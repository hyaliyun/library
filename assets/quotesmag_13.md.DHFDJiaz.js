It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery.Zweite, 244 This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\",Although not all of Bacon's popes scream. Nor are they all after Velázquez, nor are they all enclosed or trapped. See Sylvester, 40 a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works.Peppiatt, 28 Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen.Zweite, 74 At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art.Russell, 10 Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\".Russell, 38 In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\"Richard, Paul. \\"Sordidness, Ambition in Francis Bacon's Fiercest Portrayals: Display of England's master painter's works engenders the tension of transcendence and despair\\". Los Angeles Times, 9 November 1989. Retrieved 19 June 2013 Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.Sylvester, 40 1949 Head series Bacon's output is characterised by sequences of images. He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that \\"images breed other images in me\\".Peppiatt, 87 His series were not always planned or painted in sequence; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone.Peppiatt, 122 The idea for the head series came after he returned penniless, late in 1948, from a stay in Tangier. In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting (1946). Although he continued to paint, he was a ruthless self-critic, given to slashing canvases with blades, and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948.Those tasked with destroying canvases were not always loyal; in the late 1990s a number of major 1950s papal portraits and various sketches on paper resurfaced on the art market. See Hunter et al. for a catalogue of the paintings, IMMA for works on paper Gallerist Erica Brausen offered Bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery.Yard, in Farr; Peppiatt; Yard, 13 He agreed, but had nothing in reserve to hang. In following years, Brausen became perhaps the most important of Bacon's early champions; she arranged this showing—his debut solo exhibition—publicised him widely and organised viewings for international buyers. Already 40 years old, Bacon viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output of the last three years, he had little choice but to present new works.Peppiatt, 130 He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition,Peppiatt, 127Peppiatt, 122 completing the series barely in time for the opening. Head I, 1948. The first in the series and actually painted in 1948. This painting contains outlines of shoulders but they are collapsed. As in Head II, the upper head has dissolved into a void.Davies & Yard, 19 The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half- open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere.Zweite, 83 These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez,Dawson, 52 while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Peppiatt, 129 Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms.Peppiatt, 112 The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\"Sylvester, 13 He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years. Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925). Bacon described this still from the silent film as a key catalyst for his work. The series marks Bacon's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms. For him, the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated and unobserved, and had abandoned the need to present an outward face. He believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away, and the social being becomes the sum of its neuroses, which Bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare-bones features: a mouth, ears, eyes, a jaw. According to Russell, \\"the view out front ceases to be the only one, and our person is suddenly adrift, fragmented, and subject to strange mutation.\\"Russell, 38 Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting, the figures are always posed, and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed. This conceit is abandoned in Bacon's series. Head I, completed late in 1948, is considered more successful than Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen as something of a creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.Sylvester, 53 Brausen commissioned another showing to be held in 1950, for which Bacon painted three large popes modelled on Velázquez's portrait. The gallery advertised the show as \\"Francis Bacon: Three Studies from the Painting of InnocentX by Velázquez\\", but in the end Bacon was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened.Peppiatt, 141 Description Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X, 1650. Although Bacon avoided seeing the original, it remained the painting that most affected him, and one to which he referred over and over.Russell, 39 The figure is identifiable as a pope from his clothing. It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three-dimensional glass cage. This framing device, described by Sylvester as a \\"space-frame\\", was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career.Sylvester, 36 A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case, falling just in front of the pope's face and partially covering his eyes. It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty, but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon's later works, may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist.Gale et al., 94 Apart from its symbolic meaning, it has a compositional function, framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines.Sylvester, 37 Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych, May–June 1973, where it is clearly a dangling light bulb.van Alphen, 108 For Bacon, these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer, alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off, curtains open or closed.van Alphen, 110 The figure's mouth is opened wide as if screaming, an expression Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.Peppiatt, 30Zweite, 75 In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, \\"I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so.\\" When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon said, \\"It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it.\\"Bragg, Melvyn. \\"Francis Bacon\\". South Bank Show. BBC documentary, first aired 9 June 1985 His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second-hand bookshop, which he kept in his studio and to which he often referred.Schmied, 18 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure's voice is unable to escape; as if it is screaming in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon said that he had \\"wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I think, if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream, it would have made the scream ... more successful\\".Zweite, 115 The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage.Sylvester, 37 Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and \\"really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things.\\" Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian \\"shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey[ing] the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation.\\"Farr, 60 Influences The so-called \\"space frame\\" had already been used by Alberto Giacometti in the 1930s, and the two artists became friends in the 1960s. However, Giacometti had by 1949 used it only in surrealist contexts before Bacon's adaption, and in turn influenced his use in The Cage of 1950. A similar two-dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore's works, notably his maquette for King and Queen, constructed three years after Bacon's Head. It is difficult to untangle how these artists influenced and informed each other. What is notable is that Bacon continued to use the motif, with intervals until the end of his life. Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back. Edgar Degas, After the Bath, Woman drying herself, 1884 The full-length golden curtain-like folds painted in heavy brush strokes are in part influenced by Degas but also similar to Titian's 1558 Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto.Davies & Yard, 27 Bacon adapts the Old Master's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer; the black ground-paint is visible through the folds, making the separation all the more affecting. Bacon had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel, and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works, especially in his \\"screaming popes\\".van Alphen, 107 He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting, and collected many reproductions of works by Titian and Degas in which it is employed.Zweite, 208 He had begun his career as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs in the mid-1930s, and later said that he liked \\"rooms hung all round with just curtains hung in even folds\\".Russell, 35 Veils or curtains appear in Bacon's earliest works, notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body, always in portraits and always in front of, rather than behind, the figure. Head VI is closely modelled on Velázquez's c. 1650 Portrait of Innocent X,Bacon named the earlier artists in the titles of a number of his 1950s works, usually in variants of the form Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X today in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome. Bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original, even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954. Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed, or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination. Yet his fascination was all- consuming, and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for almost two decadesan examination and homage described as \\"without parallel in the history of art\\".Schmied, 17 Bacon's approach differs from Velázquez's in a number of ways: both artists were expressive, yet Bacon's broad brush-strokes and freedom with paint contrast with Velázquez's tight and controlled treatment. He adapts Velázquez's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer's point of view, elevating and distancing him. This was already a common technique in commercial, promotional photography but in Bacon's hands, art historian Weiland Schmied argues, the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe.Schmied, 18 Although Bacon revered Velázquez's portrait, he did not try to reproduce the earlier painting. In interviews, he said that he saw flaws in Velázquez's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as, according to Schmied, \\"obsolete and decayed\\".Schmied, 21 Bacon's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again, thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both Old Master and contemporary painting. Yet Velázquez's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting. The sitter's pose closely echoes the original, as does the violet and white colouring of his cope, which is built up through broad, thick, brush-strokes. The influence can be further seen in the gold-coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure. Art historian Armin Zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to Velázquez, while at the same time deconstructs his painting. Sylvester detects the influence of late works by Titian in other aspects, especially in the deep and rich colouring, and Velázquez's portrayals of Philip IV, such as Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga, and agrees with identification of pastels of Degas as a source. He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as \\"shuttering\\",Sylvester, 47–49 as seen in the earlier artist's After the Bath, Woman drying herself.Hammer, Martin. \\"Francis Bacon: Back to Degas\\". Tate Papers, Issue 17, 2012. Retrieved 10 June 2014 Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto. He believes the folds serve to \\"push the viewer back\\", creating a distance from the subject, an effect he sees as similar to the separation between an orchestra and setting;Sylvester, 50 others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison. Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter. In his series of books \\"Interviews with Francis Bacon\\", he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant. The artist replied, \\"Well, it means that the sensation doesn't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps.\\" When asked why he was compelled to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought \\"an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner.\\"Peppiatt, 147 Schmied sees HeadVI as a reaction against Velázquez, and a commentary on how the papacy is \\"obsolete and decayed\\", with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation. To him, the figure seems to \\"resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order. He screams and grimaces, clutching at arms of his throne.\\" Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.Sylvester, 49 File:Pope Julius II.jpgRaphael, Portrait of Pope Julius II, 1511–12 File:Titian - Pope Paul III - WGA22962.jpgTitian, Portrait of Pope Paul III, 1543 File:Tizian (Schule) 001b.jpgTitian, Portrait of Pope Paul III, 1545–46 File:Titian Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto 1558.jpgTitian, Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto, 1558 Critical reception When Bacon undertook the series late in 1948, he was something of a two-hit wonder. He had had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion and to a lesser extent with Painting (1946), both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist.Peppiatt, 128 The exhibition was a success, and marked his critical breakthrough. Until then, he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance. While some found his images horrifying and unnerving, they wrote about him all the same, sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post-war British art. The critic for The Observer wrote, \\"The recent paintings ... horrifying as they are, cannot be ignored. Technically they are superb, and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey, flushed with a sudden pink or green, only makes me regret the more that the artist's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric\\".Quoted in Peppiatt, 130 Most critics focused on Head I and Head VI, remarking favourably on the progression between the two. While some found the inherent violence of the paintings distasteful, Brausen was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety, and brought Bacon's work to national attention. Peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact, and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means, and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought, by presenting his sitter \\"in a vestigial setting, a cage or [behind] a parted curtain ... the rest, the most essential, lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint\\". After the showing Bacon gradually became \\"less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scene\\". His reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically, and after the showing he was sought after by European, American and African collectors and galleries, commanding prices as high as £400 for single works, unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time.Peppiatt, 131 Provenance Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery, London, in 1949. It was acquired by the Arts Council's Hayward Gallery in 1952. The Hayward has loaned it out a number of times since, including for major retrospectives at the Grand Palais, Paris, in 1971, and the Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin, in 2000. In May 1996, the National Gallery took on loan Velázquez's InnocentX portrait and hung it alongside four Bacon paintings; HeadVI, PopeI (1951), Pope 1961 and Pope 1965. Peppiatt believes that Bacon would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted, but writes that two, including HeadVI, \\"stood up to it, and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power\\".Peppiatt, 319–320 References= Notes Sources= * Davies, Hugh; Yard, Sally.

Situated along the point of Facho, in a dominant position over this stretch of coast, it was a fortification used in the defence of the anchorage of Praia from attacks by pirates and corsairs, which frequented the waters of the mid-Atlantic seeking ships returning from the newly discovered territories of the Far East. It crossed its cannons with the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Conceição and the Fort of the Port, that existed across the bay. Today, the ruins of the small fort is part of the protective northern pier that shelters shipping and refuelling ships supporting the Lajes Air Field.  History  Plan of the Fort of Espírito Santo (Damião Pego, August 1881) Unproven tradition suggests that the council hall coat-of-arms originated from the Fort of Espirito Santo after the fort was destroyed and abandoned The fort was erected in 1576 by the Corregedor of the Azores, Ciprião de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos,Francisco Ferreira Drummond (1981), p.231-232. from defensive plans first elaborated by Tommaso Benedetto. During the War of Spanish Succession (1702–1714) it was called \\"The Fortress of the Holy Spirit on the Point of Facho\\", in the report \\"Fortificações nos Açores existentes em 1710\\". Father António Cordeiro, writing in 1717, indicated that the fort included eleven iron and bronze artillery-pieces.António Cordeiro (1981), p.256-257 With the establishment of the Captaincy-General of the Azores, the fort was referred in the following terms: :\\"29 - Fort of Holy Spirit. Reformed anew, needs its gate repaired; it has ten cannon emplacements and seven good iron pieces, and its repairs necessary, requires another three pieces with its repairs and stave ten gunners and forty assistants. This fort and that of Santa Catarina are those which defend the entrance of the town in the bay of Praia.\\"João António Júdice (1981) In the reports of Manoel Correa Branco (1776), the fort is \\"...the last situated in the bay, and the main one defending [the bay] crossing fire with the many forts that defend the bay\\", noting the need for its repairs, including grout in the guardhouse, garrison cots, the wooden ceiling, and the roof of the small house that served as a powder magazine, which lacks door and stored the artillery during the winter. At this time, the fort had an irregular polygonal plan, with the walls protected by six cannon emplacements towards the sea and one towards the town. The 1805 plan of the town of Praia also includes the design of the Fort at that time. Twenty years later (around 1822), Sousa (1995) records that the port of Praia was \\"...tolerably defended by the fort...of the Holy Spirit. A Regiment of National Militia, taking the name of the village, is its defence.\\" Later, during the context of the Liberal Wars, the fort was fired upon by a squadron of Absolutist ships, during a battle on 11 August 1829. At the time, the fort was garrison by eight artillerymen and four auxiliaries, under the command of ensign Manoel Franco, supporting only two cannon. Under continuous enemy artillery bombardment, it was the only fort silenced during the battle; the fort was damaged by rocks falling from the clifftop in the bombardment, which damaged the structures, forcing the soldiers to abandon the fort. When forces loyal to Miguel I of Portugal (1828–1834) made landfall between the Fort of the Port and Fort of the Espírito Santo, they were impeded from advancing by a small Liberal contingent. These forces, therefore, converged towards the fort, beginning their invasion from that site, occupied the terraplan with 400 soldiers. These men then attempted to scale the escarpment in order to take a position that was dominant over the cliffs along the Serra de São Tiago, but were repelled and massacred by Liberal forces as they tried to take the semaphore station located on its summit. The report of Field Marshal Barão de Bastos in 1862 informed: :\\"The walls facing the sea and the cannon emplacements require some repair, the lodging includes little more than walls that can be reused; I believe its budget has been approved, but not placed in execution, due to a lack of pecuniary means.\\"Barão de Bastos (1997), p.273. Yet, by 1881, the structure was already in ruins, the stones from the walls were sold systematically for the construction of other buildings.Damião Freire de Bettencourt Damião Pego (Tombos dos Fortes da Ilha Terceira) In the 20th century, between the 1950s and 1960s, the construction of the northern protective pier by American military forces in order to help shelter offloading, resulted in further investigation of the fort's ruins. A compromise was signed between the Americans and Portuguese to permit the construction of the dock, while reconstructing the old fort. Yet, unable to fulfill this compromise, the remains of the fort was used to support the arriba at the end of the bay, between Chagas and Ribeira de Beljardim, sometime during the 1960s.Manuel Augusto Faria, s.d. Little remains of the vestiges except some portions of the rock used in the walls. The ruins are neither classified or protected by the national or regional registry, nor included in the tourist itineraries published by the city. Local tradition suggest that the royal coat-of-arms from the fort was used in the construction of the municipal council hall of Praia, although unproven.  Architecture  A panoramic view of the remaining portion of the fort's wall A detail of the wall; little remains of the main structure, although detail of mortar and stone are visible A bastion-type defensive position, the fort had polygonal shape and was implanted into the cliff of Facho, adapting into the relief on which it was built. A structure of mortar and natural basalt stone, the fort covered an area of . Originally with a capacity for seven pieces of artillery, by 1881, the structure only supported a battery of five cannons. The terraplane included a guardhouse (with two volumes) and in addition to a powder magazine, which anchored the western wall. Access to the fort was made from the beach.

The park operated under Cedar Fair's ownership as Knott's Soak City until 2013 when CNL Lifestyle Properties acquired it. The park plans to reopen in 2020 after a complete renovation of the property. History Wet'n'Wild Palm Springs officially opened as Oasis Water Park by Waterpark Associates in 1986. By 2001, Oasis Water Park spanned of a property, featured 20 attractions and had a seasonal attendance of 200,000 people. In May 2001, Cedar Fair entered into an agreement to acquire the park. The deal was finalised one month later for $9.1 million. The park was immediately branded Knott's Oasis Water Park, with additional advertising driving revenues for the remainder of the year. At the conclusion of the 2001 season Cedar Fair reported the park was down 13% at the time of acquisition, however, this was turned around to a 13% increase by the end of the season under the park's new owners. The opening scenes of the 1987 film \\"North Shore\\" were filmed at the Oasis Water Park wave tank. In the film, the wave tank location where the surf contest takes place was actually depicted as Arizona. Actor Matt Adler portrays Arizona surfer Rick Kane who wins the state surfing competition and uses his contest winnings to travel to Hawaii's North Shore. The film also starred Nia Peeples, John Philbin, Gerry Lopez, and Gregory Harrison - though none of these actors appear in any of the film's opening sequences. In the 2001-2002 winter off-season, Cedar Fair invested $2 million into refurbishing and rebranding the park into a Knott's Soak City park, joining other locations in Chula Vista and Buena Park. The refurbishment included the park's gas chlorine sanitation system being replaced by a liquid chlorine equivalent, as well as the repainting and renaming of all slides to match the other Soak City parks. A Rain Fortress aqua play area by WhiteWater West was also added to the park, which reopened in March 2002. The renovation of the park saw increases in attendance and revenue of \\"about 40%\\" in the 2002 season. On August 14, 2013, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its Palm Springs Soak City to CNL Lifestyle Properties. The park was allowed to operate under the Soak City name for the until the conclusion of the 2013 season. In November 2013, CNL Lifestyle Properties completed their acquisition of the ownership and operational rights of Wet'n'Wild Hawaii and Wet'n'Wild Phoenix. As part of the transaction with Australian firm, Village Roadshow Theme Parks, CNL also acquired rights to the Wet'n'Wild brand in the United States. In December 2013, CNL announced the Palm Springs water park would operate as Wet'n'Wild Palm Springs from the 2014 season. In June 2019, shortly before demolition commenced at Wet'n'Wild Palm Springs, professional skateboarders including Lizzie Armanto, Omar Hassan, Riley Hawk, Tony Hawk, Aaron Homoki, Kevin Kowalski, Torey Pudwill and Daewon Song spent a week filming in the closed park to create a nine-minute viral video for Thrasher Magazine entitled \\"High 'N' Dry\\". In June 2020. YouTuber Casey Neistat uploaded a YouTube video where he surfed on the wave simulator at the park after being invited, presumably by the owners of the waterpark.

Description  The Vaccine Damage Payment program was created in 1979 to provide significant payment to people who are severely disabled as a result of vaccinations against certain diseases. It is a statutory program, and it is not necessary to demonstrate negligence in order to qualify. Between 1997 and 2005, the government of the United Kingdom paid £3.5m, in 35 payments of £100,000 each, to patients who were left disabled by vaccinations. An FOI to The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was made in 2019. The DWP’s response states that up until May 2019 £74,690,000 has been paid out from the fund, and 941 claims have been successful.  Qualifications  To qualify for the program, a person must be severely disabled as a result of a vaccination, and the disablement must be assessed as at least 60%. The state will still pay even if the vaccination was not administered by them. Additionally, a person can still qualify if a vaccine against one of the diseases listed below was administered to the claimant's mother while the mother was pregnant. The claimant may also qualify if they have been in close physical contact with someone who had an oral vaccine against poliomyelitis. The vaccination must have been for one of the following diseases: * diphtheria * tetanus * pertussis (whooping cough) * poliomyelitis * measles * mumps * rubella (German measles) * tuberculosis (TB) * haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) * meningococcal group C (meningitis C) * pneumococcal infection * human papillomavirus * pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (swine flu) - up to 31 August 2010 * smallpox - up to 1 August 1971 The vaccination must also have been administered before the claimant's 18th birthday, unless the vaccination was administered during an outbreak of disease in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or if it was a vaccine for poliomyelitis, rubella, Meningococcal Group C, human papillomavirus, or pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (swine flu). The vaccination must have been administered in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or as part of Armed Forces medical treatment.

Political life In 2010, Biviano was elected in House District 50, having narrowly unseated the incumbent Democrat Monty Betts, 4,350 (50.6 percent) to 4,242 (49.4 percent). In 2012, District 50 was reconfigured to include Crittenden and Cross counties. Biviano won his second term in revised District 46 by defeating the Democrat Kyle Osborne, 6,305 (60.8 percent) to 4,073 (39.2 percent). Biviano served as the vice chair of the Advanced Communications and Information Technology Committee and was a member of these panels: (1) Budget, (2) Education, and (3) Insurance and Commerce. Representative Biviano in 2013 in District 46 supported a spending cap on the state budget. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation, a measure which Biviano co-sponsored. He also supported legislation to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He voted to allow university officials to carry concealed weapons on campus. He opposed legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He supported the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. In 2011, Biviano in District 50 co-sponsored legislation to permit weapons in places of worship. He supported a dress code for public schools. He backed curriculum standards for biblical instruction in public schools. He voted for the Capital Gains Reduction Act. He voted to permit driver's license tests only in the English language. Biviano voted against legislation to prohibit cell phone use in school zones. Biviano did not seek a third term in the House in 2014. In the Republican primary, Les Eaves, with 2,158 votes (63 percent), defeated Kyle Reeves, who polled 1,260 votes (37 percent), to obtain the Republican nomination to succeed Biviano.

In the United States, California is the only state that does not impose a significant severance tax. Instead, California imposes a statewide assessment fee, as set by the California Department of Conservation, and individual counties may choose to impose an ad valorem tax on a per county basis. Over the years, several measures have been introduced as ballot initiatives and legislation in an attempt to pass a statewide severance tax, though none has become law. Recent history Former State Senator Noreen Evan, sponsor of the latest legislative attempt to pass a severance tax in 2014. = 1990s = In the 1990s, the California State Assembly proposed two similar bills, Assembly Bills 1693 by Assemblymember Burt Margolin and 336 by Assembly member Antonio Villaraigosa. Both measures imposed a 6% oil severance tax and the revenues to be raised from the measure were to be directed into California's General Fund. Both measures were stalled in their respective committees and thus never became law. = 2006 = In 2006, Proposition 87 was proposed, which was a combined constitutional amendment and ballot initiative state statute that was defeated with 45.4% of Californians voting in support of the measure, and with 54.7% opposed. If passed, the proposition would have created the California Energy Alternatives Program Authority, a $4 billion program with the goal of reducing California's dependence on petroleum. Businessman Stephen Bing and Nobel Prize–winning climatologist Dr. Daniel Kammen sponsored the initiative. It was the most expensive campaign in initiative history throughout the United States with the Yes on 87 sponsors raising a combined $61,886,129 and with the No on 87 sponsors raising $94,430,014. = 2007-2008 = During the 2007-2008 legislative session, California Assembly member Fabian Núñez proposed Assembly Bill 9, a 6% oil severance tax, which directed revenues towards educational purposes for the first fiscal year after implementation. The bill subsequently died in the unfinished business file of the Assembly and did not become law. = 2009-2010 = Tom Steyer, a lead advocate for a severance tax in California. The next legislative session, California State Senator Denise Moreno Ducheny proposed Senate Bill 1, a 9.9% oil severance tax, with revenues directed towards the General Fund, excluding a specified sum to be deposited into the oil, gas, and geothermal administrative fund. Much like the preceding bill, Senate Bill 1 died in the unfinished file. Simultaneously, Professor Peter Matthews of Santa Monica Community College began circulating a proposed ballot measure to impose a severance tax. Professor Matthews successfully rallied hundreds of student volunteers to conduct mass signature gathering drives. However, the effort failed to collect the needed signatures in time. Assemblywoman Noreen Evans proposed Assembly Bill 2, a measure that would have imposed a 9.9% oil severance tax, enacted a state sales tax exemption for gas sales, repealed the 18-cent rate excise tax on gas/diesel, increased the sales tax by one-half cent, and enacted a 2.5% personal income tax surcharge. The measure successfully passed both Houses of the Legislature, reaching the Governor's desk, but was ultimately vetoed by Governor Schwarzenegger. Assembly member Alberto Torrico introduced Assembly Bill 656, which would have imposed 12.5% severance tax, with revenues directed towards education funding. The measure died in committee. = 2013-2014 = The most recent attempt to pass a severance tax occurred in 2013, which was authored by now State Senator Noreen Evans, was Senate Bill 241, which would have imposed a 9.5% severance tax for oil and a 3.5% severance tax for natural gas. If it had passed, the revenues would have been directed to funding state parks, higher education and the general fund. Senate Bill 241 is currently on the suspense file in the Senate Appropriations Committee. During the same year, Jack Tibbetts, an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, authored and put forward a proposed ballot initiative titled as the California Modernization and Economic Development Act. Like Senate Bill 241, this initiative would have taxed oil and gas extraction at 9.5% and directed funds to higher education state parks, as well as provide subsidies to businesses to fund localized renewable energy projects. The measure earned the endorsements of many prominent figures including former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and Nobel laureate Dr. Daniel Kammen. The proponent of initiative later joined forces with Senator Evans and both switched their focus from gathering signatures to mobilizing students to support Senate Bill 241. Further recent developments for a severance tax in California include the support of asset manager Tom Steyer. Leading up to 2014, Steyer launched an effort to conduct public education and issue awareness, as well as lobby California legislators for the implementation of a severance tax. A poll conducted by Steyer's nonprofit organization, NextGen Climate, found that 64% of 800 likely California voters for the 2016 election support the tax.

She was originally launched 21 October 1920, with a length of 466, beam of 58 feet and displacement of 8,812. Constructed at Rotterdam, she was originally designed as a combination cargo and passenger vessel. She had a crew of eighty-nine and originally showed two funnels, but only one was functioning. The ship laid up in 1933 and overhauled the next year with the dummy funnel and some passenger cabins removed, and crew size to forty-eight. On 9 May 1940 she was in port in Liverpool England, awaiting return to the Netherlands when the crew was warned not to return to their home country. The next day the German army invaded the Low Countries. The ship and crew were immediately militarized and Maasdam was chartered to the Ministry of War Transport in London. Maasdam left New York for Halifax on 11 June 1941 with a crew of forty-eight, plus thirty-two passengers, including eleven US Marine Corps personnel and seventeen American Red Cross volunteer nurses. The marines were destined for duty at the US Embassy in London and the nurses were scheduled to serve at the Harvard Hospital. Halifax was a common port from which eastbound convoys formed. Maasdam arrived the evening of 13 June 1941. Assigned to Convoy HX 133, she left 16 June amidst incredibly dense fog that lasted four days, causing several ship collisions. On 26 June 1941, at 2345 hours GMT U-564 fired multiple torpedoes in rapid succession. The first torpedo struck Maasdam’s port side at the rear of cargo hold no. 2. Immediately following two other ships next to Maasdam were also hit, Malaya II a British freighter loaded with TNT and Norwegian tanker Kongsgaard. She sank in the Atlantic Ocean off Greenland (). Seventy-eight of the Eighty people on board survived and were rescued by Norwegian ship Havprins and former Danish ship Randa. The two people lost at sea were nurses Maxine Loomis and Ruth Bradley. Ruth traveled to England to work in London at a hospital as a house mother to Red Cross nurses. She was the ex-wife of Colonel Henry S. Breckinridge (Secretary of War under Harry S. Truman), mother of Elizabeth Breckinridge and mother-in-law of John Stephens Graham. Ruth Breckinridge traveled via the SS Maasdam for England where she was to work in London at a hospital as a house mother to Red Cross nurses. Prior to being sunk in 1941, Maasdam was in several convoys starting on May 26, 1940 with Convoy FN.181 between Southend and Methil. It was part of other convoys between Halifax and Liverpool, Tyne and Southend and from Liverpool. SS Maasdam collided with the British cargo ship Anthea off the coast of Canada () and SS Anthea sank.

Its history was known through the translation of an 18th-century monk's manuscript. In 2009 it was converted into a luxury hotel, known as the Hotel Convento La Magdalena, with 21 rooms. Olive groves and mills in the vicinity reflect the occupation of people in the area. A stream, Arroyo de la Magdalena, flows nearby. History The convent was established in 1570 by the merchant, Ildefonso Alvarez, who possessed an altarpiece of the Virgin Magdalena. Alvarez took refuge in the area's caves and lived like a hermit. In the following three years, he struggled to pay his debts and eventually attracted the attention of the Christian community who helped him. In 1585, construction started on a small chapel in the area. In 1648 the place became renowned for the healing from the plague by Father Cardenas, a pastor of Seville who had journeyed to the little church. Fame and abundant alms sowed corruption among hermits. In 1685, the hermits were expelled by order of the Bishop of Málaga. The order of the Discalced Franciscans took over the management of the church in 1691 and began construction of the new convent. In 1761 the guardian of the convent was reported to be Fr. Juan Gomez. The convent was abandoned in the mid-19th century. Hotel Frescoes In 2009, the convent underwent a careful restoration and became a five star hotel that left many of the original features of the Franciscan convent. Many frescoes still remain on the arched ceilings and walls. Hotel Convento La Magdalena is part of the Antequera Golf Group and includes the Antequera Golf Course with 18 holes. It has 21 rooms, including 13 double rooms, 5 suites and 1 Royal suite. Several rooms have their own terrace and access to an organic garden. The rooms are all furnished with a flat screen TV and air conditioning and heating. The hotel is served by the \\"Refectorio\\" restaurant under chef David Muñoz, formerly of elBulli, serving traditional Andalusian and Mediterranean cuisine. The hotel also contains the \\"Tetería Arabe\\", the \\"Piano Bar\\" which serves coffee, and the \\"Bodegas\\" bar, noted for its karaoke and flamenco dancing.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The original house was named Passors after a family living on the site during the reign of King Edward III. A passor or passator was a ferryman. A later occupant was the wool merchant Ralph Warren, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1536. It was then occupied by the cloth merchant Sir Thomas White, also a Lord Mayor of London, as well as a civic benefactor and founder of St John's College, Oxford. Passors was subsequently inherited by Sir Henry Cromwell, grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. The current building was built as a private house in the early 18th century. In 1804, it became the Fulham House School for Girls having been let to the Misses Fleming, then let to the Loves, and from 1840, the Misses King ran the school for 40 years. In 1879, the house was purchased by the local builder Parkins Hammond Jones, and the family lived there until 1902 when it was acquired by the commanding officer of the 26th Middlesex (Cyclist) Rifle Volunteer Corps for use as the headquarters of his unit. The 26th Middlesex (Cyclist) Rifle Volunteer Corps evolved to become the 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. When the London Regiment was broken up in 1937, the battalion became part of the 47th (2nd London) Divisional Signals, Royal Signals. After the Second World War, the drill hall became the headquarters of the 23rd (Southern) Corps Signal Regiment. Once the Royal Signals left the site, the drill hall was occupied by B (Queen's Royal Rifles) Company of the 4th Battalion the Royal Green Jackets in 1967. This unit was re-formed at Fulham as F (Royal Green Jackets) Company, The London Regiment in 1999. F Company was disbanded in 2004. In 2006 the regimental headquarters of the Royal Yeomanry and its command and support squadron, the Westminster Dragoons, moved to Fulham House.

She was built in Dundee in 1917 and was sunk by enemy action in the North Atlantic in 1941. She belonged to Yeoward Line, which carried passengers and fruit between Liverpool, Lisbon, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Aguila is Spanish for eagle, and a popular name for ships. This was the second in Yeoward Brothers' fleet, the first having been built in 1909 and sunk by in 1915. Building and equipment The Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Dundee built Aguila, completing her in November 1917. She had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heated three single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three- cylinder triple expansion steam engine that was rated at 395 NHP and drove a single screw, giving her a speed of . Aguila bore similarities to that Caledon had built for the Yeoward Line in 1912. The two ships had the same beam, Aguila was just longer and her engine was rated as producing 50 more NHP. In the early 1920s Aguila was joined by a pair of slightly longer sister ships, and , completed by Caledon in April 1922 and January 1923. By 1930 Aguila had wireless direction finding equipment, and from 1934 she had an echo sounding device. Up to 1933 Lloyd's Register records no code letters for Aguila, but when the new wireless call signs were introduced for 1934, she was designated GPVD. Second World War service From October 1939 until 1940 Aguila continued her peacetime run between Liverpool and the Canary Islands. Her only convoy protection was on outward voyages from Liverpool to the North Atlantic west of Portugal, where she would leave the convoy to enter neutral Portuguese waters and proceed to Lisbon unescorted. After calling at Lisbon she would continue unescorted to Las Palmas and Tenerife, and return unescorted to Liverpool. France's surrender to Germany in June 1940 gave the Kriegsmarine naval bases on France's Atlantic coast, leading to German and Italian submarines' First Happy Time in the Battle of the Atlantic. Allied shipping losses increased and from August 1940 Yeoward Brothers changed the movements of its ships. In August 1940 Aguila had a normal outward run with Convoy OG 40, leaving Liverpool on 3 August and reaching Lisbon on 14 August. Three days later she left Lisbon for Las Palmas, but on 19 August the shelled her with its guns. The Regia Marina vessel claimed five hits on Aguila, but in fact the liner was undamaged and reached Las Palmas on 20 August. After her narrow escape Aguila did not call at Tenerife, but instead went south to Freetown in Sierra Leone. There the UK formed inbound convoys to the British Isles, but if Aguila hoped to join one she was unsuccessful. From Freetown she turned north and steamed unescorted to Madeira, where she stopped for five days before continuing to Gibraltar. There she joined Convoy HG 43, which left on 4 September and reached Liverpool on 19 September. On 11 October 1940 Aguila left Liverpool with Convoy OG 44, but stayed with the convoy all the way to Gibraltar. She then sailed unescorted to Lisbon and back to Gibraltar (24 October – 3 November), and made a separate unescorted trip to Las Palmas, Tenerife and Cadiz and again back to Gibraltar (3–19 November). Then she joined Convoy HG 47, which left Gibraltar on 20 November and reached Liverpool on 4 December. Aguila survived Liverpool's Christmas Blitz of 20–22 December. From 29 December to 23 July she made three round trips: by convoy from Britain to Gibraltar, unescorted from there to Lisbon and back, and then by convoy from Gibraltar home to Britain. From the first and third trips Aguila returned to her home port of Liverpool, but during her second trip Liverpool suffered the May Blitz, and on 3 May part of the port was devastated when the munitions ship burned and exploded in Huskisson Dock. Therefore, when Aguila returned a fortnight later in Convoy HG 61 it was diverted to the Firth of Clyde. The arrangement was only temporary. On 23 July Aguila was back in her home port, arriving in Liverpool with Convoy HG 67. Final voyage and loss Aguila loaded general cargo in Liverpool and embarked at least 86 Royal Navy personnel bound for Gibraltar and six civilian passengers. The RN personnel included nine Fleet Air Arm, seven Royal Naval Patrol Service, three RNR, 11 RNVR, 22 Women's Royal Naval Service (Wrens) and 35 others. The 22 Wrens were all volunteers for duties at Gibraltar: 12 as cypher officers and 10 as wireless operators. Also with them was a QARNNS nurse, Sister Kate Gribble. Aguila was one of 23 merchant ships that formed Convoy OG 71, which left Liverpool on 13 August. Allied convoys included ships of other nationalities as well as British. OG 71 included two from Ireland one each from Denmark, Greece and Norway. The Republic of Ireland was neutral so its ships, Clonlara and Lanarhone, were not blacked out. Aguilas Master, Arthur Firth, objected that their lights compromised HG 71's protection at night. rescued 10 of Aguilas survivors Aguilas naval contingent included the Convoy Commodore, Vice Admiral PE Parker DSO, and his staff. At first OG 71's only escorts were the Norwegian Navy destroyer HNoMS Bath and two Royal Navy ships; the sloop and corvette . Two days out they were augmented by five more RN corvettes. On 17 August a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor sighted OG 71, and the next day it became the first convoy to be attacked by a U-boat wolfpack. Bath fell behind while defending the convoy, and in the small hours of 19 August at 0205 hrs she was torpedoed and sunk by southwest of Ireland. Three minutes later attacked the main convoy about west of Ushant, sinking the cargo ship Alva. The corvette went to rescue Baths survivors, thus further depleting OG 71's escort, while and the Irish Clonlara rescued Alvas survivors. Two hours later the wolfpack again attacked OG 71, and torpedoed and sank Aguila and the cargo ship Ciscar. The corvette rescued 10 survivors including Captain Firth and one of the RN contingent. The tugboat Empire Oak rescued six of Aguilas crew (joining 11 she rescued from Alva), but on 22 August west of Porto sank Empire Oak, with the loss of all six of the men from Aguila (and nine of the 11 from Alva). The wolfpack attack continued until 23 August, and OG 71's total losses were eight of her 23 merchant ships plus two of her escorts. Thereafter all neutral Irish ships were blacked out when sailing in Allied convoys. After the loss of so many RN personnel in one sinking, the Navy stopped using civilian ships to carry its personnel. Monuments Aguila Memorial to the Wrens lost on the SS Aguila The lost members of Aguilas crew are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. The lost members of her naval contingent are commemorated on the Royal Navy monuments at Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth. Popular attention focused on the loss of all 22 Wrens. Members of the WRNS responded by donating a day's pay to a memorial fund, which paid £4,000 toward the building of a new for convoy escort duties, , that was launched in 1942. The balance of the fund was given to the RNLI, which in 1951 named a new lifeboat , which was stationed at Aberystwyth in Wales 1951–64 and then at Redcar in Yorkshire 1964–72. The National Memorial Arboretum now has an Aguila Memorial: a giant wren on a granite obelisk dedicated to the 22 Wrens and Sister Gribble. 12 of the Wrens had been based at Scarborough, North Yorkshire. There they are commemorated by a statue of an angel hovering over the sea, and a memorial bench on the Lighthouse Pier that was dedicated in 1972.

She was built in Dundee in 1923 and was sunk by enemy action in the North Atlantic in 1941. She belonged to Yeoward Line, which carried passengers and fruit between Liverpool, Lisbon, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Avoceta is Spanish for avocet. Yeoward Brothers had a previous ship called that was built in 1885 and sunk by in 1917. Building In the early 1920s the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Dundee built two sister ships for Yeoward Brothers, completing in April 1922 and Avoceta in January 1923. The pair were similar to that Caledon had built for Yeoward in 1917, having the same size boilers and engine, the same beam and being only longer. Avoceta had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heated three single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine that was rated at 395 NHP and drove a single screw. War service In the Second World War Avoceta continued Yeoward Brothers' service to neutral Portugal, Spain and the Canary Islands. She made nine trips to Las Palmas, six of which also included a call at Tenerife. Others were to one or another mainland port: one to Almeria, two to Valencia and 11 to Lisbon. Her final visit to the Canaries was in March 1941; thereafter she served only Lisbon and Gibraltar. Avoceta always joined an outbound convoy to leave British home waters, and then would continue either unescorted or with an OG-series convoy as far as Gibraltar. She made her return voyages either unescorted or via Gibraltar and an HG-series convoy to Liverpool. During German and Italian submarines' First Happy Time in the Battle of the Atlantic one homeward trip was diverted: Convoy HG 39 left Gibraltar on 21 July 1940 bound for Liverpool, but instead went to Swansea in South Wales. Final voyage On 13 August 1941 Avocetas sister ship Aguila left Liverpool in OG 71. On 19 August 1941 Avoceta followed, leaving Liverpool with Convoy OG 72. On 18–23 August OG 71 became the first Allied convoy to be attacked by a U-boat wolfpack. OG 72 safely reached Gibraltar on 4 September, but there received news that OG 71 had been attacked, ten ships sunk, and they included Aguila which had been lost with 152 dead and only 16 survivors. From Gibraltar Avoceta made her usual round trip to Lisbon and back (2–15 September). In Lisbon she embarked dozens of refugees from German-occupied Europe: UK subjects who had escaped the fall of France and had been denied leave to remain by the authorities in neutral Spain and Portugal. Most were women and children, some of them of French or Spanish origin, several following their husbands to the UK. Once back in Gibraltar Avoceta also embarked survivors rescued from the loss of Aguila. Her cargo included cork, 573 sacks of mail and some diplomatic bags. Avoceta was one of 25 merchant ships that formed Convoy HG 73, which left Gibraltar on 17 September bound for Liverpool. HG 73's Commodore, Rear Admiral Sir Kenelm Creighton, KBE, MVO, travelled on Avoceta. In response to the new wolfpack tactic, HG 73's initial escort included three destroyers, one sloop, eight corvettes and the fighter catapult ship . At first this was successful: on 18 September a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor found HG 73 and signalled its position and course, but on the moonless night of 21–22 September the destroyer damaged the with depth charges and drove her away. On 22 September another destroyer, , rendezvoused with the convoy and reinforced its escort. On 24 September an Fw 200 patrol aircraft again sighted HG 73, but a Fairey Fulmar aircraft from Springbank drove it off. Attack and loss The next morning the sank the cargo ship . Then on the night of 25–26 September the attack increased. Avoceta was in the first row of the convoy, with the Norwegian cargo ship in the position astern of her. At 0031 hrs fired a spread of four torpedoes from their port side. One hit Avoceta close to her engine room and two hit Varangberg. Admiral Creighton was on Avocetas bridge, and later recalled that when hit \\"She staggered like a stumbling horse\\". Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg had no time to launch her lifeboats. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such an angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered. However, the liner had three liferafts mounted so as to float clear in the event of a shipwreck, and one of her radio officers survived by clinging to a large piece of her cork cargo that had floated free from one of her holds. rescued survivors from Avoceta and rescued survivors from Avoceta The s and rescued 40 survivors from Avoceta. Jasmine also saved six of Varangbergs crew who were clinging to rafts and floating wreckage. The merchant ship saved another three of Avocetas crew. Avocetas survivors were Admiral Creighton and five of his Royal Navy staff, her Master Harold Martin and 22 of his crew, two DEMS gunners and 12 passengers. A day later sank Cervantes, killing eight people, but the merchant ship rescued 32 including Cervantes three survivors from Avoceta. Jasmine and Periwinkle landed their survivors at Milford Haven, Wales. 123 people from Avoceta and 21 crew from Varangberg were lost. Avocetas dead included 43 crew, nine Navy staff, four DEMS gunners and 67 civilian passengers, including 32 women and 20 children. The youngest victims were four one-year-old babies. The Barker family - seven children under 16, their mother Ida, grandfather, aunt and three cousins - died together. Three victims were in their early 70s; the oldest was Ernest Andrews, aged 73. The Reverend Edward Stanley and his sister Elizabeth, both in their 60s, had been returning from missionary work in Vichy France. A Jewish couple in their 60s, Semtov Jacob Yahiel and his wife Luna, had been living in Paris but the husband was a British subject so they were trying to reach relative safety in Britain. William Baxter, 49, who lost a leg in WW1 and had escaped from Occupied France, was trying to reach Ireland, his birthplace. Two victims were from British India: Musserwanji Marshall, aged 72, and a young graduate, Saraswati Kitchlu.

This was a six- storey, wide and long mill with additional three-storey wings making it in all. The mill was built for Samuel Oldknow and used to spin coarse counts. It was originally driven by the Wellington water wheel. The River Goyt, and with it the then county boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire was diverted and a weir built, the leat fed a millpond that in later times was named the Roman Lakes. This in turn fed a second mill pond along with water from reservoir in Linnet Clough. Supplementary power was provided by a second exterior wheel known as the Waterloo wheel.The Mill reached its peak production in 1804, when 10,080 spindles were operating and around 550 people were employed. It was destroyed by fire in 1892. Location The mill was built beside the River Goyt in the parishes of Mellor and Marple in what is now the Greater Manchester area. The River Goyt was the boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire. To provide water for the two wheels the Goyt was diverted and canals and reservoirs built. The water reservoirs for the mill, are now called the Roman Lakes. The foundations of the mill remain though nothing can be seen above ground. History A model of Mellor Mill and the 'Roman Lakes' Samuel Oldknow was a significant businessman and mill owner in Mellor during the Industrial Revolution. He had business interests in Stockport, Heaton Mersey and Anderton. In 1787 started to amass land in Mellor and Marple, buying in three adjoining estates. He commenced building the mill, financing it on credit secured on his reputation and the other mills. He was underwritten by loans from Arkwright, and attempted to form a partnership with Peter Drinkwater being engaged to his daughter. The financial crisis of 1792-1793 hit him badly and he sold off his other interests concentrating on completing this mill. The engagement was broken off, and he remained in debt to Arkwright. He finished the mill in 1795, but was about to declare bankruptcy in 1797. Arkwright intervened and formed a partnership with him, absorbing the debt leaving Oldknow to manage the mill and the estate. When the partnership dissolved in 1805, the estate was worth £160,584 but the debts remained at £156,333. On Oldknow's death, in 1828 the estate and mill passed to Arkwright. Since 1824, the mill had been managed by John Clayton, Oldknow's half-brother, and in 1828 Arkright (jun) allowed him to remain in the mill managers house, and take over the manufacturing. In those time 'mill' referred to the company that worked in the building not just the building itself. So John Clayton and Co took over the mill. In 1860 two steam engines and boilers were installed in a separate building to the north. The main mill-building was destroyed by fire in 1892, but many outbuildings survived. Excavation of one of these in 1921, a coach-house, revealed a cache of Oldknow's papers; and from these Unwin researched and published the book referred to below. =Parish apprentices= Oldknow was experienced at running spinning mills, and offered work to the few women living in the area, but many of his first workers were parish apprentices. Economically it made sense, on average an apprentice cost 4/0d a week to maintain while a mill hand cost 4/8d. In May 1791 he was boarding two boys at 4/6d a week. In November 1795 he made enquiries through a friend to the Parish of Clerkenwell for a supply of children. He was informed in December that 40 to 50 of mixed sexes were available, and in January 1796 he is told that 35 boys and 35 girls had been selected. The parish beadle would accompany them north. When news spread, he was offered other children by other parishes. The maximum number of apprentices was reached in 1797 to 1801. Material in the records suggest that apprentices coming out of time remained in Oldknow's service. Robert Blincoe confirmed that Oldknow was a humane employer and his apprentices were contented and healthy. Architecture This was a six-storey, 42 feet wide and 210 feet long mill with additional 3-storey wings making it 400 ft in all. The mill was built for Samuel Oldknow and used to spin coarse counts. It was originally driven by the Wellington water wheel. The River Goyt, and with it the then county boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire was diverted and a weir built, the leat fed a millpond that in later times was named the Roman Lakes. This in turn fed a second mill pond along with water from reservoir in Linnet Clough. Supplementary power was provided by a second exterior wheel known as the Waterloo wheel. The Mill reached its peak production in 1804, when 10,080 spindles were operating and around 550 people were employed. In an 1867 plan, Mellor Mill, was described as brick built and slated, consisting of main building seven stories high which included the attic with four rooms of 25 bays each, and three rooms of 49 bays. Each bay is 7 ft. 10in. There were separate waste and cotton rooms, warehousing, storerooms and a counting house. =Power= ;The Wellington wheel The Wellington Wheel, was located in a wheelpit in a basement below the central entrance to the mill. It was a breastshot wheel, in diameter and in width. Water from the mill lodge on the southern elevation of the mill, fed the wheel via a leat that entered the mill at ground level.Wellington wheel pit BBC News, 9 March 2012 ;The Waterloo wheel The Waterloo wheel was built at a later date probably in 1815. Water exited the Wellington wheel pit to the exterior breastshot Waterloo wheel which was in diameter but narrower. Power was transmitted to the mill and outbuildings through a tunnel. As the tail race was lower than the River Goyt, at water went via a tunnel further downstream to where which time the river had dropped sufficiently in height. A further water wheel is known of that supplied power to stone built corn mill off the south western gable of the mill. Together the three wheels raised 120 H.P. ;Supplementary steam engines Two Steam Engines were added later, each of 20 (nominal) H.P. by Goodfellow, of Hyde. =Equipment= Originally water frames, then throstles.

Bolivar was once the county seat, and Bolivar Landing was its port on the Mississippi River. Now permanently cut off from the river, Bolivar is a quiescent residential hamlet, while Bolivar Landing, immediately north and across the immense Mississippi Levee, is a cottage community on Lake Whittington. History When Bolivar County was established in 1836, the first county seat was located at Bolivar. William Vick sold of land to the county for $800, and it was then named Bolivar. The land was surveyed by B.M. Hines, who laid out the courthouse square, with town lots around it which were advertised for sale. An order was passed by the Board of Police (later called \\"supervisors\\") in 1840 to build a one-room courthouse at a cost of $595. In 1844, the Board of Police ordered that the county seat be moved to a location north of present-day Beulah. Soon after, the county seat was moved to Prentiss, where a courthouse was erected. After the near-destruction of Prentiss during the Civil War, the courthouse was placed on a flat-boat and carried down the river to Bolivar Landing. A post office operated under the name Bolivar from 1830 to 1859. Trusten Polk, a former U.S. Senator and Governor of Missouri, was captured by Union forces at Bolivar Landing in 1863, along with his wife and two daughters. In 1864, Union forces carried away cargo from Bolivar Landing, and set fire to several houses. Also in 1864, Confederate soldiers burned the near Bolivar Landing, though the ship was not destroyed. In 1874, high waters on the Mississippi River broke a levee at Bolivar Landing, forming a crevasse wide. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the Caulk Island Cutoff in 1937, which diverted the course of the Mississippi River to enable a more direct route for shipping. This diversion removed Bolivar Landing from contiguous access to the Mississippi River (except for a small channel for recreational boats), and created Lake Whittington, an oxbow lake. In popular culture Mark Twain mentioned Bolivar Landing in his parody \\"River Intelligence\\", published in the New Orleans Crescent in 1859. The fictional river captain Sergeant Fathom states: \\"When me and DeSoto discovered the Mississippi, I could stand at Bolivar Landing (several miles above \\"Roaring Waters Bar\\") and pitch a biscuit to the main shore on the other side.\\" References Category:Unincorporated communities in Bolivar County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi Category:Mississippi populated places on the Mississippi River ","title":"Bolivar, Mississippi"},{"id":"41497057","text":"Isabelle Juliette Martha Rapin, M.D. (born December 4, 1927 in Lausanne, Switzerland; died May 24, 2017 in Rhinebeck, New York), was a Professor of both Neurology and Pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. She was a leading authority on autism for decades, and a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology. Personal life and education Rapin was born in Lausanne, Switzerland; her mother was from Connecticut, and her father was Swiss. As a child, she was an avid reader, and a Girl Scout who attended all-girls' schools between the ages of 9 and 19. Surrounded by a family of scientists, she decided to become a physician before she was ten years old. She studied at the University of Lausanne Medical School in 1946, in a class of around 100 students that included about a dozen women. She decided to become a pediatric neurologist in 1951 after she spent twelve weeks at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and at the Hôpital des Enfants Malades in Paris. When she graduated from Lausanne Medical School in 1952, there were few paying jobs in Switzerland, so she applied to the United States to Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins and Bellevue Hospital. She immigrated to the United States in 1953 after being offered a position in pediatrics at Bellevue to begin in July. In 1952, she received a Swiss Federal Diploma in Medicine. She received her M.D. in 1955, when her thesis was published in the Swiss Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry. She met her husband, Harold Oaklander, in August 1958, and they were married in the spring of 1959. Of her husband, she said: \\"Without his unselfish and sustained encouragement and help, his willingness to share in all household and child-rearing jobs (except for car maintenance, his, and sewing, mine), I could never have flourished in child neurology as I did.\\" Her husband finished his Ph.D. at Columbia University, but knew she would not leave the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, so he accepted a \\"less prestigious\\" job nearby. They had four children: two daughters and two sons. Career Rapin interned in pediatrics at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, and did her residency in neurology at the Neurological Institute at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, where she also completed a year of fellowship. She joined the Albert Einstein College of Medicine faculty in 1958 and retired at the age of 84 in 2012. Of the developments in the field of autism during those years, Rapin said, \\"Especially in the days before autism was all over the Internet and print media, parents who came for advice were most likely to report problems with language ... These days, Internet-savvy parents worry about autism but do not always tell me their concerns when they visit my office, because they want to hear my independent diagnosis.\\" Rapin said, \\"My interest in language disorders and autism was enhanced by the arrival at Einstein of Dr. Doris A. Allen, whose background was developmental psycholinguistics, psychology, and speech pathology ... After evaluating hundreds of autistic children, I became convinced that the report by one third of parents of autistic preschoolers of a very early language and behavioral regression is real and deserving of biologic investigation.\\" =Appointments= Rapin helped found the Child Neurology Society and the International Child Neurology Association. At Einstein, she founded the Child Neurology Service and Fellowship Program. She served on the boards of the Child Neurology Society, the International Child Neurology Association, the American Academy of Neurology and the International Neuropsychology Society. Recognition and other achievements The Boston Globe said in 1992 that Rapin was \\"a specialist in neurological diseases of children [who] discovered several such diseases and also is a leading authority on autism\\". The New York Times said: \\"Considered by many the doyenne of autism, Dr. Rapin has spent decades studying the disability.\\" Albert Einstein College of Medicine said that Rapin was \\"a leader in the field of child neurology ... credited with a number of discoveries in the field of neurogenetic disorders in childhood, including shaping our understanding of autism ... In addition to her renown as a 'mother of autism,' she has been called 'a luminary in her field' and 'always the guiding light'.\\" To honor Rapin, in 2012, Einstein established an annual conference on communication disorders. According to colleague Mark Mehler, M.D., \\"She is the world's expert in the field of pediatric communication disorders, and during her career she defined as well as refined our understanding of an entire field.\\" In 2006, Einstein held an international symposium on autism honoring Rapin. Rapin's awards and recognition included: * President's Award from the American Academy of Neurology * Honorary Alumna status from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine * Award for Excellence in Autism Research from the Autism Society of America * Shriver Center Award In an autobiography published in the Journal of Child Neurology, Rapin said: > \\"The message I would give a young colleague is that child neurology is a > wonderfully rewarding field, intellectually and personally, because of the > families you will meet. In order to have it all, that is, be married, have > children, restore and furnish an antique house, work in the garden, enjoy a > lot of what life offers, and have a great job, you need a supportive and > generous mate, adequate baby sitting and house help, flexibility, good > humor, and a nose for the unusual.

Historical map regression The process is mainly used in research on the history of places, sometimes termed historic map regression. Comparing maps of an area compiled in different periods can help reconstruct the chronology of events which have altered the natural or built environment. In archaeology, map regression can help to locate features appearing only on earlier maps and to assign building phases. It is often part of desk based assessments before field work is undertaken. Methods Map regression is performed either by comparing individual features between maps, or by re-projecting an entire map so as to fit another onto which it can then be superimposed. The process can include resolving any differences in map scale, projection, datum, or format; and the interpretation of each map in its meaning and accuracy. =Transcription= Similarities between maps, such as topography or built structures, are identified to determine where distinct features from one map are plotted on another. One manual technique is to copy features from earlier maps onto transparent overlays placed on the most recent map which provides the spatial framework. By working in sequence back in time a chronology is compiled. This intensive process can promote a more considered assessment as every feature is treated individually. =Transformation= Computer based geographical information systems facilitate the scaling, rotation, and translation of an entire map to fit over another. Georeferencing establishes a congruent relationship between maps, and allows each map to be transformed and automatically re-projected as an overlay. This method is useful for the regression of maps that differ in format, for example, raster images of early maps and vector representations of modern maps. Limitations Features not appearing on one map but shown on another do not necessarily indicate an actual difference, due to purpose, detail, or accuracy; for example, comparing cadastral and topographic maps. Map format can reduce confidence in a regression. 'Strip' maps, or traverse surveys, which record features in a linear path can complicate the spatial interpolation required to match a planar format. Historical research can involve early maps of uncertain accuracy or datum. They are often small scale which leads to the magnification of any position errors in enlarging to match large scale maps. Georeferencing is not always straightforward; topography such as river courses and coastlines change over time, as do road routes and other built structures.

While Charles XII had started his offensive against Russia from his winter quarters in Saxony, the Swedish–Finnish army of 12,000 men under the command of Georg Lybecker went in field to interrupt and possibly capture the newly-established ports and town of Saint Peterburg, which had been built on Swedish land. This was intended to draw the attention and troops from the main Russian army facing Charles. The Russian forces stationed in Ingria consisted of 24,500 men of which the command had been appointed to Fyodor Apraksin. While having reached the river of Neva the Swedes under Lybecker prepared their crossing. Apraksin had fortified the opposite bank with about 8,000 men and several boats patrolling the river. Lybecker first confused the Russian command of where the possible crossing were to be made and so, on September 9, close to Teusina, his forces started the construction of the bridge. Meanwhile, two Russian brigantines spotted the work and started firing. The Swedes, however, responded with their own cannons and soon the Russian ships had to withdraw. Later after some smaller skirmishes, about 1,200 Swedes were across the river constructing fortifications. The Russians then counterattacked in full force, possibly 8,000 men. However, the Swedes made a fierce stand and the Russians were, after an hour of fighting including a hasty bayonet charge from the Swedes, soundly defeated leaving 900 men dead behind while having an unknown number of wounded. The Swedes lost 86 men dead and 291 wounded in this action. The battle had no real strategic effect as Lybeckers' force could not capture Saint Petersburg due to lack of heavy artillery. Instead, after some further campaigning, Lybecker ran out of supplies and had to retreat to the open water to get his army evacuated back to Finland. During the evacuation he had to slaughter and leave behind many of his well–needed horses, a circumstance which would have serious consequences in the Russian invasion of Finland.

The trail is the former Excelsior Ditch, which was found and repaired by John Olmsted and a large group of local volunteers. It is notable for being the first ADA approved wheelchair nature trail. It topped the list of \\"favorite trails for 2013\\" in The Sacramento Bee newspaper. Founded by Olmsted and Sally Cates, and built with help from countless locals, the Independence Trail transformed the historic Excelsior gold mining ditch into the nation's first identified handicapped-accessible wilderness trail. It is now one of the most popular trails in the area, contouring along wooded hillsides, passing live streams, and crossing deep gorges on restored wooden flumes that once transported water for hydraulic mining. The trail has two separate sections—West and East—that extend from one main trailhead on California State Route 49. Independence Trail West is oriented for most of its length around the canyon of Rush Creek, a large tributary stream that enters the South Yuba River at Jones Bar. The West trail features several wooden flumes, a large covered viewpoint, picnic tables and benches. Flume 28, over 500' in length, crosses above a waterfall on Rush Creek 1.1 miles west of the trailhead. It is a \\"must see\\" piece of mining history. The Independence Trail utilizes the old Excelsior Canal, built between 1854 and 1859 by hundreds of Chinese laborers. To bring high pressure water for hydraulic mining. The ditch tapped the South Yuba river more than 2 miles upstream from here, and ran all the way to what is now the dam at Lake Wildwood, then by the China Ditch to the Smartsville mining district, 15 miles west of Grass Valley. After hydraulic mining was outlawed in the 1880s the \\"Excelsior Ditch\\" was used for agricultural irrigation until it was abandoned in 1963. In 1969, John Olmsted rediscovered the rock-lined ditches, adjacent paths for ditch tenders, and wooden flumes that provided access over ravines.

Plot The cartoon starts with Napoleon (Krazy Kat) looking at a portrait of his human counterpart. After adding numerous countries to his empire as result of winning battles, he then sets sights on Russia. Just before leaving and going there, Napoleon engages in a warm farewell meeting with his wife Josephine who is also a cat. When the feline emperor and his handful of soldiers march in the street, bystanders cheer for him. After a long walk, Napoleon and his men set foot on a snowy terrain of Russia. The local militia immediately notices his approach, and therefore start hurling round bombs, prompting Napoleon's battalion to enter a bunker. Using the cannon which he brought along, the feline emperor manages to land some hits. The local forces retaliate with a rapid-firing gun and a cannon which they also have. One by one, Napoleon's soldiers are taken out. A Russian fighter then approaches the bunker and goes on to chase Napoleon across the country. Following a long run, that Russian fighter tosses a bomb at Napoleon. The blast is so powerful that the French leader is sent several miles upward. Upon being bested in battle and blown away by the enemy's explosive, Napoleon finds himself landing in a boat in a harbor back in France. To his surprise, he is greeted by a pack of bystanders, including his wife. They sing him a farewell song, thinking he is still departing for battle. Annoyed by this, Napoleon oars himself out of sight. Differences from the actual events The famous defeat of the real life Napoleon took place in a region called Waterloo which is in Belgium.

He held his late father's title from the age of two until the death of his grandfather, Henri-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force (who had only held that title for three years due to the death of his older brother). Jacques-Nompar very rapidly assumed the title of duc de La Force at the closing of parliament 10 February 1678 and was acknowledged a peer, subject to conversion to Catholicism. The nobleman was however for many years an active Huguenot and refused to abjure, thus was confined in the Bastille, and then in a monastery. He afterwards abjured, but actually died a Protestant, professing the Protestant faith on his death-bed in 1699. Marriage, issue and the European Wars of Religion He married as his first wife, in 1661, Marie de Saint Simon (died 1670), daughter of Antoine de Saint Simon, marquis de Courtomer and Suzanne Madeleine, and by her, had three daughters: * Louise Victoire de Caumont La Force * Jeanne de Caumont La Force * Marguerite de Caumont La Force He married, as his second wife, 12 March 1673, Suzanne de Beringhen (died 1731), daughter of Jean de Beringhen and Ne de Menoux, and by her had three sons and four daughters: * Henri-Jacques Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force (1675-1726) married 19 June 1698, Anne Marie Beuzelen (1668-1752) * François Nompar de Caumont La Force (1678-1702) * Armand-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force (1679-1761) married 17 July 1713, Anne Elisabeth Gruel de Boismont * Charlotte de Caumont La Force, a nun * Suzanne de Caumont La Force, a nun * Jeanne de Caumont La Force * Magne de Caumont La Force He died 19 April 1699 at Château de la Boulaye, near Évreux in Normandy. He was succeeded by his son Henri-Jacques Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force, and then by his third son, Armand. His widow was held prisoner for a spell at the convent of Évreux, and would end up in England as a staunch Protestant. Meanwhile the deposed King James II's Queen, Mary of Modena, was being part-way escorted by her distant cousin the Marquis de Beringhen to her final exile place in France, as a staunch Catholic. Suzanne refused to abjure (swear to be Catholic), and was confined to the convent until her husband's death, when the Earl of Jersey, English Ambassador at Paris, petitioned for her release and exile to England, where she was brought by his wife and given an apartment in St. James's Palace. Her son Armand became an ardent Catholic whom local sources describe as bigoted. He was confirmed as beneficiary of all her lands in his mother's Will but he burned the library of Protestant books which his father had collected, and persecuted his tenantry with such great severity that some died. Suzanne, the dowager duchess, was in late life among a group of gentrified Huguenots particularly from Bennes, including Isaac Gouicquet de St Eloy born in Plémy naturalised English in 1698, who emigrated with funds, to London. They breathed life into the volte-face French Protestant courtier-devoted Chapel Royal (i.e. Queen's Chapel part) at St James's and she was among those who generally lived in Sunbury on Thames.C. E.

Sunbury, her gentile refuge, was an outer Middlesex village within a few hours ride of Westminster. St Eloy owned one of its three manors, Sunbury 1703-1718 and its neighbour in the parish which includes a French Street named after this period, Kempton Park, was somewhat earlier owned by Sir John Chardin and Esther Le Pigne, or Peigne, the uncle of Sir Philip Musgrave.

Playing career As a schoolboy Griffiths played as a centre forward, playing for the Forefield Lane Junior School team in Crosby, Merseyside. He moved up to Crosby County Secondary School, playing for their intermediate team before going to Bootle Technical College aged 12. Whilst there he played for Bootle Schoolboys, and during this spell he transferred from centre forward to full back, the position he would make his own for the rest of his career. He was so impressive playing there that he was picked for the Lancashire County Schoolboys side, where he was spotted by Everton scouts who drafted him into their Youth squad in May 1954. Signing professional forms at 17, and following tours in Ireland and Holland, he made his first team debut against Preston North End at Deepdale aged 19. Everton lost 3–2, and the following week were thrashed 6–1 by Arsenal. Soon afterwards Everton let Griffiths go and in June 1960 Southport's player-manager, ex- Evertonian Wally Fielding, signed him to the Fourth Division club. Nicknamed 'Yogi' during his time with the Sandgrounders thanks to his ultra-short crewcut, Griffiths played 97 consecutive games, racking up 117 appearances and one goal before receiving a cartilage injury at Rochdale in March 1963 that all but ended his professional career aged just 23. Management career=Formby= After taking over football for Ainsdale St John's boys' club in Southport, in the mid 1960s Trevor Hitchen asked Griffiths to manage Formby. His impact was immediate, winning the Liverpool FA Challenge Cup in 1967–68. History then stepped in to give his side a leg up. The Northern Premier League was formed, attracting many of the stronger sides from lower leagues such as the Lancashire Combination who, in turn, replenished their ranks from leagues further down the football pyramid. In August 1968, after thirty years in the Liverpool County Combination, Formby moved up to the Lancashire Combination and joined national competitions for the first time in 20 years, entering the FA Cup and later the FA Trophy. After just three years Formby graduated to a stronger league, the Cheshire County League in 1971. In the first season the Squirrels reached the Liverpool Non-League Senior Cup final. After a feet- finding first year's league campaign, the next three seasons had top ten finishes and record campaigns in the FA Cup and FA Trophy that still stand. In 1978 Formby defeated two League sides to become the first non-league side to win the Liverpool Senior Cup since 1897. Griffiths picked himself as a player for the first few years at Formby, including playing a match in goal, but the habit waned as he aged and the strength of his squad increased. Nonetheless he is remembered as being a very fit and participative manager in training even late in his Formby tenure at the turn of the 1980s. =Burscough= Griffiths left Formby in October 1980. His next managerial role was at Burscough, taking them to the inaugural North West Counties Football League title in 1982–83. =South Liverpool= From there he graduated to Northern Premier League side South Liverpool, winning a treble of the Lancashire Junior Cup, the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup and most impressively the Liverpool Senior Cup in 1983–84. =Southport= In December 1984 Griffiths returned to Southport, now in the Northern Premier League, as manager, a move long desired by fans. He appointed as his assistant a man starting out on his managerial career, Dave Jones, who would go on to be boss of Cardiff City and Sheffield Wednesday. They took Southport to the quarter finals of the FA Trophy and the First Round Proper of the FA Cup. =Mossley= In November 1987 the duo left Haig Avenue, taking up identical roles in October 1988 at Mossley, who were then bottom of the Northern Premier League. Thirteen months and four trophies later, Griffiths had stabilised them in mid-table when he was asked to halve his wages. =Morecambe= Griffiths promptly moved to Morecambe in December 1989, taking Dave Jones with him again, though the latter left part way into Griffiths' four-year tenure. By the end of the first season the team had reached the final of the Lancashire ATS Cup. In 1991–92 they got to the first round of the FA Cup (losing to Hull City) and second round of the FA Trophy (losing to eventual winners Colchester United). The season finished on what was to prove to be Griffiths' high point at Morecambe, winning the two-legged final of the League Presidents Cup, beating Stalybridge Celtic 3–2 on aggregate. In 1992–93 once again they got to the second round of the FA Trophy, taking Conference side Wycombe Wanderers to a replay. After an indifferent start to 1993–94 Griffiths was sacked by the board in December 1993 after a little over four years in the post. =Other clubs= After leaving Morecambe in December 1993 he had spells with Bangor City, Witton Albion, Chorley, Kendal Town, Congleton Town and Rossendale United before retiring from the game.

His father, Samuel Imerman, was a chemist. He attended college seeking a degree in business law but never completed his studies. He was conscripted into the South African Army during Apartheid and fought in the South African Border War. Thereafter he worked for his father's chemical brokering business and then started his own company purchasing surplus chemicals and reselling them. Career In the early 1980s, he expanded his business, first, into the purchase of damaged goods (which he would then repair and resell for a profit), then, into the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical business boomed and, in 1987, Imerman listed his company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. He then expanded into food distribution, listing an additional three companies on the stock exchange in South Africa. During the late 1980s, when Western companies were divesting themselves of assets in South Africa due to Apartheid, he purchased assets at prices far below their real value. In 1989, he bought the South African assets of both Nabisco and the Ferro chemical group. The Nabisco purchase gave him the option of purchasing Del Monte International, which he did in 1993, backed by an investment from South African mining company Anglo American plc; he later purchased 50% of Del Monte Asia. In 1995, he listed Del Monte International on the Singapore Stock Exchange, tripling the value of the business to £400 million.Businessweek: \\"Executive Profile: Vivian Imerman retrieved 29 December 2013 In 1999, he sold his remaining stake in the fruit company and moved to London.

With a modernist practice based in Cambridge, he also designed many city housing projects, schools, and private residences. Early life Roberts' father, John Roberts, was a preacher and historian of the Presbyterian Church of Wales. David Roberts was educated at the Cardiff High School and Welsh School of Architecture, and was awarded the 1936 RIBA Soane Medal. David Roberts was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers in August 1942 and he served in the Italian campaign. Roberts married architect Margaret MacDonald Baird, and they settled in Cambridge where they built their house at 11 Wilberforce Road. Their only son, Nicholas Wyn Roberts, born in 1948, became an architect and professor of architecture at Woodbury University in Los Angeles. Career Mallory Court at Magdalene College, Cambridge Roberts began teaching at the Department of Architecture, University of Cambridge in 1946, and became a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1958. He influenced many students and employees who became scholars and architects, including Anthony Vidler, Lionel March, Nicholas Ray, Cedric Price, and John G. Ellis. Roberts was a modernist architect in postwar Cambridge with his University Health Centre built in 1951. Roberts's earliest college work was at Magdalene where, in Benson and Mallory Courts, he created a small townscape; he refurbished existing houses, and built new infill, to create a street effect, rather than imposing the conventional form of a college courtyard. With his headquarters overlooking the Cam, Roberts kept his office small, six to eight people. Many young architects passed through the practice. Rory Spence wrote in the catalogue, David Roberts Architect, \\"He seemed to approach each job with fresh enthusiasm and great integrity. It is no wonder that he had such admiration for Philip Webb and the meticulous individual care which he lavished on each design. Like Webb, David never worked to a formula, as so many of even the best architects do, and possibly for this reason his buildings are less well-known than they should be. There is always a strong idea at the heart of each building, related to its context, which is unique to that building\\". A former student, Geoffrey Clarke, became a partner in 1964. Roberts is described as the first architect to specialise in modern educational buildings. He gave a stepped profile to his designs for student accommodation (for example at Clare College in 1956 and Jesus College in 1963) to give the rooms a dual aspect. His student accommodation buildings at Jesus College, Cambridge and St Hugh's College, Oxford, have already been given a heritage listing of Grade II. Roberts and his wife are buried together in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.

The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers and are willing to accept them. The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction. The organization was founded by Heather Veitch, who worked as a stripper for four years before becoming a Christian and leaving the sex industry in 1999. She founded JC's Girls on Good Friday in March 2005; it was based at Sandals Church in Riverside, California, with the support of the California Southern Baptist Convention. In January 2006, JC's Girls went to Las Vegas to operate a booth at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo that received much traffic and news coverage. By 2008, Veitch had moved to Las Vegas and based the organization at Central Christian Church in nearby Henderson, Nevada. The former stripper and call girl Theresa Scher and the social worker Sheri Brown founded the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls at the Rock Church in 2007. Veitch, Scher, and Brown resigned from JC's Girls in 2011, 2012, and 2014 respectively, leaving the leadership of the organization to Laura Bonde. , the sole chapter of JC's Girls is in San Diego. Terry Barone, spokesperson for the California Southern Baptist Convention, said that JC's Girls members \\"are doing what Jesus did ... He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors.\\" JC's Girls members have been criticized for dressing like sex workers, a look that Veitch said is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted Matthew 6:24, a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, \\"Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?\\" Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls \\"America's most unusual Christian outreach operation\\". Ideology evangelizes to women in the sex industry such as Sophia Lynn, a pornographic film actor who subsequently became a Christian. JC's Girls, also called the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry, is an evangelical organization that calls itself \\"a biblically-based Christian ministry\\". JC's Girls is less focused on seeking conversions than on communicating the message to women in the sex industry that Christians exist who are willing to non-judgmentally accept them. Initially, the organization focused on evangelizing to strippers and erotic dancers, but later began to engage with women in other areas of the sex industry, such as softcore pornographic models and call girls. The organization also diversified to support people with pornography addiction. Members of the organization evangelize at adult entertainment conventions and strip clubs. Out of a belief that many women in the sex industry have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten them out of the sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so. JC's Girls aims to convey to women in the sex industry that Jesus loves them, that they are beautiful, and that they have dignity. Its volunteers often style themselves with eyelash extensions, stiletto heels, skinny jeans, skin-tight T-shirts, and backcombed hair to convey the message that such things are, in their view, not sinful. History=Background= Heather Veitch founded JC's Girls after becoming a Christian and leaving a four-year career in the sex industry as a stripper and pornographic film actor. Veitch worked as a stripper for four years in the Las Vegas area and California. After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem and the end of the world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle. She then became a Christian, married her boyfriend Jon, started and completed a course in cosmetology, left the sex industry, and became a hairdresser all by September 1999. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished she had told her friend about the gospel before she died. By 2005, Veitch was working as a hairdresser in Riverside, California. One of her clients was Lori Albee, a housewife with two children and no experience with the sex industry. Veitch told Albee about her friend who had died and to whom she wished she had evangelized. Albee suggested that they start telling other strippers about Jesus. Matt Brown, Veitch's pastor at Sandals Church, arrived for a haircut and Veitch asked him for help to start an organization to minister to sex workers. He was interested. Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as \\"a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry\\". They chose the name \\"Matthew's House\\" in reference to the Calling of Matthew, a gospel episode in which Jesus eats with sinners at the home of Matthew the Apostle. By 2011, JC's Girls chapters were based in Las Vegas, Nevada; Riverside, California; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. , the San Diego chapter is the sole chapter that remains. =Riverside chapter= On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee, and six other women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of accepting the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling them that they were loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with \\"JC\\" standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name \\"JC's Girls\\" because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name \\"Matthew's House\\". Tanya Huerter (right), who joined Heather Veitch (left) as two of JC's Girls' initial three leaders, said, \\"I believe God created sex for marriage. But God will meet these girls where they are.\\" Veitch became the head of JC's Girls, and the 17,000-member Sandals Church became the organization's base of operations. The church is part of the California Southern Baptist Convention, which supports JC's Girls. The church gave JC's Girls a $10,000 budget in its first year. The organization's members continued visiting strip clubs across California, paying for private dances and then evangelizing the strippers. Within six months of its founding, the organization's members had persuaded several strippers to start attending a church and were only once asked to stop. One of these women was fired from a strip club because she started attending Sandals Church, but she continued attending the church, saying that Brown's preaching helped her get through the week. By December 2005, Veitch, Albee, and teacher Tanya Huerter had become the organization's leaders. Two months later, Huerter, who also had no experience with the sex industry, said, \\"I have a heart for these girls. I believe God created sex for marriage. But God will meet these girls where they are.\\" Veitch, Albee, and Huerter invited Christian women from other churches in the area to volunteer with JC's Girls, and approximately 90 churches responded with interest. JC's Girls received public attention in December 2005, when UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph published an article about the organization's activities. The article prompted additional media coverage from other newspapers, television programs, and radio stations both across the United States and internationally, including news outlets as far away as France and India. Veitch began dividing her time between managing JC's Girls, appearing in the media, and serving as a caregiver for her terminally-ill husband, who had brain cancer. Pornographic film actor Jesse Jane was one of more than 200 women working in the sex industry who accepted Bibles from JC's Girls at the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo. In January 2006, JC's Girls went to Las Vegas to operate a booth at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo—the largest trade fair for pornography in the United States. The booth was decorated in the style of the booths advertising strip clubs; the women wore sleeveless shirts with the organization's name in sequins. When men attending the convention visited the booth thinking that JC's Girls was a strip club, the women asked them to guess what \\"JC\\" meant and gave attendees a sticker reading: \\"I've been booby-trapped by JC's Girls.\\" JC's Girls told thousands of male attendees about the gospel, distributed more than 200 Bibles wrapped in T-shirts reading \\"Holy Hottie\\", and gave out DVDs of a sermon by Brown about pornography addiction. Jesse Jane was one of the women who accepted a Bible. Many convention attendees wished to take pictures with the JC's Girls volunteers. Veitch was interviewed for a variety of media, including a CNN news broadcast and a documentary film by Bill Day, who had previously made the film Missionary Positions about XXXchurch.com, another Christian organization that was operating a booth at the trade fair. Also in January 2006, Brown approved a $50,000 budget for JC's Girls for the year. By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and strippers from across the United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches. In an attempt to dispel accusations that the JC's Girls message might be motivated by jealousy, Veitch lost weight and became more physically fit. She said that she wanted strippers \\"to know that if I wanted to, I could be a stripper again, but I choose to live my life for the Lord.\\" =Original website= Within the first few months of founding JC's Girls, Veitch, and Albee launched the organization's first official website, which initially received little traffic. Three months later, it had received 40,000 hits. By December 2005, the organization had received messages through its website from pornographic film actors and men with pornography addiction who said that JC's Girls had changed their lives. A slogan on the main page of the website read, \\"If you are a CHRISTIAN ... See us in ACTION ...\\". Without asking for payment, Veitch's friend, pornographic film director James DiGiorgio, took glamour photographs of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter for the JC's Girls website. DiGiorgio was not a Christian, but said that he was helping these organizations in order to support their freedom of speech; he said that the sex industry is \\"always trying to preach freedom of speech [so] anyone in this industry who has a problem with [JC's Girls'] message is a fucking hypocrite. You can't have it both ways.\\" Within a year of the organization's founding, Veitch, Albee, and Huerter were maintaining Myspace pages that they used to offer support, counsel, and advice. By 2008, the JC's Girls website was receiving around 15,000 hits per day. =Las Vegas chapter= JC's Girls has collaborated with Hookers for Jesus, a similar organization founded by Annie Lobert. (left to right: Lori Albee, Heather Veitch, Lobert) In 2008, Veitch told Brown that she believed that the JC's Girls ministry needed to move to Las Vegas, and he responded supportively. By 2008, Veitch had moved to Las Vegas and based the new chapter of JC's Girls at Central Christian Church in nearby Henderson, Nevada, leaving the leadership of the Riverside chapter to Albee. That year, Veitch collaborated with Annie Lobert, a former call girl working with Hookers for Jesus, an organization similar to JC's Girls. The organizations were both represented at that year's AVN Adult Entertainment Expo. The PussyCat Preacher, a documentary film about Veitch's experiences starting JC's Girls, was released that February. The following month, pornographic film actor Sophia Lynn left the sex industry after becoming a Christian; she underwent more than a year of counselling with Veitch through JC's Girls. Veitch had flown to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to spend a weekend educating Celebrate Community Church about the sex industry. The church soon gave Lynn a job in its office, a scholarship to go to college, and a place to live. Lynn said, \\"I hope I don't have to wake up from this. I feel like my life has been saved.\\" =San Diego chapter= In San Diego, Theresa Scher, a stripper and call girl, was looking for a way out of the sex industry when she watched a CNN interview with Albee about her work with JC's Girls in Riverside. Scher contacted 1 because they understand from personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location. Carrie Prejean, who was crowned Miss California USA in 2009, became a member of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008. Carrie Prejean started volunteering with the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008 and became Miss California USA the following year. At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became the subject of a controversy because of her response to a question about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regaied a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers. By 2009, approximately 40 women were on the chapter's active evangelism team, and they had given pink Bibles to most of the strippers in San Diego County. They paired these Bibles with other gifts, including lip gloss, necklaces, and lotions, in order to pique the strippers' interest. In August 2010, Brown went to Warsaw, Ohio, to briefly join forces with Anny Donewald, a former stripper and founder of Eve's Angels, an organization similar to JC's Girls. Together, Brown and Donewald negotiated a peace accord between women working at a strip club and members of a local church who had been picketing the club for four years. The strippers had been counter-protesting by dancing in bikinis in front of the church during Sunday services while Tommy George, the club's owner, played music from his car. Brown and Donewald spoke at the church, urging them to stop protesting at the strip club and saying, \\"It's not our job to tell these women that it's time to get out of there ... Just love them. Let the Holy Spirit draw them out.\\" Brown and Donewald also visited the strip club and spoke with the strippers, two of whom became Christians while continuing to work at the club. The peace accord received much publicity, but the church's members, led by their pastor Bill Dunfee, resumed picketing once Brown had returned to San Diego. George and his club's strippers returned to their counter-protesting. By 2011, several of the strippers JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could spend more time with her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization. Reception Veitch (right) said that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, but she said that the look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. When JC's Girls first started receiving funds from Sandals Church in 2005, some of the church's members were displeased that their tithes and offerings were being given to strip clubs. In 2006, Brown said that funding the activities of JC's Girls was worthwhile because the sex industry \\"has been largely ignored by the evangelical church,\\" and the budget allotted to JC's Girls is small compared to the money made by the sex industry. Sandals Church members were also concerned that ministering to strippers would be ineffective. Brown responded by referring to Veitch's conversion, suggesting that other strippers could have similar experiences. Terry Barone of the California Southern Baptist Convention asserted that JC's Girls members \\"are doing what Jesus did ... He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors.\\" Brown said that the most common complaint that he received about JC's Girls was \\"the way Heather Veitch looks... her breasts are too big, and she looks too much like a stripper\\", a complaint to which he responded that \\"God can use any individual to change the world\\". Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, but she said that the look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said around the same time that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—\\"They say my T-shirt is too tight\\", said Lobert, \\"but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does\\". Controversy regarding his involvement with JC's Girls threatened to lose Brown his church facility on the California Baptist University campus, but the church united in support of JC's Girls and remained in the same location. Barone said that Baptists might find viewing the JC's Girls website awkward, but that it was not intended for them. Stephen Clark of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"an edgy website [with] provocative appeals.\\" Sarah Sumner, author of Men and Women in the Church, said in Bill Day's 2008 documentary film The Pussycat Preacher that some Christians might oppose the female-led JC's Girls because of 1 Timothy 2:12, a Bible verse that can be interpreted as restricting positions of authority in church to men. Brown said elsewhere in the film that it made more sense for women to lead JC's Girls \\"because a woman would be the most welcome in the industry\\". Photographer Michael Grecco included an image of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter in his 2007 book Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry (pictured). In its first year, JC's Girls was criticized for allowing DiGiorgio to take glamorous photographs of Veitch, Albee and Huerter for their website. Veitch responded to this criticism with the assertion that \\"it is not a sin to be attractive or dress cute,\\" and that the photographs were intended to persuade women in the sex industry to dismiss the idea that Christianity is about \\"being locked up in a house with a Bible.\\" DiGiorgio said that JC's Girls is correct in believing that many women in the sex industry need to be rescued from self- destructive behavior, but he did not think that encouraging the women to become Christians would necessarily help them. The Family Research Council, an American Christian lobbying organization, has endorsed JC's Girls. In his 2013 book Evangelicals and the Arts in Fiction, writer John Weaver writes that science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein wrote about evangelicals as being sexually repressed and eventually undergoing a sexual revolution. Weaver offers JC's Girls and XXXchurch.com as evidence that Heinlein's fiction is becoming a reality. By 2007, adherents of UFO religion Raëlism had responded to JC's Girls by forming \\"Raël's Girls\\", an organization with a similar outreach program but a very different message, encouraging sex workers to try to maximise their own sexual pleasure while serving clients. In 2006, a Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit. He commended Veitch \\"for her zeal and desire to reach the lost for Christ\\", but asked, \\"How can you stay in the industry and have a relationship with God?\\", and quoted Matthew 6:24, a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, \\"Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?\\" At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry. In the image caption, he called the trio a \\"devout Christian trinity\\". Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the organization's evangelism \\"America's most unusual Christian outreach operation\\". A journalist for UK newspaper The Observer compared JC's Girls to XXXchurch.com, writing in 2006 that both of \\"these ministries are in some way reforming the church as well as their would-be followers.\\" NotesReferencesBibliography   External links * Category:2005 establishments in California Category:Charities based in California Category:Protestant feminism Category:Christian organizations based in the United States Category:Christian organizations established in the 21st century Category:Evangelical parachurch organizations Category:Evangelicalism in the United States Category:Evangelists Category:Feminist organizations in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in San Diego Category:Christian organizations established in 2005 Category:Religious service organizations Category:Sex industry in the United States Category:Sexuality in Protestantism Category:Social welfare parachurch organizations Category:Volunteer groups in the United States Category:Christian women's organizations Category:Evangelical Christian missions ","title":"JC's Girls"},{"id":"41497661","text":"Prof. Dr. Tevfik Fikret Uçar (born 28 January 1966) is a full-time Professor, chairman of the Graphic Design Department and design consultant Anadolu University of Fine Arts and Design.

It has applications in diverse areas such as representation theory, probability, and algorithm analysis; for example, the problem of longest increasing subsequences. A related formula counts the number of semi-standard Young tableaux, which is a specialization of a Schur polynomial.  Definitions and statement  Let \\\\lambda=(\\\\lambda_1\\\\geq \\\\cdots\\\\geq \\\\lambda_k) be a partition of n=\\\\lambda_1+\\\\cdots+\\\\lambda_k. It is customary to interpret \\\\lambda graphically as a Young diagram, namely a left-justified array of square cells with k rows of lengths \\\\lambda_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_k. A (standard) Young tableau of shape \\\\lambda is a filling of the n cells of the Young diagram with all the integers \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, with no repetition, such that each row and each column form increasing sequences. For the cell in position (i,j), in the ith row and jth column, the hook H_\\\\lambda(i,j) is the set of cells (a,b) such that a=i and b \\\\ge j or a \\\\ge i and b=j. The hook length h_\\\\lambda(i,j) is the number of cells in H_\\\\lambda(i,j). The hook length formula expresses the number of standard Young tableaux of shape \\\\lambda, denoted by f^{\\\\lambda} or d_\\\\lambda, as : f^\\\\lambda \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{n!}{\\\\prod h_\\\\lambda (i,j)} , where the product is over all cells (i,j) of the Young diagram.

The hook length formula gives the number of standard Young tableaux as: :f^\\\\lambda \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{9!}{7\\\\cdot 5\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot 3\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 1\\\\cdot 1\\\\cdot 1} \\\\ =\\\\ 216.

These are in bijection with the Young tableaux of shape \\\\lambda=(n,n) : a Dyck path corresponds to the tableau whose first row lists the positions of the U-steps, while the second row lists the positions of the D-steps. For example, UUDDUD correspond to the tableaux with rows 125 and 346. This shows that C_n = f^{(n,n)} , so the hook formula specializes to the well-known product formula : C_n \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{(2n)!}{(n{+}1)(n)\\\\cdots(3)(2)(n)(n{-}1)\\\\cdots(2)(1)} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{(2n)!}{(n{+}1)!n!} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{n{+}1}\\\\binom{2n}{n}.  History  There are other formulas for f^\\\\lambda, but the hook length formula is particularly simple and elegant. A less convenient formula expressing f^\\\\lambda in terms of a determinant was deduced independently by Frobenius and Young in 1900 and 1902 respectively using algebraic methods.G. Frobenius. Uber die charaktere der symmetrischer gruppe, Preuss. &ad.; Wk. sitz. (1900), 516–534.A. Young. Quantitative substitutional analysis II, Proc. London Math. Sot., Ser. 1, 35 (1902), 361–397. MacMahon found an alternate proof for the Young–Frobenius formula in 1916 using difference methods.P. A. MacMahon. “Combinatory Analysis,” Cambridge Univ. Press, London/New York, 1916; reprinted by Chelsea, New York, 1960. The hook length formula itself was discovered in 1953 by Frame, Robinson, and Thrall as an improvement to the Young–Frobenius formula. Sagan describes the discovery as follows. Despite the simplicity of the hook length formula, the Frame–Robinson–Thrall proof is not very insightful and does not provide any intuition for the role of the hooks. The search for a short, intuitive explanation befitting such a simple result gave rise to many alternate proofs.Knuth, Donald (1973). The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching, 3rd Edition, Addison–Wesley, p. 63 Hillman and Grassl gave the first proof that illuminates the role of hooks in 1976 by proving a special case of the Stanley hook-content formula, which is known to imply the hook length formula.A. P. Hillman and R. M. Grassl. Reverse plane partitions and tableau hook numbers, J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 21 (1976), 216–221. Greene, Nijenhuis, and Wilf found a probabilistic proof using the hook walk in which the hook lengths appear naturally in 1979.Greene, C., Nijenhuis, A. and Wilf, H. S. (1979). A probabilistic proof of a formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. Adv. in Math. 31, 104–109. Remmel adapted the original Frame–Robinson–Thrall proof into the first bijective proof for the hook length formula in 1982.J. B. Remmel. Bijective proofs of formulae for the number of standard Young tableaux, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 11 (1982), 45–100. A direct bijective proof was first discovered by Franzblau and Zeilberger in 1982.Franzblau, D. S. and Zeilberger, D. (1982). A bijective proof of the hook-length formula. J. Algorithms 3, 317–343. Zeilberger also converted the Greene–Nijenhuis–Wilf hook walk proof into a bijective proof in 1984.D. Zeilberger. A short hook- lengths bijection inspired by the Greene–Nijenhuis–Wilf proof, Discrete Math. 51 (1984), 101–108. A simpler direct bijection was announced by Pak and Stoyanovskii in 1992, and its complete proof was presented by the pair and Novelli in 1997.Pak, I. M. and Stoyanovskii, A. V. (1992).

Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science 1, 1997, 53–67. Meanwhile, the hook length formula has been generalized in several ways. R. M. Thrall found the analogue to the hook length formula for shifted Young Tableaux in 1952.R. M. Thrall. A combinatorial problem, Michigan Math. J. 1 (1952), 81–88. Sagan gave a shifted hook walk proof for the hook length formula for shifted Young tableaux in 1980.Sagan, B. On selecting a random shifted Young tableau. J. Algorithms 1, 3 (1980), 213–234. Sagan and Yeh proved the hook length formula for binary trees using the hook walk in 1989.Sagan, B. E., and Yeh, Y. N. Probabilistic algorithms for trees. Fibonacci Quart. 27, 3 (1989), 201–208. Proctor gave a poset generalization (see below).  Probabilistic proof = Knuth's heuristic argument = The hook length formula can be understood intuitively using the following heuristic, but incorrect, argument suggested by D. E. Knuth.. Given that each element of a tableau is the smallest in its hook and filling the tableau shape at random, the probability that cell (i,j) will contain the minimum element of the corresponding hook is the reciprocal of the hook length. Multiplying these probabilities over all i and j gives the formula. This argument is fallacious since the events are not independent. Knuth's argument is however correct for the enumeration of labellings on trees satisfying monotonicity properties analogous to those of a Young tableau. In this case, the 'hook' events in question are in fact independent events. = Probabilistic proof using the hook walk = This is a probabilistic proof found by C. Greene, A. Nijenhuis, and H. S. Wilf in 1979.Greene, C., Nijenhuis, A. and Wilf, H. S. (1979). A probabilistic proof of a formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. Adv. in Math. 31, 104–109. Define : e_\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{n!}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in Y(\\\\lambda)}h_\\\\lambda(i,j)}. We wish to show that f^\\\\lambda = e_\\\\lambda. First, :f^\\\\lambda = \\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda}f^\\\\mu, Corners of the Young diagram (5,3,2,1,1) where the sum runs over all Young diagrams \\\\mu obtained from \\\\lambda by deleting one corner cell. (The maximal entry of the Young tableau of shape \\\\lambda occurs at one of its corner cells, so deleting it gives a Young tableaux of shape \\\\mu.) We define f^\\\\emptyset=1and e_{\\\\emptyset}=1, so it is enough to show the same recurrence : e_\\\\lambda = \\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda}e_\\\\mu, which would imply f^\\\\lambda=e_\\\\lambda by induction. The above sum can be viewed as a sum of probabilities by writing it as : \\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{e_\\\\mu}{e_\\\\lambda}=1. We therefore need to show that the numbers \\\\frac{e_\\\\mu}{e_\\\\lambda} define a probability measure on the set of Young diagrams \\\\mu with \\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda. This is done in a constructive way by defining a random walk, called the hook walk, on the cells of the Young diagram \\\\lambda, which eventually selects one of the corner cells of \\\\lambda (which are in bijection with diagrams \\\\mu for which \\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda). The hook walk is defined by the following rules. (1) Pick a cell uniformly at random from \\\\lambda cells. Start the random walk from there. (2) Successor of current cell (i,j) is chosen uniformly at random from the hook H_{\\\\lambda}(i,j)\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{(i,j)\\\\\\\\}. (3) Continue until you reach a corner cell \\\\textbf{c}. Proposition: For a given corner cell (a,b) of \\\\lambda, we have : \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\textbf{c}=(a,b)\\\\right)=\\\\frac{e_\\\\mu}{e_\\\\lambda}, where \\\\mu=\\\\lambda\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{(a,b)\\\\\\\\}. Given this, summing over all corner cells (a,b) gives \\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\uparrow\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{e_{\\\\mu}}{e_{\\\\lambda}}=1 as claimed.  Connection to representations of the symmetric group  The hook length formula is of great importance in the representation theory of the symmetric group S_n, where the number f^\\\\lambda is known to be equal to the dimension of the complex irreducible representation V_\\\\lambda associated to \\\\lambda. = Detailed discussion = The complex irreducible representations V_{\\\\lambda} of the symmetric group are indexed by partitions \\\\lambda of n (see Specht module) . Their characters are related to the theory of symmetric functions via the Hall inner product: : \\\\chi^\\\\lambda(w)=\\\\langle s_\\\\lambda, p_{\\\\tau(w)}\\\\rangle, where s_{\\\\lambda} is the Schur function associated to \\\\lambda and p_{\\\\tau(w)} is the power-sum symmetric function of the partition \\\\tau(w) associated to the cycle decomposition of w . For example, if w=(154)(238)(6)(79) then \\\\tau(w) = (3,3,2,1) . Since the identity permutation e has the form e=(1)(2)\\\\cdots(n) in cycle notation, \\\\tau(e) = (1,\\\\ldots,1)=1^{(n)} , the formula says : f^\\\\lambda \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\dim V_\\\\lambda \\\\,=\\\\,\\\\chi^\\\\lambda(e) \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\langle s_\\\\lambda, p_{1^{(n)}}\\\\rangle The expansion of Schur functions in terms of monomial symmetric functions uses the Kostka numbers: : s_\\\\lambda= \\\\sum_\\\\mu K_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}m_\\\\mu, Then the inner product with p_{1^{(n)}} = h_{1^{(n)}} is K_{\\\\lambda 1^{(n)}} , because \\\\langle m_{\\\\mu},h_{ u} \\\\rangle = \\\\delta_{\\\\mu u} . Note that K_{\\\\lambda 1^{(n)}} is equal to f^{\\\\lambda}=\\\\dim V_\\\\lambda , so that \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\vdash n} \\\\left(f^{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^2 = n! from considering the regular representation of S_n, or combinatorially from the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence. The computation also shows that: : (x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots+x_k)^n = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\vdash n} s_\\\\lambda f^\\\\lambda. This is the expansion of p_{1^{(n)}} in terms of Schur functions using the coefficients given by the inner product, since \\\\langle s_{\\\\mu},s_{ u}\\\\rangle = \\\\delta_{\\\\mu u} . The above equality can be proven also checking the coefficients of each monomial at both sides and using the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence or, more conceptually, looking at the decomposition of V^{\\\\otimes n} by irreducible GL(V) modules, and taking characters. See Schur–Weyl duality. = Proof of hook formula using Frobenius formula= By the above considerations : p_{1^{(n)}} = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\vdash n} s_{\\\\lambda}f^{\\\\lambda} so that : \\\\Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}} = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\vdash n} \\\\Delta(x)s_{\\\\lambda}f^{\\\\lambda} where \\\\Delta(x) = \\\\prod_{i is the Vandermonde determinant. For the partition \\\\lambda = (\\\\lambda_1\\\\geq\\\\cdots\\\\geq\\\\lambda_k) , define l_i = \\\\lambda_i+k-i for i=1,\\\\ldots,k . For the following we need at least as many variables as rows in the partition, so from now on we work with n variables x_1,\\\\cdots,x_n. Each term \\\\Delta(x)s_{\\\\lambda} is equal to : a_{(\\\\lambda_1+k-1, \\\\lambda_2+k-2, \\\\dots , \\\\lambda_k)} (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots , x_k) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\det\\\\\\\\! \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} x_1^{l_1} & x_2^{l_1} & \\\\dots & x_k^{l_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1^{l_2} & x_2^{l_2} & \\\\dots & x_k^{l_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1^{l_k} & x_2^{l_k} & \\\\dots & x_k^{l_k} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] (See Schur function.) Since the vector (l_1,\\\\ldots, l_k) is different for each partition, this means that the coefficient of x_1^{l_1}\\\\cdots x_k^{l_k} in \\\\Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}}, denoted \\\\left[\\\\Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}}\\\\right]_{l_1,\\\\cdots,l_k}, is equal to f^{\\\\lambda} . This is known as the Frobenius Character Formula, which gives one of the earliest proofs.W. Fulton, J. Harris. Representation Theory: A First Course Springer-Verlag , New York, 1991 It remains only to simplify this coefficient. Multiplying : \\\\Delta(x) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{w\\\\in S_n} \\\\sgn(w) x_1^{w(1)-1}x_2^{w(2)-1}\\\\cdots x_k^{w(k)-1} and : p_{1^{(n)}} \\\\ =\\\\ (x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots+x_k)^n \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum \\\\frac{n!}{d_1!d_2!\\\\cdots d_k!} x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\\\\cdots x_k^{d_k} we conclude that our coefficient as : \\\\sum_{w\\\\in S_n} \\\\sgn(w)\\\\frac{n!}{(l_1-w(1)+1)!\\\\cdots (l_k-w(k)+1)!} which can be written as : \\\\frac{n!}{l_1!l_2!\\\\cdots l_k!} \\\\sum_{w\\\\in S_n} \\\\sgn(w)\\\\left[(l_1)(l_1-1)\\\\cdots(l_1-w(1)+2)\\\\right] \\\\left[(l_2)(l_2-1)\\\\cdots(l_2-w(2)+2)\\\\right]\\\\left[(l_k)(l_k-1)\\\\cdots(l_k-w(k)+2)\\\\right] The latter sum is equal to the following determinant : \\\\det \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1 & l_1 & l_1(l_1-1) & \\\\dots & \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_1-i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & l_2 & l_2(l_2-1) & \\\\dots & \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_2-i)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots& \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & l_k & l_k(l_k-1) & \\\\dots & \\\\prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_k-i) \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] which column-reduces to a Vandermonde determinant, and we obtain the formula : f^\\\\lambda \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{n!}{l_1!l_2!\\\\cdots l_k!} \\\\prod_{i Note that l_i is the hook length of the first box in each row of the Young diagram, and this expression is easily transformed into the desired form \\\\frac{n!}{\\\\prod h_\\\\lambda (i,j)} : one shows \\\\textstyle l_i! \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\prod_{j > i} (l_i - l_j) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{j\\\\leq\\\\lambda_i} h_\\\\lambda(i,j) , where the latter product runs over the ith row of the Young diagram.  Connection to longest increasing subsequences  The hook length formula also has important applications to the analysis of longest increasing subsequences in random permutations. If \\\\sigma_n denotes a uniformly random permutation of order n, L(\\\\sigma_n) denotes the maximal length of an increasing subsequence of \\\\sigma_n, and \\\\ell_n denotes the expected (average) value of L(\\\\sigma_n), Anatoly Vershik and Sergei Kerov Vershik, A. M.; Kerov, C. V. (1977), \\"Asymptotics of the Plancheral measure of the symmetric group and a limiting form for Young tableaux\\", Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 233: 1024–1027 and independently Benjamin F. Logan and Lawrence A. SheppB. F. Logan and L. A. Shepp, A variational problem for random Young tableaux, Advances in Math. 26 (1977), no. 2, 206–222. showed that when n is large, \\\\ell_n is approximately equal to 2 \\\\sqrt{n}. This answers a question originally posed by Stanislaw Ulam. The proof is based on translating the question via the Robinson–Schensted correspondence to a problem about the limiting shape of a random Young tableau chosen according to Plancherel measure. Since the definition of Plancherel measure involves the quantity f^\\\\lambda, the hook length formula can then be used to perform an asymptotic analysis of the limit shape and thereby also answer the original question. The ideas of Vershik–Kerov and Logan–Shepp were later refined by Jinho Baik, Percy Deift and Kurt Johansson, who were able to achieve a much more precise analysis of the limiting behavior of the maximal increasing subsequence length, proving an important result now known as the Baik–Deift–Johansson theorem. Their analysis again makes crucial use of the fact that f^\\\\lambda has a number of good formulas, although instead of the hook length formula it made use of one of the determinantal expressions.  Related formulas  The formula for the number of Young tableaux of shape \\\\lambda was originally derived from the Frobenius determinant formula in connection to representation theory: : f(\\\\lambda_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_k) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{n! \\\\,\\\\Delta(\\\\lambda_k,\\\\lambda_{k-1}+1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_1 + k - 1)}{\\\\lambda_k ! (\\\\lambda_{k-1} + 1)! \\\\cdots (\\\\lambda_1 + k - 1)!}. Hook lengths can also be used to give a product representation to the generating function for the number of reverse plane partitions of a given shape. If is a partition of some integer , a reverse plane partition of with shape is obtained by filling in the boxes in the Young diagram with non-negative integers such that the entries add to and are non-decreasing along each row and down each column. The hook lengths h_1,\\\\dots,h_p can be defined as with Young tableaux. If denotes the number of reverse plane partitions of with shape , then the generating function can be written as : \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\pi_n x^n = \\\\prod_{k=1}^p (1-x^{h_k})^{-1} Stanley discovered another formula for the same generating function.R.P. Stanley, \\"Ordered Structures and Partitions\\" PhD Thesis, Harvard University, 1971 In general, if A is any poset with n elements, the generating function for reverse A -partitions is : \\\\frac{P(x)}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\\\\cdots(1-x^n)} where P(x) is a polynomial such that P(1) is the number of linear extensions of A . In the case of a partition \\\\lambda , we are considering the poset in its cells given by the relation : (i,j) \\\\leq (i',j') \\\\iff i\\\\leq i' \\\\qquad \\\\textrm{and} \\\\qquad j\\\\leq j'. So a linear extension is simply a standard Young tableau, i.e. P(1) = f^{\\\\lambda} =Proof of hook formula using Stanley's formula= Combining the two formulas for the generating functions we have : \\\\frac{P(x)}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\\\\cdots(1-x^n)} = \\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in \\\\lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})^{-1} Both sides converge inside the disk of radius one and the following expression makes sense for x < 1 : P(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=1}^n (1-x^k)}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in \\\\lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})}. It would be violent to plug in 1, but the right hand side is a continuous function inside the unit disk and a polynomial is continuous everywhere so at least we can say : P(1) = \\\\lim_{x\\\\to 1} \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=1}^n (1-x^k)}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in \\\\lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})}. Applying L'Hôpital's rule n times yields the hook length formula : P(1) = \\\\frac{n!}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in \\\\lambda}h_{(i,j)}}. Semi-standard tableaux hook length formula The Schur polynomial s_\\\\lambda(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k) is the generating function of semistandard Young tableaux with shape \\\\lambda and entries in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,k\\\\\\\\}. Specializing this to x_i = 1 gives the number of semi-standard tableaux, which can be written in terms of hook lengths: > s_\\\\lambda(1,\\\\ldots,1)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in > \\\\mathrm{Y}(\\\\lambda)}\\\\frac{k-i+j}{h_\\\\lambda(i,j)}. The Young diagram \\\\lambda corresponds to an irreducible representation of the special linear group \\\\mathrm{SL}_k(\\\\mathbb C), and the Schur polynomial is also the character of the diagonal matrix \\\\mathrm{diag}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k) acting on this representation. The above specialization is thus the dimension of the irreducible representation, and the formula is an alternative to the more general Weyl dimension formula. We may refine this by taking the principal specialization of the Schur function in the variables 1,t,t^2\\\\\\\\!,t^3\\\\\\\\!, \\\\ldots : : s_{\\\\lambda}(1,t,t^2,\\\\ldots) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{t^{n\\\\left( \\\\lambda\\\\right)}}{\\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in Y(\\\\lambda)}(1-t^{h_{\\\\lambda}(i,j)})} , where n(\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_i (i{-}1)\\\\lambda_i = \\\\sum_i \\\\tbinom{\\\\lambda_i'}{2} for the conjugate partition \\\\lambda' . =Skew shape formula= There is a generalization of this formula for skew shapes, Morales, A. H., Pak, I., and Panova, G. Hook formulas for skew shapes I. q-analogues and bijections, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Ser. A, vol. 154 (2018), 350-405. : s_{\\\\lambda/\\\\mu}(1,t,t^2,\\\\cdots) = \\\\sum_{S \\\\in E(\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)} \\\\prod_{(i,j) \\\\in \\\\lambda\\\\setminus S} \\\\frac{t^{\\\\lambda_j'-i}}{1-t^{h(i,j)}} where the sum is taken over excited diagrams of shape \\\\lambda and boxes distributed according to \\\\mu.  Generalization to d-complete posets  Young diagrams can be considered as finite order ideals in the poset \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{N}, and standard Young tableaux are their linear extensions. Robert Proctor has given a generalization of the hook length formula to count linear extensions of a larger class of posets generalizing both trees and skew diagrams.

In the early 2000s, alcohol was again served, although it proved to be unprofitable. In 2014, the cafe underwent an almost year-long nineteen million dollar renovation, which saw it connect to a nearby restaurant and increase seating capacity by thirty percent.

The primogeniture legislation, in conjunction with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, would align hereditary titles in accordance with the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act.  Overview  The bill was dubbed the \\"Downton law\\" in reference to the British television drama Downton Abbey where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it can only be passed to a male heir.The Equality (Titles) Bill was precipitated by the passage of the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, which altered the laws of succession to the British throne so that male heirs no longer precede their elder sisters. The bill was sponsored by the Lord Lucas and Dingwall in the House of Lords and has had two readings. The Queen consented to the bill's procession. Conservative MP Mary Macleod has sponsored the bill in the House of Commons and pointed out that only two of House of Lords' 92 hereditary peers are women. After peer Lord Trefgarne remarked that the changes in succession would \\"set the hare running\\" on other inherited titles, a campaign group named \\"The Hares\\" was established. Prominent female aristocratic members of The Hares included Lady Sarah Carnegie, Lady Kitty Spencer, Lady Liza Campbell, and Lady Mary Charteris. Lady Sarah Carnegie served as the face of the movement, as after her the death of her father, the 14th Earl of Northesk, her title was legally claimed by a male 8th cousin instead of herself, her father's eldest surviving child. Despite the bill being in favour of gender equality, several female aristocrats refused to support the bill. Emma Manners, Duchess of Rutland, mother of the british fashion model and eldest child Lady Violet Manners, gave an interview to The Express, in which she stated that \\"[she was] delighted that the estate would be passed on to [her] son Charles, Marquess of Granby, instead of [her] first born Violet. It is a responsibility and a responsibility I am glad that my daughter does not have to bear.” An amendment to the bill that would exclude baronetcies from its scope has been opposed by David Roche, Roddy Llewellyn, and Nicholas Stuart Taylor of the Stuart Taylor Baronetcy as well as Lord Monson. A number of the bill's supporters have titles that are in danger of dying out, as their only heirs are female. Rejected at committee stage in the Lords, the Bill progressed no further but saw majority support in the Commons and prominent supporters in the Lords included former Home Secretary David Blunkett.

His father sold New Place to William Shakespeare in 1597, and his brother Hercules Underhill confirmed the sale in 1602. Fulke was alleged to have murdered his father by poison, but sources differ on whether he was accused, tried, and hanged, or accused only after his death; see below. Family Fulke Underhill, baptised 28 January 1578, was the eldest son and heir of William Underhill (d.1597) and Mary Underhill (buried 10 November 1590), daughter of Thomas Underhill of Ettington, Warwickshire. He had five brothers and three sisters: *Hercules Underhill (1581–1650), who married Bridget Carlton, the daughter of Anthony Carleton of Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire. *Timothy Underhill (d.1658) of Idlicote. *Ludowick (or Lewis) Underhill, citizen and haberdasher of London, living 1607. *William Underhill (baptised 6 March 1588, d. 1656) of Ludlow, who married Hester Parker (1601–1641), daughter of Samuel Parker of Ludlow, mercer. *Simon Underhill of Idlicote, (baptised 16 November 1589, d.1664), who married Elizabeth Hall (1585–1638), widow of Walter Savage (d.1622) of Broadway, and daughter of Richard Hall of Idlicote. *Dorothy Underhill (baptised 18 May 1579). *Elizabeth Underhill (baptised 10 November 1585, buried 25 November 1585). *Valentine Underhill (baptised 17 February 1587), who married John Bolt. Fulke Underhill's paternal grandparents were William Underhill (d. 31 March 1570) and Ursula Congreve (d. 13 May 1561), youngest daughter of John Congreve, esquire, of Stretton, Staffordshire; they had one son, William Underhill (d.1597), and four daughters. After Ursula Congreve's death, William Underhill married Dorothy Hatton (d.1569), widow of Richard Newport of Hunningham, Warwickshire, and sister of Sir Christopher Hatton, by whom he had no issue. Career Sketch made in 1737 by George Vertue of New Place in Stratford upon Avon, sold to Shakespeare by Fulke Underhill's father in 1597 Sir Christopher Hatton, who purchased the wardship of Fulke Underhill's father Fulke Underhill's paternal grandfather, William Underhill (c.1523 – 31 March 1570), was an Inner Temple lawyer and clerk of assizes at Warwick, and a substantial property holder in Warwickshire. Among his holdings was the manor of Idlicote, which he purchased from Lodovic Greville. He also held a 21-year lease on the manor of Newbold Revel from Thomas Throckmorton. In 1567 he purchased New Place in Stratford upon Avon from William Bott, agent of William Clopton, esquire. In addition to these properties he held the manors of Loxley and Barton-on-the-Heath, 'together with other houses and lands in Stratford, Hollington, Hardwick, Meriden, Haselor, Drayton and Easinghall'. William Underhill died 31 March 1570, and was buried at Nether Ettington, where he and his first wife are commemorated by a marble monument. In his will he directed that his estates were not to be alienated by his heir save in circumstances of 'pressing need'. His three daughters were given marriage portions of five hundred pounds and a silver spoon apiece. His second daughter was given the wedding ring which had belonged to her stepmother, Dorothy Hatton, and his youngest daughter was given one of her mother Ursula Congreve's rings. William Underhill (d.1597), his only son and heir, was sixteen years of age at his father's death in 1570, and became a ward of the crown. His wardship was purchased in 1571 by his stepmother Dorothy's Hatton's brother, Sir Christopher Hatton. When he came of age in about 1575, William Underhill inherited his father's estates. Shortly thereafter he obtained licence to sell the manor of Loxley to Thomas Underhill, one of his cousins, and about that time married Mary Underhill (d.1590), another cousin. In 1579 he was imprisoned for recusancy, 'but being able to give an explanation to Burghley, was soon released'. In 1581, by reason of pressing financial circumstances, he was granted licence to alienate lands in Hollington and Meriden. In 1587 he was appointed escheator for Warwickshire and Leicestershire. In 1590 his wife, Mary, died. She was buried at Idlicote, and after her death he settled his estates in trust on his eldest son and heir, Fulke Underhill. In Easter term 1597 William Underhill sold New Place to William Shakespeare for £60 by final concord dated 4 May (see Shakespeare Birthplace Trust MS, Item 1, Case 8). At the time of the sale the property consisted of one messuage, two barns and two gardens with their appurtenances. = Father's death and after = In July 1597 William Underhill was poisoned at Fillongley near Coventry, and on 6 July made a nuncupative will, naming as executors George Shirley and Thomas Shirley of Staunton Harold, Leicestershire. He left all his lands to his eldest son, Fulke Underhill, £200 apiece to each of his younger sons, and £500 apiece to his daughters Dorothy and Valentine. He died 7 July, and was buried with his wife at Idlicote. According to Stopes, Fulke Underhill died without issue in May 1598, while still underage, leaving his brother Hercules as his heir, and was not at first suspected of having poisoned his father; however 'either through his own confession or the evidence of others, his guilt afterwards became known', and in 1602 the Court of Exchequer appointed a commission to 'obtain an account of the possessions of Fulke Underhill of Fillongley, county Warwick, felon, who had taken the life of his father, William Underhill, by poison'. As evidence that Fulke Underhill died at Warwick in May 1598, Stopes writes: > From Mr. Savage's \\"Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Nicholas, Warwick,\\" we > find that sixpence was received \\"for tolling the great bell for Vouckas > Underhill, May, 1598.\\" He was, however, buried at Idlicote. In contrast to Stopes, Schoenbaum states that the crime was discovered before Fulke Underhill's death, and that he was prosecuted for it and hanged at Warwick in 1599, and attainted of felony, whereby his estates escheated to the crown, which regranted them to his brother, Hercules Underhill, when he came of age in 1602. In Michaelmas term 1602, Hercules Underhill confirmed the sale of New Place to William Shakespeare by final concord; to obtain clear title, Shakespeare paid a fee equal to one quarter of the yearly value of the property, 'the peculiar circumstances of the case causing some doubt on the validity of the original purchase'.'Final Concord Between William Shakespeare and Hercules Underhill', World Digital Library Retrieved 29 December 2013.

The show chronicles the misguided attempts at parenthood of a disgraced music executive who transitions from the big city to suburbia. After she resigns from her job and her husband leaves her, Rudi Wilson becomes a single mother raising her two children, Apple and Dick, and must learn mothering duties. Longoria stars as the main character and serves as executive producer. Mother Up! premiered on November 6, 2013, with new episodes released on Wednesdays. It made its Canadian television debut on City on January 23, 2014, with new episodes aired on Saturday nights (during its first few weeks it was Thursday nights). The show was developed by Rogers Media and co-produced by Canadian companies Breakthrough Entertainment and Bardel Entertainment, in association with U.S.-based Mass Animation. The show marked Hulu's second foray into animated programming after The Awesomes. It was pitched as \\"Family Guy for women\\". In the Hulu version, the Mother Up! theme song, is performed by the wife of lead Slipknot singer, Corey Taylor. The series became available on Breakthrough Entertainment's YouTube channel in mid-2020. Characters=Wilson family= *Rudi Wilson (voiced by Eva Longoria) - The main character, a former music executive whose reputation is almost ruined after a scandal involving shooting kids in Central America with her client 2Bit. She preserves her reputation by transferring all of the blame to her boss, yet at the price of her job and her life in the city. Now she must live as a single suburban mother (her husband left her with two kids), despite being a terrible one. *Dick Wilson (voiced by Jesse Camacho) - Rudi's son, a loner whose only friend is Agnes Chu. He constantly gets bullied by Travis. In episode 1, Rudi throws him a 10th birthday party although Sarah says Dick and Apple's birthdays aren't for months, so Dick is probably 9 years old during the first season. *Apple Wilson (voiced by Rebecca Husain) - Rudi's daughter, she is quite imaginative, and longs for her mother's attention. In episode 6, Rudi says Apple is 5. *Jeffrey Wilson (voiced by Mark McKinney) - Rudi's former husband, father of Dick and Apple. =Chu family= *Mrs. Suzi Chu (voiced by Grace Lynn Kung) - One of the series' other antagonists; Jenny's friend. She drives her daughter Agnes to excessive studying. *Agnes Chu (voiced by Rebecca Husain) - A girl in Dick's grade, only she's in the gifted class. She attends sports camp every summer as her parents want her to be well-rounded. In episode 6 her mother says she is the youngest female Chess Master in the world (though Apple, enhanced by drugs, checkmates her) and Rudi estimates that Agnes is 10 years old. =Neighbours= *Sarah (voiced by Gabrielle Miller) - Rudi's friend and neighbor, a married mother of one. Sarah is very impressed by Rudi's high-power lifestyle and celebrity friends, and is easily convinced to \\"pick up the slack\\" in Rudi's parenting. Rudi plainly takes advantage of Sarah's good nature, but she takes the abuse like a trooper, in the name of friendship and for the good of Apple and Dick. In her heart she admires Rudi's life and attitude. *Fergus (voiced by Rebecca Husain) - Sarah's son (she calls him \\"Fergie\\"); Apple's friend. *Greg (voiced by Scott McCord) - Rudi's friend and other neighbor, a widowed father of one. Greg sees himself as a helper and potential suitor to Rudi, who walks all over him, but his eternal optimism fuels their friendship. He likes to do odd jobs for her and the community it also implied Greg is scared of his stepson Joel. *Joel (voiced by Zachary Bennett) - Greg's stepson. He hates adults, especially his stepdad Greg, perhaps because he misses his real dad. His mother died, so Greg inherited custody of him. Joel is a misanthropic goth/emo with extremely violent and anti-social tendencies, in sharp contrast to his easy-going, gregarious stepfather. He plays violent video games - only banned ones - while wearing diapers so he can play for long periods of time. =Faculty= *Principal Moxley (voiced by Helen Taylor) - Head of staff at the kids' school. In Episode 6, she threatens to call Child Protective Services because Rudi let Apple walk across the tightrope on school grounds, but backs down after Rudi says she will tell the police, the media, and the school's insurance company about the tightrope. *Nurse Higgins (voiced by Rebecca Husain) - The school's nurse and head of the drama department. She enjoys explaining diagnoses and stories in a theatrical manner, with costumes. *Miss Belfonte (voiced by Gabrielle Miller) - Apple's teacher. *Ernesto - The school janitor; Miss Belfonte often hits on him. =Others= *Jenny (voiced by Helen Taylor) - Rudi's enemy and one of the series' antagonists. She disapproves of Rudi's parenting, and is resentful that Rudi is the only person who ever stood up to her.

Performing in the Fred Astaire ballroom dance competitions, Rigg won multiple first place awards. She also starred in the play Toys in the Attic performed at the Hudson Guild in Manhattan in 1972. Early life and education Rigg was born in New York City on June 9, 1921 to Mabel LaVie Schultz and William Lightfoot Schultz. She grew up in Morristown, New Jersey and then Short Hills, New Jersey. Her father, William Schultz, founded Shulton Inc., the original maker of the Old Spice brand of deodorant. During her childhood, Rigg constructed a model airplane with a 12-foot wingspan in her family's basement. She also wrote letters about her aviation interests that she sent to aviator Amelia Earhart, President Herbert Hoover, and the U.S. War Department. The letters requested the creation of a U.S. Army Air Corps for women who could not afford to purchase their own planes.\\" In 1939, Rigg graduated from the Beard School in Orange, New Jersey (now Morristown-Beard School). After studying at the Juilliard School in New York City, she completed her bachelor's degree with a concentration in music at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York in 1943. During her time at Sarah Lawrence College, Rigg served as president of the Voice Club and vice president of the chorus.

Schultz Foundation Rigg served as the Vice President of the Schultz Foundation and as a member of its Board of Trustees. The family foundation provided financial support to medical and educational organizations, as well as other nonprofit organizations. In 1992, the Schultz Foundation gave $3 million to endow facilities for leukemia research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. That year, the Schultz Foundation also gave $10 million to construct a laboratory building for molecular biology at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.

She is also an intersex activist and writer, and former member of Intersex Society of North America. Holmes participated in the first public demonstration by intersex people, now marked by Intersex Awareness Day.  Early life  Holmes underwent a clitorectomy, described as a \\"clitoral recession\\", at age 7, at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. This surgery was undertaken because her clitoris \\"could become erect\\", and the surgery has affected her life ever since, including repeated pelvic exams, adolescent sexual experiences, fear of intimacy, and feelings of difference and embarrassment. Holmes describes how clinician \\"promises of sexual normalcy are not being met\\" by surgical intervention. Holmes refers to herself as \\"still intersexual\\" after medical intervention. Career= Activism = A member of the (now defunct) Intersex Society of North America, Holmes participated with Max Beck and others in the first North American demonstration about intersex issues, a 1996 demonstration as Hermaphrodites with Attitude outside the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Boston. The event is now commemorated internationally as Intersex Awareness Day. She participated in the second International Intersex Forum in 2012. = Academia = Holmes is a professor of sociology at Wilfrid Laurier University, Ontario, where she describes her academic interests as sexuality and queer theory, feminist thought; qualitative health research and law related to sexuality and health. Holmes has also extended her interest in intersex issues to other forms of bodily diversity, including disability.Dr. Morgan Holmes, Laurier Faculty of Arts  Works  Holmes is widely published, including works that link intersex to queer theory and ideas of compulsory heterosexuality. In Re-membering a Queer Body' (1994), Holmes describes how surgery on intersex infants is undertaken to make bodies conform to heterosexual norms: Holmes also problematizes this link, and in particular concepts of intersex as a third sex. In Locating Third Sexes (2004), Holmes argues that: Holmes also links the medical treatment of intersex bodies to the medical treatment of disabled bodies. In Rethinking the Meaning and Management of Intersexuality (2002), she argues that the surgical normalization of intersex infants is neither enhancement nor treatment. In Distracted Attentions: Intersexuality and Human Rights Protections (2005), she discusses the conceptualization of an intersex birth as an emergency, negating requirement for informed consent. In Mind the Gaps: Intersex and (Re- productive) Spaces in Disability Studies and Bioethics (June 2008) she argues that, while clinicians presume that \\"intersex characteristics are inherently disabling to social viability\\", recognition of the personhood of the intersex child necessitates refraining from \\"aggressive interference\\". The research notes trends to selectively terminate intersex fetuses. In her book Intersex: A Perilous Difference (2008) Holmes argues that there is a duty to understand the stakes involved in conflating what is supposedly 'natural' with what is statistically 'normal', and of what is 'normal' with what is 'healthy'.\\" Holmes reviews medical literature and popular culture to examine how society constructs monstrosity. She \\"singles out\\" the novel Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides, \\"and episodes of The X-Files for constructing intersex characters whose lives essentially reproduce the social fascination with the monstrous and the deviant.\\" In The Intersex Enchiridion: Naming and Knowledge in the Clinic (2011), Holmes argues that the replacement of the word \\"intersex\\" with \\"disorders of sex development\\" in clinical settings \\"reinstitutionalises clinical power to delineate and silence those marked by the diagnosis\\" and \\"that this silencing is precisely the point of the new terminology.\\" In 2009, Holmes edited Critical Intersex, a collection of essays on intersex issues, including theoretical and empirical research. The book has been described as \\"an important book\\" (Anne Fausto-Sterling), \\"the 'go to source' for a contemporary, international representation of intersex studies,\\" making \\"contributions that are precise, plainly written and very illuminating... the detail is fascinating and somewhat unnerving... beautifully clear and compassionate\\" (Contemporary Sociology), and \\"an important collection\\" (Suzanne Kessler, State University of New York). Holmes has also written on her experience as an activist, including during her membership in the Intersex Society of North America. The essay When Max Beck and Morgan Holmes went to Boston, provides an account of the participation by Holmes in the first public demonstration by intersex people, on October 26, 1996, an event that took place following the activists' exclusion from a clinical conference.

Cory in the House was developed by Handheld Games Corporation and published by Disney Interactive Studios. Gameplay and plot Cory in the House is an adventure game that requires the player to play as Cory Baxter, a teenager who lives with his father Victor Baxter after Victor gets accepted as head chef at The White House. The basic premise for the game is Cory, after winning a toy contest, starts an endeavor to sell bobbleheads depicting the President of the United States to the citizens of Washington, D.C.. The bobbleheads are taken into possession by The Evil Toymaker, who tries to utilize the bobbleheads as a means of hypnotic technology on the population of Washington, D.C. Cory is tasked with retrieving the bobbleheads to stop the hypnosis plan. The gameplay is an adventure stealth game, where the player controls Cory and his friends as they move through locations including halls in The White House, a school, a mall, and streets of Washington, D.C. Tasks involve sneaking past Secret Service agents, examining rooms for specific items, throwing pastries at hypnotized teachers, and talking to non-playable characters. Additional features include mini-games, which involve tapping the Nintendo DS stylus against the touchscreen along with music or simulating connecting electrical circuits.http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/company/42302-handheld-games Reception Cory in the House was critically panned, earning an overall score of 35% out of 100 on aggregate review website GameRankings. IGN's Jack DeVries criticized the gameplay controls, calling them \\"clunky\\" and \\"hard to control\\", and found fault with the game's included laugh track that goes along with the dialogue sequence jokes. Review website Game Boyz excoriated the game's gameplay, graphics, and sound, concluding that not even hardcore fans of the Cory in the House television series would appreciate it. Due to satirical reviews on Metacritic in relation to an internet meme mockingly describing the show as an \\"anime\\" series, the game has an average user score of 9.5, making it one of the highest user-rated DS games on the site.

Elaine Bay is in the Tawhitinui Reach (a branch of the main section of Pelorus Sound), which includes other bays such as Tennyson Inlet, Fitzroy Bay and Hallum Cove. The bay is accessed by the Elaine Bay Road, which connects with the Croisilles- French Pass Road at the top of the ridge. Attractions There is a Department of Conservation Campsite situated right on the water's edge.http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/conservation- campsites-by-region/marlborough/sounds-area/elaine-bay/ The beach in Elaine Bay is mostly rocky, with some small patches of gravel. Despite this, it is popular for swimming, as it has multiple wharfs and a swimming platform. All of these structures are maintained by Elaine Bay Aquaculture. There are also a couple of walking tracks: the Piwakawaka Track, which is an easy hour and a half return, and goes around to the next bay which has a golden beach that is perfect for picnicking and swimming; and the Archer Track, which is 4 hrs return, and connects Elaine Bay to Penzance Bay via a wide, well-used track which provides great views of spectacular scenery. There are also sea kayaks available for hire within the bay. Elaine Bay is fed by a number of streams, and this creates a very rich ecosystem. Schools of fish such as herrings, kahawai and mackerel are found in great numbers. There are also a large number of birds including cormorants (known as shags) and weka. This diversity of wildlife, typical of the Marlborough Sounds, provides a rich fishing environment. There is also a boat ramp, moorings and small dock, which provide easy access to boating opportunities. Industry Elaine Bay hosts a small fishing and aquaculture port. Many smaller fishing vessels and large mussel boats regularly dock at the port. The main product is green lipped mussels, for which Pelorus Sound and its main port Havelock are famous. Many of the surrounding bays contain mussel farms, which are a large employer for the region. There is also a small forestry industry in Elaine Bay. Since the 1970s areas of Pelorus have a planted in exotic pine forest for timber. The Archer Track goes through some of this logging forest. Access The bay is accessed by the Elaine Bay Road, which is off Croisilles-French Pass Road. This road connects to , and the turn off is just north of Rai Valley. The road is paved all the way through to Elaine Bay, because of the trucks regularly accessing the Port. Settlement Apart from a few permanent residents, the settlement at Elaine Bay consists mostly of baches, small holiday homes.

Before the Civil War, the site was owned and used by the St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Association, which at the time was located on the outskirts of St. Louis. The barracks was used primarily as a training facility for Union soldiers attached to the Western Division of the Union Army. After the Battle of Lexington, the Post and Convalescent Hospitals were added to the training barracks, in order to assist in treating hundreds of incoming wounded troops. Once the war ended, the barracks was dismantled, returning to its pre-war, civilian use as a fairground and race track. Nothing of the original barracks remains at this site today. History Portrait of African American Union soldier at Benton Barracks In 1861, Major-General John C. Frémont assumed command of the Western Department of War for the Union Army. General Frémont ordered the establishment of a training barracks at the site of the St. Louis Fairgrounds. The barracks originally consisted of five buildings, 740 ft. in length and 40 ft. in width. Additionally, there was a two-story building erected for the headquarters of the Barracks Commander. The barracks could accommodate up to 30,000 soldiers. By 1863, Benton contained over a mile of barracks, as well as warehouses, cavalry stables, parade grounds, and a large military hospital. The hospital was built from the converted amphitheater on the fairground site and could accommodate 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers at a time. During the Civil War, under the administration of Emily Elizabeth Parsons, it was the largest hospital in the West. Parsons recorded many of her experiences at Benton Barracks in her memoir.Fearless Purpose: Memoir of Emily Elizabeth Parsons, Little Brown and Company, 1880 Another nurse at Benton Barracks, Belle Coddington, wrote about her memories of the hospital in an 1895 reminiscence.

Radio Times rated the film poorly, giving it two out of 5 stars. Synopsis When a group of thrill- seeking young adults BASE jump into a forbidden portion of the Tasmanian wilderness, they didn't foresee that one of their group would die in the process. They also didn't expect for their friend's blood to awaken ancient and gigantic Tasmanian devils that would swiftly seek to make them their supper. The group finds some assistance in two park rangers that arrive to arrest the group for trespassing, only to find that they too are in danger of becoming the deadly beasts' prey. One by one people start to die. Whitford is killed by one of the monsters. Then Danz dies next. The rest of the group tries to plan out an idea. In the last part of the movie, Alex reveals that her younger brother died falling from a high tree and that's why she is afraid of heights. In the end, Jayne and Alex share a kiss and survive.

As long as there are customers who are allowed to consume alcohol, Mustapha is free to go on with his business. But when Moroccan Jews are starting to immigrate to the new state of Israel, and as the town is emptied of its Jewish community, Mustapha is terrified about having to close his business.

Miller was uninsured at the time of the accident, but Medicaid paid for the majority of the $1 million in hospitalization and rehabilitation costs.http://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/rep-josh-miller-has-received-millions- in-government-assistance-opposes-medicaid-expansion-in- arkansas/Content?oid=3220760 Coincidentally, Miller's father suffered from muscular atrophy and was in a wheelchair for many years. His father convinced Miller that he too could live a full life. Miller serves on the Governor's Commission for People with Disabilities. Miller graduated in 1999 from Heber Springs High School and thereafter earned an associate degree from the Arkansas State University campus at Heber Springs. He is a Baptist. Political Life From 2009 to 2012, Miller was a member of the Heber Springs City Council. In 2012, Miller won the Republican state House primary over Phillip D. \\"Phil\\" Grace (also born 1981), a Cleburne County justice of the peace from Heber Springs, 1,653 (56.4 percent) to 1,279 (43.6 percent). In the general election, he defeated the Democrat Jeffery M. \\"Jeff\\" Pistole of Clinton in Van Buren County, 7,493 (65 percent) to 4,032 (35 percent). Miller serves on these House committees: (1) State Agencies and Governmental Affairs and (2) Public Transportation. Miller in 2013 voted to establish a spending cap on the state budget and co-sponsored a measure to amend state income tax rates. He joined as a co-sponsor the required majority to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He supported related legislation to ban abortion whenever a fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He co-sponsored legislation to allow officers of universities and religious institutions to carry concealed weapons. He supported legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He voted to establish a tiered system for lottery scholarships. Miller did not vote on the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. Despite his past personal reliance on Medicaid, Miller opposes Medicaid expansion in Arkansas under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Description The tribune was completed in 1841 and built within the first floor of the Science Museum of La Specola in Florence. The tribune was built by orders of Leopold II (1797-1870). The House of Lorraine- Habsburg was foreign to Tuscany; and the embrace of Galileo can be seen as an attempt to co-opt local patriotism. It contains a large statue of Galileo and a series of lunettes and frescoes depicting events in scientific history relating to Florence. It once contained some of his original instruments such as his geometric and military compass, an armed loadstone, two telescopes, and the objective lens of the telescope with which Galileo discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter. The tribune is generally not open to the public.Museo Galileo website. The tribune consists mainly of two rooms: a square vaulted hall, and an adjacent square room glass-metal dome. The dome allows light to shine over a marble statue of Galileo by Aristodemo Costoli. The surrounding niches have busts of famous pupils of Galileo: Benedetto Castelli, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Evangelista Torricelli, and Vincenzo Viviani. Medallions in the adjacent hall commemorate the patrons. The frescoes on the walls depict: *Leonardo da Vinci before the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza (by Nicola Cianfanelli) *Galileo demonstrates the Laws of Gravity to the Medici (by Giuseppe Bezzuoli) *Galileo observes the lamp-pendulum of the Duomo of Pisa (by Luigi Sabatelli) *Galileo presents the telescope to the Senate of Venice (by Luigi Sabatelli) *Galileo, blind and old, converses with disciples (by Luigi Sabatelli) *Session of Experiments at the Accademia del Cimento (by Gasparo Martellini) *Alessandro Volta demonstrates his experimental battery to Napoleon (design by Cianfanelli, completed by Martellini). Ultimately, this is an odd architectural assembly. The layout has a distant resemblance to a church dome and nave; however, if so, this is a temple granting hagiographical attention to a secular scientist. It contains modern touches, such as the iron dome, but it also adheres to retardataire Neoclassic elements in the niches, arches, and columns. The arrangement suggests a tardy apology to Galileo by an aristocracy which had been slow to freely embrace his pioneering spirit of Enlightenment. It took two centuries for Florentines to honor their greatest scientist with a building. But that is not surprising, they had also been slow to bury Galileo inside a church. After his death in 1642, his interment in the main body of the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, was abandoned when papal authorities protested.

A decade later when Harpy UAVs were returned to Israel for upgrade under contract, Israel had to nullify the contract under intense US pressure. As a result, China developed its own upgrade of Harpy after they were returned by Israel to China without the planned upgrade. This Chinese development of Harpy was publicized in April 2011 by China Central Television. The most obvious external visual distinction between Norinco Harpy and its Israeli predecessor is that the Chinese version has two different types of warheads, suggesting each covers different homing frequencies. In addition, the launcher of Chinese version has only six cells instead of the original eighteen cells of Israeli version.

However, pesticides are still necessary, and it was discovered that it is very inefficient to spray the plants manually, so a more efficient method was needed. The cooperative discovered that the most cost-effective method of applying pesticide is crop dusting by UAVs, and as a result, it developed its own unmanned helicopter to meet the crop dusting need.

Owen international competition of philately held in Miami. Later he joined the Music Conservatory of Ramos Mejía, Buenos Aires, where he studied guitar and classical singing. In 1975 he was awarded a scholarship sponsored by the Rotary Club of Morón to continue his studies of music and French opera in Paris; the scholarship was rejected to continue studying for a law career at the University of Buenos Aires.  Controversies  In 2006, a group of relatives of victims of the nightclub fire in Cromañón Republic (Buenos Aires) filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS on Eduardo Feinman and his boss, the television entrepreneur Daniel Hadad, due to coverage by Channel 9 and Radio 10.«Hadad, Feinmann y dos consultores, acusados ante la OEA», artículo en Radiodifusión Data del 13 de marzo de 2006.

In September 2009, during picketing at Cordoba Avenue and Junín (Buenos Aires), several university students blocked the street in support of the workers of the Kraft Foods company (formerly Terrabusi) who had been dismissed, causing gridlock of vehicles. Feinman had an exchange with Cristian Henkel (president of the University Federation of Buenos Aires), arguing that students were violating the constitutional right to free movement: In September 2010, the journalist left his Twitter account, accusing its members of \\"mediocrity\\" due to a great quantity of insults he had received, and the disapproval and rejection his comments had generated in the community.«Eduardo Feinmann se fue de Twitter dando un portazo». In December 2013, Feinmann lost another court case that he had filed as plaintiff against Google and Yahoo search engines. The journalist asked for an injunction to have search engine results blocked from access to his profile on social network Taringa and the corresponding encyclopedia entry on Wikipedia. The judgment on appeal (as a result of the appeal by the plaintiff) found that \\"to grant the requested injunction would be a restriction of thought mind restrict - in the described circumstances, in looking for, finding and disseminating information and ideas, a right guaranteed by the National Constitution, the International Covenants that are a part of it, and law 26.032, and would limit free debate that is enabled internet, that is elemental in a democratic and republican system.\\" In particular, regarding the Wikipedia article, the Court sustained the \\"development of a series of descriptions of different events in which the named individual has participated in his role as a journalist, and radio and TV host.

He served ten years as Minister of Education and two years as the Minister of Health and Housing.  Early life  Badi-ud-din Mahmud was born in Matara, a town in the south of Sri Lanka. He was born into one of the most distinguished Sri Lankan Moor families of that time as the youngest of twelve siblings. His father was S.L.M. Mahmud Naina Marikkar Mathicham, better known as Matara Mahatmaya, who was an affluent planter and landed proprietor; Badi- ud-din Mahmud's mother was Fathima Natchiya. Mahmud was educated in his childhood at St. Thomas' College, and Wesley College, Colombo. He completed his higher education at Zahira College, Colombo, with the completion of his Cambridge Senior Examination. At Zahira College, he took interest in literature, tennis, and athletics. He was raised in a strictly religious atmosphere with traditional Islamic values. However, his family produced a liberal atmosphere.  Muslim League  He first joined the All-Ceylon Muslim League{ in 1927 as a secretary. Originally a small movement, in three months it grew into the most powerful Muslim organization in Ceylon. The All-Ceylon Muslim League helped unite Muslim leaders such as Tuan Burhanudeen Jayah who were previously at odds with each other. Mahmud was also dedicated to social work. He delivered the first talk on Radio Ceylon during the festival of Hajj, organizing the recital of Takbir to precede his speech. He also initiated the Hajj prayers at Galle Face Green in 1928, which have become an annual feature, and engaged in the promotion of a public mass meeting at Galle Face Green to celebrate the birthday of Muhammad.  Aligarh Muslim University  Mahmud was further educated at Aligarh Muslim University from 1931 to 1937. He excelled in both academics and extracurricular activities. His most prominent achievements include ranking second in the Inter-Arts Examination in the First Division, and obtaining a B.A. as the top performer in the examination. Some of his other accomplishments were the gold medal of the All-India Public Speaking Competition, the Aligarh – The Oxford Meston Prize in 1937 for outstanding debating ability, and being appointed editor of the university's magazine for two successive years. In 1935, he was unanimously elected president of the U.P. University Students Federation. He presided over the All-India Students Conventions at Lucknow and organized the All-India Students Movement. Mohammad Habib, a professor and provost of Mahmud, described his pupil: While he was enrolled at Aligarh, Mahmud persuaded Muslim leaders in the Second Round Table Conference at London to support the Indian independence movement; the people that he persuaded included Shaukat Ali, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Muhammad Shafi, Zafar Ali Khan, Syed Mahmud, Bacha Khan, Mirza Ismail, and Syed Sultan Ahmed.  Reforms  On Mahmud's arrival in Sri Lanka from Aligarh, the Muslim League organized a highly attended reception to him. Well-known figures at the meeting included Mohamed Macan Markar, T. B. Jayah, and N.H.M. Abdul Cader. In 1938, Badi-ud- din Mahmud gave a speech at the birthday celebrations of Muhammad at Galle Face Green. He urged the Muslims of Sri Lanka to learn the Sinhala language because it would be the only official language after Sri Lanka became independent. His prediction was correct. Mahmud furthered his reasoning: The Muslim community received his proposal negatively. In the same year, Badi-ud- din Mahmud organized one of the largest demonstrations of the time among Muslims, a mass rally at Galle Face Green in support of the Arabs in Palestine. He delivered a speech to urge the government of Britain to fulfill its promises to Arabs in Palestine. He helped develop an independent school called Zahira College in Gampola as the first principal. Under his leadership, it grew from a small school consisting of four classrooms, a shed, 67 students, and five teachers to a school that serves the entirety of Sri Lanka with up-to-date facilities. In 1960, Zahira College enrolled over 2000 students. Mahmud developed a uniform of pajamas, frocks, and a dupatta (scarf) for girls at Zahira College; it is now widely accepted in Muslim schools in Sri Lanka but was at first rejected by most. In the classroom, he introduced traditional Islamic cultural activities, which also evoked opposition at first. ReferencesExternal links *Mahmud, Badiuddin (Dr. Al Haj) M.P.

Some lizards, such as yakka skinks (Egernia rugosa) and thorny devils use dedicated defecation sites. European rabbits may deposit their pellets both randomly over the range and at communal latrine sites.Sneddon I.A. Latrine use by the European rabbit (Oryctolagus-Cuniculus). J Mammal 1991;72:769–775 Function and impact=Territoriality= Middens and other types of defecation sites may serve as territorial markers. Elaborate \\"dungpile rituals\\" are reported for adult stallions, and deer bucks,George B. Schaller, \\"The Deer and the Tiger\\", p. 164 which are thought to serve for confrontation avoidance. In contrast, female and young animals exhibit no such behavior. =Sanitation= Dedicated defecation sites are thought to be the result of sanitation-driven behavior. For example, spider mite Stigmaeopsis miscanthi constructs woven nests, and nest members defecate at only one site inside the nest.Yukie Sato, Yutaka Saito, \\"Nest Sanitation in Social Spider Mites: Interspecific Differences in Defecation Behavior\\", Dedicated latrine areas observed by free-roaming horses mean that grazing area is kept parasite-free. Even stabled horses seem to have vestiges of such behavior. Herbivoral livestock is at risk of parasite/pathogen exposure from feces during grazing, therefore there is an interest in research of livestock behavior in presence of feces both of their own species, and others, including wildlife, including the dependence on defecation patterns.\\"Livestock grazing behavior and inter- versus intraspecific disease risk via the fecal–oral route\\" =Ecological impact= Latrines of herbivores, such as antelopes, play an important role in ecology by providing enrichment of certain areas in nutrients. It is described that duiker and steenbok antelopes tended to defecate in exposed sites, generally on very sandy soil, while klipspringer preferred rocky outcrops, thus enriching the nutrient-deficient areas, as well as depositing plant seed there. =Raccoon latrines= A common nuisance of raccoons is raccoon latrines (raccoon toilets), which may contain eggs of the roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis. Nuisance raccoon latrines may be found in attics, on flat roofs, on logs, in yards and sandboxes, etc.\\"Raccoon Latrines: Identification and Clean-up\\", a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage Use in research In addition to immediate research of animal behavior and biology, animal toilets and coprolites are an instrument of research for not directly related purposes in biology, ecology, paleontology climate research, and other areas. They provide various information: plant habitats, historical information about prehistoric life and climate, etc.\\"50,000 Year Old Animal Toilet Offers Clues To Climate Change History\\", International Business Times, February 19, 2013 Animal latrine associates Some fungi are animal latrine associates. For example, Hebeloma radicosum is an ammonia fungus which associates with latrines of moles, wood mice, and shrews. There is a curious association of Cucumis humifructus (\\"aardvark cucumber\\" or \\"aardvark pumpkin\\") with latrines of aardvarks. C. humifructus produces its fruit underground, the aardvark burrows for them, and then deposits its seeds in dunghills near its habitat. The distribution of C. humifructus tends to match that of aardvark latrines. Some insects (e.g., termites and dung beetles) feed on animal excrement and hence are natural associates of dung sites.

The character, a vampire cow, was created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Frank Brunner. She made her first appearance in Giant-Size Man-Thing #5 (1975). Publication history Bessie, or Hellcow, made her official debut in Giant-Size Man-Thing #5, published in August 1975. The creative team in charge of the issue comprised writer Steve Gerber, penciller Frank Brunner, and inker Tom Palmer. The same story is reprinted in the bonus pages of Silver Surfer vs. Dracula (February 1994).

Fictional character biography Circa 1675, Bessie, a domesticated cow living in a Swiss farm, becomes the prey of Count Dracula, who is unable to find any available humans to feed on. Bessie seemingly dies and an upset Hans, her owner, lays her to rest. Unbeknownst to Hans, Bessie has become an undead monster known as Hellcow, and rises from her grave some three nights later, in search of Dracula to take revenge on him.Giant-Size Man-Thing #5 In the present day, Howard the Duck is investigating the deaths of four farmers in Cleveland, Ohio. Howard initially concludes that the perpetrator must be a chicken. Later, in the wee hours of the morning, he disguises himself as a human. Hellcow notices him and lunges for him. A scuffle commences and Howard prevails, driving a stake through her heart and apparently ending her reign of terror. However, Hellcow did not die; her head was still intact. Her corpse is recovered by insane scientist Doctor Kilgore. Reviving her, Kilgore imprisons Hellcow and collects her \\"vampiric milk\\", which he believes he can exploit to cure his tuberculosis as well as attain immortality. When this plan does not fully work, Kilgore abducts Deadpool and extracts his hypophysis. Kilgore digests it, so as to give himself the power of self-healing that Deadpool has. However, the mixture of Hellcow's milk and Deadpool's gland in Kilgore's body goes awry, driving him even more crazy. The vampire cow and the mercenary join forces; Hellcow turns Deadpool into a vampire temporarily and together they rid Kilgore from the world permanently. Deadpool and Hellcow escape from Kilgore's abode but the latter is instantly burnt to a crisp as it is daytime.

Powers and abilities Before becoming a vampire, Bessie could produce more milk than the average cow and hence was well-favored by her owner. As Hellcow, she possesses characteristics tantamount to that of Dracula's, such as being able to suck blood from humans and being immortal. She could transform into a half-cow, half-bat form, enabling her to fly, and she could also disappear into nothingness by taking up the form of gas. She also had superbovine strength and agility.

He was born in 1801 in Krefeld, Germany. Hermès originally established his business as a saddle company in 1837. His first workshop showcased jewelry, home decor items, and silk scarves. His father Thierry Hermès originated from France and his mother, Agnese Kuhnen originated from Germany. He lost his family due to disease and moved to Paris in 1821. After his death in 1878, his son and grandsons Charles-Emile Hermès, Adolphe Hermès and Emile-Maurice, continued to run the family business. Early life Thierry Hermès was born in 1801 in the city of Krefeld, which at the time was part of Napoleon's empire, earning Hermès French citizenship. He was the sixth child of his parents who were innkeepers. After he lost his entire family to disease and war, he moved to France in 1821 as an orphan. Using his gift in leatherworking, he opened his saddle and harness shop in 1837 located in the Paris neighborhood known as Grands Boulevard. Career In 1837, Thierry Hermès founded the Hermès company as a manufacturer of horse harnesses on the Rue Basse du Rempart in Paris. Hermès specialized in the horse harnesses required by society traps, caleches, and carriages. He built his business on the strength of a stitch that could only be done by hand. The saddle stitch was completed when two needles worked two waxed linen threads in tensile opposition. After opening up his shop, his clients were the rich which included: the Parisian beau monde and European royalty, the emperor Napoleon III and his empress, Eugenie. The business soon went from harness and saddles to trunks, handbags, and zippers. Children  Hermès had one son with his wife Christine Pétronille Pierrart (1805-1896) who they named Charles-Emile. Charles-Emile had two sons of his own, Adolphe and Emile-Maurice, who were involved in the family business building elite clientele in Europe, North Africa, Russia, America, and Asia. After Hermès started his harness company, his son Charles-Emile Hermès took over the family business moving the store to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This meant that the store was in proximity to wealthy clients. Adolphe left Emile with the business because he believed that the company didn't have a long future in the era of carriages. Emile-Maurice noticed the demand for saddlery, leading him to direct Hermès to make \\"saddle stitched\\" leather goods and trunks for the customers who traveled by car, train, ship. After realizing the company was diving into the age of automobiles, Emile- Maurice acquired a two-year patent for the zipper which was known as the \\"Hermès Fastener.\\" Once the zipper was introduced, the clothing era was transformed. Other businesses such as Coco Chanel wanted to learn from them due to their rapid growth and popularity. Emile Hermès' sons- in-law, Robert Dumas-Hermès (1898-1978) and Jean-René Guerrand-Hermès (1901-1993) took over the company in 1950. The contributions from his children and grandchildren influenced the company.\\" In 1993, the company went public but 80 percent of the shares were controlled by Hermès family members.  Legacy  Hermès has many innovations which are still known to this day. The Hermès zipper founded in 1923 is used in many of the bags today. The silk Hermès used for jockeys' blouses developed the first silk scarf, \\"Jeu des Omnibus et Dames blanches\\" in 1923. Around the 1930s, Hermès International launched several items that became classics, including the large crocodile handbag known later as the Kelly, named for Grace Kelly. The company later developed men's neckties, watches, and new scarf designs. Today, Hermès features products like charms (starting at $40) and an oversize panda-bear bean-bag made of Clémnce bull-calf leather (most expensive at $100,000). One of the known classics, the Birkin, was named after actress Jane Birkin and created by Jean-Louis Dumas in 1984. Today, Hermès has 283 stores worldwide. Since 1923, Hermès has a color theme every year for their collections, creating limited edition items like the \\"Year of the River\\" (2005) silk scarf.

Terry attended Winston-Salem State University where he was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the fifth round (104 pick overall) during the 1978 NBA Draft, but was waived before playing in a game. He then took his talents to the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) where he played for the popular Toyota team, which he led to a conference championship (1978 PBA Invitational Conference). Two years later he signed with the Bullets. After his playing career was abruptly done, Terry's life was never the same. Alcoholism and drugs took over; in fact, in January 1989, Terry was convicted of cocaine distribution. Just two months later, at the age of 32, he was killed in a high-speed car crash on the Capital Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland. Police said that Terry had been drinking and was speeding.

He was paternal grandson of Aeneas Mackay, a famous Edinburgh lawyer. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and King's College, London, where he gained distinction in divinity and history. He went on to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1862, proceeding MA in 1865, and then at Heidelberg University, completing his legal curriculum at the University of Edinburgh, where he was one of the first to obtain the degree of LL.B. Mackay was admitted advocate at the Scottish bar in 1864, and attained repute in consultation. He devoted time to studies in law and history, and in 1874 he succeeded Cosmo Innes as professor of constitutional law and history in the University of Edinburgh. In 1881 Mackay was appointed advocate-depute and resigned the professorship.

The song was written by the band's dual lead guitarists, Bill Spooner and Roger Steen with Michael Evans (later a sales manager at Ingram Entertainment and VP at Sony Pictures). It has been called “absurd anthem of wretched excess,” ridiculing the rich and famous offspring of Hollywood elite. The song became the group's rock anthem and spectacular closing number to their elaborate stage shows. The band developed a cult-like fan base that has followed them for decades. Known for frequent costume changes, the group's lead singer Fee Waybill plays the character of Quay Lewd, a take off on Quaalude, a drugged out British rock star wearing two-foot tall platform shoes, a feather boa and a long blonde wig. In his early career as a choreographer, Kenny Ortega would add elements to try to make every show more spectacular. There were explosions, smoke, chainsaws and a daredevil aerial artist. Among the barely-dressed dancers and characters were Jane Dornacker and Pearl E. Gates. Even up and coming local actor/comedian Robin Williams auditioned for the show.

Rope lights can be used in many applications both indoors and outdoors. Used in place of neon signs, it is sometimes called soft neon.  Design  The design of a rope light generally depends on the end use of the product. * Wiring: The basic design involves stringing together bulbs on a wire and then encasing the wire in a clear plastic jacket. The number of wires depends on the functionality required of the rope light. A basic rope light has two wires, which generally allows users to make bulbs dim or flash. However, a rope light with three wires allows greater functionality including chasing, dimming and flashing. * Tube: The outer plastic tube is also an important feature that greatly affects the end use of any rope light. A rope light with relatively wider plastic tubing is more durable to external elements but less flexible. Thinner plastic tubing, on the other hand, is far more flexible but less robust. Generally, rope lights for heavy use outdoors feature thicker plastic casings while those used for more decorative purposes indoors have relatively thin plastic casings. * Voltage: Rope lights in the United States are generally sold in three different voltages: 12 volts, 24 volts and 120 volts. Generally, the 12 volts and 24 volts variants are better suited for situations where a battery is used to power the lights. Hence, this is the best option for cars, boats, etc. The 120-volt version is more appropriate for household or industrial lighting requirements.  LED and incandescent rope lights compared  * Bulbs: LED rope lights have bulbs that are available in different colors and the bulbs themselves generate the colors. In contrast, incandescent rope lights typically have bulbs with a colored filter that is applied around the bulb. Therefore, when an LED rope light is switched off, it appears colorless, while incandescent bulbs still appear colored. * Power consumption and performance: LED rope lights require far less energy than incandescent rope lights and generate comparatively less heat. LED bulbs use about 1 watt per foot in power while a traditional rope light uses close to 3 watts of light per foot. In general, LED rope lights are rated for 100,000 hours while a comparative incandescent rope light is rated for 25,000 hours.  Applications  Many brands of rope lights are rated for either or both indoor and outdoor use. Due to the versatility of this lighting technology, it can be used in a variety of different environments without compromising the quality of the lighting. * Indoor lighting: Rope lights are used for both decorative and practical lighting purposes. Common indoor uses include outlining the edge of a kitchen counter or bar, comprehensive ceiling lighting and under-lighting the baseboards in a movie theater. Rope lights also suit a room with no permanent layout like a garage, attic or children's rooms, where it can provide comprehensive lighting throughout the entire room regardless of how things are arranged. Users who want to add ambient lighting also use rope lights, in areas like the TV/gaming room, bedroom and bathroom. * Outdoor lighting: Outdoor uses for rope lights include staircase lighting, outdoor patio or deck lighting and outdoor artistic displays. Rope lights are durable and suitable for use around the garden, pool, driveway, shed, etc. During holiday seasons, lights can be used to create messages or designs with different colors and patterns.

He is credited with seminal work in areas ranging from robot motion planning and control, human-friendly robot design, to haptic interaction and human motion synthesis. His work's emphasis has been to develop theories, algorithms, and technologies, that control robot systems by using models of their physical dynamics. These dynamic models are used to derive optimal controllers for complex robots that interact with the environment in real-time. Life Khatib received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Sup’Aero, Toulouse, France, in 1980. He then joined the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and has been a member of the faculty there ever since. He is presently the director of the Stanford Robotics Laboratory, and a member of the Stanford University Bio-X Initiative. Work=Academic work= Khatib's first seminal contribution was the artificial potential field method, which avoids the complex robot motion planning problem by projecting controlling robots with potential fields in task space. First introduced in 1978, the method was motivated by the pressing need to enable reactive robot operation in unstructured environments, and it has since been adopted and extended by a growing number of researchers in a wide range of areas and applications in robotics, graphics, vision, and animation. Khatib, with Sean Quinlan, later proposed the elastic band model, which provided a robot planner with the ability to adjust and modify its planned motions during execution while efficiently detecting potential collisions using a sphere hierarchy. Khatib's next contribution was the operational space formulation in 1980, which avoids controlling robots joint- by-joint and instead formulates the robot dynamics, performance analysis, and control in the very space where the task is specified. When used with an accurate inertial dynamic model, this method solves the problem of joint motion coordination in a kinetic energy optimal manner. Since the 1980s, Khatib and his lab have made fundamental advances in macro-mini robots (serial structures), cooperative robots (parallel structures), dexterous dynamic coordination, virtual linkages to model internal forces in cooperative manipulation, posture and whole body control, dynamic task decoupling, optimal control, human-robot compliant interaction, elastic strips for real-time path planning, human motion synthesis, and human-friendly robot design. Khatib's contributions also span the field of haptic interaction and dynamic simulation. His work with Diego Ruspini in haptic rendering established some of the basic foundations for haptic explorations of virtual environments—the virtual proxy for haptics rendering, haptic shading, texture, and collision detection. This founding work was pursued with Francois Conti to address the display of deformable objects, the expansion of workspace for spanning large volumes with small haptic devices, and the efficient and safe hybrid actuation of haptic devices, with numerous applications including ultrasound examination in pregnancy The Khatib group's present day interests include modeling human motor control, muscle actuated control, humanoid robotics, haptics in neuroimaging, and multi-contact control. ;Memberships *President of the International Foundation for Robotics Research (IFRR) *Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) =Robots= Khatib is holding a novel muscle actuated robot arm that uses a hybrid pneumatic muscle and electrical motor actuation mechanism. ; Stanford Robotics Platforms (Romeo and Juliet) In the mid 1990s, Khatib's lab focused their efforts towards developing robot manipulation in a human environment. The Stanford Robotics Platforms, developed in the process, were the first fully integrated holonomic mobile manipulation platforms and were later known as Romeo and Juliet. This effort gave birth to a commercial holonomic mobile robot, the Nomad XR4000,Nomad XR4000 Robot by Nomadic Technologies. The models and algorithms resulting from this project established the basis for his later exploration of humanoid robotics like the Honda ASIMO. ;Haptic fMRI Interface (HFI) Developed in 2013 by Samir Menon, Gerald Brantner, and Chris Aholt under Khatib's supervision, HFI is a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) compatible haptic interface with three degrees-of-freedom.Haptic fMRI Interface The interface allows subjects to perform virtual haptic tasks inside the entire bore of an MRI machine, and is lightweight and transparent to enable high fidelity neuroscience experiments. Khatib's group has successfully demonstrated real-time closed-loop haptic control during a high resolution fMRI scan with low enough noise levels to enable single subject analyses without smoothing.

After many years of relative obscurity as an artist, Hou Chun- Ming’s quick ascent into the art world began in April 2007 when Hong Kong Sotheby’s auctioned his graphic artwork Erotic Paradise. Although it was not considered a favorite, it nevertheless sold for $480,000 HKD, twelve times over the starting bid. New Paradise & God Hates You were each sold for over $1 million HKD and Anecdotes About Spirits and Immortals sold for a record $2.64 million HKD, the highest international auction price ever commanded by a contemporary Taiwan artist.  Biography  Hou Chun-Ming was born on January 10, 1963 in Liuchiao Town, Jia Yi County in Taiwan. In 1982, he entered the Department of Fine Arts, National Art Academy and won the first prize in the National Oil Painting Exhibition in 1983.“Sharing of Corporeal Body” by Gong Zuo-Jun(http://www.itpark.com.tw/people/essays_data/162/604), Modern Art bi- monthly, 2009. After graduating from college in 1987, he became a prolific painter. In his representative painting of that era: The Intestine Sutra series, he attempted to magnify the conflict between “sex” and “folk lore” within his art. In 1988, Hou's work Little Women was showcased at the Busan International Biennale in Korea. In 1990, Hou's Mythology & Desire Punishment were well received by critics. But what really shot him into the mainstream was Anecdotes about Spirits and Immortals. The title of Anecdotes about Spirits and Immortals was inspired by the name of Gan Bao's book In Search of the Supernatural. His creativity was inspired by his many field trips with his teacher Chen Chuan-Xin.Hou Chun-Ming’s Crime and Punishment by Hou Chun-Ming, Garden City Publishers. (2008) Teacher Chen took Hou to Tainan to see the Dongyue Temple, well known for its monks who communicate with ghosts. After visiting the Hall of Dragon Metamorphoses in Kaoshiung, Hou was shocked to find they chained the mental patients together. His creativity was equally fueled by the magical power of Taiwan’s folklore. In fact he decided to create his own gods and weave his own mythology into his work. Consequently, in 1995，Anecdotes about Spirits and Immortals was selected to represent Taiwan in the Venice Biennale. In 1997，Hou & his first wife divorced unexpectedly, which threw his world into total darkness. He lamented: “Geniuses such as poet Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud、painter Vincent Willem Van Gogh、Amedeo Modigliani、Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec were all dead at the age of 37. When I was 10, I was fascinated that their lives could burst into flames so suddenly and so brilliantly , therefore, I thought to die young would be worth it. And if I were not meant to be an artist like them, to spend 37 years in art would be long enough, I should start looking for something else to do. To me, 37 years old was a great gateway, and before I realized it, I was in front of this gateway.”His creativity also stagnated. A Suicide Message of Dying on Love at Age 36, Hou writes: “ My whole body hurt sharply when I lie down, I was not spared the pain when I was out of the bed either.”。 Hou did not stay depressed for long, he participatel in group therapy and become a freelance writer and to paint aimlessly. These were all attempts to cope with the pain. In particular, he found solace in painting the Mandala . For Hou, “The round mandala is a mirror reflecting your own inner world. You can meet yourself through painting aimlessly. A round Mandala is like a womb, a seed or an egg, it nourishes all possibilities. In 2001，Hou became a father, which re- invigorated his artistic muse . From being a wandering ghost most of his life, he suddenly became a guardian of lives. Through voluminous freelance writing and graffiti paintings, Hou’s creative style had metamorphosed from the art of “challenging any opponent to a fight” to the search for one’s inner soul. At the end of 2005, an art collector sent Hou's work to Hong Kong Sotheby’s Sales for auction. Much to his surprise, Hou Chun-Ming shot to international stardom and his name became recognized worldwide. In 2007, inspired by Taiwan god culture, his print Erotic Paradise became an overnight sensation. It was sold for $480,000 HKD. His print Strong Anal Sex：The Buddha with Refined Love then sold for $192,000HKD. Hou’s fame quickly escalated to new heights. In the same year at Hong Kong Christie’s auction, his woodblock printings Anecdotes about Spirits and Immortals, a set of 37 pieces, were sold for $2.64 million HKD. It holds the record for the highest price by any Taiwan artists at an international auction. The smashing success of this work put Hou on the map. For the longest time, art collectors paid little attention to Taiwan artists. Hou changed that. His talent and fame attracted global fascination to not just himself, but for the Taiwan art community at large. Since 2012, Hou made himself the contemporary Cangjile who created the original Chinese script. Hou drew scripts and made them into charms with calling power. Hou believes that charms are scripts that have not yet been tamed, and charm’s power came from the secret desires of a person. He said that each script when written out is actually a charm with strong calling power, for example, when we write love letters, we are calling for love, when we write in Facebook, we are looking for friendship and when we draft a complaint, we are seeking justice. Hou dissects words from short sentences and combine them into a charm, or he uses the sound, shape and meaning of words and the beliefs in Taiwan folklore, he develops them into new Chinese characters. Public reception and criticism Hou believed that if each of us has a little chaotic black area within our heart that we usually block and suppress. But, with self-dissecting method, Hou analyzes our dark spaces with art. By combining traditional religious rituals, body symbols and sex, he aims to relieve observers from life’s strangest phenomena. A Taiwan TV personality Tsai Kang-Yun evaluated Hou's work, he said: “I can always feel Hou's power and think that I owe him for that. May be because he created his paintings out of pain or out of restraint, but all of us who are inspired by him owe him.

Thengapattanam, once part of Travancore and later Kerala, was bequeathed upon to Tamil Nadu on 1 November 1956 along with some parts of today's Kanniyakumari District. Etymology Thengappattanam derives its name from the abundance of coconut groves sprout along the vast estuary, meaning the town/city with coconut trees in abundance. The word Thenga(i) is found in Malayalam/Tamil refers to coconut/palm; The suffix \\"pattanam\\" is derived from \\"pattinam\\", a Tamil word which means coastal town or a city. Thus \\"Thenga+pattanam\\" became Thengapattanam in the later years. Also, acclaimed Malayalam/Arabic novels on Islamic history refers to this town as Naariyal pathathan, Naariyal meaning \\"coconut\\", and pathathan is an Arabic word for town. History Capital of \\"Thenga Nadu\\" Chilappathikaram, the Tamil epic refers thengapattanam as the capital of \\"thenga nadu\\" – one of the 48 countries of lemuria, otherwise known as ‘kumari kandam’, where the Dravidian civilizations known as the ‘cradle of civilizations’ flourished. The world renowned historical research traveler ‘dalami’ refers this place as a ‘harbour town’ in this book written in ad 100. The king of ‘thenga nadu’ karunan thadangal is said to have ruled from here. Dutch Invasion This area, once under the domain of chera, pandya and nayakkar kings, was later ruled by the kings of travancore. Attingal queen got the right to rule this area in ad 1700. During this time in the middle of the 17th century, the naval forces headed by the Dutch colonel nicolfwar besieged this town and gained control of it. The Dutch records of ‘wrin-de-herik’ state that after the take over a Dutch infantry division, a go down and a church were established here in ad 1678. In ad 1694, the forces attingal queen fought the Dutch, chased them out and regained its control. The rule of Venad The Dutch again attacked thengapattinam, when it became part of ‘venad’ under the rule of marthanda varma maharaja. during this battle fought to chase out the Dutch, many Muslims lost their lives. The ‘kuntadipattan paarai’ which came under the heavy attack of the Dutch cannons stand out to be a ‘living memorial’ today. Later, due to the ‘Tamil nadu liberation movement’ this part was annexed to Tamil Nadu in 1956. It is worth mentioning here that the famous raja kesavadas, the then divan of the king Rama varma of travancore was brought up in his youth in the well known ‘puthen veedu\\" here. Geography=Topography= Thengapattanam is located in the South western coast of India bordering the Arabian sea to the west, western ghats to the north, and vast fertile plains with intermittent Rocky hills to the east.

The Canal, while it functioned, merged with Thamirabarani River River at Thengapattanam, and formed a basin known as Valiyar. The development project mooted to revive AVM Canal Waterways would link Thengapattanam with Kanyakumari in the east and Kasargode in the north-west in Kerala, when it becomes operational. =Geology= Thengapattanam is classified under the Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes. =Climate= The climate here is classified under Köppen–Geiger climate classification system as As/Aw/Am, as an implication the town experiences moderate tropical climates ranging from monsoon to Savannah dry influenced by the vicinity to Thermal equator.

Bina, provides security and cyber- security advisory services across the top tier of the Israel private sector, including its infrastructure and defense firms, as well as most sensitive government, military and intelligence agencies. It also works in India supporting one of its critical financial markets infrastructure institutions and other global institution. In his book Guidelines for a National Cyber Strategy, (co-authored with Ofer Assaf), Siboni outlines five points for which decisions are critical for determining a national strategy. Starting with the state's responsibility to protect the private sector in relation to cyberspace security and privacy issues. The second point relates to the state responsibility, to enforce the use of technologies and practices in cyberspace defense in the civilian sector, which in many cases is part of its critical infrastructures. The third point is the extent to which the state is entitled to store information about the civilian sector's activities in cyberspace in order to defend it. The fourth point concerns the state's responsibility to build cyberspace capabilities and use them in a manner that will attain the state's interests. And, finally, the fifth point is the state's ability to secure the infrastructure that will allow the realization of a cyber strategy over time.

Early life Rachmat Kartolo was one of five children born to Kartolo and Roekiah, two film actors active with Tan's Film, on 13 March 1938. After Roekiah's death, Kartolo brought the children to his hometown at Yogyakarta. In the city, the Indonesian capital during the later days of the Indonesian National Revolution, Rachmat lost one of his siblings and, in 1949, his father. After the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence, Rachmat and his surviving siblings – Jusuf, Imam, and Sri Wahjuni – were brought to Jakarta and raised by their father's friend, Adikarso. There Rachmat completed his education, graduating from senior high school before entering the National Theatre Academy of Indonesia. Career Adikarso introduced Rachmat to music and the recording industry; Rachmat and his brothers performed at Wisma Nusantara in Harmoni, Jakarta, under their guardian's supervision. In 1958 Rachmat and his brothers established a band. Though Jusuf and Imam later left, Rachmat went on to solo success. At the time the government under president Sukarno forbade the use of English-language music, and thus, the Encyclopedia of Jakarta writes, Indonesian popular music was in search of its identity. Rachmat used sounds inspired from country music, and his songs were mostly about romance. His first hit, in 1963, was \\"Patah Hati\\" (\\"Heartbroken\\"), written by his brother Imam. The song had another burst of popularity in 1984, allowing him to buy a new car. Though he initially showed no interest in film, in 1964 Rachmat appeared in his first production, Kunanti Djawabanmu (I Await your Reply). By 1977 he had completed more than 20 films. In 1975 he established his own production house, Mafin Film, and in 1978 he made his directorial debut with Tengkorak Hitam (Black Skull). Even after entering film he continued to record albums, first on gramophone records then on cassettes. From his debut until his final role in Titisan Dewi (1990), Rachmat appeared in more than 40 films, including action flicks such as Matjan Kemajoran (1965), comedies such as Benyamin Jatuh Cinta (1976), and dramas such as Bernafas dalam Lumpur (1970). He directed a total of four films: Tengkorak Hitam, Masih Adakah Cinta (1980), Jangan Sakiti Hatinya (1980) and Mat Pelor (1990). Death Rachmat died on 18 September 2001. In June of that year he had made a stage performance in Blitar, as former president Sukarno in a memorial performance.

Verdone, here in his fourth direction, besides interpreter is also the author of the subject and participates in the script as in his other films.  Plot  Sandy is an American teenager who has become a famous baby-model, just arrived in Rome for photo shoots and fashion shows that will engage her for a few months; she is accompanied by her mother and stepfather, because she is still too young to live her life alone. The mother, looking for a private teacher to whom to entrust her daughter's school preparation during her stay in the capital, tries to contact the well-known theologian Michael Spinetti: in the convent where he lives, the woman's phone calls Rolando Ferrazza, a thirty years old and graduated with honors, but who despite this has found no other occupation. To round off his meager income, Rolando takes the opportunity and introduces himself to the woman as Father Spinetti. The deception succeeds with Sandy's parents but not with the girl, who soon unmasks him and tries to blackmail him: she would prefer to live a life different from the one imposed by the hard work of a model and the tedious family life. To ensure that the secret of Rolando is well guarded, Sandy forces him to take her around the city, spending days full of fun. Between the two it is born a tender friendship and for the young, still a girl \\"water and soap\\", it is the beginning of the first amorous disturbances. The mother, meanwhile, discovers the truth, meeting the real father Spinetti. Furious, fires the young impostor who loses his job and can no longer see Sandy. However, the young woman escapes from a photographic set, arriving in the middle of the night at Rolando's house; the two spend a few hours together again, making love too (the first time for Sandy, who wants to give herself to a sweet and tender man like Rolando), but in the end the girl decides to go back to her family and her life the days, leaving Rolando to his future.  Production  Carlo Verdone was inspired by the plot of the film by a journalistic service of RAI, made by Carlo Sartori, which told the phenomenon of the so-called \\"babymodels\\" – just exploded in the early 1980s, with the case of Brooke Shields –, and to complain exploitation of mothers on their prodigal daughters; mothers not very sensitive to the need for a balanced psychological development of adolescent daughters, who deprived them of a serene infancy to take them to forced stages to success. = Cast = The female protagonist of the film, Natasha Hovey, was here at her film debut. Fabrizio Bracconeri, who plays Rolando's neighbor, was also in the first career film: Verdone had met him in the garage where he worked and already in the past had asked the actor and director to make him play a part in his job; when for the role of the neighbor he was looking for someone who spoke in Roman in the same way as Sora Lella, Verdone decided to try it, then writing it for the film. For the role of Wilma Walsh, Sandy's mother, Verdone had initially thought of Virna Lisi, then opting for Florinda Bolkan. Elena Fabrizi instead returns to play the role of the grandmother of the protagonist in a film by Verdone, as had already happened in an episode of White, Red and Verdone. Finally appears in a small cameo, as a presenter of a fashion show, Christian De Sica; Verdone wanted to help his friend, as well as his brother- in-law, at a time when he was in financial difficulty.  Soundtrack  The song Acqua e sapone, written by Vasco Rossi and music by Gaetano Curreri, is sung by the Stadio.

It made landfall on Western Australia's Pilbara coast nearly halfway between the major towns of Karratha and Port Hedland as a category 4 cyclone on midnight of 31 December 2013. Meteorological history On 25 December the Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported that a broad monsoonal circulation that they had been monitoring to the northwest of Western Australia had developed a discrete centre of circulation. Over the next few days the system slowly developed further as it moved towards the south-southwest, before during 28 December the BoM reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Christine. It intensified into a Category 2 storm on 29 December, Category 3 on 30 December, and then a marginal Category 4 on the same day. Watches and warnings were issued for areas between Derby and Exmouth, extending inland beyond the Pilbara to the Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance region around Wiluna and Leinster. Christine made landfall between Roebourne and Whim Creek while strengthening around midnight on 31 December, with the eye passing through Roebourne itself, with Wickham skirting the edge of the eye. The storm began to turn to the southeast and began to weaken slowly. Impact=Western Australia= Cyclone Christine intensifying off the Australian coast on 29 December Upon making landfall, Christine produced heavy rainfall across a large section of the West Australian Pilbara. In Roebourne, a total of was recorded by a rain gauge before the instrument failed, while the maximum daily precipitation total of was observed in Abydos North. Additionally, Port Hedland recorded , Karratha , while thunderstorms along Christine's outer bands produced three-day totals of in Broome and in Lagrange Bay. All mining and shipping operations were cancelled in Port Hedland, however no actual damage to mining infrastructure was reported. Roebourne and Wickham bore the brunt of Christine's winds, with a maximum confirmed gust of recorded at Roebourne. Both towns received significant damage and according to many local residents of Wickham, Christine was the worst cyclone in recent memory; several roofs were significantly damaged and many of the towns trees were uprooted and destroyed. In Roebourne, roofs of many houses collapsed under the weight of water or were ripped off by wind gusts, while the whole town lost electricity for a short period. Karratha and Port Hedland were spared any major damage, apart from minor flooding and wind-related damage. As Christine moved inland, flooding closed the Great Northern Highway north of Newman, however the town itself received wind gusts and only of rain. An estimated 3–4.5 tonnes of iron ore was lost in exports across the Pilbara region due to Christine. Mining operations and shipments were suspended for three days, though most of the facilities sustained only minor damage if any. Despite the storm, Port Hedland reported a record monthly export of 29.9 million tonnes in December 2013, with 28.5 million tonnes being iron ore. This surpassed the previous record set in September 2013 by roughly 300,000 tonnes. =Elsewhere= As the remnant low of Christine moved south-eastwards and into South Australia, it combined with a thermal low whipping up gusty winds and causing extreme heat across central Australia. Moomba recorded a maximum of on the 2 of January, almost beating its former record high set the year before. winds combined with the heat caused catastrophic fire dangers across the southern inland and a complete fire ban was issued for South Australia. As the extreme heat moved east, temperatures of were recorded in Birdsville, Queensland and in Walgett, New South Wales. Further south however, Christine's remnants caused light showers and a cooler change in the Adelaide area, while isolated thunderstorms caused of rain to fall in Eucla, more than triple the areas monthly average. Victoria and southern New South Wales also recorded light rain and a cooler change from Christine's remnants, with Melbourne reporting and maximum temperatures in the low 20 °C's during the New Years period.

From Sketchline: :\\"The picture is a fantastic landscape, illuminated by a grayish-violet unearthly light. Against the background of the desert space, there are several strange objects that are completely unconnected: a cactus, beans, a yellow figure and a peculiar “shaggy” stick. A dark cloud occupying the right side of the canvas hangs menacingly over the field. The title of the work not only does not explain what is happening but, as is often the case with Surrealists, creates an even greater mystery, thereby making the audience curious.\\"  Influence  According to Nathalia Brodskaïa, Mama, Papa is Wounded! is one of Tanguy's most impressive paintings. Brodskaïa writes that the painting reflects his debt to Giorgio de Chirico – falling shadows and a classical torso – and conjures up a sense of doom: the horizon, the emptiness of the plain, the solitary plant, the smoke, the helplessness of the small figures. Tanguy said that it was an image he saw entirely in his imagination before starting to paint it.Nathalia Brodskaïa, Surrealism, Parkstone International, 2012, p. 123.

It was designed by Frederick Crossley and Thomas Rayson, and commemorates those who were lost in the two World Wars. The memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In 1919 Chester City Council formed the Chester War Memorial Committee to make recommendations for a memorial to those lost in the First World War. Some schemes for public and social improvement were suggested, but these were considered to be too expensive. William Beswick, the son of the county architect, was asked to prepare two designs, without a fee: one to stand outside the Town Hall, the other outside the King's School. Both were accepted by the committee. Another idea was to reconstruct the medieval Chester Cross. The King's School rejected the plan for the memorial on their site, and the other two plans were rejected by the City Council. Following a public meeting it was agreed that the monument should include a prominent cross, and that it should be sited in the centre of the city. Giles Gilbert Scott was asked to design a monument to stand in the grounds of the cathedral. His design included the figure of Saint Michael under a cross, all under a canopy, to stand in the cathedral grounds. This had an estimated cost of £4,000. It was approved by the committee, but as it was to stand on cathedral land, the cathedral had the last word, and the design was vetoed by the dean, possibly because of its height of nearly . The committee then asked Scott for a simpler design, based on the \\"cross on steps\\" model familiar in many English market crosses. This was produced, and would have cost £2,500, but it was rejected by the committee. The committee then decided to hold a competition to design a memorial cross to stand in the cathedral enclosure, and to cost less than £2,000. In 1921, out of 23 entries, the design of Frederick Crossley and Thomas Rayson was chosen, with that of William Beswick coming second. The total cost of the monument came to £1,540 (equivalent to £ in ). The figures on the monument were sculpted by Alec Miller of Chipping Camden, and the contractors were W. Haswell and Sons of Chester. The monument was unveiled on 24 May 1922 by two mothers who had lost sons in the war and was dedicated by the Bishop of Chester. Following the Second World War, a further inscription was added. Description The monument is constructed in red sandstone from a quarry in Delamere, matching the exterior stone of the cathedral. It stands about high. It has a hexagonal base of four steps from which rises a plinth that supports a cross. Around the plinth are niches in the Gothic style containing the figures of six saints who are identified as follows: Werburgh, the patron saint of Chester; George, the patron saint of England; Maurice, a warrior saint who represents the infantry; Alban, a soldier and the first British martyr; David, the patron saint of Wales (many of Chester's inhabitants are from Wales) and Michael, the Biblical archangel who overthrew Satan. On the fourth step of the base is the following inscription: The west side of the third step is inscribed with the dates 1939–1945. The monument was designated as a Grade II listed building on 6 August 1998. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\".

Geometric mechanics applies principally to systems for which the configuration space is a Lie group, or a group of diffeomorphisms, or more generally where some aspect of the configuration space has this group structure. For example, the configuration space of a rigid body such as a satellite is the group of Euclidean motions (translations and rotations in space), while the configuration space for a liquid crystal is the group of diffeomorphisms coupled with an internal state (gauge symmetry or order parameter).  Momentum map and reduction  One of the principal ideas of geometric mechanics is reduction, which goes back to Jacobi's elimination of the node in the 3-body problem, but in its modern form is due to K. Meyer (1973) and independently J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein (1974), both inspired by the work of Smale (1970). Symmetry of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian system gives rise to conserved quantities, by Noether's theorem, and these conserved quantities are the components of the momentum map J. If P is the phase space and G the symmetry group, the momentum map is a map \\\\mathbf{J}:P\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}^*, and the reduced spaces are quotients of the level sets of J by the subgroup of G preserving the level set in question: for \\\\mu\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}^* one defines P_\\\\mu=\\\\mathbf{J}^{-1}(\\\\mu)/G_\\\\mu, and this reduced space is a symplectic manifold if \\\\mu is a regular value of J. Variational principles  * Hamilton's principle * Lagrange d'Alembert principle * Maupertuis * Euler–Poincaré * Vakonomic  Geometric integrators  One of the important developments arising from the geometric approach to mechanics is the incorporation of the geometry into numerical methods. In particular symplectic and variational integrators are proving particularly accurate for long-term integration of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems.  History  The term \\"geometric mechanics\\" occasionally refers to 17th-century mechanics.Sébastien Maronne, Marco Panza. \\"Euler, Reader of Newton: Mechanics and Algebraic Analysis\\". In: Raffaelle Pisano. Newton, History and Historical Epistemology of Science, 2014, pp. 12–21. As a modern subject, geometric mechanics has its roots in four works written in the 1960s. These were by Vladimir Arnold (1966), Stephen Smale (1970) and Jean-Marie Souriau (1970), and the first edition of Abraham and Marsden's Foundation of Mechanics (1967). Arnold's fundamental work showed that Euler's equations for the free rigid body are the equations for geodesic flow on the rotation group SO(3) and carried this geometric insight over to the dynamics of ideal fluids, where the rotation group is replaced by the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Smale's paper on Topology and Mechanics investigates the conserved quantities arising from Noether's theorem when a Lie group of symmetries acts on a mechanical system, and defines what is now called the momentum map (which Smale calls angular momentum), and he raises questions about the topology of the energy-momentum level surfaces and the effect on the dynamics. In his book, Souriau also considers the conserved quantities arising from the action of a group of symmetries, but he concentrates more on the geometric structures involved (for example the equivariance properties of this momentum for a wide class of symmetries), and less on questions of dynamics. These ideas, and particularly those of Smale were central in the second edition of Foundations of Mechanics (Abraham and Marsden, 1978).

Life Born in 1787 or 1788, he was the son of Thomas Mackenzie, linendraper, and a pupil of John Adey Repton the architect. He was early employed in making architectural and topographical drawings for the works of John Britton and others, and this set the direction for his career. His style was quite close to that of Auguste Pugin, with whom he worked; and they were both under the influence of John Nash. In 1804 Mackenzie began to exhibit at the Royal Academy, and contributed eleven drawings between that year and 1828. He contributed to the Society of Painters in Water-colours from 1813, becoming an associate in 1822, and a full member the following year. From 30 November 1831 till his death he was treasurer to the society. In later life Mackenzie was no longer commissioned to illustrate books. He died, 25 April 1854, of disease of the heart. He was buried at Highgate cemetery; his remaining works were sold at Sotheby's in March 1855.

The bulk of his work was in the following books: * Britton's Beauties of England and Wales; * Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain (1807 and 1809—twenty-five drawings engraved); * History of the Abbey Church at Westminster (Ackerman, 1812—32 coloured aquatints); * Britton's Cathedral Antiquities (Salisbury Cathedral—58 plates); * Robert Havell's Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Seats (drawings dated 1816 and 1819); * Histories of Oxford and Cambridge (Ackerman, 1814 and 1815—39 plates); * Colleges of Winchester, Eton, etc., 1816 (13 plates); * Abbeys and Castles in Yorkshire (with William Westall); * Pugin's Specimens of Gothic Architecture, 1821; * Principal Antiquities of Oxfordshire, Oxford, 1823; * Memorials of Oxford, by James Ingram, 1837 (100 plates); * Charles Heath's Picturesque Annual, 1839 (six plates); * Memorials of Cambridge, by Thomas Wright and Harry Longueville Jones, 1841; * The Churches of London, published by Charles Tilt (drawings dated 1837–9). Among his drawings were The King's Coronation (1822) and The Principal Room of the Original National Gallery, formerly the Residence of John Julius Angerstein, Esq., lately pulled down. The latter was contributed to the Water-colour Society's exhibition in 1836, and went to the South Kensington Museum, together with two drawings of Lincoln Cathedral and one of Thornton Abbey, Lincolnshire. sepia drawing of Antwerp Cathedral went to the British Museum. In 1842 Mackenzie designed the slab which was placed over the grave of George Barret the younger. Family Mackenzie married in 1843 Mrs. Hine, a widow, the daughter of John Carpenter, a farmer; but his married life was subject to money troubles. He died leaving his wife and invalid daughter dependent on charity. The Water-colour Society presented them with £110, and a subscription was raised among his friends to purchase an annuity for their benefit.

Wells at the age of 34. He later called the book, which became a bestseller, \\"the keystone to the main arch of my work.\\"Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 161. His most recent biographer, however, calls the volume \\"both the starting point and the lowest point in Wells's career as a social thinker.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 151-52). Taking the revolution in transport facilitated by the \\"mechanical revolution\\" as his point of departure, Wells told readers they were living through a reorganization of human society that would alter every dimension of life. An academic biographer has described the degree of accuracy of Wells's predictions as \\"certainly phenomenal.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 92. The chapters of Anticipations appeared in Great Britain in the Fortnightly Review (April–December 1901) and in the United States in the North American Review (June–November 1901), and were published as a book in November 1901. Anticipations was \\"Wells's first non-fiction bestseller.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 91. The volume was reissued by Chapman and Hall in 1914, on the eve of World War I. Synopsis=Chapter 1: Locomotion in the Twentieth Century= Proposing to forecast \\"the way things will probably go in this new century,\\" Wells's point of departure is \\"the probable developments and changes of the means of land locomotion during the coming decades.\\" Taking the \\"steam engine running on a railway\\" to be the most characteristic symbol of the 19th century, he analyzes the historical factors that led it to appear when it did. Wells predicts that \\"new motor vehicles\\" will lead to trucks, cars (\\"motor carriages\\"), and buses (\\"the motor omnibus\\") that will be \\"segregated\\" from horse traffic on \\"special roads\\" competing with railways.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 1. =Chapter 2: The Probable Diffusion of Great Cities= Wells argues that the speed of land travel stands \\"in almost fundamental relation to human society.\\" The speeding up of land locomotion will therefore revolutionize human society. Rather than producing even larger cities, a new sort of \\"human distribution\\" will be created, with the increase in the distance a worker can travel in an hour acting as a \\"centrifugal\\" force leading to a considerable development of \\"suburbs\\" while this development is counterbalanced by \\"centripetal considerations\\" like a desire for access to shopping districts, good schools, doctors, and \\"the love of the crowd.\\" The terms \\"town\\" and \\"country\\" will become obsolete as a new kind of \\"urban region\\" develops.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 2. =Chapter 3: Developing Social Elements= The two-class social system of a lower class administered by a superior class derived from the speed of horses in an agricultural society, according to Wells. The revolution in technology, he predicts, will produce in the 20th century a system of four classes: (1) \\"the shareholding class\\" administering \\"irresponsible property\\"; (2) \\"the abyss,\\" consisting of people \\"without either property or any evident function in the social organism\\"; (3) a reconstructed, productive, and \\"capable\\" middle class, including, notably, \\"mechanics and engineers,\\" whose potential will depend on the education this class receives, no longer being \\"middle\\" in any meaningful sense; and (4) a class of non-productive business managers, political organizers, brokers, financiers, clerks, etc. \\"All these elements will be mingled confusedly together, passing into one another by insensible gradations.\\" Wells regards the United States as \\"the social mass which has perhaps advanced furthest along the new lines.\\"H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 3. =Chapter 4: Certain Social Reactions= Circa 2000, Wells predicts, the capable productive class will have developed a way of life characterized by a scientific worldview, an ethos of social duty, and an unsentimental view of personal relations that lead it to view \\"a childless, sterile life\\" as \\"essentially failure and perversion.\\" Families of this class will live in efficient households with no need for domestic servants. The shareholder class will cultivate opulent, archaic decoration, which Wells clearly deplores, and he also fears that its wealth may enable it not only to \\"buy up almost all the available architectural talent\\" but also \\"in a certain figurative sense—buy up much of the womankind\\" that would otherwise belong to the capable class.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 4. =Chapter 5: The Life-History of Democracy= Wells argues that \\"democracy\\" is a term with little specificity, signifying little more than a denial \\"that any specific person or persons should act as a matter of intrinsic right or capacity on behalf of the community as a whole.\\" As a political creed, Wells considers democracy flimsy and untenable: \\"I know of no case for the elective Democratic government of modern states that cannot be knocked to pieces in five minutes.\\" The appearance of representative democracy Wells links to what he called the \\"mechanical revolution\\" (hence its early appearance in Great Britain, the U.S., and France), and explains the appearance of a belief in \\"the people\\" as little more than a disbelief in monarchs and nobles. In Wells's view, it is not the people but rather \\"a scientifically trained middle-class of an unprecedented sort\\" that \\"will become, I believe, at last consciously the State.\\" The real governors that \\"democracy\\" produces—political bosses and demagogues—Wells regards as likely to provoke wars. But they will be incapable of managing these wars, leading to their replacement.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 5 (emphasis in original). =Chapter 6: War= Wells sees the mechanical revolution as making the division of armies into infantry and cavalry obsolete. The \\"new war\\" is determined by the increasing range and accuracy of the rifle (and also of the field gun). Wells predicts that a few snipers will be able to defend territory against a larger force. War will become less \\"dramatic\\" and more \\"monstrous.\\" The State will organize all of society for the support of its war machine. Wells analyzes how tactics will be altered by rapid locomotion, command of the air, and \\"light, swift ships.\\" (But \\"my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea.\\") Technical, not moral factors will be determinate. Societies with the most well developed and consolidated \\"educated efficient classes\\" will prevail.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 6. =Chapter 7: The Conflict of Language= Wells predicts that \\"unifying sources\\" give only English, French (or possibly German), and Chinese a chance of flourishing in the future. Dismissing the racialist thought associated with romantic nationalism as \\"nonsense,\\" he predicts that languages like Spanish and Russian by the year 2000 will \\"be tending more and more to be the second tongues of bilingual communities.\\"H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 7. =Chapter 8: The Larger Synthesis= Though it may take \\"centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed,\\" Wells predicts that the process he is describing \\"aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself.\\" Present-day economic integration anticipates this, as do \\"at least five spacious movements of coalescence\\": Anglo-Saxonism, British imperialism, Pan-Germanism, Pan-Slavism, and the idea of a union of \\"Latin\\" peoples. Wells analyzes each of these. But he believes it is \\"a naturally and informally organized, educated class\\" rather than any regional political movement that will be the means whereby \\"a New Republic\\" will come to dominate the world. Wells scrutinizes the present for signs of such a development, and finds them in American trusts, unofficial organizations like the Navy League, philanthropic tycoons, etc.H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 8. =Chapter 9: The Faith, Morals, and Public Policy of the New Republic= In his concluding chapter, Wells went as far as he ever did in the direction of eugenics, advocating a \\"euthanasia of the weak and the sensual.\\" In his text, he insists that social groups will not be treated \\"as races at all\\" but as individuals. It cannot be denied, however, that it is in remarks that are more than a little tinged with racism and anti-Semitism that Wells declares that he rejects racism and anti-Semitism. A recent biographer has said that \\"Nothing has done more damage to Wells's reputation than the concluding chapter of Anticipations.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 148-49. Wells predicts that a stern morality freed from the trammels of exploded religious beliefs and based on ideas of Malthusianism and natural selection will sustain aggressive action of the \\"World State\\" to \\"check\\" and \\"control\\" human activity so as \\"to favour the procreation of what is fine and efficient and beautiful in humanity.\\" The future rulers will not quail before the need to use the \\"method\\" of \\"death\\"; about death \\"they will have no superstitions.\\" \\"[G]ood scientifically caused pain\\" may also be used, but its use can be \\"unsafe and demoralizing\\" for those who inflict it. So \\"[t]o kill under the seemly conditions science will afford is a far less offensive thing.\\" Sexual morality, on the other hand, will be comprehensively liberalized, facilitating the goal of having \\"perhaps half the population of the world, in every generation, restrained from or tempted to evade reproduction.\\" Declaring these to be policies devoted to \\"a purpose greater than happiness,\\" Wells declares that it is not for immortality, but for the \\"spacious\\" \\"future of our race\\" [i.e. the human race], that the \\"kinetic men of the coming time\\" will \\"live and die.\\"H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 9. Genesis The idea of writing the articles that became the chapters of Anticipations was suggested to Wells by James B. Pinker, his literary agent. Pinker persuaded Wells that \\"the thinking literary men\\" had a responsibility to express their views.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 91. It is perhaps also noteworthy that the book was written while Wells awaited the birth of his first child, George Philip (\\"Gip\\") Wells, born on July 17, 1901.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 146. In a letter to Elizabeth Healy, Wells said that the purpose of Anticipations was \\"to undermine and destroy the monarch, monogamy, faith in God & respectability—& the British Empire, all under the guise of a speculation about motor cars & electric heating.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 147. Reception In the words of a biographer, Anticipations \\"took England by storm,\\" making Wells \\"almost famous in fact.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 92. Vigorously promoted, the book and its views were widely discussed. \\"Every significant thinker [in Great Britain] apparently read and thought about the book,\\" according to an academic biographer.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 95. The publication of Anticipations led to Wells's friendship with E. Ray Lancaster, the director of the Museum of Natural History. The book was appreciated by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, who introduced Wells to Graham Wallas. William James predicted that Anticipations would influence British youth, but thought that Wells did not allow sufficiently for \\"human nature.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 94-95. Wells's Anticipations, together with his next production, The Discovery of the Future, established him as \\"a great man,\\" according to one biographer, and as a result he was soon sought out by many leading figures of the day. \\"Bertie Wells had been transformed into H.G.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 97. He became a major literary figure as well as new socialist leader who was courted by the Fabians. Later readers have recoiled at what Lovat Dickson in 1969 called the book's suggestion of \\"strong-armed fascism.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 150. W. Warren Wagar, discussing Anticipations' advocacy of racism, eugenics and capital punishment, noted \\"To Wells' credit, he would soon abandon such thoughts, but they were all here in plain English in Anticipations and we have no power or licence to wish them away\\".W. Warren Wagar, H.G. Wells: Traversing Time. Middletown, Connecticut Wesleyan University Press, 2004. (pp. 90-1). A number of writers (e.g. Michael CorenMichael Coren, The Invisible Man : The Life and Liberties of H.G. Wells, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 1993. and John Carey )John Carey, The Intellectuals and the Masses : Pride and Prejudice among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880-1939 London : Faber and Faber, 1992. have made even stronger charges against Wells.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 150, 455. But in fact Wells responded to criticism and was soon arguing against the negative eugenics advocated in Chapter 9, and he later became a leading advocate of human rights. Sherborne notes within two years of the publication of Anticipations: \\"Wells would be arguing against negative eugenics; within three defending black people against race prejudice; within four advocating the desirability of a multitracial society\\".Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 152. Cultural Impact The print magazine of the Young Fabians, the youth-wing of the Fabian Society of which H.G.Wells was a member, is named after this.

Following the purchase, Dragoon Spring was used as a watering place by the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, commonly called the \\"Jackass Mail\\", starting in July 1857.

The construction of the station was supervised by Butterfield Division Superintendent William Buckley of Watertown, New York.John Warner Barber and Henry Howe, Our Whole Country or the Past and Present of the United States, Volume II, Cincinnati, 1861, pp. 1448-1449.

An order dated March 2, 1861, was sent to the Overland Mail Company to transfer the contract to the Central Overland Trail, because of the start of the Civil War. The present marker at the station states that one of the reasons was because of competition from the Pony Express, but the Pony Express never existed in Arizona and was not in competition with any stage line. The earliest stage line to use the station, when a through service returned to the Southern Overland Trail, was Tomlinson & Co.\\"Mail at Last.\\" Arizona Miner, Prescott, Arizona, May 18, 1867 During the American Civil War, it was the site of the First Battle of Dragoon Springs and near to the site of the Second Battle of Dragoon Springs, fought between Apache warriors and Confederate soldiers. The Six Graves at Dragoon Springs Stage Station There are six graves that have been identified at the Dragoon Springs Stage Station. There are four rock cairns covering graves north of the gate to the entrance of the ruins of the stage station building. There are two to the west of the same building, consistent with historical accounts. Records indicate that seven individuals were killed at or near the station and they were buried in six graves, and when carefully assessing the evidence the identity of those buried in each set of graves is clear. Two Butterfield’s Overland Mail Company Graves The drawing by H. C. Grosvenor, made in 1860, shows the two graves of north the station gate. The photograph to the right was taken from the approximate position of Grosvenor when he made the drawing. In both the drawing and the photo, when a straight line is drawn starting at the top apex of the shark fin like mountain, to the station gate and through the center of the graves, the lines match exactly. Well, to some extent exactly because as any experienced surveyor knows, one can draw a straight line between any two points. In fact, these historical drawings are known to have been approximate and to have collapsed a wider view into a narrower drawing (Seymour 2019). From the history book that contained the Grosvenor drawing was this: > “This station, or corral, is 85 miles east of Tucson. It is a rectangular > enclosure, protected by a stone wall eight foot high. One third of the space > is occupied by storehouses and the sleeping apartment of the station master. > These structures are covered by thatched roofs. The mules are kept in the > other part, ready for change on the arrival of the mail. A heavy wooden gate > defends the entrance. The two graves in the foreground are mementos of a > tragedy that occurred on the night of September 8, 1858. Rude wooden slabs > at their head bear brief inscriptions. ...With little hope of living, St. > John succeeded in writing an account of the murder in a small book, for the > information of the mail party that was due the succeeding Monday.\\"John > Warner Barber and Henry Howe, Our Whole Country, Volume II, Cincinnati, > 1863, pp. 1448 & 1449. In the drawing it appears that the two graves are in line head to foot. They were staggered with a space between them and, at ground level, they are drawn from the perspective of the artist, and this latter point is important to remember. The graves of Butterfield's Overland Mail Company employees are a result of a massacre that started a few minutes after midnight on September 9, 1858. Some of the station construction crew had just gone on to the San Pedro River to build a station. Left behind were Silas St. John, James Burr, William Cunningham, James Laing, and three Mexican laborers. One of the construction crew that had just left for the San Pedro River was Superintendent William Buckley. As one of those that was killed was his uncle, he wrote an account of the massacre for their hometown newspaper in Upstate New York. > ”The last hope that there might be an error or falsehood in the first report > of the massacre of our old fellow townsman, Mr. James Burr, and his > companions, at Dragoon Springs has been dispelled by a letter from William > Buckley, one of the superintendents of the overland mail company, to his > father.

An article in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, 1858, titled “Amputation at the Shoulder-Joint, by B. J. D. Irwin, M. D., U. S. Army,”J. D. Irwin, M. D., U. S. Army, The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, 1858, Vol. XLI, Blanchard and Lea, Philadelphia, 1861. gives a brief account of the massacre which corresponds to St. John's description. Irwin was the surgeon who operated on St. John. > ”…The largest is a double grave in which rests together the remains of Wm. > Cunningham, and James Hughes [Burr].

(Italics in the quote for emphasis) The Four Graves Attributed to a Confederate Battle with the Apache At the spring, about one mile south of the station, was a battle between Confederate forces and the Apache on May 5, 1862. There are two primary reference to deaths and graves at this location, representing the four graves that are now visible north of the station. The first was this from a Union soldier with Colonel Carleton's Column from California to the Daily Alta California. > ”Fort Thorn, July 10, 1862. Dragoon Springs. [June] 23rd.—At Dragoon Springs > found water, but sufficient by using with care and patience. At night the > surrounding mountains were alive with Indian fires. Near the stage station > are the graves of Hunter’s men, killed by Apaches. On the graves were these > inscriptions, neatly cut in rough stone, executed by one of the Union > prisoners they had along: ‘S. Ford, May 5th, 1862.’ ‘Ricardo.’ Ford was a > Sergeant, and Ricardo was a poor Mexican boy the Texans had forced into > service at Tucson.”Daily Alta California, August 10, 1862, “DIARY OF THE > MARCH TO THE RIO GRANDE.” The second account is from Carleton himself. While there are no known Confederate Army orders documenting their battle with the Apache, an original letter that is cited by Historian L. Boyd Finch, in his Confederate Pathway to the Pacific, wherein he devoted part of a chapter to the battle. In a footnote Finch gives a reference for the battle near the station from a Union Order given by Colonel (soon to be General) Carleton. The relevant section of the original letter is quoted here: > ”The rebels, from the best information I can get, have retired from Arizona > toward the Rio Grande. The Apaches attacked Captain Hunter’s company of > Confederate troops near Dragoon Spring and killed 4 men and ran off 30 mules > and 25 horses.”The War of the Rebellion, A Compilation of the Official > Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I—Volume L—In Two Parts, > Part I—Reports, Correspondence, Etc., Washington, Government Printing > Office, 1897, Headquarters Column from California, Fort Barrett, Pima > Villages, Ariz. Ter., May 24, 1862, Carleton to Drum, p. 1095. As can be seen in the report it states that “near Dragoon Spring and killed 4 men,” and while it does not state that this occurred at the station or even that they were buried there, the likelihood is high that they were buried there given the archaeological evidence. (In L. Boyd Finch's footnote, which gives the Union Order as a reference, he did not accurately paraphrase the order by stating “Carleton himself later told of the Rebel graves there.)”L. Boyd Finch, Confederate Pathway to the Pacific, The Arizona Historical Society, Tucson, 1996, pp. 150-153. The reference that was paraphrased incorrectly is in “Notes to Chapter Sixteen, number 5 on page 269. This is however, irrelevant to the argument, which from the report cited above notes that four confederates were killed, which is consistent with the number of graves visible in one area of the site, two of which have grave markers which identify two of the individuals by name. Another statement is found about the 1862 battle in a Sacramento newspaper: > ”Correspondent of the Union, Mesilla (A. T.), September 15th, 1862, The > California Column. Dragoon Springs are situated in a canon one mile from the > road. It was here that a portion of Hunter’s (secesh) party were attacked by > the Apaches, who drove off their stock and killed three Texans, whose graves > are near the entrance to the canon.”Sacramento Daily Union, California, > October 18, 1862. The mouth of the canon is at the point where the Dragoon Mountains meet the plain and is about one-half mile from Dragoon Springs Stage Station. While the description given may seem contradictory it is common for historical sources to convey terrain and landscape descriptions that are quite different from how we might perceive these today. The description is really not that far off from reality. Moreover, this article mentions only three Texans were killed instead of four, but this is very likely explained by the fact that at this time, the Mexican boy would not have been referenced as a Texan and, owing to this bias, the Mexican boy, who might not even have been enlisted, was not mentioned by this writer. While it may seem that there is some contradiction concerning exactly who is buried under the four visible rock cairns seen just north of the station gate, when the documents are carefully examined and assessed there are really no contradictions and the burials are quite easily explained. The 1967 Desecration of Confederate Soldier S. Ford’s Grave and Removal of his Remains and disturbance of the Rock Cairn over one of the Butterfield Employee’s Grave Regrettably, damage was done to the Confederate rock cairns in 1967. One of the Confederate graves was disturbed and the grave of S. Ford was desecrated and the body removed. On June 9, 1967 a United States Government, Department of Agriculture—Forest Service report was issued concerning the desecration. > Violation of the American Antiquities Act of June 8, 1906 upon the > Butterfield Stage Route (Dragoon Springs Station) was found upon personal > inspection of the site on June 6, 1967. One of the graves of the historic > massacre on September 8, 1858 was disturbed at some time previous to this > inspection of June 6th. The grave of Ford was excavated and the body or its > remnants removed.United States Government Memorandum, Department of > Agriculture—Forest Service, File No. 2760, June 9, 1967 A follow up of the desecration was given by the Coronado National Forest Willcox Ranger District. > ”The common grave is that of the individuals killed in the Station > construction massacre. It is unmarked.”Coronado National Forest, Willcox > Ranger District, Willcox, Arizona, to Mr. Peter Cowgill, Tucson, Arizona, > July 7, 1970. As the six visible graves are identified both visually and by the National Forest Service desecration reports, the graves are identified as the result of the massacre of Butterfield's Overland Mail Company employees and those of a Confederate and Apache battle on May 5, 1862. A photo taken by Roscoe P. Conkling and Margaret B. Conkling on December 22, 1929, which when compared to the rock cairns today, show a distinct structural difference.Seaver Center for Western History Research Natural History Museum, Los Angeles County, 900 Exposition Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, 80007, File GC 1006, Box 5, Folder 09b, Dragoon Springs Station. This is common as people loot graves in hopes of finding treasure. Another Conkling 1929 photo shows the carved stone marker for S. Ford on top of one of the rock cairns, but they did not mention which cairn. This marker is now cemented at the base of one of the cairns. Is it the same cairn as that shown in this photo? Also, there was no mention of Ricardo's stone marker. Consequently, the identification of specific graves must remain in question among the Confederate graves. A chronological record of the Confederate Army engagements in early May 1862, which were between Tucson and Dragoon Springs Stage Station also adds clarity: > ”May 5, 1862. 3 soldiers killed, incl. Sgt. Samuel B. Ford; 2 soldiers > wounded, 1 Mexican killed: Ricardo; 17 horses captured; 21 mules captured; > 16 cattle captured.

Conclusion for the Identity of the Six Graves While there were no Confederate Army orders detailing the battles with the Apache, the battle was likely impromptu, as most were and therefore would not have been subject to orders. What at first glance to some may appear to be conflicting accounts for the battles, location, and number killed, to a seasoned analyst, the inferences can be clearly drawn. A relatively definitive identification can be made for those buried under the four clearly visible rock cairns north of the station gate. These are the burials of the Confederate soldiers and the Mexican boy. It is evident from archaeological evidence and by the references given, that the rock cairns to the north covered the graves of four Confederates (3 Texas soldiers and a Mexican boy [Ricardo]). The two graves to the west of the structure enclose three massacred Overland Mail Company employees. Also, as noted by massacre survivor Silas St. John, his amputated arm was buried between the two graves to the west of the station structure. An Interpretive Marker at the Graves An interpretive marker at the graves should honor the massacred Overland Mail Company employees and those with Captain Hunter's forces that died in battle against the Apache.

Under Basire he became a stylish line engraver. Works Le Keux's engravings were found in the architectural publications of John Britton, Augustus Welby Pugin, John Preston Neale, and others; they were an influence in the revival of Gothic architecture. He engraved the plates to James Ingram's Memorials of Oxford, and published himself two volumes of engravings, Memorials of Cambridge, with text by Thomas Wright and Harry Longueville Jones; some of these plates were subsequently used for Charles Henry Cooper's Memorials of Cambridge.

Naming  During the Italo-Abyssinian War, a large group of Ethiopian soldiers, marching to the north to fight the Italians, arrived almost starving at the town of Freweyni. In honour of this march, the town was renamed to Sinkata. In 1991, after the EPRDF seized power, new administrative divisions came into place. South of the town, a suburban tabia was created. To distinguish the town tabia from the surrounding tabia, the name of the town was changed again to Freweyni. The surrounding of Sinkata kept the Sinkata name. Nowadays, both Freweyni and as well as Sinkata are still commonly used to refer to the town.

It is located in the south side of the city called District 8. It's known locally and internationally for the social protests that took place during 2003 in the event known as the October massacre, during the Bolivian gas conflict, and the 2019 protestshttp://hrp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Black-November- English-Final_Accessible.pdf by supporters of the Movement for Socialism, during the post electoral protests in Bolivia in 2019. During both events, there were civilian deaths after the State ordered police and military intervention, which was later backed with a decree from the legislative power. In 2003, the intervention was supported by the Supreme Decree 27209 and in the case of the 2019 riots which were supported by the Supreme Decree 4078 on the 14th of November 2019, that gave an exemption of penal responsibilities to the Armed Forces of Bolivia. The 4078 decree was repealed on the 28th of November 2019 after an agreement with social organisations.  Location  Senkata is located in the lateral areas of Avenida 6 de marzo in the city of El Alto. This avenue is part of the Ruta nacional 1 - the Bolivian highway network that connects the La Paz Departamento (Bolivia) with the departments of Oruro, Chuquisaca, Potosí and Tarija.  Characteristics  The District of Senkata is in the vicinity of the La Paz - Oruro highway. It houses the Senkata Plant, where Yacimientos Petrolíferos de Bolivia has its liquid gas and gasoline installations providing these to the neighbouring city of La Paz, and it also houses the headquarters of the executive power of Bolivia.  History  Much like the other districts in El Alto, the population that lived there initially were immigrants of other regions in Bolivia, mainly miners that lived through the relocation in Bolivia during the 80s, which caused the loss of jobs for miner workers and triggered their migration to other cities. This migration period represents one of the 4 milestones that marked the urban development of El Alto, a city with 90% of inhabitants that speak Aymara.

The song is about a man asking the woman he loves not to come into his life, just yet, for he feels he is not ready to protect her, as he lives a hard life. Here, the rain becomes a metaphor for the woman – asking for the rain to not come down just yet, in other words, asking the woman not to fall in love with him just yet.

He fought in the Bangladesh Liberation War and was awarded the third highest gallantry award in Bangladesh, the Bir Bikrom, for his courage. He is currently a vice-chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Early life and education Ahmed's father, Dr. Azharuddin, was a member of the National Council of East Pakistan from Bhola. In 1968, Ahmed received his MA degree in Political Science from Dhaka University. Career as a football player Ahmed was a football player during his university days. He later joined the Mohammedan Sporting Club, in 1964. He was selected for the Pakistan national football team in 1967. Military career=Pakistan Army= While playing for the Pakistan and Mohammedan football teams, in 1967, Ahmed was inspired to join the Pakistan Army by the General Secretary of the Pakistan Football Federation, Major Mohammad Hossain Malik. Ahmed applied to join the army's Education Corps, and was commissioned in 1968. He was trained at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Abbottabad. After being commissioned, he continued his career as a football player and participated in many tournaments. After the 1970 Bhola cyclone, he, as a captain, with Bravo Company, engaged in relief work at Galachipa, Patuakhali. =Role in Bangladesh Liberation War= Ahmed was at Jagdishpur Village in the border area of Jessore as part of a training exercise. He was barred from all type of communication there and had no idea of Operation Searchlight, by Pakistan Army, and the declaration of independence of Bangladesh. He returned to the Jessore Cantonment on 29 March. He learned from his batman that there was an order for the Baloch Regiment to disarm the East Bengal Regiment, and that 25 Baloch Regiment and 3 Frontier Force had taken up positions in front of the cantonment. The arsenal had been broken into by East Bengal non- commissioned officers and soldiers. He joined the Bangladesh Liberation War and asked his commanding officer, Colonel Jalil, to join the war. But Jalil, who maintained contact with M. A. G. Osmani of the Bangladesh Awami League, refused to join the liberation, as Osmani had asked. During the subsequent battle, Ahmed fought alongside his troops, but realised that the ammunition they had with them would not be enough to last for more than three hours. So, he started thinking about an exit plan. After fighting relentlessly for almost two hours, he finally escaped the cantonment with 200 companions. In later campaigning, Ahmed, under continuous attack from the Pakistani army, he maintained a free zone at Jessore, including Benapole BOP, from April to mid- May. During the second week of May 1971, Ahmed was ordered to move to Tura, Meghalaya to join the BDF Sector 11 under Major Ziaur Rahman.

Mainly it consists of chocolate, crumbs of bread, sugar, yolk, almonds and red wine. It is shaped like a small gugelhupf. Similar to the English Christmas pudding the Mohr im Hemd is cooked in water. Afterwards it is covered in hot chocolate and decorated with whipped cream. Sometimes the Mohr is served along with ice cream and thus gets called Eismohr im Hemd. A Mohr im Hemd can be savoured in Austrian coffee houses as well as restaurants. Sometimes you can get a Mohr in a Bavarian confectionery shop as well. The term Mohr is an outdated German term for people with dark skin. Im Hemd (literally: \\"in a shirt\\") refers to the (white) cream covering the chocolate cake  Controversy regarding the denomination  In 2012, the SOS Mitmensch organization claimed that the term Mohr im Hemd is racist, suggesting it ought to be replaced (e.g. by Schokokuchen mit Schlag, Schokohupf oder Kakaohupf). Backers of the argumentation state the term Mohr is discriminating due to historical reasons. Defenders of the term counter by stating Mohr is an outdated term used almost exclusively in art (Othello), sayings (Der Mohr hat seine Schuldigkeit getan, der Mohr kann gehen. – \\"The Moor has done his duty, the Moor can go.\\", quotation from Schiller's Fiesco), historic works (and rarely pejorative) or – completely without a reference to a person – as a name for confectionaries.

Overview Textual research is mainly historically oriented. Textual scholars study, for instance, how writing practices and printing technology has developed, how a certain writer has written and revised his or her texts, how literary documents have been edited, the history of reading culture, as well as censorship and the authenticity of texts. The subjects, methods and theoretical backgrounds of textual research vary widely, but what they have in common is an interest in the genesis and derivation of texts and textual variation in these practices. There are many ways to think if you are a textual scholar, some are interested in what the author is trying to intend or there are those who seek to see how the text is transmitted. Textual scholars produce their own editions of what they discovered. Disciplines of textual scholarship include, among others, textual criticism, stemmatology, paleography, genetic criticism, bibliography and history of the book. Textual scholar David Greetham has described textual scholarship as a term encompassing \\"the procedures of enumerative bibliographers, descriptive, analytical, and historical bibliographers, paleographers and codicologists, textual editors, and annotators-cumulatively and collectively\\". Some disciplines of textual scholarship focus on certain material sources or text genres, such as epigraphy, codicology and diplomatics. The historical roots of textual scholarship date back to the 3rd century BCE, when the scholarly activities of copying, comparing, describing and archiving texts became professionalized in the Library of Alexandria.Greetham, David C.: Textual Scholarship.

The episode is described in the Bhagavata Purana and the Sur sagar by Surdas. Modern-day sermons as well as the Television series Krishna by Ramanand Sagar recalls the episode.Pauwels p. 330 Background The Bhagavata Purana narrates that after meeting his friend Sudama, Krishna and his elder brother Balarama walked through the streets of Mathura and encountered Kubja, a young hunchback maidservant of the king Kamsa. She had a beautiful face and carried a plate of ointment with her. Krishna praises her beauty and asks for ointment in return for a boon. She introduces herself as Trivakra, one who is bent in three places. Mesmerized by Krishna's charm, she grants him the ointment that she was taking for the king. Pleased, Krishna presses his toes on her feet and placed a finger of both his hands under her chin and raises the fingers, which straightened her body.Kubja gets overcome with desire for her saviour and pulls the upper garment of Krishna, inviting him to her house. However, Krishna politely declines and promises to return to her house, after fulfilling the purpose of his visit.Bhagavata Purana 10.42 by PrabhupadaPauwels pp. 331-2 In Ramanand Sagar's series, Krishna meets the bent and ugly Kubja, who carries sandalwood paste for the king. Krishna flatters her in a boyish prank tone. The ugly Kubja becomes upset and fells insulted, considering it a sarcastic taunt. However, Krishna explains to her that he was not referring to her physical state but to her inner beauty of the soul and prophesies that the curse of her physical deformity will soon disappear. Krishna asks her to give him the sandalwood paste, which he will deliver it to Kamsa. Kubja is suspicious of Krishna's intention, but slowly begins to trust him. Kubja fears that Kamsa may behead her if she grants Krishna the paste, but Krishna comforts her that he will protect her from the tyrant. She slowly realizes the divine nature of Krishna and is filled with devotion. She comments how she is waiting for him for several lives and the paste was meant for him, ultimately offering the paste as a mark of complete surrender. In sermons, Kubja offers the ointment even without being asked as a gesture of any devotion.Pauwels p. 331-2 After straightening Kubja, she bows to Krishna. There is no hint of erotic overtones to Kubja episode in the television series. Kubja applies the paste on Krishna's feet as a mark of respect as he takes her leave.Pauwels pp. 335-7 Surdas's poetry mentions the episode in a passing reference, however the focus in the text is the saving grace of God, who does not discriminate in devotees and helps even a low class maidservant Kubja.Pauwels pp. 330, 332 In the Bhagavata Purana, after slaying Kamsa, Krishna visits Kubja with Uddhava as promised. Kubja worships Krishna with her companions and offers him a seat of honour. As Kubja readied herself for Krishna, Krishna made himself comfortable in Kubja's bed in the inner chambers.By embracing him, Kubja's desire is fulfilled. She requests Krishna to stay with her for some time, however Krishna left for Uddhava's residence, promising he will fulfil her desires again.Pauwels pp. 333-4Bhagavata Purana 10.48 by Prabhupada Surdas talks about the second meeting of Kubja and Krishna in more detail. He mentions that Kubja's fortune is due to her virtue in a previous life. After killing Kamsa, Krishna hurries to Kubja's house to fulfil her desire.Pauwels p. 335 In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Kubja is the reincarnation of Shurpanakha, a demoness who vied for Rama, Krishna's previous birth on earth. Surpanaka's penance is rewarded in her birth as Kubja, when her desire to unite with Rama is fulfilled.Pauwels pp. 336 The television series as well as other classical works like the Vishnu Purana do not record the visit of Krishna to Kubja's house.Pauwels p. 337 In popular culture The story of Kubja appears in the beginning and the end of the 2019 film Bala, in the form of a school theatre.News 18. If You Criticise Directly, People will Not Listen, Says Bala Director Amar Kaushik 26 November 2019. The reference is made in relation to an underlying theme of colorism in the film.

It has 3414 students (according to Rapport Général de Rentrée 2012-2013) who spend three years at the end of which they take the Baccalaureate Exam. The school is located in Thiès, (a region, 72 kilometers far from Dakar, the capital city of Senegal) in a neighborhood called ‘Cité Malick Sy', and next to the Thiès Gendarmerie headquarters.  History  El Hadji Malick SY High School was created in 1965. Its first headmaster is Mr. Jean GNING. At the beginning there were only two buildings for the classrooms (block A and block and B), the administrative building and the library. Blocks C, D and the dormitory were later built. The dormitory is now called Block E and is used to hold classrooms. The dormitories show that Malick Sy used to be a boarding school with both Junior High and High School students. It was the main school of the region and one of the most famous and best schools in Senegal. Many generations of bright students have been educated there. Some of the current teachers of the school have even been Malick Sy students and are now the colleagues of their former teachers! Due to that kind of process, the school has become a real family for many people. Alumni come from everywhere to either support or just visit their former school. Going back there is like a pilgrimage for many generations.  The Godfather  El Hadji Malick Sy was a respected and venerated religious leader born in Gaya, Saint-Louis (northern Senegal) in 1847 from a Fulani family. Maodo Malick –his nickname- traveled to Mauritania for religious training, and then returned to Saint-Louis in 1884. He went on pilgrimage to Mecca. When he came back from Mecca, he went to teach in Louga and Pire before establishing a ‘Zawiya' (religious center) in Tivaouane in 1902. El Hadji Malick Sy has considerably contributed to the spread of the Tidjaniya brotherhood. He was a very responsible and devout Muslim, and he worked for his country and his religion up to his passing in 1922.  The Baobab Tree  Situated right at the entrance of the school, the Baobab is the symbol of El Hadji Malick SY High School. It is older than the school itself and can be seen from a long distance away. Along with the picture of the Godfather, the baobab is represented on all the official documents of the school and the uniforms of students.  The Administration  The administration plays a huge and difficult role in the school. It is composed of the Headmaster, his Deputy, Teachers, Superintendents, a Bursar, a Social Assistant and a Nurse. Each of them has a specific work to do for the school and towards students. a- The Headmaster & The Deputy Headmaster The current Headmaster is Mr. Ahmed Iyane DIOP. His Deputy is Mr. Cheikh Tidjane KEITA. They both used to teach respectively Physical Education and Philosophy in the school. The Headmaster rules the administration. He is responsible for everything that happens in the school and is backed up by the Deputy Headmaster. The latter controls teachers, students and makes sure discipline and order prevail in the school. He assists and replaces the Headmaster when needed. They are the highest authorities of the school. b- Superintendents & Teachers The superintendents keep an eye on students' attendance. In case the latter need to be absent they have to go to see them in order to have valid justifications that could allow them to keep attending classes when back. The deputy Headmaster also works with them about students' reports. Beyond giving knowledge, there are teachers who do their best to make students be in good working conditions. They tutor clubs, organize students in educational groups and alert them on things related to their day-to-day life. They cheer them up when they want to give up because studying is sometimes hard, and they help them to behave well the whole year long.  Subjects  At Malick SY High School students learn many interesting subjects which help them have a wide range of choices after passing their Baccalaureate exam. There is a total of 14 subjects taught. Scientific branches have mathematics, physics and chemistry and biology as majors. They use two labs. One of them was totally renewed and renovated by the Hope Project for Senegal last year. It's now called Papa Mballo Diallo Lab. The literary branches learn French, English, history & geography, philosophy and foreign languages- Spanish, Portuguese, German and Arabic. This year, we're lucky enough to have an English library thanks to the help of the HOPE Project for Senegal, again! It's called Malick Sy English Corner and is dedicated to a former English Club member who died in 2012. His name is Papa Mamadou Sow. All branches have Physical Education- with 3 football playgrounds, 2 basketball fields, 2 handball fields, a Senegalese Wrestling arena and a gymnasium. Due to the lack of space and facilities, many other schools from different neighborhoods come to Malick SY to do P.E.  Students  The students of El Hadji Malick SY High School are very proud and always try hard to be good representatives of their beloved school to the highest level. It's important to remind people that this school has contributed a lot to the training of the Senegalese intelligentsia. Indeed, many personalities in Senegal and even some well-known people in the world were Malick SY students. Students also represent the high school in contests like the Senegalese General Contest, the English Lovers Awards and so on.  The School Government  The School Government is an organization supervised by the administration and led by students. It's been created to be the voice of students in administrative, social and educational matters. It's made up of a presidency and different commissions such as Sports, Human Rights, Finance, Culture, etc. It's also the link between the administration and the different clubs of the school. Those clubs (English, Literature, Arabic, German, Gymnastic, etc.) play a very active and associative role in the school. They are very creative and innovative in improving the levels and welfare of students. They are led by students and represent El Hadji Malick SY High School everywhere in Senegal.

The Nauen Plateau () is a low plateau in the German states of Brandenburg and Berlin. It rises above the surrounding countryside by an average of and is a largely contiguous upland area that was formed during the Saale and Weichselian glaciations. It consists predominantly of ground moraine deposits, partly overlain by gently rolling end moraine formations. Whilst the neighbouring regions of Zauche to the south, the Teltow to the southeast and the Barnim to the northeast have the same name as their geological formation, the cultural landscape on the Nauen Plateau bears the historical and regional name of Havelland. That said, the river country of the Havelland extends beyond the plateau to include the Havel valley and other lowland areas.  Location  The Nauen Plateau lies in the central Mark and in the extreme west of the state of Berlin. Its northern boundary is formed by a glacial meltwater valley, the Berlin Urstromtal, and by the former marshlands of the Havelland Luch, now part of the West Havelland Nature Park. North of the luch is the smaller ridge of Ländchen Glien. The Plateau's eastern boundary is formed by the Berlin-Potsdam chain of Havelsee lakes, which separates the Nauen Plateau here from the plateau of Teltow. After turning westwards at the Templiner See the Havel valley between Potsdam and Brandenburg an der Havel marks the boundary of the Nauen Plateau to the south and separates it from the Zauche region. Newly planted Theodor Fontane pear tree near the village church of Ribbeck The Havel valley also borders the region to the west, where the river swings north again after passing through the Plauer See. Between Pritzerbe, part of the town of Havelsee, and Paulinenaue, the western boundary of the Nauen Plateau runs west of the Garlitz and Ribbeck Heaths and east of the bird reserve established for the great bustard. Its entire area covers about . From west to east it measures around 45 kilometres and from north to south around 20 kilometres.  Settlements and natural landscapes  Like the cities of Berlin and Potsdam, the eponymous town of Nauen lies on the perimeter of the plateau; on its northern rim. Other large settlements on the plateau are Wustermark, Brieselang, Dallgow-Döberitz and Ketzin. The towns, villages and municipalities on the plateau mainly lie in the two counties of Potsdam- Mittelmark and Havelland. 1905 map Outlier of the Havel in Berlin-Gatow Windmühlenberg Nature Reserve in Gatow The Nauen Plateau was designated as a region suitable for wind power; as a result the Ketzin Wind Park has been built here. It comprises eight 2.3 megawatt N90 turbines with a total output of 18.4 MW. The wind park with its 100-metre-high tubular towers joined the national grid in June 2005.Press release by the manufacturer, Nordex SE, dated 27 June 2005 In the years that followed, other facilities were installed. In July 2012 there were 21 wind generation facilities in Ketzin and Ketzin II with a total output of 48.5 MW.Liste of wind parks, retrieved August 2012 By April 2013 there were about 160 wind generators on the Nauen Plateau. The former military training area of Döberitz Heath has now become a nature reserve and is home to a rare type of vegetation, dry, sandy, grassland flora. The Döberitz Heath and Ferbitzer Busch nature reserves together cover around . The Windmühlenberg Nature Reserve on the eastern slopes of the plateau above the River Havel in Gatow, a quarter of Berlin's Spandau borough, also supports dry, sandy, grassland flora.  Geostructure  The ground moraine and terminal moraine depositions of the Nauen Plateau are partially overlain by marls and glacial sands, left behind by the waters of the thawing ice sheet about 15,000 years before the end of the Weichsel glaciation. The glacial shaping of the relief resulted in a succession of glacial drift, confined space in a change from clays, tills, sands and gravels. On the slopes of the plateau above the Havel lowlands, layers of sand, 10 metres thick, occur at the surface near Groß Glienicke, Kladow and Gatow, such as at the Gatow hill of Windmühlenberg, on the Gatow Heath or near Karolinenhöhe. The dry, nutrient-poor sand here is ideal for the extreme habitat needed for dry grassland. The remaining soils on the surface of the Upper Pleistocene landscape area are dominated, on the one hand, by rusty brown earth (Braunerde) that, with good aeration and deep rooting forms similar habitats to that of the dry sands and nutrient-poor areas. On the other hand, parabraunerde soils, with their higher humus and clay content, such as those in the Gatower Feldflur Nature Reserve, offer the best conditions for agriculture.

Introduction  FISSEQ combines the spatial context of RNA-FISH and the global transcriptome profiling of RNA-seq. FISSEQ preserves the tissue allowing single molecule in situ RNA localization. The foundation of the method is a novel nucleic acid sequencing library construction method that stably cross-links cDNA amplicons within biological samples. Sequencing data is then generated through an intensive interleaved microscopy and biochemistry protocol and subsequent image processing and bioinformatics. FISSEQ is compatible with diverse sample types including cell culture, tissue sections, and whole mount embryos. FISSEQ is an example of an extremely dense form of in-situ nucleic acid readout: every letter along the RNA chain is read. Thus, barcodes for FISSEQ can be packed into a short string of DNA, as short as 15-20 nucleotides long for the mouse brain or 5 nucleotides for targeted cancer gene panels.  Methods  FISSEQ Schematic: A tagged random hexamer primer is used to prime M-MuLV reverse transcriptase to generate aminoallyl dUTP- modified cDNA fragments in fixed cells or tissues from RNA. BS(PEG)9 permanently cross-links the modified cDNA and the cellular protein matrix. After cDNA circularization, Phi29 DNA polymerase generates cDNA amplicons. Amplicons in 3D in situ RNA sequenced within the cell. In FISSEQ, a series of biochemical processing steps, such as DNA ligations or single-base DNA polymerase extensions, are performed on a block of fixed tissue, interlaced with fluorescent imaging steps. The process is conceptually identical to the mechanism of fluorescent sequencing by synthesis in a commercial bulk DNA sequencing machine, except that it is performed in fixed tissue. Each DNA or RNA molecule in the sample is first “amplified” (i.e., copied) in-situ via rolling-circle amplification to create a localized “rolling circle colony” (rolony) consisting of identical copies of the parent molecule. A series of biochemical steps are then carried out. In the kth cycle, a fluorescent tag is introduced, the color of which corresponds to the identity of the kth base along the rolony’s parent DNA strand. The system is then “paused” in this state for imaging. The entire sample can be imaged in each cycle. The fluorescent tags are then cleaved and washed away, and the next cycle is initiated. Each rolony – corresponding to a single “parent” DNA or RNA molecule in the tissue – thus appears across a series of fluorescent images, as a localized “spot” with a sequence of colors corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the parent molecule. The nucleotide sequence of each DNA or RNA molecule is thus read out in-situ via fluorescent microscopy.  History  The development of FISSEQ began over a decade ago. The underlying principles are similar to those that ushered in the sequencing revolution. In both bulk high-throughput sequencing and FISSEQ, short sequences are locally amplified and then imaged one nucleotide at a time. However, the requirement to sequence RNA in intact tissue—rather than isolated and purified DNA, as in conventional bulk sequencing—posed additional challenges. These limitations were overcome, and FISSEQ allows the joint, high-throughput readout of sequence and spatial information.

Career In 1968, Cole graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree from the University of Sydney and joined the Department of the Treasury. From 1979 Cole spent two years as a senior World Bank official, saying these years were crucial in developing his views on economic policy. Shortly after in 1983 Cole was appointed principal private secretary to Treasurer Paul Keating, working in the role until October 1985. He was appointed the thirteenth Secretary of the Department of the Treasury in 1991, remaining in the role until 1993 when he transferred to another role as Secretary of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services (later Department of Human Services and Health). There was speculation at the time that Cole was removed as Treasury Secretary due to evidence he gave to a Senate inquiry into Victoria's debt blowout, the Treasurer, John Dawkins, denied the suggestion, stating that his move was just a normal part of the re-establishment of administration following an election. Cole left the public service in 1994, aged 47. When he left, John Taylor, the Commonwealth Auditor-General at the time, told media \\"it's a tragedy that somebody of the standing and even future potential of Tony Cole should be lost to public service\\". After leaving the public sector, Cole was a Senior Investment Consultant and Executive in the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation’s investment consulting business for 17 years, including heading the business in the Asia Pacific region for more than five years. In 2013 and 2014, he was a member of the Abbott Government's National Commission of Audit, which was established to improve the Australian government's budget.

The game is currently moderated by Alamaze.co. Description Alamaze was a computer- moderated play-by-mail game designed by Rick McDowell. In the May & June 1986 issue of Paper Mayhem magazine, Pegasus Productions announced that their first several games were filled and they were going \\"full speed ahead\\" with play. The rulebook listed the various orders the players could send; each order was numbered — this indicated in which priority sequence the order would happen. When players signed up to play, they received setup information about which kingdom they would control, and the map location of that kingdom. The cost of setup was $15, and included two rulebooks, a map, and covered the first two turns. Thereafter the cost was $6 per turn. Each turn took about two weeks to process and return, and each turn covered one month in game time. A large part of the game was diplomacy, and successful players were expected to contact other player by phone to form alliances or seek information. Gameplay Each game of Alamaze involves fifteen players, each one controlling a different kingdom. There are eighteen possible kingdoms: Giants, Paladins, Gnomes, Elves, Darkelves, Rangers, Uriks, Westmen, Halflings, Dragons, Nomads, Dwarves, Barbarians, Swampmen, the Sorceror, the Witchlord, the Warlock, and the Underworld. The inhabitants of each kingdom each have different advantages and each has a special victory condition. Each player has varying numbers of * Troops: for conquering new territories * Agents: can be spies or assassins * Emissaries: sent on diplomatic missions * Leaders: lead the military groups. As they progress in levels, they confer increasing bonuses to the group's strength * Wizards: The only wielders of magic in the game. Each kingdom has a fixed number of wizards; their maximum level varies from kingdom to kingdom. All these various characters can advance in levels except the troops. The game is played out on a 26 x 26 grid map, 676 squares of various types of terrain such as forest, mountains and cities, all of which have an effect on both movement and combat. Each player only has a rough idea of what the map contains, and must explore it, square by square, to uncover the locations of special items and other kingdoms. There are three paths to victory: # Take control of six out of ten regions on the map # Meet the specific victory condition given to your kingdom # Have the greatest number of status points at the end of Turn 40. Players can only write a number of orders each turn equal to their king's Influence, which starts at 12–15, depending on the kingdom. This can increase or decrease depending on actions of the player and his opponents. If the player is able to win a seat on the five-member High Council, the king's Influence increases by 1. However, each king hides three secrets. If any of these are discovered by another player and revealed, the king loses Influence, and if a member of the High Council, is removed from it. Each kingdom can have a maximum of four military groups, which can be composed of archers, cavalry, infantry, leaders and wizards. These military groups have 20 movement points per turn, but this is affected by terrain, and each kingdom has advantages and disadvantages in certain types of terrain. Players must pay their followers and feed their citizenry in order to accomplish anything. For example, it costs 6,000 gold to use a prince emissary. The money and food comes from human habitations: village produce a little gold and a lot of food; towns produce more gold than food; cities produce a lot of gold, but cost food rather than produce it. In the three months of the winter, gold production is halved and food production is 25% of normal. Other possible orders for player included trading surpluses of food or gold with other kingdoms, searching for artifacts, or having a wizard cast spells. (Each spellcasting has a cost dependent on the level of the spell.) Reception In the March 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue 131), Michael Gray enjoyed the game, calling it \\"a treat\\". Gray liked the computer moderation, and the priority number of each possible order. He did have issues with the high-level spells he was given, finding them underpowered. Gray also didn't like the fact that \\"an enemy player can hit and run before you can catch him. For example, an enemy group can show up at one of my towns on one turn, then attack the town on the next turn, capture it, and move away before I can catch it. I can use an agent to find out where the group went, but unless I am lucky, it can always stay one jump ahead of me.\\" Gray also found $6 per turn to be very high for a game that might last as long as 40 turns, and warned that players would have to spend a lot of time (and possibly a lot of money on long-distance charges) in order to coordinate with other players. However, overall, he highly recommended the game. Reviewer Jim Townsend stated in White Wolf Magazine in 1988 that \\"Alamaze is possibly the finest PBM game in existence\\", noting that it was \\"the most innovative design since the first PBM game emerged\\". Townsend noted at the time that even though the game still had significant issues, and experienced players had \\"a MASSIVE advantage\\" over novices, Alamaze \\"should still be tried by anyone who considers [themselves] a real gamer\\". Stewart Wieck reviewed the game in 1991 in White Wolf No. 21, stating that \\"Alamaze is the best fantasy PBM game I have ever played, and if not for a few problems with the program itself and a slightly erratic turn-around time, Alamaze would win my highest rating\\". Wieck gave Alamaze an overall rating of 4 out of a possible 5. Awards Alamaze was awarded the Origins Award for \\"Best Play-by-Mail Game of 1987\\". Also in 1987, Alamaze tied for first place with Hyborian War for Best PBM Game of 1987 in Paper Mayhem, a magazine for play-by-mail gamers. In 1989, Alamaze tied for second place for Best PBM Game of 1989 with Kings & Things* in Paper Mayhem magazine.

She delivered submarines to Brazil and Peru before the war began. Requisitioned in 1914 by the French Navy, she was torpedoed by a German submarine in late 1916 and sunk at Funchal, Madeira. Background and description Kanguroo was a ship built to transport submarines for the shipbuilder Schneider et Cie. The company's submarines were too small and their endurance too limited to cross the oceans on their own. Schneider deemed towing them too risky so the company commissioned a purpose-built ship to deliver them safely to their destination. She was long with a beam of and a draft of .Croce, p. 199 The shipCouhat, p. 247 displaced and could carry out- sized cargo up to in weight. Kanguroo was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine driving a single shaft that gave her a speed of . She had a crew of four officers and eighteen enlisted crewmen.Garier, p. 231 Bow of the Kanguroo with the plating removed The ship was essentially a self-propelled floating dry dock with three main sections. The stern contained the engine, bridge, crew accommodations, workshops, pumps, electric generators and storage facilities for the submarine's torpedoes. The submarine's batteries were kept charged during the voyage by the current from the generators. The middle section consisted of a double-hulled well deck with ballast tanks between its inner walls and the outer hull. The well deck had a capacity of and was closed off by a pair of water-tight doors at its forward end. The outer plating and structural members of Kanguroos bow were designed to be partially dismantled to give access to the short tunnel through the bow to the well deck. Additional ballast tanks were positioned below and on each side of the tunnel to raise and lower the bow.Croce, pp. 199–200 Loading a submarine was a lengthy process that took weeks. The first step was to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water- tight doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.Croce, p. 200  Construction and service  The Peruvian submarine Ferre being loaded aboard Kanguroo Kanguroo was launched by Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde on 12 April 1912 at their shipyard in Bordeaux.Garier, p. 233 She loaded the on 28 June at Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, but did not depart for Callao until 30 July. She arrived in Peru on 19 October, after stops in São Vicente, Cape Verde, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo, but could not unload the submarine until 29 October. The ship delivered Ferres sister ship in 1913 and the the following year.Croce, p. 202 Kanguroo (foreground) sinking, 3 December 1916 After the start of World War I in August 1914, the French Navy requisitioned the Kanguroo. She was torpedoed and sank at the Port of Funchal, Madeira on 3 December 1916, together with the and the elderly British cable layer , by the German submarine . A total of thirty-three foreign crewmen and eight Portuguese nationals died during the attack. A monument with a sculpture by Francisco Franco de Sousa was raised in 1917 to commemorate the incident.

Although Himeros never took the title of king, he was of great significance. He is mentioned by various ancient historians, such as Diodorus and Justin on account of his exceptional atrocities. Phraates II was confronted with war on two fronts during his reign. In the west, the Seleucids attacked and in the east the nomadic peoples, who had already destroyed the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, threatened. Phraates II moved east against these nomads and appointed Himeros who was one of his favourites on account of his good appearance as satrap in Mesopotamia. Himeros' tenure stood out principally for his tyrannical atrocities and constant harassment of his subjects in Babylon and the surrounding cities. He would have even his own underlings sold into slavery. He set fire to the agora and the temple of Babylon and destroyed wide sections of the city. Perhaps because of this, his rule, which also encompassed Seleucia on the Tigris and Ctesiphon, seems to have been very brief indeed. Shortly before 127 BC, Hyspaosines is attested in Babylon as ruler. The later fate of Himeros is unknown.

The Chennai Egmore–Thanjavur main line is part of Chennai–Viluppuram–Mayiladuthurai–Kumbakonam–Thanjavur–Tiruchirappalli line. There are several branch lines (included here): Chengalpattu–Arakkonam links to Chennai Central–Bengaluru City line, Guntakal–Chennai Egmore section), Viluppuram–Puducherry, Cuddalore–Virudhachalam, Mayiladuthurai–Thiruvarur, and Peralam–Nagapattinam sectors. The line connects the Kaveri delta to Chennai.  History  The \\"main line\\" of the metre gauge railway system in the Coromandel coast connected Chennai with Tiruchchirappalli via Viluppuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Kumbakonam, and Thanjavur junctions. The Chennai–Mayiladuthurai–Thanjavur–Tiruchirappalli line continues to be thought of as the \\"main line\\". In 1861 the Great Southern Railway of India built the long wide broad gauge line between Nagapattinam and Tiruchirapalli (then known as Trichinopoly) and the line was opened to traffic next year. It was a new development south of Chennai. After taking over of GSIR by South Indian Railway Company in 1874, the Nagapattinam–Tiruchirapalli line was converted to wide metre gauge in 1875. Again after conversion, the long wide broad gauge line between Nagapattinam and Tiruchirapalli was opened in 2001-02 The South India Railway Company laid a long metre gauge trunk line from Chennai to Thoothukudi via Viluppuram, Cuddalore Port (then known as Cuddalore Junction), Mayiladuthurai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirapalli (then known as Trichinopoly), Madurai, Virudhunagar in 1880. The long Tindivanam-Cuddalore Port (then known as Cuddalore Junction) sector, long Cuddalore Port-Porto Novo sector and long Shyali-Mayiladuthurai sector were opened in 1877, thereby connecting Tindivanam to the already opened Tiruchirappalli-Nagapattinam line. But during Gauge Conversion in years 1995-2000 the long Tindivanam-Cuddalore Port (then known as Cuddalore Junction) sector, long Cuddalore Port-Porto Novo sector & long Shyali-Mayiladuthurai sector were never made into wide broad gauge line. Following an agreement between the British and the French, a long metre gauge line was laid between Puducherry and Viluppuram around 1877–1879. A wide line was laid between Arakkonam and Kanchipuram (then known as Conjeevaram) in 1865 by Indian Tramway Company. The line was converted to metre gauge in 1878 and opened in 1891. The Chengalpattu-Walajabad line was opened in 1880. Viluppuram was connected to Vriddhachalam railway station in 1927 by a long railway track. The long Mayiladuthurai-Tarangambadi (then known as Tranquebar) line which was opened by British for people in 1926 and was closed in 1987 for broad gauge conversion. But the project is standing still for 33 years now  Suburban railway  A major part of the South Line, Chennai Suburban is part of this line. The area south of Chennai was served by a single line shared by passenger and goods trains till 1931. Electric trains in the sector were planned as early as 1923. Construction work began in 1926 and was completed in 1931. A new line for electric trains was added between Chennai Beach and Egmore, and two lines were added between Egmore and Tambaram. The first MG EMU services were run on 1.5 kV DC overhead lines on 11 May 1931. In the 1960s the Chennai Beach–Tambaram–Viluppuram sector was converted from 1.5 kV DC traction to 25 kV AC traction and limited EMU services were extended to Chengalpet. In 1969, an additional metre gauge track was laid between Tambaram and Chengalpet. Starting with the 1995s the entire area was converted to broad gauge.  Gauge conversions  With the conversion from metre gauge to broad gauge, the entire long Egmore-Tambaram- Tiruchirapalli-Dindigul-Madurai sector was completed, broad gauge passenger traffic was initiated in March 2001. The left over conversion work was then completed and the last metre gauge EMU service ran between Tambaram and Egmore on 1 July 2004. Conversion from metre gauge to broad gauge of the Viluppuram–Puducherry branch line was completed in 2004. The Cuddalore Port Junction railway station–Vriddhachalam railway station sector was converted in 2003. After conversion work of the Thanjavur–Tiruvarur broad gauge section was opened to traffic in 2006 and Tiruvarur–Nagore section in 2010. The long Viluppuram - Thanjavur was converted to Broad Gauge in 2010. A broad gauge line (conversion from metre gauge) connecting Chengalpattu with Arakkonam was built in 1999–2000. The Thakolam-Arakkonam sector had to be realigned because of its proximity to the Arakkonam Naval Air Station.  Electrification  The metre gauge track of Madras Beach-Tambaram sector was electrified in 1931 with 1.5 kV DC overhead system. In the fifties Indian Railways decided on using 25 kV AC overhead system on a national basis. The Madras Beach-Tambaram sector was converted to 25 kV AC overhead system in 1967. The Tambaram-Chengalpattu- Viluppuram sector was electrified in 1964–65 and then again in 2000-01 (after gauge conversion) along with the Chengalpattu-Kanchipuram sector. The broad gauge Viluppuram-Puducherry line was electrified in 2006. The broad gauge Viluppuram-Tiruchirapalli sector was electrified in 2010. New electrification survey in 2012–13 had been sanctioned in the Railway budget for the Karaikkal/Karaikkal port-Thiruvarur-Thanjavur-Tiruchchirappalli and Nagapattinam-Velankkani sectors. The execution of Electrification of Villupuram–Cuddalore Port–Mayiladuturai-Kumbakonam–Thanjavur and Mayiladuturai –Thiruvarur has been given to Rail Vikas Nigam Limited.  Railway reorganization  The Great Southern Railway of India and Carnatic Railway merged to form South Indian Railway Company in 1874. In the early 1950s legislation was passed authorizing the central government to take over independent railway systems that were there. On 14 April 1951 the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway Company and Mysuru State Railway were merged to form Southern Railway. Subsequently, Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was also merged into Southern Railway. On 2 October 1966, the Secunderabad, Solapur, Hubli and Vijayawada Divisions, covering the former territories of Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway and certain portions of Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway were separated from Southern Railway to form the South Central Railway. In 1977, Guntakal division of Southern Railway was transferred to South Central Railway and the Solapur division transferred to Central Railway. Amongst the seven new zones created in 2010 was South Western Railway, which was carved out of Southern Railway.

BUKU considers itself to be a boutique event that delivers a big festival punch without compromising its house-party vibe. BUKU seeks to serve as a platform for the intersection of pop culture and the New Orleans underground arts community, and combines international musicians with local food vendors, local visual artists, and various surprise pop-up street performers throughout the site. BUKU's musical tastes have been a relatively even mix of electronic dance music, hip hop music, and indie rock featuring past performances by Bassnectar, Lana Del Rey, Kid Cudi, Migos, MGMT, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, Illenium, Nas, Excision, Major Lazer, Alt-J, TV on the Radio, A Day to Remember, REZZ, Flosstradamus, deadmau5, Kendrick Lamar, Porter Robinson, Pretty Lights, RL Grime, Seth Troxler, Future, Ellie Goulding and dozens of others. Like other festivals and mass gatherings, BUKU 2020 was forced to postpone due to COVID-19. Buku said they would offer refunds, but did not give a deadline date readily visible in any social media online or in emails to ticket holders. Apparently, you had to dig for it. They sent one email to this effect, which again did not include a date or detail of the process, and then transferred tickets later without warning in order to keep more money. BUKU 2021 is scheduled to take place on March 19 and 20. Location and Stages Aerial Shot of BUKU 2019 The festival is held on the New Orleans riverfront at Mardi Gras World, within walking distance of the Warehouse District and the famed French Quarter. BUKU's unique stages include the Power Plant (outside along the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad with the spooky Market Street Power Plant as the backdrop), the Ballroom (a concert hall with wrap around balcony viewing), the Back Alley (tucked away with the feel of a secret riverside dance party), which was replaced by the Wharf Stage in 2018, and the Float Den (one of the leading Mardi Gras float production houses). Being on the Mississippi River allows BUKU fans incredible views of the Crescent City Connection bridge while boats and barges roll along the river. The Creole Queen riverboat (2012-2017) docked next to the festival, acting as the VIP-only S.S. BUKU for the weekend, with an open bar, special performances and a viewing area of the main stage from the boat's top deck. In 2018, the festival doubled the size of its site space outside Mardi Gras World and increased its capacity to another 3,000 people each day, totaling 35,000 across its two-day event. This site expansion allowed BUKU to move the Power Plant Stage across the train tracks for even more space, including the new TOO BUKU Rooftop providing VIP ticket holders a perfect view of the main stage. The Wharf Stage, which replaced the Back Alley Stage, is located next to the Mississippi River where the Power Plant Stage used to be. Another big change was the departure of the river boat and the addition of the new VIP Stage, located at the VIP grove near the main stage. In 2020, BUKU announced more changes to the site and an increased capacity of 25,000 people per day. The 2020 stages include the Port (renamed main stage), The Stacks (located directly in front of the Market Street Power Plant), a new space for the Float Den, Ballroom and The Wharf. https://www.thebukuproject.com/vibe/ Artwork BUKU Billboard at the 2019 Festival In addition to the musical performances, BUKU features installations by prevalent local and national artists. Sculptures, paintings, graffiti, and other mediums are all included, including the annual live graffiti gallery, the pieces of which are created in real time during the festival's two days and auctioned off to fans to raise money for charity. Past live graffiti gallery artists include Hugo Gyrl, Ceaux, DVOTE, Fat Kids, READ, KNOWLA, MEEK, Monica Kelly, Swan, Uter and more. Other notable art pieces featured at BUKU include the Live Graffiti Gallery, Fort BUKU, L-System Tree, Water Tower, The Beacon and more. Art installations at BUKU are typically fabricated from recycled industrial materials such as IBC totes, pipes and shipping containers. Furthermore, BUKU curates a program of surprise pop-up performers and revelers ranging from break dancers, bounce dancers, circus troupe performers, flow artists, mobile DJ carts and more. BUKU also focuses on an all illustrated branding approach conceptualized by Los Angeles- based music and art enigma Young & Sick, who also made his debut festival performance on the Float Den stage at BUKU in 2014. In 2019, the festival rebranded under the direction of electronic music producer and designer Paper Diamond. Charity In 2013, BUKU announced its charitable partner Upbeat Academy, an after-school music education program for New Orleans middle- and high school students with a focus on hiphop and dance music production and performance. Upbeat is free to attend for all student-artists and is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Every year, a portion of every ticket sold to BUKU Music + Art Project benefits the program. Additionally, student artists and Upbeat Alumni also perform at the festival.

The 30 day period during which purchasers may choose to either select a refund or transfer their tickets to March 20-21, 2021, closes on May 7, 2020, at 11:59PM CT. If you did not receive an email and would like to transfer your order or get a refund, please contact infoATthebukuprojectDOTcom. If you do not actively choose one of these options by May 7, 2020 at 11:59PM CT, we will automatically transfer your tickets to March 20-21, 2021.\\" 1\\\\. The policy was not outlined in the email or on social media. There was a buried link, which you then had to follow further. All process details were hidden from immediate view and had to be searched for. No wording from that notice above was included in the email or on the front page of their website as it should have been. At a minimum, the deadline noted above should have been posted with every notice. 2\\\\. This announcement also assumes you received the email in the first place or saw it in the short four- week time frame, which if you happened to be a first-line responder, technology worker, teacher, or involved in many other fields for that matter, you may not have seen. This is a pandemic and that month's time period was filled with uncertainty and time-consuming challenges for everyone. 3\\\\. There was one email on April 7, 2020 as noted, nothing more about the process or deadline in the following month. No additional social media post either, despite many comments on those platforms that went unanswered. The next email was on May 8, 2020 saying thank you for transferring your ticket. 4\\\\. You were likely to only see the above statement if you got the second email of transfer because you wanted your money back and went looking for help. However, if you did reach out to the email address listed and try to state your case, they said they could not help, they were just the ticketing agency, and referred you to another Buku email address, which chose not to respond at all - to multiple attempts. This lack of transparency and lack of response not only shows an incredible lack of compassion but feels extremely shady and irresponsible in the time of Covid. Hiding the true process and deadlines were a deliberate attempt to force ticket transfers and keep more money. Unethical is a better description. Someone recently changed this page to say \\"BUKU 2021 is scheduled to take place on March 19 and 20.\\" instead of the previously stated \\"will take place...\\" Scheduled instead of will - interesting development. Let's hope they can make things right if they have to do this a second time. Otherwise, buy your ticket secondhand before buying directly from them if you plan on still supporting this unethical organization.

Its Facebook page and Google app appeared in 2013.] The literal translation of Hou de kharcha is \\"let there be expenditure\\", analogous to the American English phrase \\"make it rain\\". The meme usually consists of an image of a person appearing triumphant, with a caption congratulating them on achieving petty materialistic milestones such as \\"Buying Shoes\\", \\"Light Diwali Crackers With\\", or \\"Buying an Enfield Bullet by Way of a Loan\\". The meme arose in mockery of the practice of Indian politicians erecting large numbers of hoardings (billboards) in order to announce minor or routine events.  Background  Indian politicians in Maharashtra use hoardings for petty things like birthday wishes for other politician of the same party or wishing holidays. When the former revenue minister Narayan Rane celebrated his birthday in 2008, scores of hoardings were put up across the state. Similarly, a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator had 4,000 hoardings put up across the city following his election. Politician like Raj Thackeray have asked his partymen to stop putting up these hoardings. Thus in parts of India, hoardings with picture of political activists and message of birthdays, honor, steadfast support etc. are common sights.] Recognising the humour potential in this practise, people created memes mocking the excessive congratulating of small events by adding captions to digital images, and shared these \\"Hou De Kharcha\\" memes via Facebook and Whatsapp  Popularity  This meme became a viral trend among the Marathi- speaking crowd around the globe through social media.] The meme's official Hou de Kharcha Facebook page has over 1,65,000 fans and receives 100+ image requests everyday as of December 2013.

He led the ill-fated Swedish NW Greenland Expedition, also known as Björling–Kallstenius Expedition, in 1892.  Life  Björling was born on 19 October 1871 in Stockholm, Sweden and was the son of Johan Alfred Björling and Lydia Kastengren. He passed his studentexamen in 1891 and took part in the 1890 expedition to Spitsbergen and shipped in 1891 a Greenlandic merchant ship to the west coast of Greenland, where he using a rowboat penetrated north to the area of Devils Thumb. He died in 1892 or 1893 in the Canadian Arctic. He was the nephew of Swedish mathematician Emanuel Björling (1808–1872).  Expeditions  In the summer of 1889 as a 17‑year‑old, he led an expedition along with two companions to become the first to climb Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in Sweden. In 1890, he participated in an expedition to Greenland and Spitsbergen. He continued his exploration of Greenland by going to Upernivik, which is the northernmost part of Greenland. From there he successfully rowed an Eskimo boat all the way north to the Devil's Thumb. =1892 Swedish NW Greenland Expedition= In the spring of 1892 he was on the EGG Kallstenius, heading for northwest Greenland. His planned to survey the largely unexplored polar basin at the northern tip of North America. His route passed through Newfoundland, where he met bought a schooner called Ripple for the trip north. He also hired a crew and bought provisions for the trip. The ship sailed and was never heard from again. The next time people heard about the company was through a telegram, sent on November 1893 by the whaler Aurora, which stated that the ship had passed the wrecks of Ripple on June 17 of that year at the mouth of Smith Sound. Notes found later revealed details of Björling's tragic expedition. According to the notes, Ripple sailed from Godhavn on August 2, 1892 toward Baffin Bay, and crossing it to Melville Bay to Cape York. From there Björling moved on to Carey Islands to replenish his supplies from the English depot there. His ship, however, had to be abandoned at the island's south coast. After that, instead of trying to head for Greenland's west coast, where the expedition almost certainly would have been rescued, Björling headed north to Northumberlandön and from there back to the Carey Islands, finally arriving in Ellesmereland. There Björling hoped to meet Eskimos and ask for food and help. Unfortunately, that never happened. Posthumous honours Björlingø, an island of the Carey group is named after this Swedish explorer.

Plot synopsis As with all the subsequent Union Club stories, the story is related by a man called Griswold to other club members in the club bar. Some time ago, Griswold sold an unspecified idea or invention to a wealthy man called Felix Hammock, who made a profit of ten million dollars from Griswold's idea but only paid him ten thousand dollars and no royalties. Griswold felt aggrieved by this, but failed to obtain legal redress against Hammock or to persuade him to voluntarily pay more. Griswold decided to get even with Hammock by summoning a tiny supernatural creature from another universe and enlisting its aid. The creature, which is not named in this story, is described as being two centimetres tall, with no tail or horns, and \\"not red exactly, or black. Rather lavender, I should say.\\" It offered to help Griswold steal something of value from Hammock, without actually injuring him. Although it was capable of stealing anything Griswold could think of, it had only limited powers and so could only steal no more than about two grams of matter. Therefore, the puzzle Griswold had to solve was how to steal something valuable to Hammock which would not exceed that mass. Griswold then invites his listeners to try to work out what he did. (Asterisks then appear in the text so that the reader may also attempt to do so before continuing.) When the other club members fail to solve the problem, Griswold describes his solution. He had the creature steal particular flakes of paint from Hammock's collection of original Picasso paintings – specifically, he stole Picasso's signature from each painting, reducing the value of Hammock's art collection by at least ten million dollars. He then visited Hammock at home in order to witness his anguish at the moment of discovering his loss.

DR. Ondřej Ditrych is the director of the IIR.https://iir.cz/article/novym-reditelem-umv-se-stal-ondrej- ditrych The founder of the IIR is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (MFA). The institutional support of the IIR comes mostly from the state budget for science, research, and innovation of the Czech Republic, contributions of the MoFA and projects of the targeted support financed by local and foreign subjects. The IIR carries out independent research in public interest. Ondřej Ditrych, director of the IIR  History = Before 1989 = The first suggestion for the foundation of an institution that would engage in research of international relations and work under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared very soon after the end of WW2. However, the communist revolution of 1948 stopped any plans for such an institution.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV.

OCLC 247489592 Therefore, not such institution was founded until 1957 when the IIR predecessor the Institute for International Politics and Economy was established.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 s. Available online. , . OCLC 247489592 The Institute had a seat in one of the Petschke villas in the Prague district Bubeneč and it was later moved to the Lobkowitz Palace in Malá Strana (another Prague district) where it resided until 1970.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV.

The Institute for International Politics and Economy (Ústav pro mezinárodní politiku ekonomii-ÚMPE) became a significant research institution with a great reputation abroad in a very short time. Its high number of foreign connections, a good overview of the international situation and knowledge of the then current scientific research became very problematic for some of the Institute's employees at the end of the 1960s. During the Prague Spring some of the employees of the Institute became an active part of the reforming processes which resulted in the cancellation of the ÚMPE and the dismissal of some of its employees at the beginning of the normalization process in 1970. Some of them later emigrated.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů : od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 9. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 S. 14-17. As a replacement for the ÚMPE, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia founded the Institute of International Relations in 1970.Encyklopedie českých právních dějin. Vydání první. vyd. Plzeň: [s.n.] , . OCLC 953824143 p. 43. The historical building the House of the White Horse which stands in Nerudova street in Malá Strana, became its seat. The IIR has had its seat there up until the present. The greater freedom of society in the second half of the 60s was reduced again by gradually increasing ideological pressure, control, and censorship. Despite this, the IIR still tried to stay in touch with other countries including western countries.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 p. , . OCLC 247489592 p. 147-153. At this time the IIR had the best equipped and supplied library in the field of international studies in Czechoslovakia however it was not accessible to public and even the scientists had to have special authorization to read many of the (mostly foreign) publications.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 s. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 p. 147,231. = After 1989 = The key changes in the operating of the IIR came after the events of 1989. For the IIR the Velvet Revolution meant not only vast personnel changes but also a journey to becoming a truly independent scientific institution. In the coming years the IIR mainly underwent radical de-ideologization and de-politicization, while there was also a great emphasis on active connections with other countries and making it so that the expertise of the IIR's employees would be as high as possible. Professor Otto Pick, who led the IIR in the years 1994-1998, played a key role in the process of this change.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 s. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 S. 193 - 207. On the edge of the millennium, the IIR was definitely already a confident, independent and highly professional institution that contributed to the development of international studies. Together with its newly set goals, the IIR continued in its support of the foreign policy of the newly created Czech Republic. For example, the Diplomatic Academy which was founded in 1997 and serves as a preparatory school for diplomatic workers of the Czech Republic, was part of the IIR for almost ten years. The Development Center was also created under the auspices of the IIR in 2001. This center closely cooperated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding questions of foreign development.Encyklopedie českých právních dějin. Vydání první. vyd. Plzeň: [s.n.] volumes s. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 953824143 p. 43. In 2007 under the law n. 341/2005 about public research institutions, the IIR was transformed into a public research institution and elements of autonomy were brought into its organization.INFO@AION.CZ, AION CS-. 341/2005 Sb. Zákon o veřejných výzkumných institucích. Zákony pro lidi [online]. [cit. 2019-10-16]. Dostupné online.

Current Activities = Research = The activities of the IIR consist of its independent research and general popularization and educational activities. The IIR, therefore, creates a unique bond between the academic world, the public and the practice of international politics. The key activity of the IIR is independent research in the field of international relations. The research must follow the priorities defined in the Conception of the Development of the IIR for the years 2018-2022 and it also follows the Conception of Research of the MoFA for the years 2017-2021. The IIR implements two general kinds of research. The first one is elementary, academic research that has theoretical variety and methodological accuracy and whose ambition is visibility on both the domestic scene and abroad. The second one is practically oriented on applied research that utilizes broad knowledge that comes mostly from the IIR's own research and is based on advanced analytical and research methods. This research is mostly used by the MFA but sometimes it is also used by other public institutions.https://iir.cz/static/vyzkum-na-umv The research activities of the IIR are run by the research department whose director is currently Professor Emil Aslan .https://www.iir.cz/en/static/assoc-prof-emil-aslan-souleimanov-is-now-the- director-of-research-at-the-iir The department is divided into six research centers: = The Center for European Security = Studies security questions concerning Europe from broad, interdisciplinary point of view; the studied issues range from conventional military threats to new topics such as hybrid threats.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for-european-integration = The Center for European Integration = Investigates processes, institutions, and actors of European politics with a special emphasis on questions of European integration. It deals mostly with processes of integration and differentiation in the European Union as well as the Czech Republic as a part of the EU. Last but not least it examines politics of European states while putting emphasis on their international dimension.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for- european-integration = The Center for Energy Policy = Investigates the internal dimension of the energy policy and security of the EU and selected regions. It also continuously monitors and analyzes the external dimension of the European Union's energy policies and security with regard to its present and potential future suppliers in the Middle East, Africa and selected countries in Asia, North America, and Latin America.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for-energy-policy = The Center for Global Political Economy = Studies the mutual entanglement of political and economic power in international relations, the understanding of which is crucial for strategic decision-making of both state and non-state actors in the contemporary globalized world. The research activity pertains to two related levels: international political economy and global justice.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for-political-economy = The Center for International Law = Is focused mainly on analysis of the development of international law in connection with new phenomena and trends of the current world such as globalization, migration or the growing meaning of human rights. The emphasis is put especially on problematics of international organizations, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, international human rights law and usage of power in international relations.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for-international- law = The Center for EU-Asia Relations = Reflects on the convergence of the European and Asian continents in a world of progressing globalization. It focuses the whole Asian region except for the Middle East.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/centre-for-eu-asia-relations  International cooperation  For the purpose of carrying out its research program the IIR internationally networked e.g. in the EU Nonproliferation and Disarmament Consortium, TEPSA (Trans European Policy Studies Association), EPIN (European Policy Institutes Network), the ECPR (European Consortium for Political Research) or EuroMeSCo (Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission). Its foreign partners therefore also include the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI), the Korean Institute of Foreign Affairs and International Security (IFANS) and the Austrian Institut für Wissenschaften vom Menschen (IWM). To give an example of the international activities of the IIR we can mention its production of applied research with a regional (especially in projects of the International Visegrad Fund) and a European dimension (e.g. its participation on TEPSA projects for the European Parliament). https://www.iir.cz/en/static/who-we-are  Educational and popularization activities  One of the elementary goals of the IIR is broadening of the public knowledge about international studies and cultivation and broadening of the horizons of the public debate about international politics in the Czech Republic. For this purpose, the IIR develops many activities, that should target the public as well as experts.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/publishing-department Lecture by the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs The IIR holds many public events such as panel discussions, lectures or big international conferences that usually focus on relevant international topics and questions that come up in the IIR's own research. The most important conferences are the Prague European Summit (PES), the International Symposium \\"Czech Foreign Policy\\" and the Czernin Security Forum which are all held annually. In putting together these conferences the IIR cooperates with important partners such as the MoFA, the Government Office of the Czech Republic, the NATO Public Diplomacy Division, EUROPEUM, PSSI or AMO.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/publishing-department IIR also participates in the education of the students of international studies. It operates as a joint partner in a consortium led by the Faculty of Social Sciences of Charles University, which implements the academic program European Politics and Society (Erasmus Mundus). Last but not least the IIR offers expert internships to Czech and foreign students and university graduates. Research workers of the IIR regularly appear in Czech and foreign media. These appearances take the form of interviews or commentaries or analyses. These appearances enables them to publish the results of their own research and professionally narrate and comment on international events. Almost all of the outputs produced by the IIR are also published and made available to the broad public via many communication channels but mainly through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube).  Publishing activities  The publishing activities of the IIR have a key meaning for its research as well as its popularization and educational activities. The IIR has its own publishing house that deals with the preparation, production, and sales of its periodical and non-periodical publications. The IIR publishes many publications mostly monographies, policy publications and two academic, peer- reviewed periodicals in printed as well as electronic form: the Czech Journal of International Relations and New Perspectives. It also publishes the popularizing magazine International Politics.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/publishing-department = The Czech Journal of International Relations = The tradition of the CJIR goes back to 1966 when the first issue was published as a publication of the ÚMPE. The journal was originally intended as an academic quarterly. Its quality diminished after the normalization, but the fall of the communist regime brought about its radical reform.ŠEDIVÝ, Jaroslav. Mezinárodní vztahy. První pokus o odborný čtvrtletník k nové vědní disciplíně. Mezinárodní vztahy, 2007 Gradually it went back to its original concept namely that of a strictly scientific periodical where Czech, as well as foreign experts, can publish the results of their research. Nowadays the CJIR is peer-reviewed journal that is run according to the regular standards of academic publishing (every admitted text must go through a double-blind, anonymous review procedure). The CJIR is a leading Czech platform for publishing of original results of independent research in the field of international relations. = New Perspectives = The IIR started to publish the journal New Perspectives in 1993.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 p. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 p. 231. The main goal of this journal was to publish articles in the English language about Central Europe, as this condition would enable it to reach a broader audience. The journal was also valuable for the IIR's library during the post- Velvet Revolution era because it could be exchanged commodity with other research facilities for valuable foreign publications.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů : od ÚMPE k ÚMV.

Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 s. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 S. 231 In the more than 25 years of its existence the journal became a respected, leading academic periodical that deals with interdisciplinary research of Central and East European politics.http://iir.cz/en//static/perspectives-journal = International Politics = The on-line magazine International Politics comes from the long tradition of the printed periodical of the same name, whose first issue was published in 1956 by the Czechoslovakian Society for Spreading of Political and Scientific Knowledge (later known as Socialistic Academy).https://www.iir.cz/en/list/mezinarodni-politika International Politics gained a favorable reputation mainly in the 60s, but its growth was stopped by the normalization and the issue from December 1969 was the last one for a very long time. International Politics was restored as monthly in 1990. In this form, the journal was led by its editor in chief Dobroslav Matejka until 2000. Prof. Otto Pick was also in the editorial council.DRULÁK, PETR, 1972-. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV. Praha: Ústav mezinárodních vztahů 403 p. Dostupné online. , . OCLC 247489592 p. 230. In 1991 the editorial office of International Politics was moved to the seat of the IIR and since 1993 the magazine has been published by IIR publishing house. Since 2013, however, it is published only as an electronic magazine.  The library  The reading room in the IIR library The library provides informational, librarian, rental, bibliographical and search services. It cooperates with a number of Czech but mainly with foreign professional libraries and informational institutions. At the end of 2016 it contained over 84 600 books and yearbooks and 419 journals.http://www.dokumenty- iir.cz/Publikace/Bro%C5%BEuraAJ_final_final7.pdf Full texts of many of the journals are available via paid databases (EBSCO, JSTOR, WoS).https://www.iir.cz/en/static/electronic-sources The library is a member of the European Information Network on International Relations and Area Studies (EINIRAS) and it also participates in the project Knihovny.cz.https://www.knihovny.cz/Search/Results/?lookfor0%5B%5D=&type0;%5B%5D=Libraries&bool0;%5B%5D=AND&filter;=&daterange;=&publishDatefrom;=&publishDateto;=&limit;=10&sort;=relevance&page;=1&searchTypeTemplate;=basic&database;=Solr&keepFacetsEnabled;=true&join;=AND  Organization structure  Based on law no. 341/2005 about public research institutions, the IIR has three main organs: the director, the board and the supervisory board. Based on the organization order there is also a commission for working affairs, an ethical commission and several editorial boards.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/organisation-structure The IIR is led by the director. Currently, this function is held by PhDR. Ondřej Ditrych MPhil. (Cantab.), Ph. D. As a statutory organ the director decides about every matter pertaining to the IIR, with the exception of the matters that are entrusted by law to the founder (the MoFA) or the other two main organs and ensures that the IIR's accountancy is properly carried out.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/organisation-structure The IIR board nominates candidates for the position of director of the IIR, determines the directions of the IIR activities; approves the budget, internal regulations, and annual reports; discusses suggestions for the research targets, etc. Members of the board are elected by the IIR researchers from among their own ranks (internal members) and from those of specialists/members of other institutions, governmental bodies which conduct research and the beneficiaries of the IIR research outcomes (external members).https://www.iir.cz/en/static/organisation-structure The supervisory board of the IIR supervises the activities and economy of the IIR. It has the right to suggest an appeal of the director to the founder of the IIR. It also has the right to express its opinion on the draft budget of the public research institution, on its way of management, on proposals of amendments to the institution's charter, on proposals of a division, integration or unification of the IIR, on research proposals, and on draft annual reports. Members of the supervisory board are appointed and recalled by the founder so that it reasonably represents the founder and, possibly, also the employees of the public research institution.https://www.iir.cz/en/static/organisation- structure  See also  Ministry of Foreign affairs (Czech Republic)  References = Bibliography = * Petr Drulák, Petr Kratochvíl a kol. 2007. 50 let českého výzkumu mezinárodních vztahů: od ÚMPE k ÚMV.

Riverdale House is a Victorian mansion located at 89 Graham Road in the Ranmoor area of Sheffield, England. Formerly a private residence, the building, which is Grade II Listed has now been adopted for commercial use and accommodates several small businesses. History The house was built around 1860 for Charles Henry Firth (1837-1892) of the eminent Sheffield family of steel makers. Charles was the fifth son of Thomas Firth and the brother of Mark Firth. Firth Works Gives details of Firth genealogy. The house was constructed in the Victorian Gothic style and faced south taking in views of the Porter valley and Whiteley Woods. Firth lived at Riverdale house after his marriage to his wife Adelaide in 1860, who died at a young age in 1875. Firth himself died in December 1892 in Bath after suffering from gout for some time. Marianne Firth (Charles second wife) remained at Riverdale House for several years, along with her children and second husband. Riverdale House was put up for sale in June 1898 and was described as “a substantially stone built family mansion, having upwards of 13 acres of valuable freehold land (exclusive roads) surrounded by excellent boundary walls and belted with well grown plantations”. Genes Reunited Gives details of Firth history. The house eventually became the property of John George Graves (1866-1945) who, in 1902, moved in. The 36-year-old Graves was a successful and wealthy businessman who had set up one of the first mail order catalogues selling furniture, electro-plated goods, tools, drapery and clothes, he also became known as a generous benefactor to the City of Sheffield. At its height Graves’ company employed 3,000 people and he and his wife Lucy held an annual tea party for staff in Riverdale House's large grounds (photograph on Picture Sheffield). Despite his success as a businessman, Graves did have financial difficulties in 1908 and was forced to lease Riverdale to a tenant and live in a smaller house in Beauchief, however by 1915 he had returned to the house and lived there for the rest of his life. After J.G. Graves’ death in 1945 Riverdale House was lived in by his daughter Ruth and her husband Stanley Drummond-Jackson. Around 1955 it was taken over by Brown Bayley Steels and used as offices. Ranmoor Society Gives house and Graves history. Today the house is still used as offices but is divided up between a number of small businesses. The substantial grounds were built on in the mid 1970s to accommodate the Riverdale Park apartment complex and the house is now hemmed in by modern buildings.\\"Sheffield‘s Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Page 26 Gives general history of house.

Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the record one star, opining that, \\"It's not so much that the songs lack shape, it's that this suggests Reptar lack conviction – every song borrows from something else, something vaguely similar but different enough to make this an incoherent mess, albeit one with oddball pretensions.\\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media panned the album, deriding the band as \\"accessible to way more information than they can fully process, desperate for attention, and prone to the most public of embarrassments.\\" Ryan Reed of Paste felt it better than the group's debut EP: \\"Body Faucet is an improvement over Oblangle in nearly every respect, but it’s definitely not as surprising as that lovely little EP [...] That being said, what they lose in unpredictability they gain in consistency and muscle.\\" of PopMatters felt the opposite: \\"Although Body Faucet is certainly entertaining throughout, it isn’t hard to imagine that the band spent more time naming the record and some of its songs [...] than attempting to perfect the many pop hooks found on the group’s 2011 debut EP, Oblangle Fizz Y’all, which, even after several listens of Body Faucet, will stand up as the stronger release.\\" Track listing Personnel  ;Reptar *Ryan Engelberger *William Kennedy *Andrew McFarland *Graham Ulicny ;Additional musicians *Damian Dominguez – Saxophone *Joe Gransden – Trumpet *Kevin Lyons – Trombone *James Pannell – Trombone *Will Scruggs – Saxophone *Josh Spilliards – Tuba *Andrew Zimdars – Trumpet *Caroline Bozeman – Backing vocals *Sabra Cordery – Backing vocals *Sarah Dodge – Backing vocals *Katherine Kennedy – Backing vocals *Catherine Quesenberry – Backing vocals *Jess Smith – Backing vocals *Elizabeth Turner – Backing vocals In popular culture *\\"Sweet Sipping Soda\\" is featured on the soundtrack of FIFA 13.

The Ac Activator element is autonomous, whereas the Ds Dissociation element requires an Activator element to transpose. Ac was initially discovered as enabling a Ds element to break chromosomes. Both Ac and Ds can also insert into genes, causing mutants that may revert to normal on excision of the element. The phenotypic consequence of Ac/Ds transposable element includes mosaic colors in kernels and leaves in maize.  Discovery  Its discovery was based on studying its genetic behavior, i.e., \\"jumping genes\\" in maize and published by Barbara McClintock, leading to her 1983 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The Ac/Ds transposable elements were first isolated and sequenced By Federoff et al. 1983 using insertions of Ac and Ds into the well-studied Waxy(Wx1) gene. The elements have been shown to function in other plants, including tobacco, Arabidopsis,) and rice. Genomic analysis of maize show that these elements, which share terminal 11 bp imperfect inverted repeat sequences, have much sequence heterogeneity, both in length and content. They also include a class of DNA elements that do not transpose in the presence of the Ac element (Du et al. 2011). The chromosome breaking property has been shown to come from pairs of closely positioned elements.  Toolkits  Researchers use mutant phenotypes to discover gene functions. Ac/Ds prefer to transpose to nearby genes, affording a way to mutagenize those regions of the genome, and by subsequent genetic crosses, remove the Ac that causes new mutants and instability of a Ds mutant. Collections of Ac/Ds elements that cover the genome and are useful for generating mutants. Application of Ac/Ds toolkits has also been applied to other species like arabidopsis, yeast, and even zebrafish.  In corn  Activator (Ac)/ Dissociation (Ds) transposable elements were discovered by Barbara McClintock when she was studying the maize genomic composition of the short arm of chromosome 9. She noticed that when chromosome 9 had been exposed to drastic structural modifications, the progeny had changes such as multiple copies of the short arm or lacking one or more of its parts, as well as other changes. She believed that these changes were due to transposition of “mutable loci” into the genome and that these spontaneous translocations were not random due to where the breaks occurred and where they fused. Ac/Ds elements have been observed to insert into gene rich regions of the maize genome, they alter the regulation of gene expression and may create unstable insertion alleles, stable derivatives, or excision alleles due to insertion of a transposable element into a gene. Transposable elements residing at or near a gene prevent gene expression and can also result in a mutation that causes exhibition of the recessive phenotype. Removal of transposable element locus results in restoration of the gene organization and activity. Ac is 4565 base pairs long and codes for a 3.5 kb open reading frame that synthesizes an 807 amino acid long transposase enzyme. Ac elements are autonomous and their movement results in a 4.3 kb insertion. Ds elements are not autonomous because they cannot produce the transposase needed for transposition, and can only transpose when it is provided by the Ac element. Ds elements have shown to cause a 4.1kB and 2.0 kB insertions. The transposable elements were seen in progeny of plants that had undergone stress, and mutations caused by the insertion are like those caused by x-rays, UV light, or chemicals causing events like chromosome breakage and fusion. There are distinct families of transposon controlling elements that are made up of a combination of elements some that can, and some that cannot, transpose. The families differ in their developmental timing and transposition frequency, as well other types of genetic rearrangements. Ac or Ds element insertion near a locus causes unstable mutations. Ds elements are considered non-autonomous because they cannot transpose without the presence of the Ac element, since they themselves cannot produce the enzyme transposase needed for transposition. However, since Ds elements can utilize the transposase enzyme produced by the Ac elements, it shows that they have the structural information needed for transposition and only lack the information needed to produce the enzyme. Ds elements were identified at the site of a chromosome breakage. Ac and Ds elements are structurally related because insertion of either element brings about similar mutations. They are also similar because their restriction endonuclease cleavage site maps are indistinguishable from each other. Different mutants display different levels of gene expression, which largely depends on the presence or absence of the transposable element somewhere else in the genome. The different function of the elements are detected as altered temporal or spatial patterns of somatic reversions or reversible inactivation of the entire element. Some excision events of these elements restore gene function and can be detected as somatic reversions. If Ac or Ds insertions in an exon, and the transposable elements are excised leaving some of the duplicated base pairs behind, it alters the protein structure either by causing mutations such as frame shift mutations or the addition of amino acids. In some cases, unstable Ds or Ac induced mutant can give rise to a stable recessive mutant. Ac determines the mutation process and the mutable loci as well as their timing. Ac transposase does not influence transcription initiation site selection, and large numbers of Ac elements may inhibit the expression of Ds by reducing the rate of transcription initiation instead of affecting the transcription site selection. Ac transposase is also capable of suppressing gene expression when Ac or Ds inserts in 5’ untranslated region using target sites. Ac or Ds element insertion sites have been characterized by the presence of different direct duplications of 6-10 base pairs prior to insertions, indicating that Ac transposase may have preference for short duplication as insertion sites. Transposition of both Ac and Ds occurs during development of a tissue and is under precise control which is determined by the number of Ac loci present, their organization, and their position in the chromosome complement. The transposable elements not only entirely remove or alter the gene function via insertion, but can also exert a mutator activity when they leave the position where they had visited the chromosome. Induced disturbances in quantity and organization of the heterochromatic elements of the chromosome could give rise to a series of alterations in its structure, behavior, and in genic reactions that can alter phenotypic expression. The Ac and Ds elements share two properties that are common for transposable elements. One is that at the site of their insertion, a short DNA sequence is 8 base pairs long, and is duplicated and borders exactly at the Ac or Ds sequence. Second, the sequences of several Ds elements terminate in an inverted repeat of the nucleotide sequence TAGGATGAAA. The Ds elements shows quite some degree of similarity with the Ac elements, such as the Ds9 element which is a complemental mutant of Ac and only differs in the open reading frame 1. Other Ds elements differ from the Ac element by internal deletions. As Ac copy number increases, the expression of genes flanking the Ds promoter insertion are negatively regulated, which is called the negative dosage effect. Ds flanking gene expression is inhibited in the presence of the autonomous Ac element. As the Ac element copy number increases, transposition events that require Ac occur at a later time during endosperm development. Ac causes no or few chromosome breaks. In the absence of Ac, Ds caused mutations are stable. By identifying alleles that suppress the Ac element they could be used for functional genomics studies. The properties of transposable elements can also be altered in a clonally heritable fashion. Ds elements can be used as building blocks for complicated structures like the double Ds or the 30kb transposon-like insertion which is terminated by Ds elements. Ds elements can generate long direct inverted duplicates of a chromosome segment, indicating that Ds elements are able to mobilize DNA sequences unrelated to themselves, this can provide a mechanism for rearrangement of genetic information. Since small duplication of host DNA created by the insertion of the elements are left over in a slightly altered form after excision of the transposable element, they may indicate that plant transposable elements play a role in the evolution of genes.

He is the namesake of Warren Dunes State Park and Warren Woods State Park in Michigan, both of which he developed. Biography Warren was born on April 7, 1847 in Ludlow, Vermont to Waters and Caroline Warren. Warren was descended eight generations from an early American family; Joseph Warren came to the country from England in 1635. His great-grandfather fought in the American Revolution at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The son of a Congregationalist minister, Edward Kirk Warren was educated in public schools. In 1858, the family moved to Three Oaks, Michigan. Upon reaching adulthood, Warren took a job working in a sawmill. On January 24, 1864, he started working for Henry Chamberlain, who owned a local dry goods store. He was married on November 3, 1867, to Sarah E. Stevens. In 1868, Warren opened a dry goods store with James L. McKie as McKie & Warren. The store was very successful, and the partnership purchased the interests of their chief competitor, Henry Chamberlain, in 1879. Sarah died in 1879. Edward remarried on February 17, 1880, to Mary Louise Chamberlain, the daughter of Henry Chamberlain. While overseeing the store, Warren learned that his female clientele were unsatisfied with their whalebone corsets, which became brittle and stiff over time. During a trip to Chicago, Illinois, Warren visited a feather duster manufacturer and observed that the company discarded certain turkey wing feathers. These feathers were unsuitable for use in feather dusters, but were strong and pliable. By removing the plumage from these feathers, Warren was able to identify a substitute for whalebone. Warren experimented with developing a corset for a year before perfecting a design. A patent for \\"featherbone\\" was approved on October 3, 1883. Warren organized the Warren Featherbone Company in Three Oaks to manufacture his product. Although stores were at first reluctant to stock the new material, the invention gradually increased in popularity. Warren left his mercantile enterprises to focus on his featherbone company, where he was company President until his death. In 1902, Warren organized the E. K. Warren & Co. banking house in Three Oaks. Seven years later, he returned to the mercantile trade with his son as Charles K. Warren & Co. =Personal life= The Edward K. Warren Foundation developed and preserved Warren Dunes State Park Warren was a prominent citizen of Three Oaks and served at times as treasurer, clerk, and supervisor. Warren was also a philanthropist, establishing the Edward K. Warren Foundation to oversee the management of two tracts of forest and beach. These tracts were developed as Warren Dunes State Park, today one of the most popular state parks in Michigan, and Warren Woods State Park. In 1916, Warren founded the Chamberlain Memorial Museum, named after Warren's father-in-law. The museum preserved early farm implements, Native American artifacts, and war memorabilia. The collection was purchased by Michigan State College in 1952. Edward Kirk Warren's home in Evanston, Illinois Warren's strong Congregationalist convictions guided his personal life. He was a staunch supporter of prohibition, replacing the income that saloons would have brought Three Oaks with money from his own account. Warren was the president of the International Sunday School Association of North America and oversaw the World's Sunday School Convention in 1904 in Jerusalem, Israel. He was named president of the International Sunday School Association in 1915. Warren was also a member of the Michigan Historical Society, the Chicago Historical Society, the Wisconsin Archaeological Society, the Union League Club, and the Geographic Society of Chicago. He also owned an operated a ranch near Three Oaks and a few ranches in Texas, Mexico, and New Mexico. Warren was a supporter of Dwight L. Moody and was named a trustee of the Moody Bible Institute in 1909. Warren died at his home in Evanston, Illinois on January 16, 1919. The Warren Featherbone Company Office Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service on January 23, 1986. Seven days later, his Evanston house was similarly listed.

Overview Water will flow from one solution to another, trying to create equilibrium between both solutions. Usually, the two solutions are concrete and the coating application on top of the concrete. Concrete is very porous, so water beneath the concrete, will force itself through the concrete, typically through vapor transmission. The water will then try to break through the semi-permeable membrane (either the surface of the concrete or the primer). Most epoxies or urethanes or polymer applications are not permeable so the water will stop at the polymer coating. However, the pressure from the water does not stop, forcing the water to collect directly in between the concrete and the layer of epoxy/urethane. This collection creates the notorious “osmotic blister” that is commonly feared by coating specialists. For steel substrates: The presence of soluble salts (particularly sulfates and chlorides) at the metal/paint interface is known to have a detrimental effect on the integrity of most paint systems including fluorocoatings. The salts come from atmospheric pollution and contamination during blasting or other substrate preparation processes. These salts promote osmotic blistering of the coating and underfilm metallic corrosion. As a result, loss of adhesion, cathodic disbondment, and scribe creep can be observed. A coating behaves as a semi-impermeable membrane; allowing moisture to pass through but not salts4,5. When a paint coating is applied on a metallic surface contaminated with soluble salts, an osmotic blistering process takes place (Figure 8.10). Osmosis is the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules (water) through a semipermeable membrane (coating film) into a region of higher solute concentration (the salt contaminated substrate). The process drives to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides, but because salt cannot pass through the membrane (coating) it can never equalize. Water continues to permeate into the region. As the soluble substance dissolves under the paint layer, the pressure caused by the increase in volume can exert a greater force than the paint adhesion and cohesion forces, giving rise to the formation of a blister; the process called osmotic blistering. The blisters are first filled with water and later with corrosion products from the corrosion of the metallic substrate.

Aired by BBC Two Scotland on 13 June 2013, the hour-long programme takes a satirical look at Scottish politics and the independence debate, two subjects that had largely seen an absence of humour up to that point. The film sees Bremner visit the Scottish Parliament and interview politicians and other senior public figures as he gets to grips with the issues of the Scottish political scene. Bremner recorded the programme after moving back to live in Scotland and realising he knew very little about the politics of that country. Background Details of the programme were announced by the BBC Media Centre in March 2013, with plans for it to be aired later in the year. Bremner had recently returned to live in Scotland after spending much of his life in England, and as part of the press release for the show, he gave some insight into his reasons for recording it. \\"Coming back to Scotland in the run-up to the Referendum, I realised I knew almost nothing about Scottish Politics. Time I did. And why is there so little political comedy in Scotland outside the Parliament? Time to make sense (and nonsense) of it all.\\" 2013 also saw Bremner defend fellow comedian Susan Calman, whose attempt to satirise the referendum debate on BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz led to her receiving death threats on social media from users who had been offended by her comments. Bremner himself spoke of a strong reaction to the announcement of his show, telling The Scotsman in June 2013 \\"I didn't get it to the extent that Susan Calman did, but the strength of feeling surprised me.\\" He also noted that from a comedy perspective, there are people who \\"think [First Minister] Alex Salmond should be off limits, even though Alex Salmond himself has a very good sense of humour and understands that political comedians are part of a healthy democracy.\\" The Scotsman later noted that \\"many observers have complained of a lack of satire in the mainstream media and lamented the fact even light-hearted attempts to lampoon the Scottish political scene have triggered an explosion of online bile.\\" The programme aired on BBC Two Scotland on 13 June 2013. Shortly before it was broadcast, Bremner said that recording it had left him undecided on the question of Scottish independence. \\"On the debate itself, I started the programme with an open mind and, funnily enough, ended it with a perhaps more open mind.\\" He subsequently called for there to be more satire in the referendum debate. \\"There’s great humour to be had. There’s a lot of big, different characters involved and good arguments, and there are plenty of good Scottish comedians who can have plenty of fun with it. It’s far too dangerous to leave it only to the politically minded.\\" Synopsis The programme follows Bremnerknown for his impressions of UK politiciansas he searches for material to put together a show focusing on Scottish politics for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the first time he has tackled the subject. Speaking to politicians, journalists and other public figures, he seeks to get to grips with Scotland's political scene, as well as the issues surrounding the independence debate, also assembling a team of his fellow comedians to help. The group, including Andy Zaltzman, Julia Sutherland and Paul Sneddon, discusses potential material with Bremner, and identifies characteristics and topics that could be used in a stand-up routine. Sheldon says that one of the problems with putting together such a show is that many people cannot identify the key figures at Holyrood, something highlighted by Bremner himself during a street survey in which he asks members of the public to name Scotland's politicians. Undaunted by the lack of public recognition of those he intends to lampoon, Bremner works on his material, listening to recordings of First Minister Alex Salmond and other politicians as he drives between appointments. He is given a tour of the Scottish Parliament Building by MSP Joan McAlpine and watches a session of the Scottish Parliament. He also travels to Westminster to interview Ian Davidson, chair of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. The documentary ends with Brember presenting a one-off stand-up routine at Edinburgh's Assembly Hall.

They make FFF 3D printers, develop 3D printing software, and sell branded 3D printing materials. Their product line includes the Ultimaker S5 and S3, Ultimaker 3 series, Ultimaker 2+ series and Ultimaker Original+. These products are used by industries such as automotive, architecture, healthcare, education, and small scale manufacturing. History Ultimaker BV is a Dutch 3D printer company that was founded in 2011 by Martijn Elserman, Erik de Bruijn, and Siert Wijnia. Ultimaker started selling their products in May 2011. The company's foundation was laid at ProtoSpace Utrecht where Wijnia organized two workshops to build the RepRap Darwin 3D printer. Two Beta-workshops were organized at ProtoSpace Utrecht starting in September and December 2010, each consisting of 10 Monday evenings. Erik de Bruijn and Martijn Elserman assisted at those workshops. Frustration from their inability to get the Darwin design to work led to the inspiration to create their own design. Instead of sticking to the RepRap principle that their printer should be able to print its own parts, they designed their printer to be built mostly of laser cut plywood parts, that could be produced orders of magnitude faster than printed parts at the time. Their first prototypes bore the name \\"Ultimaker protobox\\" but newer prototypes were just titled \\"Ultimaker\\". In March 2011, Ultimaker ltd. released their first complete product, the \\"Ultimaker\\" (renamed in 2013 to \\"Ultimaker Original\\") under a Creative Commons BY-NC license. The Ultimaker Original was distributed as a Do It Yourself kit that hobbyists and technicians assembled themselves. It could print objects up to 210 mm x 210 mm x 205 mm at a maximum resolution of 20 microns. = Company Milestones = 2013 - The Ultimaker 2 was released. The target market was home-users, schools, and libraries, small businesses, and industrial designers who used 3D printing for rapid prototyping and production. 2015 - In 2015 Ultimaker's revenue doubled, with 35% of new customers coming from the North American market. 2017 - Ultimaker's U.S. presence grew to include a network of 37 re-sellers. 2018 - Partners with material manufacturers DSM, BASF, DuPont Transportation & Advanced Polymers, Owens Corning, Mitsubishi, Henkel, Kuraray, Solvay and Clariant to create material profiles for printing high-level engineering plastics and composites. Opens facility in Singapore to service Asia, Pacific and China markets and expands manufacturing presence to three continents. 2019 - Arkema joins material alliance program and releases FluorX filament. The company moved its headquarters to Utrecht, The Netherlands.  Software  Their first software ran under a modified version of Replicator-G. They changed this later to Cura because more and more users started using this software in favor of Replicator-G, which was originally produced with Makerbot in mind. When the lead developer for Cura started working for Ultimaker, Ultimaker Cura became the lead software product for Ultimaker. Cura rapidly became a favorite of 3D printing enthusiasts. A YouMagine Survey found that 58% of users surveyed used Cura, compared to 23% that used Slic3r. On September 26, 2017 the company announced that Cura had achieved one million users. This announcement was made at the TCT show. With the release of Cura 4.0, Ultimaker users were able to back up their files to the cloud. As of 2020 the software was processing 1.4 million jobs per week. Products Unlike the RepRap project, Ultimaker is not focused on the end-goal of self-replication. Ultimaker printers are designed to make high quality prints easy and hassle free. Ultimaker sells the Ultimaker Original family as a DIY kit and the Ultimaker 2 and 3 family as pre-assembled machines. One of the distinctive properties of Ultimaker printers is that vertical movement is accomplished by moving the print platform, not the nozzle. The products are manufactured at three facilities: Netherlands, U.S. and Singapore =Ultimaker Original= Ultimaker 3D Printers Ultimaker Original is a predecessor of Ultimaker 2 and was released a few months after the company was founded. Because the Ultimaker Original is sold as a kit it must be assembled by the user and can be modified to the user's preference. In 2012, the Ultimaker Original was awarded Fastest and Most Accurate 3D printer available by MAKE Magazine. =Ultimaker 2= Ultimaker 3D printer printing an object Ultimaker 2 is the successor to the Ultimaker Original and was released in September 2013. MAKE magazine classified the Ultimaker 2 as the \\"best open-architecture 3D printer of 2014\\" and named it runner-up in the category \\"Prosumer FFF\\". = Ultimaker 2 Go = The Ultimaker 2 Go is a compact and portable design that comes with a travel case for easy transportation. Released date April 2015. This printer along with the Ultimaker 2 Extended are the newest additions to the Ultimaker family of printers. Awarded 2nd place in the Most Portable category in MAKE Magazine's Digital Fabrication Shootout 2015\\\\. = Ultimaker 2 Extended = Released date April 2015. Awarded 1st place in the Best Large Format category in MAKE Magazine's Digital Fabrication Shootout 2015\\\\. Rated as a top 5 3D printer by 3DForged.com. Otherwise similar to normal Ultimaker 2 except for its 100 mm higher build volume and somewhat larger frame. = Ultimaker 3 and Ultimaker 3 Extended= The Ultimaker 3 was released on 18 October 2016 and introduced professional dual extrusion 3D printing for the desktop. It was named the best 3D printer for 2017 by All3DP. In 2019, The Mediahq recognized the Ultimaker 3 as the Best 3D Printer of 2019 for Enthusiasts. = Ultimaker S5 = The Ultimaker S5 was introduced in April 2018. It increased the build area of the X axis while maintaining the build area of the Z axis and introduced a feeder system that pauses when material runs out and resumes when new material is loaded. This is the only model made by Ultimaker that is certified by Materialise for FDA-approved medical applications. In July 2019, this model was named Best Enthusiast 3D Printer by Tom's Guide in their annual rankings. = Ultimaker S5 Pro Bundle = The S5 Pro Bundle option was announced at the TCT Show in September 2019. The Pro Bundle is an upgrade of the S5. It includes the S5 Air Manager to provide a closed environment for printing to keep ultrafine particles from the air while printing and the S5 Material Station that can hold up to 6 spools of filament for continuous 24/7 printing. The company developed the model as a bridge between industrial 3D printers and desktop printers. = Ultimaker S3 = In September 2019, the S3 was introduced as a smaller alternative to the S5. Like the S5, it was developed for the professional market and not the casual hobbyist. The S3 occupies a smaller footprint than the S5 and offers a smaller build volume. The dual extruders print using almost any 2.85 filament, including abrasive filaments. = Ultimaker Materials = Ultimaker 3D printers currently print using either company branded filaments made from polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), Tough PLA, Copolyester (CPE), Nylon, Polycarbonate, Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU 95A) and water-soluble PVA or third-party compatible materials. This includes certain composite materials. A breakaway material was developed and released in 2017 to support multi-extrusion printing and reduce post- processing time.

Aceto was born in Turin, Italy. He studied fine arts at ECAL.  Art work  Using among others sculpture, film and sound, Italian Swiss-based artist Alfredo Aceto creates spaces suspended between fiction and reality. His environments are places to live, in which one can find a sort of melancholy, artificial time alteration and image saturation. The objects he produces are traces, functional elements for the construction of the space where the blurred boundaries between his personal timeline and the collective one express the way chronology can be manipulate. His work arises from the will to create a place where would mix together the various strata of a linear form of time, turning into a platform from which signs of different ages emerge. Developing his work in a creative path that passes through multiple and never truly resolved phases of growth. Alfredo Aceto nurtures his own research by questioning his own self and, more in general, the ego that reigns in every person, if only on a latent level. In 2017, Aceto began teaching art at ECAL in Lausanne. In 2018 he is nominated for Swiss Art Awards in Basel.

He was born at Hanthorpe House, Morton and Hanthorpe, Lincolnshire in 1796, the second son to Charles James Packe (1758–1837), of Prestwold Hall, Leicestershire, and his first wife Penelope, of Blythe Hall, Warwickshire. He married in 1824 Maryanne-Lidia (1796–1876), daughter of John Heathcote – of Connington Castle, Huntingdonshire, and MP for Ripon – and Mary Anne (née Thornhill).

He was also chairman of the Kesteven Quarter Sessions, a Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, and, in 1843, High sheriff of Lincolnshire. In 1871 Packe gave evidence to a House of Lords committee in support of a petition by Clementina Elizabeth, Dowager Lady Aveland of Grimsthorpe Castle. The petition, presented upon the death of her brother, Albyric Drummond-Willoughby, sought to attach the descendency of the Heathcote Baronetcy to her in preference to her sister.

Military career George Hussey Packe entered the army in 1813, and fought as a cornet in the 13th Light Dragoons at the Battle of Waterloo, where he was wounded. Packe had embarked for the Waterloo campaign in May 1815, landing at Ostend, from where he began a series of 'Waterloo letters' to his father.

Railway interests In 1830 George Hussey Packe's father, Charles James Packe, had become a director of the Leicester and Swannington Railway, opened 1832.Wright p. 120 George Hussey himself became part of a Lincolnshire group of landowners, including Lord Worsley, who presented to Parliament an 1844 scheme for a railway between Cambridge and York, as part of a number of companies' proposals vying for London to York railway links. Packe's group's proposition was opposed by four competing companies, including the Eastern Counties Railway, and they responded by surveying a route from their proposed line at Cambridge, through Peterborough, to London. Competing London to York schemes included those by Direct Northern and Great Northern (GNR) railway committees. Later in the year Packe, and other Cambridge and York group members, joined the GNR proposal as part of a new London and York railway committee, with Packe becoming one of its directors. The committee considered two routes: one through the fens, which would have included Cambridge; the other a more direct 'towns' line from London via Peterborough, Stamford, Grantham, Newark, Retford, and Doncaster – the latter route was adopted.Wright p. 126Scrivenor, Harry (1849); The Railways of the United Kingdom..., p. 386\\\\. Grinling, Charles, H.; The History of the Great Northern Railway, Methuen & Co (1898), pp. 12–13 Some proposers of the previous Cambridge and York fen route scheme resigned from the London and York committee, but Packe stayed.Wright pp. 120–124 Further opposition from Lincoln, Gainsborough and Boston quarters prompted the London and York committee to develop a scheme for an East Lincolnshire Railway (ELR) between Boston and Grimsby, under a joint proposal with the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway, an act for which was obtained in 1847 – Packe with fellow London and York committee members, including Charles Tennyson d'Eyncourt, became directors of the scheme. Packe was a director and the deputy chairman of the GNR between 1847 and 1864, after which he became chairman until his death in 1874 – he was also a director of other GNR companies, and by 1849 was ELR chairman.Wright p. 129Glynn, Henry (1847); Reference Book to the Incorporated Railway Companies of England and Wales, p. 68\\\\. In 1857 Pack was named as a defendant, with other GNR directors, in an action taken by preference stock holders of the GNR to receive dividends from company profits. The plaintiff's case was proved, an appeal against the ruling was dismissed.In Chancery, Between William Charles Henry [And Others] Plaintiffs, and the Great Northern Railway Company [And Others] Defendants.... Great Britain, Court of Chancery. 21–24 August 1857. The Honington to Lincoln branch of the GNR Grantham to Skegness line ran through George Hussey Packe's land at Caythorpe, where, by the early 1880s, companies were working opencast mines for ironstone, the first being the West Yorkshire Iron and Coal Company in the late 1870s. Such mining on Packe's land was the first in south-west Lincolnshire.Wright p. 170 Political career George Hussey Packe was MP for South Lincolnshire from 1859 to 1868. He was one of three candidates proposed for the 1847 general election to the UK Parliament for the Newark constituency, alongside John Stuart and John Manners-Sutton. In the proposal Packe is described as \\"a promoter of the London and York Railway\\". Newark was represented by two seats which Stuart and Manners-Sutton won.\\"The General Election – Members Elected\\", The Spectator, 31 July 1847, p. 726\\\\. Retrieved 29 December 2013 Packe was selected to fight the 1859 general election on behalf of the Liberal Party, being described as \\"a gentleman supported by high family connections, and having the advantage in all the large towns, of the railway influence incident to his position as Deputy Chairman of the Great Northern Company.\\" Fellow constituency opponents at hustings, held at Sleaford Market Place on 1 April, were Sir John Trollope, and Anthony Willson – of Rauceby Hall, and in 1854 High Sheriff of Lincolnshire – both Conservative. Packe had visited all the principal towns of South Lincolnshire to promote his cause. His written March address to the freeholders and electors of South Lincolnshire expressed strong and independent support for Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister, who had called the 1857 election after losing a vote of censure in Parliament over the conduct of the Second Opium War – Packe felt that Palmerston was deserving of the country's support. Packe stated his intention to encourage civil and religious liberty, and \\"agricultural interest\\". He believed that public expenditure should be curtailed, but with the maintenance of naval and military spending commensurate with keeping of the peace. Packe won one of the two constituency seats.The Poll Book for the Election of Two Members to represent in Parliament the Southern Division of the County of Lincolnshire, \\"South Lincolnshire Contest (1857)\\", pp. 4–9 He was reelected for Parliament for the Lincolnshire, Parts of Kesteven and Holland constituency in 1865.Ridgway, James; The Present Peerage of the United Kingdom (1868) \\"List of the Present Parliament 65-66-67-68\\", p. 44\\\\.
