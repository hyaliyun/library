It is the largest town in the arid Great Karoo region, and is known as the \\"Capital of the Karoo\\". It forms part of the Beaufort West Local Municipality, with 34 085 inhabitants in 2011. It is the centre of an agricultural district based mainly on sheep farming, and is a significant town on the N1 national road. Next door to Beaufort West is the Karoo National Park. Important fossils have been found in the area, initially by David Baird, son of the local magistrate in 1827. The old Town Hall and the Dutch Reformed Church have been declared national monuments. History Beaufort West was the first town to be established in the central Karoo. The town was founded in 1818 and initially named Beaufort after Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, who was the father of Lord Charles Henry Somerset, then governor of the Cape Colony. The town was renamed Beaufort West in 1869 to avoid confusion with Port Beaufort in the Western Cape as well as Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape. The town became prosperous with the introduction of Saxon Merino sheep. One of those who first farmed them, John Molteno, was a young Anglo-Italian immigrant who then founded the town's first bank in 1854 and went on to become the first Prime Minister of the Cape.L.

It is located at 25 Woodstock Road, next to Somerville College. The church is served by the Congregation of the Oratory. History The entrance to the Oratory Church of St Aloysius Gonzaga (with the flag of the Vatican City flying at half mast the day after the death of Pope John Paul II) St Aloysius' was founded as the Jesuit (Society of Jesus) parish of central Oxford. Completed in 1875, the building of St Aloysius' was an important step in the ongoing refoundation of a Roman Catholic presence in Oxford. The parish was served by notable members of the society for many years, including Gerard Manley Hopkins (December 1878 - September 1879). The church also housed a notable collection of relics bequeathed by Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, many of which were destroyed in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the Jesuits left the church and the parish was taken over by the Archdiocese of Birmingham. In 1990, the Archbishop of Birmingham invited members of the Birmingham Oratory to take over the running of the parish and found a new Oratorian community in Oxford. Two priests from Birmingham arrived in September 1990 and, in 1993, the Oxford Oratory was established as an independent Congregation. Fr Robert Byrne then served as provost from 1993 to 2011. From 2011-2019, Fr Daniel Seward served as provost. The incumbent is the Very Rev. Fr Nicholas Edmonds-Smith. Liturgy It is part of the tradition of the Oratory in England to ensure that the liturgy is celebrated in a dignified and worthy manner. In the Oxford Oratory most Masses are celebrated in English, but on Sundays and Holydays a non-Tridentine Solemn Mass is sung in Latin. Latin is also used in the Tridentine Low Mass also celebrated on Sundays and Holydays, while the Parish Mass is sung in English.The Oxford Oratory: Mass Times (retrieved in August 2019)] Organ The organ was enlarged between 1998 and 2004 by Matthew Copley. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Building The church was designed by Joseph Hansom in a Gothic Revival style.Harris, Penelope, \\"The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-82), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall and Churches of the Catholic Revival\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, Much of the original interior decoration was painted over in the 1970s, and the altar moved forward. The building is being gradually restored as part of the \\"Oxford Oratory - Reaffirmation & Renewal\\" campaign. The church consists of a single nave and five side chapels. To the left of the sanctuary is the Sacred Heart chapel, and the Lady Chapel is to the right. There are also chapels dedicated to St Philip Neri (formerly St Joseph's chapel) and Our Lady of Oxford (also known as the relic chapel). There are plans to build a new baptistery and a chapel dedicated to Cardinal Newman after his beatification in September 2010.

Bose's ashes are stored in the temple in a golden pagoda. Bose died on 18 August 1945. His ashes arrived in Japan in early September 1945; after a memorial service, they were accepted by the temple on 18 September 1945. The death of Indian nationalist leader Subhas Chandra Bose occurred from third- degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese Taiwan. However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have persisted since then, keeping alive various martial myths about Bose. Death =Last months with the Indian National Army= Map of Central Burma showing the route taken by Subhas Chandra Bose and his Indian National Army (INA) group of 500 from Rangoon to Moulmein. The group traveled in a Japanese military convoy until they reached the river Sittang. After crossing the river, they walked the remaining 80 miles. At Moulmein, Bose, his party, and another INA group of 500, boarded Japanese trains on the Death Railway (which had been constructed earlier by British, Australian, and Dutch prisoners of war) to arrive in Bangkok in the first week of May 1945. During the last week of April 1945, Subhas Chandra Bose along with his senior Indian National Army (INA) officers, several hundred enlisted INA men, and nearly a hundred women from the INA's Rani of Jhansi Regiment left Rangoon by road for Moulmein in Burma. Accompanied by Lieutenant General Saburo Isoda, the head of the Japanese-INA liaison organization Hikari Kikan, their Japanese military convoy was able to reach the right bank of the Sittang river, albeit slowly. (See map 1.) However, very few vehicles were able to cross the river because of American strafing runs. Bose and his party walked the remaining to Moulmein over the next week. Moulmein then was the terminus of the Death Railway, constructed earlier by British, Australian, and Dutch prisoners of war, linking Burma to Siam (now Thailand). At Moulmein, Bose's group was also joined by 500 men from the X-regiment, INA's first guerrilla regiment, who arrived from a different location in Lower Burma. A year and a half earlier, 16,000 INA men and 100 women had entered Burma from Malaya. Now, less than one tenth that number left the country, arriving in Bangkok during the first week of May. The remaining nine tenths were either killed in action, died from malnutrition or injuries after the battles of Imphal and Kohima. Others were captured by the British, turned themselves in, or simply disappeared. Bose stayed in Bangkok for a month, where soon after his arrival he heard the news of Germany's surrender on May8. Bose spent the next two months between June and July 1945 in Singapore, and in both places attempted to raise funds for billeting his soldiers or rehabilitating them if they chose to return to civilian life, which most of the women did. In his nightly radio broadcasts, Bose spoke with increasing virulence against Gandhi, who had been released from jail in 1944, and was engaged in talks with British administrators, envoys and Muslim League leaders. Some senior INA officers began to feel frustrated or disillusioned with Bose and to prepare quietly for the arrival of the British and its consequences. During the first two weeks of August 1945, events began to unfold rapidly. With the British threatening to invade Malaya and with daily American aerial bombings, Bose's presence in Singapore became riskier by the day. His chief of staff J. R. Bhonsle suggested that he prepare to leave Singapore. On 3August 1945, Bose received a cable from General Isoda advising him to urgently evacuate to Saigon in Japanese- controlled French Indochina (now Vietnam). On 10August, Bose learnt that the Soviet Union had entered the war and invaded Manchuria. At the same time he heard about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Finally, on 16August, after being informed of the unconditional surrender of Japan, Bose decided to leave for Saigon along with a handful of his aides. =Last days and journeys= The last airplane journeys of Subhas Chandra Bose. Paths of completed flights are shown in blue. On 16 August 1945, he left Singapore for Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand). On either the 16th itself or on the 17th morning, he flew from Bangkok to Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. On the 17 August afternoon, he flew from Saigon to Tourane, French Indo-China, now Da Nang, Vietnam. Early next morning at 5 AM, he left Tourane for Taihoku, Formosa, now Taipei, Taiwan. At 2:30 PM on 18 August, he left for Dairen, Manchukuo, now Dalian, China, but his plane crashed shortly after take off, and Bose died within a few hours in a Japanese military hospital. Had the crash not occurred the plane would have dropped off Bose at Dairen and proceeded to Tokyo along a flight path shown in red. Reliable strands of historical narrative about Bose's last days are united up to this point. However, they separate briefly for the period between 16 August, when Bose received news of Japan's surrender in Singapore, and shortly after noon on 17 August, when Bose and his party arrived at Saigon airport from Saigon city to board a plane. (See map 2.) In one version, Bose flew out from Singapore to Saigon, stopping briefly in Bangkok, on the 16th. Soon after arriving in Saigon, he visited Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, head of the Japanese forces in Southeast Asia, and requested him to arrange a flight to the Soviet Union. Although until the day before, the Soviet Union had been a belligerent of Japan, it was also seen, at least by Bose, as increasingly anti-British, and, consequently, a possible base of his future operations against the British Raj. Terauchi, in turn, cabled Japan's Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) in Tokyo for permission, which was quickly denied. In the words of historian Joyce Chapman Lebra, the IGHQ felt that it \\"would be unfair of Bose to write off Japan and go over to Soviet Union after receiving so much help from Japan. Terauchi added in talking with Bose that it would be unreasonable for him to take a step which was opposed by the Japanese.\\" Privately, however, Terauchi still felt sympathy for Bose‚Äîone that had been formed during their two-year-long association. He somehow managed to arrange room for Bose on a flight leaving Saigon on the morning of 17 August 1945 bound for Tokyo, but stopping en route in Dairen, Manchuria‚Äîwhich was still Japanese-occupied, but toward which the Soviet army was fast approaching‚Äîwhere Bose was to have disembarked and to have awaited his fate at the hand of the Soviets. In another version, Bose left Singapore with his party on the 16th and stopped en route in Bangkok, surprising INA officer in-charge there, J. R. Bhonsle, who quickly made arrangements for Bose's overnight stay. Word of Bose's arrival, however, got out, and soon local members of the Indian Independence League (IIL), the INA, and the Thai Indian business community turned up at the hotel. According to historian Peter Ward Fay, Bose \\"sat up half the night holding court‚Äîand in the morning flew on to Saigon, this time accompanied by General Isoda ...\\" Arriving in Saigon, late in the morning, there was little time to visit Field Marshal Terauchi, who was in Dalat in the Central Highlands of French Indo-China, an hour away by plane. Consequently, Isoda himself, without consulting with higher ups, arranged room for Bose on a flight leaving around noon. In the third sketchier version, Bose left Singapore on the 17th. According to historian Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper, \\"On 17 August he issued a final order of the day, dissolving the INA with the words, 'The roads to Delhi are many and Delhi still remains our goal.' He then flew out to China via French Indo-China. If all else failed he wanted to become a prisoner of the Soviets: 'They are the only ones who will resist the British. My fate is with them'.\\" The Mitsubishi Ki-21 twin-engine heavy bomber (Allies code name Sally) that Subhas Chandra Bose and Habibur Rahman boarded at Saigon airport around 2 PM on 17 August 1945. Around noon on 17 August, the strands again reunite. At Saigon airport, a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bomber, of the type code named Sally by the Allies, was waiting for Bose and his party. In addition to Bose, the INA group comprised Colonel Habibur Rahman, his secretary; S. A. Ayer, a member of his cabinet; Major Abid Hasan, his old associate who had made the hazardous submarine journey from Germany to Sumatra in 1943; and three others. To their dismay, they learned upon arrival that there was room for only one INA passenger. Bose complained, and the beleaguered General Isoda gave in and hurriedly arranged for a second seat. Bose chose Habibur Rahman to accompany him. It was understood that the others in the INA party would follow him on later flights. There was further delay at Saigon airport. According to historian Joyce Chapman Lebra, \\"a gift of treasure contributed by local Indians was presented to Bose as he was about to board the plane. The two heavy strong-boxes added overweight to the plane's full load.\\" Sometime between noon and 2 PM, the twin-engine plane took off with 12 or 13 people aboard: a crew of three or four, a group of Japanese army and air force officers, including Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, which although fast retreating in Manchuria still held the Manchurian peninsula, and Bose and Rahman. Bose was sitting a little to the rear of the portside wing; the bomber, under normal circumstances, carried a crew of five. That these flights were possible a few days after Japan's surrender was the result of a lack of clarity about what had occurred. Although Japan had unconditionally surrendered, when Emperor Hirohito had made his announcement over the radio, he had used formal Japanese, not entirely intelligible to ordinary people and, instead of using the word \\"surrender\\" (in Japanese), had mentioned only \\"abiding by the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.\\" Consequently, many people, especially in Japanese-occupied territories, were unsure if anything had significantly changed, allowing a window of a few days for the Japanese air force to continue flying. Although the Japanese and Bose were tight lipped about the destination of the bomber, it was widely assumed by Bose's staff left behind in Saigon that the plane was bound for Dairen on the Manchurian peninsula, which, as stated above, was still under Japanese control. Bose had been talking for over a year about the importance of making contact with the communists, both Russian and Chinese. In 1944, he had asked a minister in his cabinet, Anand Mohan Sahay to travel to Tokyo for the purposes of making contact with the Soviet ambassador, Jacob Malik. However, after consulting the Japanese foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, Sahay decided against it. In May 1945, Sahay had again written to Shigemitsu requesting him to contact Soviet authorities on behalf of Bose; again the reply had been in the negative. Bose had been continually querying General Isoda for over a year about the Japanese army's readiness in Manchuria. After the war, the Japanese confirmed to the British investigators and later Indian commissions of inquiry, that plane was indeed bound for Dairen, and that fellow passenger General Shidea of the Kwantung Army, was to have disembarked with Bose in Dairen and to have served as the main liaison and negotiator for Bose's transfer into Soviet controlled territory in Manchuria. The plane had flown north. By the time it was near the northern coast of French Indo-China, darkness had begun to close in, and the pilot decided to make an unscheduled stop in Tourane (now Da Nang, Vietnam). The passengers stayed overnight at a hotel, and the crew, worried that the plane was overloaded, shed some 500 pounds of equipment and luggage, and also refueled the plane. Before dawn the next morning, the group flew out again, this time east to Taihoku, Formosa (now Taipei, Taiwan), which was a scheduled stop, arriving there around noon on 18 August 1945. During the two-hour stop in Taihoku, the plane was again refueled, while the passengers ate lunch. The chief pilot and the ground engineer, and Major Kono, seemed concerned about the portside engine, and, once all the passengers were on board, the engine was tested by repeatedly throttling up and down. The concerns allayed, the plane finally took off, in different accounts, as early as 2 PM, and as late as 2:30 PM, watched by ground engineers. =Death in plane crash= Clipping from Japanese newspaper, published on 23 August 1945, reporting the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese- occupied Manchuria. Just as the bomber was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring. Airport mechanics saw something fall out of the plane. It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller. The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames. Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and General Shidea were instantly killed. Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline. When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door but found it blocked by the luggage. They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front. The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch. The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited. Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned. According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, \\"A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku.\\" The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3 PM. Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter. Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting very much that he would live. Dr. Yoshimi promptly began to treat Bose and was assisted by Dr. Tsuruta. According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, who interviewed all the hospital personnel later: Soon, in spite of the treatment, Bose went into a coma. He died a few hours later, between 9 and 10 PM. Bose's body was cremated in the main Taihoku crematorium two days later, 20 August 1945. On 23 August 1945, the Japanese news agency Domei announced the death of Bose and Shidea. On 7 September a Japanese officer, Lieutenant Tatsuo Hayashida, carried Bose's ashes to Tokyo, and the following morning they were handed to the president of the Tokyo Indian Independence League, Rama Murti. On 14 September a memorial service was held for Bose in Tokyo and a few days later the ashes were turned over to the priest of the Renk≈çji Temple of Nichiren Buddhism in Tokyo. There they have remained ever since. Among the INA personnel, there was widespread disbelief, shock, and trauma. Most affected were the young Tamil Indians from Malaya and Singapore, men and women, who comprised the bulk of the civilians who had enlisted in the INA. The professional soldiers in the INA, most of whom were Punjabis, faced an uncertain future, with many fatalistically expecting reprisals from the British. In India the Indian National Congress's official line was succinctly expressed in a letter Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. Said Gandhi, \\"Subhas Bose has died well. He was undoubtedly a patriot, though misguided.\\" Many congressmen had not forgiven Bose for quarreling with Gandhi and for collaborating with what they considered was Japanese fascism. The Indian soldiers in the British Indian army, some two and a half million of whom had fought during the Second World War, were conflicted about the INA. Some saw the INA as traitors and wanted them punished; others felt more sympathetic. The British Raj, though never seriously threatened by the INA, was to try 300 INA officers for treason in the INA trials, but was to eventually backtrack in the face of its own end. Legends of Bose's survival =Immediate post-war legends= Subhas Chandra Bose's exploits had become legendary long before his physical death in August 1945. From the time he had escaped house arrest in Calcutta in 1940, rumours had been rife in India about whether or not he was alive, and if the latter, where he was and what he was doing. His appearance in faraway Germany in 1941 created a sense of mystery about his activities. With Congress leaders in jail in the wake of the Quit India Resolution in August 1942 and the Indian public starved for political news, Bose's radio broadcasts from Berlin charting radical plans for India's liberation during a time when the star of Germany was still rising and that of Britain was at its lowest, made him an object of adulation among many in India and southeast Asia. During his two years in Germany, according to historian Romain Hayes, \\"If Bose gradually obtained respect in Berlin, in Tokyo he earned fervent admiration and was seen very much as an 'Indian samurai'.\\" Thus it was that when Bose appeared in Southeast Asia in July 1943, brought mysteriously on German and Japanese submarines, he was already a figure of mythical size and reach. After Bose's death, Bose's other lieutenants, who were to have accompanied him to Manchuria, but were left behind in Saigon, never saw a body. There were no photographs taken of the injured or deceased Bose, neither was a death certificate issued. According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, For these two reasons, when news of Bose's death was reported, many in the INA refused to believe it and were able to transmit their disbelief to a wider public. The source of the widespread skepticism in the INA might have been Bose's senior officer J. R. Bhonsle. Bhonsle, unlike some other senior officers, had been kept in the dark about Bose's final plans, in part because he had also become an agent for the British. When a Japanese delegation, which included General Isoda, visited Bhonsle on 19 August 1945 to break the news and offer condolences, he responded by telling Isoda that Bose had not died, rather his disappearance has been covered up. Even Mohandas Gandhi swiftly said that he was skeptical about the air crash, but changed his mind after meeting the Indian survivor Habibur Rahman. As in 1940, before long, in 1945, rumours were rife about what had happened to Bose, whether he was in Soviet-held Manchuria, a prisoner of the Soviet army, or whether he had gone into hiding with the cooperation of the Soviet army. Lakshmi Swaminathan, of the all-female Rani of Jhansi regiment of the INA, later Lakshmi Sahgal, said in spring 1946 that she thought Bose was in China. Many rumours spoke of Bose preparing for his final march on Delhi. This was the time when Bose began to be sighted by people, one sighter claiming \\"he had met Bose in a third-class compartment of the Bombay express on a Thursday.\\" =Enduring legends= In the 1950s, stories appeared in which Bose had become a sadhu, or Hindu renunciant. The best-known and most intricate of the renunciant tales of Subhas Bose, and one which, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, may \\"properly be called a myth,\\" was told in the early 1960s. Some associates of Bose, from two decades before, had formed an organization, the \\"Subhasbadi Janata\\", to promote this story in which Bose was now the chief sadhu of an ashram (or hermitage) in Shaulmari (also Shoulmari) in North Bengal. The Janata brought out published material, including several newspapers and magazines. Of these, some were long lived and some short, but all, by their number, attempted to create the illusion of the story's newsworthiness. The chief sadhu himself vigorously denied being Bose. Several intimates of Bose, including some politicians, who met with the sadhu, supported the denials. Even so, the Subhasbadi Janata was able to create an elaborate chronology of Bose's post-war activities. According to this chronology, after his return to India, Bose returned to the vocation of his youth: he became a Hindu renunciant. He attended unseen Gandhi's cremation in Delhi in early February 1948; walked across and around India several times; became a yogi at a Shiva temple in Bareilly in north central India from 1956 to 1959; became a practitioner of herbal medicine and effected several cures, including one of tuberculosis; and established the Shaulmari Ashram in 1959, taking the religious name Srimat Saradanandaji. Bose, moreover, was engaged in tapasya, or meditation, to free the world, his goals having been broadened, after his first goal‚Äîfreeing India‚Äîwas achieved. His attempt to do so, however, and to assume his true identity, was being thwarted jointly by political parties, newspapers, the Indian government, even foreign governments. Others stories appeared, spun by the Janata and by others. Bose was still in the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China; attended the Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's cremation in 1964, but, this time, neglecting to disallow a Janata-published newspaper to photograph him; and gave notice to the Janata of his return to Calcutta, for which several much publicized rallies were organized. Bose did not appear. The Janata eventually broke up, its reputation marred by successive non-appearances of its protagonist. The real sadhu of Shaulmari, who continued to deny he was Bose, died in 1977. It was also claimed that Nikita Khrushchev had reportedly told an interpreter during his New Delhi visit that Bose can be produced within 45 days if Nehru wishes. Still other stories or hoaxes‚Äîelucidated with conspiracies and accompanied with fake photographs‚Äîof the now-aging Bose being in the Soviet Union or China had traction well into the early 80s. Bose was seen in a photograph taken in Beijing, inexplicably parading with the Chinese Red Army. Bose was said to be in a Soviet Gulag. The Soviet leadership was said to be blackmailing Nehru, and later, Indira Gandhi, with the threat of releasing Bose. An Indian member of parliament, Samar Guha, released in 1979 what he claimed was a contemporaneous photograph of Bose. This turned out to have been doctored, comprising one-half Bose and one-half his elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose. Guha also charged Nehru with having had knowledge of Bose's incarceration in the Soviet Union even in the 1950s, a charge Guha recanted after he was sued. For the remainder of the century and into the next, the renunciant legends continued to appear. Most prominently, a retired judge, who had been appointed by the Indian Government in 1999 to undertake an enquiry into Bose's death, brought public notice to another sannyasi or renunciant, \\"Gumnami Baba,\\" also known by his religious name, \\"Bhagwanji,\\" who was said to have lived in the town of Faizabad in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. According to historian Sugata Bose, Earlier, in 1977, summing up the extant Bose legends, historian Joyce Chapman Lebra had written, =Perspectives on durability of legends= According to historians Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper: Amid all this, Joyce Chapman Lebra, wrote in 2008: Inquiries =Figgess Report 1946= Confronted with rumours about Bose, which had begun to spread within days of his death, the Supreme Allied Command, South-east Asia, under Mountbatten, tasked Colonel (later Sir) John Figgess, an intelligence officer, with investigating Bose's death. Figgess's report, submitted on 25 July 1946, however, was confidential, being work done in Indian Political Intelligence (IPI), a partially secret branch of the Government of India. Figgess was interviewed in the 1980s by Leonard A. Gordon and confirmed writing the report. In 1997, the British Government made most of the IPI files available for public viewing in the India Office Records of the British Library. However, the Figgess report was not among them. A photocopy of the Figess report was soon anonymously donated for public viewing to the British Library in the European manuscripts collection, as Eur. MSS. c 785. Good candidates for the donor, according to Leonard Gordon, are Figgess himself, who had died in 1997, or more likely another British intelligence officer in wartime India, Hugh Toye, the author of a book (). The crucial paragraph in the Figgess report (by Colonel John Figgess, Indian Political Intelligence, 25 July 1946,) is: The remaining four pages of the Figgess report contain interviews with two survivors of the plane crash, Lt. Cols. Nonogaki and Sakai, with Dr. Yoshimi, who treated Bose in the hospital and with others involved in post-death arrangements. In 1979, Leonard Gordon himself interviewed \\"Lt. Cols. Nonogaki and Sakai, and, (in addition, plane- crash survivor) Major Kono; Dr. Yoshimi ...; the Japanese orderly who sat in the room through these treatments; and the Japanese officer, Lt. Hayashita, who carried Bose's ashes from the crematorium in Taipei to Japan.\\" The Figgess report and Leonard Gordon's investigations confirm four facts: * The crash near Taihoku airport on 18 August 1945 of a plane on which Subhas Chandra Bose was a passenger; * Bose's death in the nearby military hospital on the same day; * Bose's cremation in Taihoku; and * transfer of Bose's ashes to Tokyo. =Shah Nawaz Committee 1956= With the goal of quelling the rumours about what happened to Subhas Chandra Bose after mid-August 1945, the Government of India in 1956 appointed a three-man committee headed by Shah Nawaz Khan. Khan was at the time a Member of Parliament as well as a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian National Army and the best-known defendant in the INA Trials of a decade before. The other members of the committee were S. N. Maitra, ICS, who was nominated by the Government of West Bengal, and Suresh Chandra Bose, an elder brother of Bose. The committee is referred to as the \\"Shah Nawaj Committee\\" or the \\"Netaji Inquiry Committee.\\" From April to July 1956, the committee interviewed 67 witnesses in India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam. In particular, the committee interviewed all the survivors of the plane crash, some of whom had scars on their bodies from burns. The committee interviewed Dr. Yoshimi, the surgeon at the Taihoku Military Hospital who treated Bose in his last hours. It also interviewed Bose's Indian companion on the flight, Habib ur Rahman, who, after the partition, had moved to Pakistan and had burn scars from the plane crash. Although there were minor discrepancies here and there in the evidence, the first two members of the committee, Khan and Maitra, concluded that Bose had died in the plane crash in Taihoku on 18 August 1945. Bose's brother, Suresh Chandra Bose, however, after having signed off on the initial conclusions, declined to sign the final report. He, moreover, wrote a dissenting note in which he claimed that the other members and staff of the Shah Nawaz Committee had deliberately withheld some crucial evidence from him, that the committee had been directed by Jawaharlal Nehru to infer death by plane crash, and that the other committee members, along with Bengal's chief minister B. C. Roy, had pressured him bluntly to sign the conclusions of their final report. According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, =Khosla Commission 1970= In 1977, two decades after the Shah Nawaz committee had reported its findings, historian Joyce Chapman Lebra wrote about Suresh Chandra Bose's dissenting note: \\"Whatever Mr Bose's motives in issuing his minority report, he has helped to perpetuate until the present the faith that Subhas Chandra Bose still lives.\\" In fact, during the early 1960s, the rumours about Subhas Bose's extant forms only increased. In 1970, the Government of India appointed a new commission to enquire into the \\"disappearance\\" of Bose. With a view to heading off more minority reports, this time it was a \\"one-man commission.\\" The single investigator was G. D. Khosla, a retired chief justice of the Punjab High Court. As Justice Khosla had other duties, he submitted his report only in 1974. Justice Khosla, who brought his legal background to bear on the issue in a methodical fashion, not only concurred with the earlier reports of Figess and the Shah Nawaz Committee on the main facts of Bose's death, but also evaluated the alternative explanations of Bose's disappearance and the motives of those promoting stories of Netaji sightings. Historian Leonard A. Gordon writes: =Mukherjee Commission 2005= In 1999, following a court order, the Indian government appointed retired Supreme Court judge Manoj Kumar Mukherjee to probe the death of Bose. The commission perused hundreds of files on Bose's death drawn from several countries and visited Japan, Russia and Taiwan. Although oral accounts were in favour of the plane crash, the commission concluded that those accounts could not be relied upon and that there was a secret plan to ensure Bose's safe passage to the USSR with the knowledge of Japanese authorities and Habibur Rahman. It though failed to make any progress about Bose's activities, after the staged crash. The commission also concluded that the ashes kept at the Renkoji temple (which supposedly contain skeletal remains) reported to be Bose's, were of Ichiro Okura, a Japanese soldier who died of cardiac arrest but asked for a DNA test. It also determined Gumnami Baba to be different from Subhas Bose in light of a DNA profiling test. The Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to on 8 November 2005 after 3 extensions and it was tabled in the Indian Parliament on 17 May 2006. The Indian Government rejected the findings of the commission. Key findings of the report (esp. about their rejection of the plane-crash-theory) have been criticized and the report contains other glaring inaccuracies. Sugata Bose notes that Mukherjee himself admitted to harbouring a preconceived notion about Bose being alive and living as an ascetic. He also blames the commission for entertaining the most preposterous and fanciful of all stories, thus adding to the confusion and for failing to distinguish between the highly probable and utterly impossible. Gordon notes that the report had failed to list all of the people who were interviewed by the committee (including him) and that it mis-listed and mis- titled many of the books, used as sources. =Japanese government report 1956, declassified September 2016= An investigative report by Japanese government titled \\"Investigation on the cause of death and other matters of the late Subhas Chandra Bose\\" was declassified on 1 September 2016. It concluded that Bose died in a plane crash in Taiwan on 18 August 1945. The report was completed in January 1956 and was handed over to the Indian embassy in Tokyo, but was not made public for more than 60 years as it was classified. According to the report, just after takeoff a propellor blade on the airplane in which Bose was traveling broke off and the engine fell off the plane, which then crashed and burst into flames. When Bose exited it his clothes caught fire and he was severely burned. He was admitted to hospital, and although he was conscious and able to carry on a conversation for some time he died several hours later.

A patent is not a right to practice or use the invention, but a territorial right to exclude others from commercially exploiting the invention, granted to an inventor or his successor in rights in exchange to a public disclosure of the invention. A =Abandonment= The reply of an applicant to an office action must be made within a prescribed time limit. If no reply is received within the time period, the application may be considered, depending on the jurisdiction, as abandoned or deemed to be withdrawn, and, therefore, no longer pending. =Allowance= A patent is \\"allowed\\" when the patent office examiners have determined that the patent application meets the necessary criteria of novelty, non-obviousness, feasibility, and usefulness. The applicants are notified of this certification, and that the patent office is ready to grant the patent once certain fees are paid and paperwork filed by the inventors or assignees. The term is used in the U.S. and some other countries. Few allowed patents are not subsequently granted. =Annuity fee= A fee to be paid to maintain a patent or a patent application in force. Also called \\"maintenance fee\\" or \\"renewal fee\\". =Application= An application for a patent, or patent application, is a request by a person or company to the competent authority (usually a patent office) to grant him a patent. By extension, a patent application also refers to the content of the document which that person or company filed to initiate the application process. This document usually contains a description of the invention and at least one claim used to define the sought scope of protection. =Assignor estoppel= In United States patent law, an equitable estoppel barring a patent's seller (assignor) from attacking the patent's validity if he/she is found to have infringed that patent later. =Auslegeschrift= In outdated German patent law, the second reading, or publication, of a patent application. =Author‚Äôs certificate= A form of inventor's recognition formerly available in the Soviet Union and a number of Socialist countries. Also called \\"inventor's certificate\\". B =Biogen sufficiency= U.K. law concept according to which, if \\"the extent of the monopoly claimed [in a patent] exceeds the technical contribution to the art made by the invention as described in the specification\\", the patent may be revoked on the ground of insufficiency of disclosure. The concept stems from the decision Biogen v. Medeva, issued by the House of Lords on 31 October 1996.EPO Board of Appeal decision T 1727/12 of 1 February 2016, point 1.2. =Bolar exemption= See research exemption. =Branching off= Under German patent law, a procedure consisting in deriving a utility model (German: Gebrauchsmuster) from a pending patent application.

C =Catch and release= The practice of a patent holding company buying a patent, offering a license to its members and then selling or donating the patent after a certain period of time. =Chapter I= In the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), \\"Chapter I\\" refers to the prosecution procedure when no demand under is made. The states selected under Chapter I by the applicant are called \\"designated States\\". and . =Chapter II= In the PCT, \\"Chapter II\\" refers to the prosecution procedure when a demand under is made. An international preliminary examination is conducted in this case. The demand indicates the Contracting State or States in which the applicant intends to use the results of the international preliminary examination (\\"elected States\\"). and . =Claim= A noun phrase defining the extent of the protection conferred by a patent, or the extent of protection sought in a patent application. =Claim chart= A chart often used in the context of patent litigation for analyzing and presenting information regarding a patent claim vis-√†-vis an allegedly infringing product or method. =Claim construction= The process of interpreting or explaining the meaning of the terms in a patent claim, especially in the context of patent infringement. =Clearance search and opinion= A search done on issued patents or on pending patent applications to determine if a product or process infringes any of the claims of the issued patents or pending patent applications. These searches and opinions are also called freedom-to-operate searches and opinions. See Patent infringement. =Common general knowledge= A legal concept used notably when assessing whether an invention involves an inventive step and whether the disclosure of the invention is sufficiently clear and complete for a skilled person in the art to be able to carry out the invention. The common general knowledge \\"is the common knowledge in the field to which the invention relates.\\" The information \\"must be generally known and generally regarded as a good basis for further action by the bulk of those engaged in that art before it becomes part of their common stock of knowledge relating to the art, and so part of the common general knowledge.\\"Generics (UK) Ltd v Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd & Anor [2008] EWHC 2413 (Pat) (October 15, 2008), items 36‚Äì37. Regarding the inventive step assessment, \\"[if] information is part of the common general knowledge then it forms part of the stock of knowledge which will inform and guide the skilled person's approach to the problem from the outset.

A non-provisional application may also claim priority to a prior filed application, which is not permitted with provisional applications. =Novelty= A patentability requirement according to which an invention is not patentable if it was already known before the date of filing. =Nullity action= Lawsuit initiated by a party requesting a patent to be declared invalid, i.e. to be revoked. Also called \\"revocation action\\". O =Objective technical problem= In the so-called \\"problem- solution approach\\" applied by the European Patent Office (EPO) to assess whether a claimed invention involves an inventive step (), the problem that the notional skilled person is tasked with solving. If the skilled person, starting from the closest prior art and faced with the objective technical problem, would have arrived, without exercising any inventive skill, at the claimed invention, then the claimed invention is regarded as being obvious, i.e. the claimed invention does not involve an inventive step. =Office action= A formal report from a Patent Office examiner to an inventor or attorney detailing which claims in a patent application were allowed for later issue (publication) in a patent and which claims were rejected. The examiner gives reasons for allowance or rejection. =On-sale bar= A concept of U.S. law in which the grant of a patent is prevented if the invention that is the subject of the patent application was on sale more than one year prior to the priority date. =Opposition proceeding= Proceedings in which a third party opposes the grant of a patent in an attempt to prevent that grant, or have the patent revoked. Opposition proceedings may be pre- or post-grant. P =Patent= A territorial right to prevent others from commercially exploiting an invention, granted to an inventor or his successor in rights in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. A patent is regarded as a specific type of intellectual property right, and is granted for a limited period of time, the term of the patent. =Patent ambush= A patent ambush occurs when a member of a standard-setting organization withholds information, during participation in development and setting a standard, about a patent that the member or the member's company owns, has pending, or intends to file, which is relevant to the standard, and subsequently the company asserts that a patent is infringed by use of the standard as adopted. =Patent Application Locating and Monitoring System (PALM)= The Patent Application Locating and Monitoring System (PALM) is used to support the Reexamination process inside the USPTO. Reexamination is the examination of a granted patent, which can result in the revocation of that patent. The PALM system is used with both Image File Wrappers and paper File Wrappers. See Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure, Section 2235. =Patent caveat= Formerly, in United States patent law, a legal document filed with the United States Patent Office.Patent Act of 1836 Caveats were discontinued in 1909. A caveat was like a patent application with a description of an invention and drawings, but without claims. It was an official notice of intention to file a patent application at a later date. =Patent classification= Classification of patents in technological areas for convenient retrieval during prior art searches. =Patent drawing= Technical drawing in a patent application, that illustrates the invention. It may be required by law to be in a particular form. =Patent family= A group of patents related by a common priority claim. =Patent flooding= Patenting every possible way of doing something. =Patent infringement= Commercially exploiting an invention claimed in a patent without permission of the patentee. =Patent misuse= In United States patent law, an affirmative defense used in patent litigation after the defendant has been found to have infringed a patent. =Patent model= A miniature model that shows how an invention works. =Patent monetization= The generation of revenue or the attempt to generate revenue by a person or company by selling or licensing the patents it owns. =Patent pending= ejector seat of the military aircraft, stating \\"Patents pending in other dominions and foreign countries\\". D√ºbendorf Museum of Military Aviation. A warning that a patent application has been filed for an invention integrated in a product. The warning indicates that the applicant(s) may be entitled to some rights even if a patent has not been granted yet, or that the applicant(s) will be entitled to some rights once a patent is granted. =Patent pool= A consortium of at least two companies agreeing to cross- license patents and other IP rights relating to a particular technology. =Patent portfolio= A collection of patents owned by a single entity, such as an individual or corporation. =Patent specification= See specification. =Patent thicket= A dense web of overlapping intellectual property rights that a company must navigate through in order to commercialize new technology.Carl Shapiro, Navigating the Patent Thicket: Cross Licenses, Patent Pools, and Standard-Setting, 2001, Innovation Policy and the Economy (Vol. I) (Jaffe, E. et al., eds), pp. 119‚Äì150, MIT Press. =Patent troll= A person or company who enforces patent rights against accused infringers in an attempt to collect licensing fees, but does not manufacture products or supply services based upon the patents in question. Also called a patent assertion entity (PAE) or non practicing entity (NPE). =Patent watch= A process for monitoring newly issued patents on a periodic basis to see if any of these patents might be of interest. =Patentability= A set of substantive requirements for a patent to be granted. An invention satisfying these requirements is said to be patentable. =Patentability opinion= An opinion as to whether an invention might be patentable. Such an opinion may be established by a patent attorney to assist an inventor or company into deciding whether to file a patent application.Mark J. Thronson, Joel M. Grossman, Gabrielle S. Roth, Jon D. Grossman, Intellectual Property Legal Opinions (Loose Leaf), Aspen Publishers, 2008 Supplement, page 1-12. . =Patentable subject matter= Patent systems exclude certain areas from the grant of patents. Material not so excluded is known as patentable subject matter. =Patentee= One to whom a patent was granted. Also called \\"patent holder\\", \\"patent proprietor\\", or \\"patent right holder\\". =Pay-for-delay= A deal under which a company holding a patent on a drug pays a generic manufacturer to delay its launch of a cheap copy of the drug.Something rotten, The Economist, August 6, 2009. Consulted on August 7, 2009. =PCT application= A patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Also called \\"international application\\". =PCT Direct= A procedural scheme launched in 2014 by the European Patent Office (EPO). The scheme consists in allowing an applicant filing a PCT application claiming priority from an earlier application already searched by the EPO to reply ‚Äìat the time of filing the PCT application‚Äì to any objections raised in the search opinion drawn up for the priority application. =Person having ordinary skill in the art= A notional person having typical knowledge of a particular field or art, used such as to assess whether an invention is nonobvious or whether the specification of the patent enables one to practice what is claimed. =Petition to make special= A United States patent law procedure that requests the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to accelerate a patent's prosecution, based on a showing that certain conditions are met. For example, if the inventor is old or sick, or the field of invention is a favored area of science that significantly enriches people's lives, The U.S. PTO may allow such a petition. =Petty patent= Phrase sometimes used to refer to utility models and Gebrauchsmuster, which are specific forms of patents for inventions usually granted for a shorter term, i.e. mostly 6 or 10 years instead of 20 years. In some jurisdictions, the patentability criteria applicable to petty patents are less stringent than those applicable to 20-year patents. See also innovation patent. =PHOSITA= In the United States, an abbreviation for \\"person having ordinary skill in the art\\". =Piracy= Pejorative term. Generally refers to the willful infringement of a patent. May also be applied to the vigorous enforcement of a patent. =Pre-grant Publication= Pre-grant Publication (PGpub) is the procedure under 35 U.S.C. Section 122(b) requiring the publication of most United States patent applications 18 months after their filing dates. This procedure was first enacted in the 1999 American Inventors Protection Act. =Preliminary injunction= An injunction issued by a court prior to a final determination of the merits of a legal case, in order to restrain a party from going ahead with a course of conduct or compelling a party to continue with a course of conduct until the case has been decided. In patent law, a preliminary injunction typically allows a patent to be enforced against an infringer prior to a final decision on the merits, i.e. while the infringement proceedings are pending. Depending on the jurisdiction, a number of requirements may have to be met for the court to grant a preliminary injunction, such as: urgency (to prevent imminent harm to the patentee's business), clear infringement, and a sufficient likelihood that the patent is valid. =Prior art= Material publicly available prior to the priority date of an application which may anticipate the subject of and prevent the grant of a patent. =Priority right= The priority right is a right to claim priority from an earlier application. Claiming priority gives the later filed application a priority date of the filing date of the earlier application. =Problem-solution approach= Under the case law and practice of the European Patent Office (EPO), a systematic approach to assess whether an invention involves an inventive step. Also called \\"problem and solution approach\\". =Prosecution history estoppel= In certain states, most notably the United States, actions during prosecution can estop a party from certain later actions or assertions. =Provisional application= In United States patent law, a legal document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that establishes an early filing date, but which does not mature into an issued patent unless the applicant files a regular patent application within one year. See also Non-provisional patent application. =Provisional (patent) rights or provisional protection= The rights conferred to a published patent application, i.e. the rights conferred before the patent is granted. See also U.S. patent law, 35 USC 154(d). Under the European Patent Convention, :\\"for the period of provisional protection, between the moment of publication of the patent application and the moment of the publication of the patent grant, requires Member States to ensure that the applicant can claim compensation reasonable in the circumstances from any person who has used the invention in their territory. Following publication of the mention of the patent grant, full compensation of any losses suffered may be claimed, depending also on whether the infringer knew or should have known that he or she was infringing.\\"European Commission, Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper), November 28, 2008, page 98, footnote 116 (pdf, 1.95 MB). (See copyright notice in page 1: \\"Reproduction of parts of this report that are based on the Commission's own research is authorised, provided that the source is acknowledged. For material quoted in this report that is derived from other sources, permission must be sought directly from the copyright holder.\\") R =Reading a claim= The process of establishing patent infringement involves \\"reading\\" a claim onto the technology of interest. If all of the claim's elements are found in the technology, the claim is said to \\"read on\\" the technology; if a single element from the claim is missing from the technology, the claim does not literally read on the technology and the technology does not infringe the patent with respect to that claim. Also, the process of contesting or invalidating a patent can involve showing that the claim reads on prior art, i.e., the claim's elements are found in the prior art. =Reasonable and non- discriminatory licensing= A type of licensing typically used during standardisation processes. Also abbreviated \\"RAND\\". =Reduction to practice= In United States patent law, making or performing an invention (actual reduction to practice) or filing a patent application describing how to make and use an invention (constructive reduction to practice). Important for determining which party is \\"first to invent\\". =Reexamination= The examination of a granted patent, which can result in the revocation of that patent. =Regional patent= A single patent covering a set of countries. As of 2012, the only true regional patent covering more than two countries appears to be the OAPI patent. The European patent, the Eurasian patent, and the ARIPO patent each effectively lead, once granted, to a bundle of national patents for which there might be separate translation requirements (for example in the European Patent Convention), maintenance fees, durations of protection (for example with ARIPO) and separate jurisdiction exist (a patent invalidated in one country might still be valid in others). The unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein can also be regarded as a regional patent with a truly unitary effect. See also unitary patent. =Regional phase= The prosecution phase wherein an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) becomes subject to examination at a regional level. There are four regional patent treaties: the European Patent Convention, the Eurasian Patent Convention, the Bangui Agreement (see African Intellectual Property Organization or OAPI), and the Harare Protocol (see African Regional Intellectual Property Organization or ARIPO). See also National phase. =Registration patent= A type of patent that takes effect, even if the substantial requirements (e.g. regarding novelty) have not been fulfilled. The Belgian, Dutch and French patents are examples of registration patents. =Reissue patent= A U.S. patent that is reissued by the USPTO after the patentee filed an application for reissue, because the originally issued patent was regarded as defective.MPEP ¬ß 1401 Reissue =Rejection= In the United States, to have patent claims \\"rejected\\" in a patent application means that the subject matter as claimed is considered by the patent examiner to be unpatentable. A final Office action based on rejection of claims is subject to review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI). cf Objections, supra. =Request for continued examination= In the United States, a request by an applicant for continued prosecution after the patent office has issued a \\"final\\" rejection or after prosecution \\"on the merits\\" has been closed (for example by a Notice of Allowance (NOA)). =Research exemption= In some legislations, an exemption to the rights conferred by patents, pursuant to which performing research and tests for preparing regulatory approval does not constitute infringement for a limited term before the end of patent term. =Restitutio in integrum= In the European Patent Convention, a means of redress following a loss of right due to the non-observance of a time limit in spite of all due care. =Revocation action= Lawsuit initiated by a party requesting a patent to be declared invalid, i.e. to be revoked. Also called \\"nullity action\\". S =Sandor Obviousness= In United States patent law, an obviousness rejection based on a single reference. Generally a case for an obviousness rejection requires the examiner to rely on 2 or more references. Sandor Obviousness stems from Ex Parte Sandor Nagy where the examiner relied on only a single reference to reject the claims at issue. Ultimately the case was remanded on appeal back to the examiner. =Search report= A report established by a patent office, which mentions documents which may be taken into consideration in deciding whether the invention to which a patent application relates is patentable. =Second medical use= The patenting of a particular medical use of a molecule (or more generally product or composition), wherein a first particular use of a molecule is already known and, therefore, wherein the novel and inventive aspect lies solely in the second use of the molecule. Also known as further medical use. =Selection invention= An invention consisting in the selection of individual elements, sub-sets, or sub-ranges, within a larger, known set or range.: \\"Selection inventions\\" (Novelty), : \\"Selection inventions\\" (Inventive step). A selection patent is a patent granted on a selection invention.Jochen E. B√ºhling, Dariusz Szleper, Thierry Calame, Nicolai Lindgreen, Nicola Dagg, Shoichi Okuyama,Working Guidelines, Question Q209, Selection Inventions ‚Äì the Inventive Step Requirement, other Patentability Criteria and Scope of Protection, AIPPI. Consulted on March 29, 2009. \\"A selection patent is a patent granted for making an inventive selection from a field that is already known. Selection inventions may involve the selection of individual elements, sub-sets, or sub-ranges, which have not been explicitly disclosed previously, within a larger known set or range.\\" =Selection patent= See selection invention. =Skilled person (in the art)= See person having ordinary skill in the art. =Small entity status= In United States patent law, a status allowing small businesses, independent inventors, and nonprofit organizations to file a patent application and maintain an issued patent for a reduced fee. An entity that does not qualify for small entity status is charged double the fees charged small entities.35 U.S.C. 41 (h)(1), 37 C.F.R. 1.27 Changes to US patent law in December 2012 created a sub-category of Small Entity Status called \\"Micro Entity Status\\"Federal Register, page 75033-75034, 37 CFR 1.29 for inventors who qualify for Small Entity Status, but also have a gross income less than a certain amount, and have assigned their patent(s) to their employer which is an institution of higher education.December 19, 2012, Federal Register page 75034, left column =Software patent= A patent in the field of computer software. Some types of inventions in the field of software are legally considered non-patentable subject-matter, depending on the jurisdiction. See also software patents under the European Patent Convention, under TRIPs Agreement, under United Kingdom patent law, under United States patent law, computer programs and the Patent Cooperation Treaty, software patent debate. =Specification= The specification, or patent specification, may either refer to the description of a patent or patent application, which is the meaning prevalent in the U.S.,See for example MPEP 608 \\"...since each of these sections (specification, abstract, claims, sequence listings) of the disclosure are separately indexed...\\" or to the complete patent as granted, which is meaning prevalent in Europe.See for example : \\"The specification of the European patent shall include the description, the claims and any drawings.\\" =State of the art= A synonym for prior art. =Statutory Invention Registration= A procedure governed by MPEP Sections 1100 et al. in which a patent applicant could request a public filing of their application. Usually, this was used when the applicant felt a patent was no longer possible during the application period. It may now be obsolete due to the 1999 America Inventors Protection Act which required publication of U.S. applications in 18 months unless an exception applied. =Submarine patent= A patent first published and granted long after the original application was filed. =Sufficiency of disclosure= An important requirement to be met by a patent in order to be validly granted. According to this requirement, an invention must be described in the application or patent in a sufficiently clear and complete manner to enable the person skilled in the art to carry out the invention. =Supplementary international search= A prior art search performed for an international (PCT) application in addition to the main international search provided for under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The supplementary international search (SIS) is carried out by another International Searching Authority (ISA) than the ISA that carries out the main international search. =Supplementary protection certificate= A sui generis right notably available for medicinal and plant protection products. The right comes into force after the corresponding patent expires and, for medicinal and plant protection products, has a maximum term (i.e., lifetime) of 5 years. =Swear back of a reference= A procedure under U.S. patent law whereby an inventor can get a patent even if the invention has become public before the patent application was filed. Also \\"Swear behind a reference\\" or \\"Antedate\\" a reference. See 35 USC Section 102. T =Technical character= A condition for an invention to be considered patentable under the case law and practice of the European Patent Office (EPO). Namely, an invention must notably have a technical character to be patentable. See for example Software patents under the European Patent Convention. =Term of patent= The maximum period during which it can be maintained in force. =Transfer= An operation by which ownership of a patent or patent application changes (for instance as a result of a financial transaction). =Transitional phrase= In United States patent law, a phrase that links the preamble of a patent claim to the specific elements set forth in the claim which define what the invention itself actually is. The transitional phrase acts as a limitation on the claim, indicating whether a similar device, method, or composition infringes the patent if it contains more or fewer elements than the claim in the patent. U =Unitary patent= A patent having a unitary effect throughout the territories of more than one country. The proposed unitary patent in the European Union, also called \\"European patent with unitary effect\\", is the most well-known unitary patent. Other unitary patents are the unitary patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and the OAPI patent. See also regional patent. =Unity of invention= A requirement that a patent application can relate only to one invention (or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept, see for instance Unity of invention under the European Patent Convention). =Utility= A patentability requirement mainly used to prevent the patenting of inoperative devices such as perpetual motion machines. =Utility model= An intellectual property right which is very similar to the patent, but usually has a shorter term (often 6 or 10 years) and may have less stringent patentability requirements. See also petty patent and innovation patent. V =Validity opinion= A validity opinion, also called \\"invalidity opinion\\", is a legal opinion provided by an attorney on how a court might rule on the validity of an issued patent. Validity opinions are often sought prior to patent litigation. See Patent infringement. X =X-Patent= Patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office between July 1790 (when the first U.S. patent was issued) and July 1836.

The bombing killed twelve Serb civilians who were travelling to Graƒçanica and injured dozens more. Albanian extremists are suspected of being responsible for the attack. Graƒçanica is a predominantly Serb-populated town in central Kosovo, near the regional capital Pristina, in a predominantly Albanian-populated area. Following the Kosovo War in 1999 it became an enclave within Albanian- controlled territory. Relations between the two communities were tense and occasionally violent. Background In early 1998, Serbian police forces moved to put down an uprising by ethnic Albanians in central Kosovo. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) responded by launching a bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 24 March 1999. The campaign lasted for 78 days and ended when the Yugoslav Army (VJ) left the province on 12 June. The 40,000 withdrawing Yugoslav soldiers were replaced by an estimated 50,000 NATO troops. The 848,000 Albanians who were displaced from their homes during the war quickly returned as about 230,000 Serbs, Roma and other non-Albanians were forcibly cleansed from Kosovo or fled it in fear of retaliatory attacks. At least an estimated 300 Serbs were killed by Kosovo Albanians in attacks following the war. Approximately 100 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were damaged or destroyed in the region by the end of 1999. Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) officials condemned some of the attacks while Albanian media organizations attempted to justify them, calling the churches \\"symbols of Serbian fascism\\". Serbian authorities urged international forces to prevent further attacks from occurring. There was widespread unrest in Kosovo in 2000. On 6 June 2000, a grenade was thrown at a crowd of ethnic Serbs waiting for a bus in the town square of Graƒçanica, injuring three people, which was followed by some civil unrest. Since 22 January 2001 an insurgency was carried out in Macedonia by the ethnic Albanian NLA, established by former KLA fighters. Attack The so-called Ni≈° Express was a convoy of five or seven buses which carried 200 ethnic Serbs from Kosovo to the southeastern Serbian city of Ni≈° and back. The convoy was under the protection of a British unit of KFOR and was escorted by five Swedish armoured vehicles. A remote-controlled bomb exploded in its vicinity at noon on 16 February 2001 as it passed through the Albanian-populated town of Podujevo while returning from Ni≈° to the Serbian enclave in Graƒçanica.See: * ; * . The Serbs were travelling to visit family graves in Graƒçanica on the Orthodox Christian Day of the Dead.BBC News The first bus took the full force of the blast. It contained 57 passengers and most of those killed or wounded in the attack were sitting in it. KFOR had received advance warning of the attack and conducted a search of the bus route but failed to uncover any explosive devices. The youngest victim was Danilo Cokic (1999-2001) Reports suggested that the patrol conducting the search was distracted just prior to the explosion by two men acting suspiciously. The explosion caused many injuries and United Nations helicopters were used to airlift at least three victims to hospital. The buses not affected by the blast were able to drive away from the scene. The two men who were spotted by the KFOR patrol before the attack were taken into custody. Aftermath Kosovo Albanian extremists were suspected of orchestrating the attack. Initial reports suggested that 7 people were killed by the blast. Two wounded Serbs died en route to the hospital and the body parts of two others were found amongst the debris of the bus. 12 people were killed and 40 were injured by the blast. According to KFOR's regional commander, the bomb was made of 100‚Äì200 pounds of high explosive.\\"Ruthless murder of Serbs on road to family graves\\", The Birmingham Post, 17 February 2001 The explosion created a crater that was six feet deep and twelve feet wide. Serbs living in Kosovo enclaves began forming crowds and attacking Albanians within one hour of the attack. Serbs in the enclave of ƒåaglavica blocked the road leading to Macedonia and pulled ethnic Albanians out of their cars and assaulted them. The relatives of the victims reacted by staging violent protests in Graƒçanica. NATO leaders condemned the blast and called it \\"premeditated murder\\". NATO peacekeepers on the ground described the bombing as an indiscriminate attack. NATO Secretary General George Robertson responded to the blast by saying \\"NATO did not conduct its air campaign in order to see ethnic cleansing by one group replaced by the ethnic attacks and intimidation of another\\". He warned that Kosovo was in danger of losing the support of the international community if violence continued. The Parliament of Yugoslavia protested the bombing‚Äîwhich it deemed an act of terrorism‚Äîby cutting short its session. A bomb attack in April 2001 targeting Serbs in Pristina left one dead and four injured (KLA volunteer Roland Bartetzko was later found guilty). =Arrests= Controversy surrounds the arrests and subsequent release of the suspects. Five Albanian men were arrested for the attack. Four men were later suspected of committing the attack, but they escaped from a U.S. detention facility in 2002. One Albanian, Florim Ejupi, was convicted in 2008 of planting the bomb and sentenced to 40 years in prison. However, he was released on 13 March 2009.'Panel frees Albanian jailed for Kosovo bus bombing' Reuters On 5 June 2009, EULEX's chief prosecutor announced that the EU mission had opened a new inquest into the case that had been given to the special prosecutor's office in charge of war crimes cases.

Bible use =Hebrew Bible= The origin of the metaphor is the prohibition of putting a stumbling block before the blind (). Geoffrey W. Bromiley calls the image \\"especially appropriate to a rocky land like Palestine\\". In the Hebrew Bible, the term for \\"stumbling block\\" is Biblical Hebrew (). In the Septuagint, is translated into Koine Greek (), a word which occurs only in Hellenistic literature, in the sense \\"snare for an enemy; cause of moral stumbling\\".OED \\"scandal\\", etymology. In the Septuagint a stumbling block means anything that leads to sin. =New Testament= The New Testament usages of , such as , resemble Septuagint usage. It appears 15 times in the New Testament in 12 unique verses according to Strong's Concordance. These passages are: , , (3 times), , , , , , , , , , and . The noun has a derived verb, (formed with the suffix as English \\"scandalize\\"), meaning literally \\"to trip somebody up\\" or, idiomatically, \\"to cause someone to sin.\\" This verb appears 29 times in 27 New Testament verses. Apart from skandalon the idiom of \\"stumbling block\\" has a second synonym in the Greek term proskomma \\"stumbling.\\" Both words are used together in 1 Peter 2:8; this is a \\"stone of stumbling\\" ( ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒøœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œåŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ) and a \\"rock of offense\\" ( œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¥Œ¨ŒªŒøœÖ). The antonymous adjective (·ºÄœÄœÅœåœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœÇ), \\"without causing anyone to stumble,\\" also occurs three times in the New Testament. Later use =Judaism= The Leviticus warning is developed in rabbinical Judaism as lifnei iver \\"before the blind.\\" =Christianity= Catholicism \\"Scandal\\" is discussed by Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica.Vander Heeren 1912, \\"Notion of scandal\\" In the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church, it is discussed under the fifth commandment (Thou shalt not kill) section \\"Respect for the Dignity of Persons\\". Active scandal is performed by a person; passive scandal is the reaction of a person to active scandal (\\"scandal given\\" or in Latin ), or to acts which, because of the viewer's ignorance, weakness, or malice, are regarded as scandalous (\\"scandal received\\" or in Latin ).Vander Heeren 1912, \\"Divisions\\" In order to qualify as scandalous, the behavior must, in itself, be evil or give the appearance of evil.Vander Heeren 1912, \\"Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (1)\\" To do a good act or an indifferent act, even knowing that it will inspire others to sin ‚Äî as when a student studies diligently to do well, knowing it will cause envy ‚Äî is not scandalous. Again, to ask someone to commit perjury is scandalous, but for a judge to require witnesses to give an oath even when he knows the witness is likely to commit perjury is not scandalous. It does not require that the other person actually commit sin; to be scandalous, it suffices that the act is of a nature to lead someone to sin. Scandal is performed with the intention of inducing someone to sin. Urging someone to commit a sin is therefore active scandal. In the case where the person urging the sin is aware of its nature and the person he is urging is ignorant, the sins committed are the fault of the person who urged them. Scandal is also performed when someone performs an evil act, or an act that appears to be evil, knowing that it will lead others into sin. (In case of an apparently evil act, a sufficient reason for the act despite the faults it will cause negates the scandal.) Scandal may also be incurred when an innocent act may be an occasion of sin to the weak, but such acts should not be foregone if the goods at stake are of importance.Vander Heeren 1912, \\"Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (3)\\" Protestantism The term \\"stumbling block\\" is common in Protestant writings. An early use was Martin Luther's consideration that the common belief that the Mass was a sacrifice was a \\"stumbling block.\\" Modern \\"scandal\\" The Greek word was borrowed from Greek to Latin to French, and finally to English as \\"scandal\\".

The reservoir is situated in the Pangani River Valley of the Masai Steppe, about 50 km south of Moshi. It is fed by two major inflows, the rivers Kikuletwa and Ruvu which drain some of catchment consisting of wooded grassland, forest, true desert, and alpine desert. It was constructed for the purposes of irrigation, hydro-electric power and to start a local fishing industry. The reservoir was completed in December 1965 however the irrigation scheme had not yet been developed. The plan was to build a dam that would have served the purpose of storing flood flow, which would allow the development of some 30,000 acres of irrigated farming and generation of electricity power. By 1970 the lake had a thriving Tilapia fishery production. However, this did not last long and subsequent reports from 1972 and 1973 showed a major decline in fish product.

His plays have been staged in over fifty countries all over the world.Page ¬´ Short Biographie¬ª, in √âric-Emmanuel Schmitt website, .  Life  =Early years= Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's parents were teachers of physical education and sport, and his father later became a physiotherapist and masseur in paediatric hospitals. He was also a French boxing champion while his mother was a medal- winning runner. His grandfather was an artisan jeweller. The \\"Classiques & Contemporains\\" edition of La Nuit de Valognes (Don Juan on Trial) claims that Schmitt depicts himself as a rebellious teenager who detested received wisdom and was sometimes prone to violent outbursts. According to Schmitt, however, it was philosophy that saved him and taught him to be himself and to feel that he was free. One day, his mother took him to the Th√©√¢tre des C√©lestins to see a performance of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac starring Jean Marais. Her son was moved to tears and the seeds of his passion for the theatre were sown. After the show, he told his mother that he wanted to \\"be like the man on the poster\\"; his mother thought he meant the actor, Jean Marais, but he replied: \\"No!\\" and read out the name on the poster \\"Edmond Rostand\\". He then began to write. Later, he would say: \\"At sixteen, I realised (or decided) that I was a writer, and I wrote, produced and acted in my first plays at high school.\\" To improve his style, he threw himself with frenzied zeal into exercises of pastiche and re-writing, especially Moli√®re. =Education= After preparatory classes at the Lyc√©e du Parc for France's elite universities, Schmitt passed the entrance exam to the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. He was a student there between 1980 and 1985, leaving with the top French teaching qualification in philosophy (agr√©g√© de philosophie). In 1987, he was awarded the degree of PhD for his thesis \\"Diderot and Metaphysics\\" at the Paris-Sorbonne University, which was published in 1997 with the title \\"Diderot or the Philosophy of Seduction\\". He has lived in Brussels since 2002 and obtained Belgian citizenship in 2008.\\"Wet die naturalisaties verleent / Loi accordant des naturalisations\\", 28 July 2008, http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/welcome.pl = Career = Schmitt spent his military service teaching at the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, afterwards spending two years as a student teaching assistant at the University of Besan√ßon. He went on to teach at the high school in Cherbourg before being appointed lecturer at the University of Chamb√©ry, where he taught for four years. On the night of 4 February 1989, he became separated from his companions during an expedition to the Ahaggar Desert and, in the vast expanses of the Sahara, he underwent a spiritual experience that was nothing short of a divine revelation. In that instant, he says that his mind was filled with the words \\"Everything is justified\\". Schmitt believes that it was that extraordinary experience that enabled him to break into writing. He describes it in his novel Night of Fire (La Nuit de Feu), published in September 2015. During the 1990s, his plays brought him rapid success in several countries. Don Juan on Trial was the first to be performed in September 1991 at Espace 44 in Nantes. His next play, The Visitor, won three prizes at the Moli√®re Award Ceremony in 1994. It was then that he decided to devote himself entirely to writing, and he gave up his lecturing position at the University of Chamb√©ry. In 1996, Enigma Variations received its first performance, starring Alain Delon and Francis Huster in the lead roles. In 1998, his play, Fr√©d√©rick or Crime Boulevard (Fr√©d√©rick ou le boulevard du crime), opened simultaneously in France and Germany, with Jean-Paul Belmondo acting in the original production at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny. In 2001, Mr Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran (M. Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran) was both staged and published in France and Germany. In 2004, the book sold over 250,000 copies in France and 300,000 in Germany. Schmitt has also written three one-act plays for humanitarian causes. Francis Huster played the devil in The Devil's School (L'√âcole du diable), which Schmitt wrote for an Amnesty International evening. One Thousand and One Nights was written for the \\"Culture Changes Life\\" campaign (La culture √ßa change la vie) organised by the French charity The People's Aid (Secours populaire). In the early 2000s, he wrote several novels and short stories. Published in 2000, The Bible According to Pilate, a novel about Christ, won critical acclaim and massive sales. The next year, he produced another novel about a contentious historical figure: The Alternative Hypothesis (La Part de l'autre) is an alternate history in which Hitler is accepted into the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna; what follows changes the course of history for the entire world. He then wrote a whimsical and satirical version of the Faust myth, When I was a Work of Art (Lorsque j'√©tais une oeuvre d'art ‚Äì 2002). The tales that comprise his Cycle de l'Invisible have delighted readers and audiences in the French-speaking world and beyond, both on stage and in the bookshops. Milarepa deals with Buddhism, Mr Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran deals with Sufism, Oscar and the Lady in Pink (Oscar et la Dame rose ‚Äì 2002) with Christianity, Noah's Child (L'Enfant de No√© ‚Äì 2004) with Judaism, The Sumo wrestler Who Could Not Get Fat (Le Sumo qui ne pouvait pas grossir ‚Äì 2009) with Zen Buddhism, and The Ten Children Madam Ming Never Had (Les Dix Enfants que madame Ming n'a jamais eus ‚Äì 2012) deals with Confucianism. They are read by millions of readers of all generations. Keen to explore new modes of expression, Schmitt wrote a work of autofiction, My Life with Mozart (Ma Vie avec Mozart), which was published in eight different countries from South Korea to Norway. This composition of music and words can also be performed by actors and instrumentalists. In the same vein as the first film he wrote and directed, Schmitt published a collection of short stories, Odette Toulemonde and other stories, a celebration of women and their quest for happiness. Odette Toulemonde has toured Europe as both a book and a film. The Dreamer of Ostend (La R√™veuse d'Ostende), a lyrical tribute to the power of the imagination, followed in 2007, while a third collection appeared in 2010: Concerto to the Memory of an Angel (Concerto √† la m√©moire d'un ange), four stories that deal with the theme of redemption and which won the \\"Prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle\\". A fourth collection, Two Gentlemen of Brussels (Les Deux Messieurs de Bruxelles ‚Äì 2012), explores the theme of invisible love, while a fifth, The Revenge of Forgiveness (La Vengeance du Pardon) (2017) concerns forgiveness. These collections are unique for the way in which, like a novel, each has a beginning, a middle and an end, each volume exploring a specific issue over several stories. Returning to the novel in 2008 with the publication of Ulysses from Baghdad, Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt again revealed his talent for being a \\"chameleon story-teller\\" (as described by Fabienne Pascaud in the magazine T√©l√©rama) in a tale about a man who undertakes a journey such as millions make in search of a safe place to go: the story of a stowaway. A contemporary picaresque saga about the human condition, the novel ponders the question: are borders the stronghold of our identities or the last bastion of our illusions? A keen amateur musician with a passion for Mozart, Schmitt has made his mark in the world of opera with a translation into French of two of Mozart's works: The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni. He has also composed music and produced a CD. These days, he continues to write fiction and plays but focuses on writing screenplays. Odette Toulemonde (2007), a film about happiness starring Catherine Frot and Albert Dupontel, was followed by a screen adaptation of Oscar and the Lady in Pink (2009), with, Mich√®le Laroque, Max von Sydow, Amira Casar and Myl√®ne Demongeot in the lead roles. Schmitt is one of the most widely read and performed contemporary French-language authors in the world. His works have been translated into 45 languages and staged in over 50 countries. His plays are constantly being put on in new productions and revivals in both national and private theatres throughout the world and are now part of contemporary repertoire. In January 2012, Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt announced that he was taking over as director of the Th√©√¢tre Rive Gauche in association with the producer and actor, Bruno Metzger. Following a period of renovation and refurbishment, the Th√©√¢tre Rive Gauche opened its doors in September 2012 and now hosts contemporary productions. On Saturday 9 June 2012, the Royal Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature awarded Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt Seat 33 (foreign literary member) replacing Hubert Nyssen; Seat 33 was once occupied by Anna de Noailles, Colette and Jean Cocteau. The public session and reception was held on 25 May 2013. In 2015, he published Night of Fire, an account of the revelation he experienced in the Ahaggar Desert in 1989 and which turned the former atheist into a believer. He now declares himself to be an \\"agnostic who believes\\". In answer to the question \\"Does God exist?\\" he replies, \\"I don't know but I think so.\\" In 2016 Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt was unanimously elected by his peers member of the jury of the Prix Goncourt, he occupies Edmonde Charles-Roux's cover and published a detective novel about violence and the sacred, The Man Who Could See Through Faces (L'Homme qui voyait √† travers les visages). In the spring of 2017, he talked publicly about his childhood and adolescence in When I Grow Up, I'm Going to be a Child (Plus tard, je serai un enfant), a book of interviews produced by Catherine Lalanne. =Other activities= In 2016, Schmitt was a commentator at the Rio Olympic Games alongside Patrick Montel, Alexandre Boyon, St√©phane Diagana and Nelson Monfort on France T√©l√©visions.

The place of the first settlement was known by native mapuche people as Fiske Menuco, which means \\"deep water\\". It was destroyed in 1899 by a flooding of the R√≠o Negro, and had to be rebuilt northwest in higher lands. The General Roca Canalito Its present population is approximately 86,000 (according to ), making it the second most populated city in the province after Bariloche, and the second most important in the Alto Valle after Neuqu√©n. The main activity around the city is the intensive agriculture under irrigation, which made possible an intense agro-industrial activity. The main crops are pears and apples. The city hosts the annual National Festival of the Apple, which is held in early February. General Roca, named after Julio A. Roca, is located from Buenos Aires, from Bah√≠a Blanca, from Viedma and from the deepwater port of San Antonio Este. The city is connected to the east by Argentine National Route 22, and is also crossed by provincial routes 6 and 65, which connect it to other cities in the Alto Valle, with the south of the province, and with the La Pampa Province. Through the centre of the city drives the wide rail train lane that joins Zapala with Bah√≠a Blanca and Buenos Aires. The local airport connects General Roca with other points of the country, mainly with Buenos Aires and Mendoza. Nonetheless, due to lack of maintenance, the airport has not been used since the year 2000. A panoramic picture of Gral. Roca at night where fireworks can be seen. Together with Villa Regina, Allen, Cinco Saltos, Cipolletti, Neuqu√©n and many other smaller towns, they constitute the lineal urbanization of the Alto Valle of the Negro River.

Besides apple and pear orchards, there are vineyards and other establishments producing peaches and a variety of other fruits and vegetables. Within the industrial sector, the fruit-refrigerating storehouses, fruit and vegetable packaging, and other agriculture-related industries stand out. Climate General Roca has a semi-arid climate with warm to hot summers, combined with cool (but rarely cold) winters. Rainfall is sparse year round, resulting in a relative arid influence of the climate, being located in the Andean rain shadow.

It is a multidisciplinary institution that includes a department of theatrical arts and the Institute of Screen Arts. The university has four campuses around the city of Kyiv and a separate student dormitory. The rector of university is Oleksiy Bezghin. History The institution was for the first registered in the Russian Ministry of the Internal Affairs on March 5, 1899 as a music-drama school, but only opened in September 1904. On November 7, 1912 the school was honorary named in the memory of Mykola Lysenko who was its first director. The sponsorship came from Mykola Levytsky and Mykhailo Starytsky, a father-in-law of Ivan Steshenko. The school was opened in the building belonging to the professor-psychiatrist I. Sikorsky on the 15 Velyka Pidvalna street (today Yarslaviv Val). Upon the death of Mykola Lysenko the school chairman became O. Vonsovska, the school violin instructor, and then pianist Maryana Lysenko, the daughter of M.Lysenko. In 1916-1917 there opened the theatrical studio of Les Kurbas. At the end of 1918 the chairman of artistic affairs and national culture Petro Doroshenko signed the document to transform the school into the Higher music- drama school of Mykola Lysenko. During 1919-1920 the first rector of the school was Felix Blumenfeld. Sometime in the span of the Russian Civil War the Bolshevik government approved the request to move the school to 45 Velyka Volodymyrivska street (today it is the Palace of scientists of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). In 1922 the school was moved again to 52 Khreshchatyk, a place it rents to this day from the local municipal administration. In 1924-1928 the rector of the school became Mykola Hrinchenko. During the occupation of Kyiv during World War II between 1941 and 1943, the university was temporarily merged with the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in Moscow.

The current town was settled in the 1880s half a mile west of the original site, and named Garner after a local gin operator. For most of the 20th century, the town has had steady growth, from around 40 residents in 1914 to 98 in 1990. A post office was located in Garner from around 1890 to 1970. The town has a Baptist church, an elementary/middle school, and several small businesses. Much of the surrounding land is used for livestock farming. The post office and general store in Garner were run for many years by a Mr. James A. Vance. A story about him is in a book by Ben K. Green, Wild Cow Tales. The story is called \\"The One That Got Away\\". Mr. Vance was born June 14, 1871, arrived in Garner on Oct. 7, 1894, and died at home in Garner in 1964.

The nature reserve was established in 1997 in order to preserve the unique flora and fauna of the East Usambara Mountains. The East and West Usambara Mountains are a biodiversity hotspot. The Amani Nature Reserve includes tropical cloud forest habitats. Reserve The Amani Nature Reserve was established in 1997 in a forested area in the East Usambara Mountains with an area of , including the Amani Botanical Garden of and a further of forest managed by local tea estates. Traditionally, people living in villages adjacent to the reserve have used the forest as a source of timber, firewood and medicinal plants, a place to gather plants, bush meat, honey and fruit for consumption and a source of live birds, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates for international trade. Flora The forests in the reserve have been described as intermediate evergreen forests or submontane evergreen forest, a type of vegetative cover that tends to grow on the seaward side of both the West and East Usambaras. The dominant trees are Allanblackia stuhlmannii, Isoberlinia scheffleri, Macaranga capensis, Cephalosphaera usambarensis, Myrianthus holstii., Newtonia buchananii and Parinari excelsa. A growing problem in the area is the presence of the invasive West African tree Maesopsis eminii. This tree germinates readily from seeds which are spread by birds, springs up in gaps in the canopy and outperforms native tree seedlings, displacing rare endemics and reducing biodiversity. The forests of East Usambara have long been separated from other forests and their isolation makes them more vulnerable to invasive species such as M. eminii. Fauna Waterfalls at Amani (1906) The fauna of the Usambara Mountains has been compared to that of the Gal√°pagos Islands in terms of its richness and biological importance. The area of the Amani Nature Reserve is better studied than many other parts of the range with numerous endemic invertebrates dependent on the native moist forest cover including mites, spiders, freshwater crabs, dragonflies, beetles, butterflies, millipedes and molluscs. There are few large mammals in the reserve. Duiker and bushpig are plentiful and there are two species of monkey, but the elephants and leopards that used to inhabit the area are no longer present. The elusive long-billed forest warbler (Artisornis moreaui) is known from the reserve and from one other locality, Mount Namuli in northern Mozambique, away. Some of the endemic animals are named after the mountains in which the nature reserve is set, and these include the Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), Usambara alkalat, Usambara hyliota (Hyliota usambara) and the Usambara eagle-owl (Bubo vosseleri). Others are named after the reserve, and these include the Amani sunbird (Hedydipna pallidigaster) and the Amani tailorbird. There are also endemic tree frogs and chameleons unique to the area. Amani Hill Research Station Founded in 1902, after World War II the scientific station became famous for its research into malaria. Since the 1970s the laboratory has remained largely unchanged with the specimens and instruments of a long gone by era. As of 2017 the station receives few visitors and the thirty-four staff maintain the entomological collection continuing to add butterflies and other insects.

Oro√±o (July 20, 1825 in Coronda, Santa Fe ‚Äì October 12, 1904 in Santa Fe) was an Argentine politician and lawyer, and governor of Santa Fe between 1865 and 1868. Youth in the military Oro√±o was born to Unitarian Coronel Santiago Oro√±o and Juana √Åvila Baigorria. At age 16 he joined his father and participated of the military campaigns directed by Juan Lavalle and Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz. In 1839 he married Joaquina Cullen, daughter of Santa Fe governor Domingo Cullen. In 1852 he participated of the Battle of Caseros, fighting together with the forces of Entre R√≠os under the command of Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n, one of the divisions of the Grand Army, against the forces of Buenos Aires led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. Political career Oro√±o Boulevard in downtown Rosario, named after Nicasio Oro√±o. In 1854 Oro√±o sent a letter to president of the Argentine Confederation Justo Jos√© de Urquiza with a proposal for the institutional organization of Rosario, which was approved. On August 17 of that year he was named Customs Administrator, an important position during those times. After the promulgation of the law that gave Rosario city status, the governor of Santa Fe Jos√© Mar√≠a Cullen, Oro√±o's brother-in-law, named him political chief of the city. Oro√±o created a vigilance service for the city. Under his administration the Provincial Hospital of Rosario was opened. The Municipality of Rosario honoured his legacy by renaming a major street as Oro√±o Boulevard in 1904. Together with Marcelino Freyre, Oro√±o represented Santa Fe in the Assembly that wrote the Argentine Constitution in 1853. In 1862 Oro√±o was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies, but in 1865 he resigned, after being chosen to replace Patricio Cullen as governor of Santa Fe Province. In the latter office he focused on the institutionalization of the province. When he finished his mandate in 1868 he was elected national senator, and from his seat he promoted the expansion and population of the country. After a period of political inactivity, Oro√±o was named director of the Office of Lands and Colonies of the Nation in 1891, but was removed from the charge after political differences with president Luis S√°enz Pe√±a. In 1899 he was elected as constitutional deputy for the convention that a year later sanctioned the provincial constitution of Santa Fe. He was again elected national deputy in 1902, but died two years later. References * Javier Etcheverry.

From top left: Silver dimes in paper 2 x 2 holders, a roll of dimes and a mixed-loose lot of half dollars, quarters, dimes and \\"wartime\\" nickels. Junk silver is an informal term used in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia for any silver coin that is in fair or cull condition and has no numismatic or collectible value above the bullion value of the silver it contains. Such coins are popular among people seeking to invest in silver, particularly in small amounts. The word \\"junk\\" refers only to the value of the coins as collectibles and not to the actual condition of the coins; junk silver is not necessarily scrap silver. This citation provides no clarification distinguishing the term junk silver from the equally ambiguous term scrap silver. Precious metals including silver are measured in troy ounces (ozt). A spot price for silver is the price for a troy ounce of silver which is 99.9-percent pure, or 999 fine. Silver coins including junk-silver coins have set silver-alloy contents ranging from 35-percent to 90-percent or more. The term \\"coin silver,\\" for example, refers to 90-percent silver alloy which was the most common alloy used to mint silver U.S. coins. Any combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.00 contains 0.715 troy ounces of 99.9-percent silver (0.7234 troy ounces if uncirculated), except for the silver dollars (Morgan and Peace) which contain .7736 troy ounces of silver. In other words, a full troy ounce of 99.9-percent silver is contained in any combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.40.

Canadian dollar, half-dollar, quarter and dime coins minted after 1919 and before 1967 contained 80-percent silver. Those minted 1919 or earlier are sterling (92.5%) silver. For these coins (1920 - 1966), every CAD$1.00 in face value contains 0.6 troy ounces of silver. The 1967 quarter and dime were minted in either 80% or 50% silver. The 50% quarters and dimes continued part way through 1968 until the mint introduced the 100-percent nickel versions of all the coins mentioned beforehand. To tell the 1968 nickel and silver coins apart, the ones made from nickel are magnetic whereas the silver coins are not. Australian pre-decimal florin, shilling, sixpence and threepence coins minted from 1910 to 1945 contained 92.5-percent silver. From 1946 to 1964, they were minted in \\"post- silver\\" coins which contained 50-percent silver. In 1966, the \\"round\\" 50-cent coin contained 80-percent silver. Swiss 1/2 Franken, 1 Franken and 2 Franken minted from 1874 to 1967 contained 83.5 percent silver. 5 Franken minted from 1922 to 1928 contained 90-percent silver and weighed 25g (385 gr.), and those minted between 1931-1969 contained 83.5 percent silver and weighed 15g (231 gr.). Mexico and many other Central American countries made silver coins that are considered junk silver today. Popularity Junk-silver coins may be a desirable method of investing in silver for several reasons: ;Low premiums: Coins can often be purchased for little or no premium over the spot price of silver, particularly during periods of economic stability. ;Legal tender: In many cases, coins remain legal tender (one notable exception being the United Kingdom, where pre-decimal coinage - including examples minted in silver - was demonetised after the move to decimalisation) and maintain their face value regardless of the price of silver. ;Recognition :Coins are familiar and less likely to have their value disputed than silver rounds or bars. ;Divisibility: Coins can be easily spent or traded in small amounts. In contrast, minted silver bullion is rarely smaller than a troy ounce, while minted gold bullion (and other precious metals) is highly valued in even small amounts, like the American Gold Eagle coins. For these reasons, junk silver is popular among survivalists. In the event of a crisis or catastrophe during which traditional currency collapses, it is speculated that silver coins could provide a viable alternative, temporarily or indefinitely, while fiat currency, which is not backed by precious metals or other commodities, has no inherent value and can be subject to extreme inflation, even hyperinflation, similar to Weimar Germany, post-WWII Hungary and, more recently, Zimbabwe's dollar and Venezuela's bolivar fuerte. Proponents of junk silver and other precious metals claim that, while fiat currencies have historically been subject to hyperinflation, precious metals will always have inherent value and can act as a medium of financial exchange when fiat currencies are obsolete. Junk copper Some coin collectors and investors are also informally using the term \\"junk copper\\" to refer to any copper-bullion coins of no numismatic value. Prominent examples include U.S. pennies minted before 1982 (partial), Canadian pennies minted before 1997, and some pre-euro copper European coins. 154 junk- copper U.S. pennies contain a full pound of .950 fine copper.

Nestled in the northern part of the Nahuel Huapi National Park, and surrounded by lakes, forests and mountains, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful locations in the mountainous parts of Patagonia; earning it the nickname 'Garden of Patagonia (Spanish: Jard√≠n de la Patagonia). Just located a couple of kilometers away from the border with Chile through the Cardenal Antonio Samor√© Pass and with other nearby places such as Bariloche and San Martin de los Andes, it forms a popular tourist corridor during both summer and winter. Geography and climate The town is located halfway between the cities of San Mart√≠n de los Andes and Bariloche, inside the Nahuel Huapi National Park, very close to the isthmus of the Quetrihue Peninsula, where the Los Arrayanes National Park and its arrayanes (Luma apiculata) forest is located. The town is located nearby Cardenal Antonio Samor√© Pass that links it with Osorno in Chile. The elevation of the city centre is about , and the lake is at . Surrounding mountains range from to about (Cerro Bayo, right behind the city, is high). The area's climate is with marked alpine characteristics despite relatively low altitudes. Summers are known for being sunny and pleasant, with high temperatures usually between 18 ¬∞C (65 F) and 25 ¬∞C (77 F), but with cold nights between 2 ¬∞C (35 F) and 9 ¬∞C (48 F). Temperatures will reach 30 ¬∞C (86 F) only a couple of times every year, and night frost happens occasionally during the summer as well. There are often long stretches of sunny, windy weather; however, when the weather gets locked in a stormy pattern, it can remain so for several days or weeks: temperatures will stay cold (10 ¬∞C to 18 ¬∞C, or 50 F to 65 F) and summer sleet is not unprecedented. Rainfall in the summer averages to per month, with a very high variability from one year to another. March brings more frequent frost, but also nice stretches of sunny weather. The average high temperature is 19 ¬∞C, the low is 4 ¬∞C, occasionally 30 ¬∞C can be reached, and temperatures may fall to -5 ¬∞C. The most radical change occurs sometime during the month of April, when Villa La Angostura first gets in the path of a \\"train of Pacific storms\\": in the end, total precipitation for the month averages . The average high is 14 ¬∞C (57 F), the low is 2 ¬∞C or 35 F(the nighttime change is small due to increased cloudiness)and by late April any cloudless night will be frosty. May is known for being extremely rainy, with an average amount of (including sleet and snow). It is also often the month of the first significant snowfall. High temperatures are usually around 9 ¬∞C or 48 F, lows average 1 ¬∞C or 33 F, sometimes temperatures can reach -10 ¬∞C or 14 F. June, July and August are the core of the winter in Villa La Angostura, when the average high ranges from 5 ¬∞C to 8 ¬∞C (40 F to 46 F) and lows from 0 ¬∞C to -2 ¬∞C (32 F to 28 F). Storms are very frequent and usually bring a mixture of rain, snow and sleet; overall precipitation averages to monthly for the period, falling mostly as snow in the mountains around the city. Snowstorms can sometimes be heavy (over 20 cm or 8 inches), and extreme cold waves might bring temperatures down to -18 ¬∞C (0F) or lower; however, long stretches of intense frost are rare as Pacific storms always strike the area with milder, moist air. In September, the storminess diminishes slightly ( in total), and high temperatures reach an average of 11 ¬∞C, although low temperatures only increase to -1 ¬∞C. By the end of the month, there might be stretches of pleasant weather and comfortable temperatures, but the month also marks the beginning of the windiest part of the year. October is extremely variable, going back and forth between periods of extremely windy, but sunny weather, and freak cold snaps that bring night temperatures below -5 ¬∞C (23 F) and mixtures of sleet and snow. Average highs are 14 ¬∞C (57 F), lows are 1 ¬∞C (33 F), and precipitation reaches . November brings springlike weather, much lower precipitation () but strong winds and wild variations in temperature. Averages are 17 ¬∞C in the afternoon and 3 ¬∞C at night, but it is not unusual to have a day of rain and sleet with a high below 5 ¬∞C (40 F), or a day with sunny weather and a high of 25 ¬∞C (77 F). Finally, December is a transition between spring and summer: winds are still very strong and freak variations occur, but the average high of 20 ¬∞C (68 F) and the low of 5 ¬∞C (40 F) are more typical of summer weather. Storminess might be a bit higher as in November, with an average of of rain. On the whole, Villa La Angostura's climate is noted for being among the rainiest in Argentina (with of rain over almost 300 days a year), for having no frost-free periods whatsoever, and for its clear, dry and extremely pleasant summer days. Areas west of the city are much rainier, with over over Brazo Rincon. Nearby La Angostura is the Cerro Bayo and its ski centre. The resort's base, at only higher than the city, usually only sees sufficient snow cover for a few weeks in midwinter, following large storms. However, slopes above the altitude of offer reliable snow cover, and most of the skiing takes place between and , where pockets of snow might be found till midsummer. The view from the top is impressive, especially toward the west, across Nahuel Huapi lake, with the majestic, heavily glaciated Cerro Tronador (), clearly visible. Tourism Lago Correntoso La Angostura is considered among the main attractions of Argentina's Andean Patagonia not only because of the wooden town itself, but also because of the beauty of its sights. On its west side is the Nahuel Huapi Lake, and to the east, the Correntoso Lake. Both lakes are connected by the Correntoso River, which, with 200 meters of length, is one of the sport fishing destinations around La Angostura. The architecture of the town follows a stylized Alpine wooden style similar to that of Bariloche's city centre. There are shops and restaurants of artisanal products such as chocolate, beer and trout. It's categorised as a mountain village, even though it has approximately 11,000 inhabitants. 2011 Volcanic Ash In June 2011, Villa La Angostura was declared a disaster area due to the massive layer of ash dumped on the community by the eruption to the west in Chile.

He won a gold medal in Boxing at the 1924 Summer Olympics, defeating Danish boxer S√∏ren Petersen in the final. Background Von Porat was born in the little parish of Pj√§tteryd, Kronoberg County, Sweden, into an independently wealthy family. The von Porats lived on a huge estate in Sweden. An English tutor gave von Porat and his three brothers their early education, hence von Porat learned to speak English with a decidedly British accent. He also learned to speak Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, German and French fluently. While very young, he and his family moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, where his father organized a branch of the Berlitz Language School. In early 1914 the family settled in Oslo, Norway, where his father made extensive maritime investments. The von Porat fortune disappeared rapidly when World War I came along, forcing the four von Porat boys to seek work. Amateur career It was while employed as a minor clerk in the office of an Oslo shipping agent that von Porat became interested in boxing. He knocked out two opponents in one evening during his first amateur tournament. Shortly thereafter he knocked out the amateur middleweight champion of Denmark in two rounds. Otto von Porat went on to flatten all the best heavyweight amateurs in Europe, then won the Olympic Heavyweight Gold Medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. He returned to Norway to serve in the Norwegian Army. He represented the club Oslo AK. Pro career Von Porat then came to the United States in the Summer of 1926, turning professional at that time. He generally fought in the rings of Minneapolis, New York City, and Chicago. He was a huge drawing card in the Chicago area. He could often be found at the Chicago Norske Klub, a Norwegian- American cultural center. It is said that his fight with Paulino Uzcudun \\"gave rise to the wide-spread impression that von Porat lack[ed] aggressiveness and ... the 'killer instinct.' Although he had a once-promising career and was a top contender for the Heavyweight Title, von Porat apparently lacked self- confidence and thus \\"lost fighting strength in the rough American school.\\" Life after boxing After his boxing career ended von Porat continued to live in Chicago. In 1982 he died in B√¶rum, Norway.

Lindy Hop is closely related to earlier African American vernacular dances but quickly gained its own fame through dancers in films, performances, competitions, and professional dance troupes. It became especially popular in the 1930s with the upsurge of aerials. The popularity of Lindy Hop declined after World War II, and it converted to other forms of dancing, but it never disappeared during the decades between the 1940s and the 1980s until European and American dancers revived it starting from the beginning of the 1980s.This is discussed in various articles. Some of the most significant are https://authenticjazzdance.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/the-third-generation-by- terry-monaghan/ . https://authenticjazzdance.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/mama- lou-parks-by-terry-monaghan/. http://harlemlindyhopmusings.blogspot.fi/search?updated- max=2017-06-13T07:28:00-07:00&max-results;=7 . Early influences (1900s‚Äì1920s) Lindy Hop combined a number of dances popular in the United States in the 1920s and earlier, many of which developed in African American communities. Just as jazz music emerged as a dominant art form that could absorb and integrate other forms of music, Lindy Hop could absorb and integrate other forms of dance. This hybridity is characteristic of vernacular dances, in which forms and steps are adapted and developed to suit the social and cultural needs of its participants in everyday spaces. Therefore, Lindy Hop was not originally the creative or economic project of formal dance academies or institutions. Lindy Hop's genealogy can be seen in the ideological themes, social uses, and steps that it has absorbed during its development. For many Lindy Hop historians, the Charleston is Lindy Hop's most influential predecessor, and Lindy Hop's basic footwork and timing reflects that of the Charleston. The transition from Charleston to Lindy Hop was facilitated by the Breakaway, a partner dance which introduced the 'Swing out' and 'open position' of dances such as the Texas Tommy to the 'closed position' and footwork of partnered Charleston. As jazz music in the late 1920s changed, so did jazz dances, including the Lindy Hop. The swung note of swinging jazz encouraged dancers to introduce a 'delay' in their timing which influenced the execution of footwork and approaches to tempo within Charleston and Breakaway. Classic era (1927 to 1935) =Harlem and Its Renaissance= The New York Renaissance of the 1920s raised the profile of African American vernacular culture in white communities within the United States, particularly in New York City. The popularity of African American dance and music fed what became a fascination with the somewhat illicit nature of the ghetto area. White patronage in the area brought much-needed income to the bars, clubs, and theaters of Harlem, as well as work for black artists in a city increasingly belabored by economic depression. Upper and middle class white audiences were exposed to Harlem's working class entertainment, at first through white audiences attending black venues and shows in Harlem, but later through traveling shows, popular music, and cinema. This prompted a mainstream thirst for \\"black\\" cultural forms. However, by the time dances such as the Lindy Hop reached mainstream white audiences, they had often been reworked by white teachers and film studios to accord with the aesthetics and social values of white mainstream America. White dancers in Hollywood films played pivotal roles in popularizing Lindy Hop. Dean Collins' dancing in particular not only spread the form across the United States but also provided less 'risque' versions for more conservative American palates. Harlem's increasing popularity as an entertainment district, as well as a vibrant creative center for African Americans in the 1920s and 1930s, brought about the creation and popularization of Lindy Hop, both in social dance spaces and on the stage. Origin of the Lindy Hop In one account it is argued that, in the slang of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a 'Lindy' was a young woman. There exists an unsubstantiated claim that the word \\"hop\\" was documented as early as 1913 as a term for swing dancing and was also, apparently, a term used by early Texas Tommy dancers to describe the basic move for their dance. In a more influential, but inaccurate account, however, popular legend has it that dancer \\"Shorty\\" George Snowden renamed the breakaway dance as the Lindy Hop in a dance contest. In this version, Snowden was one of the 24 couples that competed in a negro dance marathon that began on June 17, 1928 at the Manhattan Casino, a ballroom that was located at 8th Avenue and 155th Street in Harlem. During the contest \\"as he remembers it - Snowden decided to do a breakaway, that is, fling his partner out and improvise a few solo steps of his own. In the midst of the monotony of the marathon, the effect was electric, and even the musicians came to life...Fox Movietone News arrived to cover the marathon and decided to take a close-up of Shorty's feet\\" and an interviewer then asked him, \\"What are you doing with your feet?\\" Snowden, \\"without stopping, replied 'The Lindy'\\". Research has shown that Snowden's account of the naming of the Lindy Hop in the Rockland Palace (the Manhattan Casino which was renamed at the time of the marathon) is likely not true because the term 'lindy hop' in connection with the Harlem Lindy Hop was used for the first time in public in September 1928, which is more than two months after Snowden and his partner Mattie Purnell supposedly named the dance in the dance marathon. The time gap between the dance marathon and the first use of the term in public does not make sense if Snowden really named the dance in the dance marathon.George Snowden's career in dancing is discussed, in particular, Terry Monaghan's George Snowden article, and Harri Heinil√§'s doctoral dissertation. See: Terry Monaghan, 'George Snowden', The Dancing Times, July 2004. The article is republished at http://jassdancer.blogspot.fi/2012/10/shorty-george-snowden.html . Harri Heinil√§, An Endeavor by Harlem Dancers to Achieve Equality ‚Äì The Recognition of the Harlem-Based African-American Jazz Dance Between 1921 and 1943, pages 135-138. Heinil√§ published also an article of George Snowden and Mattie Purnell where they are discussed concerning their invention. The article can be found at https://authenticjazzdance.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/the-creators- of-the-lindy-hop-george-shorty-snowden-and-mattie-purnell/ . As there does not exist proper evidence for the naming of the Lindy Hop, there exists evidence for inventing the Lindy Hop in the dance marathon in which Snowden and Purnell participated and devised the basic principle of the Lindy Hop. Whether Snowden intended it or not, Lindy Hop was associated with Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic airplane flight, completed in 1927. \\"Lindy\\" was the aviator's nickname. The reporter interviewing Snowden apparently tied the name to Charles Lindbergh to gain publicity and further his story. While Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight may or may not have inspired the name \\"Lindy Hop\\", the association between the aviator, George Snowden and the dance continues in Lindy Hop folklore. Te Roy Williams and His Orchestra recorded the song \\"Lindbergh Hop,\\" written by Ted Nixon and Elmer Snowden, on May 25, 1927.Jazz Odyssey 'The Sound Of Harlem' Volume III Original 1964 3XLp Vinyl Box Set Columbia Records C3L 33 Mono Jazz Archive Series Various Artist in High Fidelity Sound with 40-Page Booklet, produced by Frank Driggs The Memphis Jug Band on 9/13/1928 recorded \\"Lindberg Hop- Overseas stomp,\\" written by Jab Jones and Will Shade. Often referred to as the \\"first generation\\" of Lindy Hop, dancers such as George Snowden, Leroy \\"Stretch\\" Jones, Twistmouth George and Edith Matthews inspired many other dancers and troupes (including Frankie Manning) to take up Lindy Hop. Twistmouth George and Matthews are credited with inventing the \\"twist\\" that characterises the first few steps of the follower's footwork in the Swingout. By the end of the classic era Lindy Hop was danced across Harlem in ballrooms, night clubs], cabaret clubs, rent parties, apartments, and street parties ‚Äî almost anywhere people came together with music to dance. Aerials era (1935 to 1941) Lindy Hop at an Elk's Club dance In 1935 Lindy Hop‚Äîwith swing music‚Äîhad become increasingly popular throughout America, attributable in part to the success of musicians such as Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, and Chick Webb. Ballrooms across the United States hosted the big bands of the day, with Chick Webb leading one of the most popular at the Savoy Ballroom. It was with his orchestra that the teenage Ella Fitzgerald first gained fame. These ballrooms continued a national tradition of sponsoring contests where dancers invented, tested and displayed new steps for prizes. At first banning lindy hoppers because they took more space than other dancers and often kicked nearby couples, the Savoy eventually relented and welcomed them as an attraction for other guests.Frankie Manning, Northern California Lindy Society workshop interview, January 2002. As the 'Home of Happy Feet', the Savoy became the hottest ballroom in New York City, if not the world. =The first air steps= Head bouncer at the Savoy Herbert \\"Whitey\\" White (an African American man nicknamed for a white streak in his hair) managed a team of local dancers that included George Snowden. White arranged for dancers to perform at professional engagements, including parties and shows, all over the city and country. George Snowden's absence from the ballroom with these performances gave a new generation of dancers the opportunity to shine, Frankie Manning among them. With the most popular dancers returning to the Savoy between engagements, rivalries soon developed between different groups, particularly between Shorty George and his friends and newer dancers such as Manning. These rivalries were often played out in formal competitions between groups. Since the beginning of jazz dance, acrobatics were an essential part of vernacular dance, commonly known as flash dancers who toured with bands across United States during the first part of the 20th century. The first generation of Savoy Lindy Hoppers, George Snowden's generation, introduced the early versions of air steps and acrobatics to the Lindy Hop by the very beginning of the 1930s. Savoy Lindy Hopper Frankie Manning has claimed that he devised the first air step in the Lindy Hop. This story, however, is inaccurate. It is more accurate to say that his first air step in the Lindy Hop likely helped to develop the spectacular air step routines which Manning's generation of Savoy Lindy Hoppers, the second generation, perfected. Manning went on to dance extensively with one of the most influential Lindy Hop troupes, the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers (also known as Whitey's Lindy Maniacs, Whyte's Hopping Maniacs, The Harlem Congaroos, The Hot Chocolates, and other names). The troupe was based at the Savoy and managed by White. They performed around the world from 1935 to 1942 at private parties and in stage shows and films; contributing to the spread of Lindy across America. =Dean Collins and Hollywood= Lindy Hop's movement into the American and international mainstream is largely attributed to four factors: Hollywood films, dance studios and instructors such as Arthur Murray, touring dance troupes, and ordinary people (e.g., American troops in WWII bringing Lindy Hop to new countries). One of key figures in Lindy Hop's move to Hollywood was Dean Collins. Dean Collins learned Lindy Hop from his sisters in New Jersey and became a high-profile dancer of this style on the west coast of the United States, appearing in a number of Hollywood films that capitalized on the popularity of swing music and dancing. Frankie Manning and other African American dancers also appeared in key films of the era, such as Hellzapoppin' and A Day at the Races, however, their films were not as numerous. World War II era (1941 to 1945) During the war many top performers were called to military service, including many Lindy Hoppers and musicians. Frankie Manning and other members of the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers were drafted, prompting the disbanding of the group. Lindy hop became a wartime recreation, with white dancers developing as the most well-known and common faces in popular musical films. In 1943, Life magazine featured Lindy Hop on its cover and called it \\"America's National Folk Dance\\". In 1944, due to continued involvement in World War II, the United States levied a 30 percent federal excise tax against \\"dancing\\" nightclubs. Although the tax was later reduced to 20 percent, \\"No Dancing Allowed\\" signs went up all over the country. Post-war era (1945 to 1984) After the Second World War, music changed. Jazz clubs, burdened by new taxes and legislation limiting venues' ability to employ musicians and dancers or host dancing, employed only smaller bands and filled dance floors with tables. Musicians, immersed in the new world of bebop and cool jazz wanted patrons to pay attention and listen, not dance. The rise of rock and roll and bebop in the 1950s saw a further decline in the popularity of jazz for dancing, and Lindy Hop slipped from the public eye, replaced by Rock and Roll dancing, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing and other dances. Revival era (1980s) Lindy Hop was revived in the 1980s by dancers in New York City, California, Stockholm, and the United Kingdom. Each group independently searched for original Lindy Hop dancers and, for those who lived outside of New York City, traveled to New York City to work with them. Al Minns, Pepsi Bethel, Frankie Manning and Norma Miller came out of retirement and toured the world teaching Lindy Hop, later to be joined by dancers such as George and Sugar Sullivan. =British revival= Louise \\"Mama Lou\\" Parks was a hostess at the Savoy Ballroom who promised Charles Buchanan that she would continue holding the Lindy Hop portion of the Harvest Moon Ball dance competition after the Savoy Ballroom closed. She helped preserve the dance by teaching the performance and competition aspects to a new generation of dancers, and in doing so, helped a generation from getting in trouble with the law. After Parks contacted Wolfgang Steuer of the World Rock 'N' Roll Federation in Germany about sponsoring the winners of her Harvest Moon Ball at their international swing dance competition, she started to become more well known in Europe and caught the attention of the British TV company London Weekend Television. \\"In 1981 they paid for one of Mama Lou's events to be re- staged at Small's Paradise Club on 7th Avenue in Harlem.\\" The program aired in late 1982 on the arts program The South Bank Show and featured Parks, her Traditional Jazz Dance Company, and the Lindy Hop. The TV show sparked so much interest in the dance that Mama Lou Parks and her Traditional Jazz Dance Company toured the UK in 1983 and 1984. Terry Monaghan and Warren Heyes met each other at her workshops in London in 1983. Afterwards, they decided to form the British dance company The Lindy Hop Jivers, later renamed to the Jiving Lindy Hoppers. In March 1985, the Jiving Lindy Hoppers (Warren Heyes, Terry Monaghan, Ryan Francois, Claudia Gintersdorfer, and Lesley Owen) travelled to New York City on their first research visit. Their goal was primarily to meet Al Minns but when they arrived, they learned that he was in hospital and not expected to live much longer. (Al Minns died on 24 April 1985.) Through Mama Lou Parks, they met Alfred \\"Pepsi\\" Bethel and trained with him for two weeks in New York City followed by another week in London. While in NY, they also met two former members of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, Frankie Manning and Norma Miller, dance historians Mura Dehn, Sally Sommer, and Ernie Smith, as well as dance enthusiasts that had just formed the New York Swing Dance Society in 1985.. During the 1980s, the Jiving Lindy Hoppers were instrumental in spreading Lindy Hop throughout the UK by teaching and performing at shows, festivals and on TV. In January 1984, the Jiving Lindy Hoppers started teaching Lindy Hop in London. After the first few classes, Ryan Francois joined the classes and later that year became a member of the Jiving Lindy Hoppers. During the 1990s, he was considered one of the most talented modern Lindy Hoppers and travelled internationally to teach and perform the Lindy Hop with his dance company, Zoots and Spangles Authentic Jazz Dance Company (formed in 1986) formed with two other dancers who also left The Jiving Lindyhoppers troupe to form Zoots and Spangles. On 31 October 1987, Simon Erland, a sculptor and dance enthusiast, started Jitterbugs London with Ryan Francoise, the first European Lindy Hop and Swing club to run weekly events with classes that began the social Lindyhop revival. Ryan's troupe Zoots and Spangles were an integral part of the club and performed there regularly as well as in stage shows which grew the popular awareness of the dance. Jitterbugs and Zoots were the real catalyst for the Lindyhop revival in the 1980's and 90's. Ryan Francois and Julie Oram taught Lindy Hop classes followed by DJed music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Sing Lim, \\"an extra enthusiastic and energetic dancer\\", became good friends with Ryan and Julie and in 1991, she started to help run Jitterbugs. Sing Lim taught the dance classes when Ryan and Julie were out of town performing for Zoots and Spangles, as well as helped advertise and promote the club. When Sing Lim returned to Singapore in 1994, she started Jitterbugs Swingapore and helped spread Lindy Hop to Singapore, Australia, and Japan, as well as parts of the U.S. In 1986, Simon Selmon started taking Lindy Hop classes from Warren Heyes, his previous rock and roll dance instructor who had now converted to Lindy Hop. The dance classes inspired Simon Selmon to travel to New York City later that year, where he met Margaret Batiuchok, one of the founders of the New York Swing Dance Society. Upon his return to London, he started the London Swing Dance Society in a similar manner to the New York Swing Dance Society. Later, Simon Selmon travelled throughout Europe, America, and Japan teaching Lindy Hop. =Swedish revival= Three Swedish dancers who later formed an influential performance and teaching group called The Rhythm Hot Shots traveled to New York City in April 1984 in search of Al Minns, one of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers. They invited Al Minns to Stockholm, where he held a dance workshop in 1984 for the newly created Swedish Swing Society. When Al Minns died in 1985, they found Frankie Manning. The Swedish Swing Society and The Rhythm Hot Shots helped spread Lindy Hop throughout Sweden and the rest of the world, partly through the Herr√§ng Dance Camp held every summer since 1982 in the town of Herr√§ng. =American revival= In 1982, Al Minns was convinced to start teaching Lindy Hop at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center in New York City. Californian dancers Erin Stevens and Steven Mitchell flew to New York City to take classes with him in 1983 and 1984. When Al Minns died in 1985, they learned about Frankie Manning through Bob Crease, a board member of the New York Swing Dance Society. They visited Frankie Manning in 1986 and are credited with convincing him to begin instructing Lindy Hop. Erin Stevens and Steven Mitchell helped spread Lindy Hop to California and other locations within the US. With Frankie Manning out of retirement, he continued where Al Minns left off at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center. Eventually the demand for his dance instruction increased and Frankie Manning started to travel and teach worldwide spreading his joy of Lindy Hop. Neo-swing era (1990s) The 1990s saw the rise of popular neo-swing bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue, Dr. Zoot, Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Brian Setzer in the swing revival, and many other artists moving on from ska and punk rock based music to a reworking of swinging jazz musical themes and standard songs. Almost overnight, neo-swing bands and clubs popped up in most large cities in the United States, with the music's popularity growing internationally, with bands such as The Louisville Sluggers in Australia and many others. Neo-swing music was a modern interpretation of jazz and swing incorporating modern elements of rock, rockabilly, jump blues and ska rhythms played with blazing horns and over-the-top presentation. Film such as Swing Kids (1993) and Swingers (1996) capitalized on the popularity of neo-swing, with the former discussing youth resistance to the Nazi party in Germany through jazz and Lindy Hop, and the latter becoming a cult-hit story of love and misadventure in Los Angeles. The popularity of films such as Swingers (which featured the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and landmark Lindy Hop venue The Derby) prompted the American Gap commercial \\"Khaki Swing\\" in 1996 exploited the popularity of neo swing music with a sequence of swing dancing and the song \\"Jump Jive and Wail\\". Many swing dancers who came to Lindy Hop in the 1990s cite these films, advertisements and bands as key factors inspiring them to take up lindy hop. Neo-swing dancers often dressed up with fancy zoot suits and many accessories. The dance - in order to be made simpler and easy to sell - was mainly taught as a six-count form based on East Coast Swing. Revivalist Lindy Hoppers such as The Rhythm Hot Shots in Sweden and Sylvia Sykes in the United States were able to offer classes in Lindy Hop and other swing dances to interested young people in the late 1980s and 1990s. As the fad died towards to end of the 1990s, the numbers of dancers dwindled and Lindy Hop was taught again as a jazz dance, and dancers had turned back to jazz music and continued to develop their dance. The neo-swing era, with all its problems, had one important contribution to Lindy Hop - popularizing the dance revivalists were researching and learning, and bringing it once again to the general public and creating a popular basis that has been a firm foundation for the continuation of the art form into the 21st century.

George Snowden and his partner Mattie Purnell won \\"all the prizes for fancy stepping and other competitions\\" on June 20, 1928, during the third evening of competition. On June 27, The New York Times reported that Aurelia Ida Hallback and Bernard Paul, a couple in the dance marathon, had planned to marry on Friday, June 29. They were going to withdraw from the competition until the promoter, John Lavaro, said that a minister would be provided if they were still in the competition on their intended wedding date. The couple decided to marry while still dancing in the marathon and their wedding was recorded by FOX Movietone News in \\"MVTN C 4980: Couple Dance on Way to Get Marriage License\\". Four couples remained when the dance marathon was forced by the Health Commissioner to end after 16 days, on July 3. The eight finalists were awarded an equal portion of the $1000 prize at the Savoy Ballroom on Friday, July 6, 1928. References world-lindy-hop- day-may-26-2019 Further reading * DeFrantz, Thomas.

The Thorsberg moor (, or Thorsbjerg Mose Angel Danish: Tosbarch, T√•sbjerre \\"Thor's hill\\") near S√ºderbrarup in Anglia, Schleswig- Holstein, Germany, is a peat bog in which the Angles deposited votive offerings for approximately four centuries. It is the location of important Roman Iron Age finds, including early Elder Futhark runic inscriptions such as the Thorsberg chape, a Roman helmet, a shield buckle, and an early example of socks (attached to trousers). The finds are of similar importance as the contemporaneous finds from Illerup and Vimose in Denmark. Excavation The moor was excavated in 1858-1861 by Flensburg teacher Helvig Conrad Engelhardt. The objects recovered by Engelhardt are on exhibit in the state museum of archaeology at Gottorf Castle; another 500 finds are on exhibit in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Finds The deposits were made from approximately 100 B.C. to A.D. 500 Thomas Birkmann, Von √Ögedal bis Malt: die skandinavischen Runeninschriften vom Ende des 5. bis Ende des 9.

However, it is doubtful that they were dedicated specifically to Thor. The placename may reflect worship of Thor there by Danes during the Viking Age rather than by Angles during the Roman Iron Age. And as Engelhardt noted, although the 'Thor's hammer' symbol occurs on several finds from the site, it is a motif that can be found in many non-Germanic contexts, even on Native American artefacts.Conrad Engelhardt, Thorsbjerg Mosefund: beskrivelse af de oldsager, som i aarene 1858-61 ere udgravede af Thorsbjerg mose ved S√∏nder- Brarup i Angel, Copenhagen: Gad, 1863, p. 71 They include early examples of clothing, both Germanic and Roman, in particular the footed trousers, which are commonly dated to the 4th century but which now appear to be no later than A.D. 300;Graham Sumner, Roman Military Clothing (2): AD 200-400, Botley: Osprey, 2003, , p. 35. objects of Roman workmanship including two phaler√¶, military decorations in the form of richly decorated gold discs 13.2 cm in diameter made in the 3rd century in the workshop of Saciro, thought to have been near Cologne, which have the image of a seated man with a spear, possibly a representation of Mars;Herbert Schutz, Tools, Weapons and Ornaments: Germanic Material Culture in Pre-Carolingian Central Europe, 400-750, Leyden/Boston: Brill, 2001, , pp. 185-86. and objects of Germanic workmanship, notably the Thorsberg chape, a piece of a scabbard bearing one of the earliest inscriptions in runes. Some of the Germanic fibul√¶ and shield bosses of ultimately Roman origin appear to be from Germanic tribes in Greater Germania, who were in closer contact with the Romans than the Angles.Birkmann, p. 46. After approximately A.D. 200, the deposition of weapons increased, possibly as a result of conflict between tribes such as the Marcomannic war (AD 166 to 180), possibly as a result of Roman campaigning. Many of the objects deposited, especially the weapons, have been made useless by breaking, bending, etc. It was common practice among Celtic peoples to ritually \\"kill\\" such weapons.Dragos Mandescu, \\"Killing the Weapons.

She was in the service of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) as HMNZS Gambia from 1943 to 1946. She was named after the then Crown colony of the Gambia, and has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. Construction Gambia was conceived in the 1938 Naval Estimates and was laid down on 24 July 1939, at Swan Hunter's Yard at Wallsend. She was launched on 30 November 1940, by Lady Hilbery and commissioned on 21 February 1942. Service history =Early wartime career= The cruiser saw active service in the East Indies with the British Eastern Fleet, and was involved in the Battle of Madagascar in September 1942. She then carried out trade protection duties in the Indian Ocean, but returned to home waters, calling at the territory of the Gambia on the way, where West African Chiefs in full regalia led thousands of their subjects to visit the ship named after their colony. She refitted at Liverpool between June and September. =Royal New Zealand Navy service= HMNZS Gambia, 18 May 1944. Because New Zealand's two other cruisers of the time, and were damaged, it was decided in discussions with the Royal Navy Admiralty that Gambia would be recommissioned as HMNZS Gambia, for the use of the Royal New Zealand Navy. The New Zealand Official History writes: '..HMNZS Gambia was commissioned at Liverpool on 22 September 1943 under the command of Captain William-Powlett, DSC, RN. A few of the officers and three-quarters of the ratings were New Zealanders.' On 3 October 1943 the New Zealand High Commissioner visited the Gambia and addressed the ship's company. After sea trials, shaking down, and ten days attached to the 1st Cruiser Squadron in Scapa Flow, she arrived at Plymouth '..on 5 December 1943 to work with HM ships Glasgow and Enterprise under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.' With these ships she commenced anti-blockade runner patrols in the Bay of Biscay in December, as part of Operation Stonewall. Of particular note was the pursuit of the German blockade-runner Osorno, and the pursuit and destruction of another blockade-runner under Captain William-Powlett's overall command, but without actual involvement: ' 'Under the circumstances,‚Äô wrote ..William-Powlett, ‚ÄòGambia, the senior of the four cruisers, was unable to take part in the successful and exciting operation carried out by Glasgow and Enterprise: she could merely play the part of an exasperated listener-in....‚Äô Gambia served with the British Pacific Fleet, and participated in attacks on Japanese positions throughout the Pacific. In February 1944 she searched for blockade runners in the Cocos Islands area. She also supported a series of carrier raids against oil installations and airfields. She saw action off Okinawa, Formosa and Japan and took part in the bombardment of the Japanese city of Kamaishi on 9 August. She was attacked by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft as a ceasefire was announced, and fired some of the last shots of World War II. She was present on 2 September 1945 in Tokyo Bay for the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. =Return to the Royal Navy= Gambia was returned to the Royal Navy at Portsmouth on 27 March 1946. She underwent a refit and was recommissioned on 1 July 1946 for the 5th Cruiser Squadron with the Far East Fleet. She returned to the UK on 6 January 1948, and in January 1950 she was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean, later serving with the 1st Cruiser Squadron on the same station until October 1954. In 1953, she and her sister brought aid to the Greek island of Zakynthos when it was struck by the Ionian earthquake. Greek officials would later comment, \\"we Greeks have a long- standing tradition with the Royal Navy and it lived up to every expectation in its infallible tradition of always being the first to help\\". In the same year she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden In 1955 she became flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the East Indies Station, but the decision not to continue the refit of the battleship , meant funds were available for a life extension of Gambia and Bermuda, with additional finance and equipment from US assistance to NATO.P.

On 4 November 1958 she recommissioned for the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean. She deployed to the Far East on 4 December 1959 to relieve the cruiser in the Red Sea. The ship returned to the UK via South Africa with a visit to Freetown and the Gambia, before arriving in Portsmouth in July 1960. The last months of 1960 she served in the South Atlantic and the Home Fleet before entering the reserve in December of that year, her crew largely going to the new cruiser . Decommissioning and fate Gambia was paid off to reserve in December 1960. She remained in reserve at Portsmouth until she was put on the disposal list and sold to Thos W Ward for scrapping. She left Portsmouth under tow on 2 December 1968 and arrived at Inverkeithing for breaking up on 5 December.

Life and career  Docherty became a professional boxer in 1998 after representing Scotland in the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, under the promotional banner of Tommy Gilmour and began to notch up victories. Docherty is known primarily as a body-puncher; his tactics typically centre on his methodical attacks, hurting opponents particularly with his left hook to the liver. His defense is assisted by excellent head movement and a solid chin. After winning 12 fights, with 1 draw, and no losses, Docherty was rewarded for his progress by being granted a shot at the current British champion - Mancunian Michael Gomez, a rough-and-tumble, aggressive fighter who had over double the number of fights that Craig had. The contest was pulsating while it lasted. Docherty attempted to go toe-to-toe with Gomez, something of a foolhardy decision, as Gomez was well known for his relentlessness and heavy hands. The fight ended inside two rounds, with Gomez battering a bloody Docherty until the referee stopped the proceedings. Choosing to rebuild, the Glaswegian wasted no time in chalking up another three victories, before again being rewarded with a Commonwealth title shot. This came on 12 April 2003, when he squared off with Dean 'Pitbull' Pithie, in Bethnal Green, London. Despite being booed by a predominantly English crowd, Docherty dominated the bout, hurting Pithie with consistently hurtful bodyshots, leading to an eighth round stoppage. The victory brought Docherty much media coverage in Scotland, in the national tabloids, and talk circulated around a possible fight with counterpart Alex Arthur. Instead, Craig, nicknamed 'Hot Property', decided to defend his belt against mandatory Ghanaian Abdul Malik Jabir, which he won by Unanimous Decision in an enthralling classic. The gritty performance earned him much praise, and a quick-fire defense was set up with another challenger, Kpakpo Allotey, which Docherty won by sixth-round stoppage. Before deciding to meet old friend and Commonwealth Games team-mate Arthur, Doc decided to challenge the experienced Boris Sinitsin, the Russian European champion. It was a step too far however, and Sinitsin managed to use his experience and stamina to slightly outwork Docherty. Despite that, one judge had it a draw. The clamour for a unification with British champion Alex Arthur still mounted however, and the fight was inevitable. Purse bids led to the fight originally being scheduled for Docherty's backyard of Glasgow, but Frank Warren later came up with the highest bid, and the fight was set for Meadowbank, Edinburgh. It did not come to that however, as Arthur managed to pound out a ninth-round stoppage. Docherty dominated early on, but seemed hurt by a big Arthur uppercut midway through the contest. Body shots led to his misery, and the ninth-round knockdown ended Docherty's fight. In 2010 Docherty took time out of Boxing to compete in professional Mixed Martial Arts under The tutelage of Glasgow's Dinky Ninja Fight Team, where he had 2 professional fights 1 win 1 loss record before deciding to give boxing another go in 2013 in the Super Welterweight division. In 2015 he won the vacant WBU World Boxing Union, World super welterweight title via a 6th-round knockout of former Irish amateur star and 2 time world military games gold medalist Michael Kelly of Dundalk. In 2017 added the vacant WBF (World Boxing Foundation) World Super Welterweight title by stopping Hungarian Peter Orlik inside 6 rounds.

Clarke, first published in 1946 in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. It was subsequently published as part of a short story collection in A Treasury of Science Fiction (Groff Conklin, 1948 and Expedition to Earth in 1953. It details the concern of the advanced Martian civilization with humanity's research into rocketry following the discovery of atomic power. The title of the story refers to the solution humanity utilizes to overcome the threat of the Martians. Summary The story begins in the form of correspondence between the President of Mars and the Secretary of the Martian Council of Scientists, regarding the discovery of atomic power (in the form of atomic bombs) by humans. They are concerned that once humanity's current war is over (they have been monitoring Earth's broadcasts), humans will use atomic power and rockets to breach interplanetary space and pose a threat to Mars. A remote monitoring station is set up by Mars on the Moon to monitor Earth's progress. Finally they send a fleet of 19 battleships along with a warning to Earth that one city will be destroyed every time a rocket leaves Earth's atmosphere. Earth agrees to stop experimenting with rockets when they realize their broadcasts are being intercepted. Ten years pass without any further rocket experimentation, while the Martians plan for the extermination of the human race, believing that Earth will always be a threat to them. The next letter, beginning \\"Mars is a mess!\\", is sent from Mars by a human named Lieutenant Commander Henry Forbes, and reports to Earth upon the destruction of Martian civilization due to a nuclear attack from Earth. The previous letters had been recovered from the ruins of the capital. Rather than experimenting with rockets, humans had perfected matter transmission and beamed their bombs directly over the Martian cities. Forbes is hopeful that rocket experiments will resume soon, as he finds being \\"beamed\\" across space to be uncomfortable.

During a career that spanned 40 years, he has been an actor, director and theatre administrator. He wrote and directed several plays which have a great relevance in the modern history of Ethiopian Culture. Gesesse was born on September 27, 1937 in Guro Gutu in Hararghe State. He started his theatre career in the 1950s as a young University student. His promise got him a scholarship at Northwestern University's theater school, in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied in the late 1950s.(Plastow, 94) On returning to Ethiopia, he was a part of a small group of reformers, who in the 1960s turned theatre from an art form aimed at propagandizing for the aristocracy to into a means for examining the political and social situation in Ethiopia. In 1960, he became associated with the Haile Selassie I theatre, which had been initially founded by Emperor Haile Selassie, primarily for his own entertainment, but whose direction was being changed to focus on everyday concerns by newly appointed director Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin and gained acclaim as a director. His early work Yeshi depicts the corruption of urban life, typified by its titular character, a prostitute who destroys the life of her lover.(Plastow, 96-98) He became the General Director of Hager Fikir Theatre in 1974. In 1975, he was suspended and sent to prison by the newly installed Derg government after his play \\"Iqaw\\" which criticized state terrorism. In 1976, Tsegaye, who had become the Director of the National Theatre in Addis Ababa was removed after demonstrations by theater workers. Gessesse was named the new Director.(Plastow, p154). His work continued to cause controversy as with his direction of Tsere Kolonialist as well as his own play, Tehaddiso (Renaissance), both of which deviated with the regime's preference for serious-minded realism. As Derg's hold tightened, its tolerance for these deviations lessened. Gessesse was fired from his post in 1979.(Plastow, 160-162) However, his fame allowed him a certain amount of leeway, which allowed him to be one of a few playwrights able to mount politically sensitive productions into the 1980s. His plays Cherchez Les Femmes' (1980) and Ferdu Leinante (The Judgement is for you, 1984) examined the use of fear as a means of control without directly criticizing the regime.

Polkerris (, meaning fortified pool) is a small village on the south coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom. It forms part of the civil parish of Fowey. The village is part of the Rashleigh estate which is commemorated in the name of the pub, 'Rashleigh Inn'. The village essentially consists of a single steeply sloping road down to the harbour and beach. Parking is limited. There is a small sandy beach, with a curved harbour wall. Etymology The original translation of the place name is obscure. However, the presence of a number of Napoleonic era cannons embedded in the harbour wall, muzzle first, does lend credence to one possible meaning 'Fortified Cove'. Geography Polkerris is on the west side of the Gribbin promontory and on the east side of St Austell Bay. It is two miles west of Fowey and three miles east of St Austell. Polkerris is situated on the South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south west England from Somerset to Dorset. The path follows the cliff tops from nearby Polmear, goes through the village, and onwards to Fowey via Gribbin Head. History Fishing, essentially a seine fishery for pilchards (Sardina pilchardus), was a mainstay of the village's economy from at least the late 16th century, there being a seine house recorded here in 1590. The village has been part of the Rashleigh family's Menabilly Estate from the late 16th century, and the estate built the half-moon quay in 1775 to help the seine netting company. The seine company was in decline in the 1870s and closed. A lifeboat, the Catherine Rashleigh was stationed in Polkerris in November 1859, and the boathouse was built for ¬£138 4s (¬£138.20), on land donated by the Rashliegh's. The station transferred to Fowey in 1922 and the boathouse is currently a restaurant. From the 1950s tourism became significant in the summer. Today, the village has restaurants, water sports and some accommodation. Cultural references The Rashleigh Inn was the setting for the 1972 film Doomwatch, a spin-off of the BBC TV series of the same name. The location of the film is wrongly described as Polperro but the harbour and interior of the pub are clearly seen. This has been confirmed by the existing landlord Jon Spode. Some residents of Polkerris also took part in the film as extras.

Biography  = Early life = William Link is the son of Elsie (n√©e Roerecke) and William Theodore Link, a textile broker. His mother had German Huguenot heritage. Link discovered late in life that his father's parents were Jewish. Link's niece, Amy, examined a suitcase William Theodore Link had left to his son, which they had kept in their attic. She opened it in 2011 and it turned out to contain genealogical research and evidence done by William Theodore Link during World War II. Amy had discovered that Link's paternal grandparents were Jews. Link earned a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business prior to serving in the United States Army from 1956 to 1958. = Levinson partnership = William Link and Richard Levinson met on their first day of junior high school. Each had enjoyed doing magic tricks and other students repeatedly mentioned to each of them that they should meet. They began writing together soon after. In high school, they created radio scripts. While studying at the University of Pennsylvania, they wrote film criticism for the college newspapers. Some of their short stories were published in Playboy. They sold their first short story, \\"Whistle While You Work\\", to Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, which published it in the November, 1954, issue. In 1959, their play Chain of Command was produced by the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. This was followed by script-writing for Alfred Hitchcock Presents (Day of Reckoning, original air date November 22, 1962, based on a novel by John Garde), Dr. Kildare, and The Fugitive. They co-created and sometimes produced such TV series as Mannix in 1968, Columbo in 1969, Ellery Queen, and Murder, She Wrote (co-created with Peter S. Fischer). The character Columbo was first introduced by Link and Levinson in a 1960 episode of The Chevy Mystery Show. For the Jessica Fletcher character they created in 1983 when CBS contacted them to create a new mystery TV show, they found inspiration in a mix of Agatha Christie and her Miss Marple character. At first, they wanted Jean Stapleton for the role, but she ended up declining the offer. They collaborated on several made-for-TV movies, including The Gun, My Sweet Charlie, That Certain Summer, The Judge and Jake Wyler, Guilty Conscience, The Execution of Private Slovik, Charlie Cobb: A Nice Night for a Hanging, and Blacke's Magic; the last, which starred Hal Linden and Harry Morgan, was also developed into a short-lived TV series. The partners collaborated, as well, on two feature films: The Hindenburg (1975) and Rollercoaster (1977). Levinson and Link occasionally used the pseudonym \\"Ted Leighton\\", most notably on the telefilm Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You (1971), where their work was substantially rewritten by other hands, and on Columbo when they came up with stories to be scripted by their collaborators. They co-wrote the Broadway musical magic show Merlin starring Doug Henning and co-scripted the film The Execution of Private Slovik. = Post 1990s = Following the sudden death of Levinson in 1987, Link continued his writing and producing career in many media. In 1991, in tribute to Levinson, he wrote the script for the 1991 TV film The Boys, starring James Woods and John Lithgow. He is a frequent contributor to such mystery fiction publications as Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. His post-Levinson TV work includes The Cosby Mysteries (1994‚Äì95), starring Bill Cosby. Link also was executive story consultant on the short-lived science fiction/detective series Probe in 1988. In 2010, the specialist mystery publishing house, Crippen & Landru, released The Columbo Collection, a book featuring a dozen original short stories about Lieutenant Columbo, all written by Link.  Publications  *  Awards  All the following awards were cojointly won by Link and Levinson : * 1979: Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Ellery Queen and Columbo. * 1980s: Three-time winners of the Edgar Award for Best TV Feature or MiniSeries Teleplay * 1989: WA's Ellery Queen Award for outstanding mystery-writing teams. * 1995: Elected to the Television Academy Hall of Fame. Other recognitions: * 2002: Named president of the Mystery Writers of America (one of the few television writers to achieve this honor.

Christians of Byzantine Rite and of all West Syriac and East Syriac rites celebrate Mary as Mother of God on 26 December and the Coptic Church does so on 16 January.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 84 The Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church observe the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January.  Significance  The feast is a celebration of Mary being the mother of Jesus. The English title \\"Mother of God\\" is a literal translation of the Latin title Mater Dei, which in turn is a rendering of the Greek title ŒòŒµŒøœÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÇ (Theotokos), meaning \\"Bearer of God\\" dogmatically adopted by the First Council of Ephesus (431) as an assertion of the divinity of Christ.  History  The Second Vatican Council stated: \\"Clearly from earliest times the Blessed Virgin is honoured under the title of Mother of God.\\"Pope Paul VI, Lumen gentium, 66 and at an early stage the Church in Rome celebrated on 1 January a feast that it called the anniversary (Natale) of the Mother of God. When this was overshadowed by the feasts of the Annunciation and the Assumption, adopted from Constantinople at the start of the 7th century, 1 January began to be celebrated simply as the octave day of Christmas, the \\"eighth day\\" on which, according to , the child was circumcised and given the name Jesus. In the 13th or 14th century, 1 January began to be celebrated in Rome, as already in Spain and Gaul, as the feast of the Circumcision of the Lord and the Octave of the Nativity, while still oriented towards Mary and Christmas, with many prayers, antiphons and responsories glorifying the maternity of Mary. Pope John XXIII's 1960 rubrical and calendrical revision removed the mention of the circumcision of Jesus and called 1 January simply the Octave of the Nativity. =Feast of the Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary= The feast of the Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was first granted, on the petition of King Joseph Manuel, to the dioceses of Portugal and to Brasil and Algeria, 22 January 1751, together with the feast of the Purity of Mary, and was assigned to the first Sunday in May. In the following year both feasts were extended to the province of Venice, 1778 to the kingdom of Naples, and 1807 to Tuscany. In the Roman Breviary the feast of the Maternity was commemorated on the second, and the feast of the Purity on the third, Sunday in October. At Mesagna in Apulia it was kept 20 February in commemoration of the earthquake, 20 February 1743. This particular feast was not included in the universal calendar of the church, but a number of diocesan calendars had adopted it. By 1914, the feast was established in Portugal for celebration on 11 October and was extended to the entire Catholic Church by Pope Pius XI in 1931. S Agostino Madonna del Parto Madonna del Parto In Rome, in the Basilica of S. Augustine, The feast of the \\"Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" was celebrated with an octave, in honour of the miraculous statue of the Madonna del Parto by Jacopo Sansovino. For centuries, people of Rome and its environs have invoked the intercession of the Madonna before this statue asking for safe deliveries and healthy babies. The statue is laden with thank-offerings and always surrounded by offerings of flowers and candles, and often photographs of smiling infants and toddlers, \\"visual evidence of faith in holy intercession\\".Jacobs, Fredrika H., Votive Panels and Popular Piety in Early Modern Italy, Cambridge University Press, 2013 p. 23, Our Lady of Good Remedy This feast was also the titular feast of the Trinitarians. In 1198, John of Matha founded the Order of the Most Holy Trinity with the mission of ransoming captive Christians. To this end, he placed the order's fund-raising efforts under the patronage of Mary. In gratitude for her assistance, he then honored Mary with the title of \\"Our Lady of Good Remedy\\" (also known under the invocation of Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios).\\"Trinitarian Devotions\\", The Trinitarians Her feast day is now celebrated on 8 October. Mysterii Paschalis The 1969 revision of the liturgical year and the calendar states: \\"1 January, the Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord, is the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God, and also the commemoration of the conferral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus.\\"Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 35 f It removed the 11 October feast, even for Portugal, stating: \\"The Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is celebrated on 1 January in the Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God.\\"Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 142 The 11 October feast is now celebrated only by some Traditionalist Catholic individuals and groups. Marialis Cultus In his Apostolic Letter, Marialis Cultus, Pope Paul VI explained: \\"This celebration, placed on January 1 ...is meant to commemorate the part played by Mary in this mystery of salvation. It is meant also to exalt the singular dignity which this mystery brings to the \\"holy Mother...through whom we were found worthy to receive the Author of life.\\" It is likewise a fitting occasion for renewing adoration of the newborn Prince of Peace, for listening once more to the glad tidings of the angels (cf. Lk. 2:14), and for imploring from God, through the Queen of Peace, the supreme gift of peace.\\"Pope Paul VI, Marialis Cultus, ¬ß5, February 2, 1974, Vatican  See also  * Feast of the Circumcision of Christ * Madonna del Parto as an iconic motif * Mother of God (Roman Catholic)  References   External links  * Saints of January 1 Category:January observances Category:December observances Category:Catholic Mariology Category:Christmastide Category:Marian feast days Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days ","title":"Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God"},{"id":"4821452","text":"John Beard (born 1943) is a Welsh artist and painter born in Aberdare, Wales, now based in Sydney, Lisbon and London whose work has been exhibited worldwide and is held in the collections of major museums and institutions.

It is the most general structure in which projective properties are expressed in a coordinate-free way. The technique is based on work by German mathematician Hermann Grassmann on exterior algebra, and subsequently by British mathematician Arthur Cayley's work on matrices and linear algebra. It is a form of modeling algebra for use in projective geometry. The technique uses subspaces as basic elements of computation, a formalism which allows the translation of synthetic geometric statements into invariant algebraic statements.

Within libertarianism in the United States, counter-economics has been adopted by anarcho-captalists, left-wing market anarchists, as well as more anti-capitalist anarchists.  Origins  The first presentation of the theory of counter-economics was made by Samuel Edward Konkin III at a conference organized by J. Neil Schulman in 1974 held in Cheshire, Massachusetts. The first book to portray counter-economics as a strategy for achieving a libertarian society was Schulman's novel Alongside Night (1979).  Relationship with agorism  Konkin's agorism, as exposited in his New Libertarian Manifesto,New Libertarian Manifesto. postulates that the correct method of achieving a voluntary society is through advocacy and growth of the underground economy or \\"black market\\" ‚Äì the \\"counter-economy\\" as Konkin put it ‚Äì until such a point that the State's perceived moral authority and outright power have been so thoroughly undermined that revolutionary market anarchist legal and security enterprises are able to arise from underground and ultimately suppress government as a criminal activity (with taxation being treated as theft, war being treated as mass murder, et cetera). According to Konkin's pamphlet Counter-Economics: According to Konkin, counter-economics also allows for immediate self-liberation from statist controls, to whatever degree practical, by applying entrepreneurial logic to rationally decide which laws to discreetly break and when. The fundamental principle is to trade risk for profit, although profit can refer to any gain in perceived value rather than strictly monetary gains (as a consequence of the subjective theory of value). Voluntary practices of counter-economics include: * Arms trafficking * Bartering and alternative currency use * Being an illegal immigrant or hiring illegal immigrants * Drug trafficking * Electricity theft or tapping * Exchange of food stamps * Mutual credit * Off- the-grid energy and solar energy * Smuggling * Subsistence farming * Tax evasion * Prostitution  Strategy  According to Per Bylund, counter- economics applies two basic strategies to liberate people from the state, vertical or introverted and horizontal or extroverted, arguing: = Vertical or introverted = The vertical or introverted strategy is aimed towards individuals concentrating on decentralized local infrastructure as opposed to expansive state foundations and explained as such: Voluntary association among those in a community is essential to this concept. Bylund believes developing means to refuse dependency on state services and become self-reliant can be an effective course of action to achieve free market processes. Community technology is an example of this strategy. Bylund mentions Karl Hess's efforts to transform a Washington, D.C. neighborhood which reflects these principles as a primary example. Hess set up green houses on top of available rooftops and using old washing machine parts to build a fish-breeding facility in a building basement. = Horizontal or extroverted = The horizontal or extroverted strategy applies individuals actively creating black market networks and structures which can be stretched beyond neighborhood communities focus in the vertical strategy, with Bylund arguing as follows:  See also  * Agorism * Civil disobedience * Economic secession * Illegalism * Informal sector * The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism * Voluntaryism  References   External links  * The Agorism Project ‚Äì Agorism.co * Agorism.info * Just Things  The Fair Trade Journal of Applied Counter- Economics * Alongside Night by J.

Saile's principal claim to fame is the historical novel Kepler, Roman einer Zeitwende first published in German in Stuttgart in 1938 and many times reprinted. It is an imagined biography of the life and times of the astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler. The novel was translated into English by James A Galston and published in New York City in 1940 by Oskar Piest, under the title Troubadour of the Stars. The novel has occasionally been interpreted as a coded protest against the Nazi r√©gime which Saile had experienced at first hand. Following the banning of the Social Democratic Party by the Nazis, in June 1933 as editor of the newspaper Rathenower Zeitung, during the subsequent wave of arrests Olaf Saile was briefly detained in the Oranienburg Concentration Camp, during which time he was maltreated. His release was apparently secured after a friend and fellow- journalist K√§the Lambert used her journalistic credentials to enter the camp and then to write a report detailing conditions there.

The duo was formed in 1992 to combine different directions of experimental music, such as abstract electronica, noise music, rhythmical, minimalism, micro and macro sounds and waves, and free improvised voices. Their release \\"Forbidden Beat\\" (from their latest album Laton) has been said by some to represent F.R.U.I.T.S. at the peak of their creativity, with a combination of a bass-heavy danceable electro, drum 'n' noise, futuristic soundcapes, dark voice work outs and absurd humour refraining. Borisov and Jagun are both legends of the Russian underground music scene and are well known for their various projects since the early 1980s. Borisov was and still is the driving force behind many Russian new wave, industrial, electronica bands such as Tsentr, Nochnoi Prospekt and Volga in addition to his mostly experimental electronic solo-projects. Jagun is a well-known Russian composer, electronic specialist and professionally educated brass player. Since the middle of the 1980s he has produced different electronic projects including the most famous alternative rock formation of ex-Soviet Union, Moralnyi Kodeks. During the 70-80s he played in the USSR's most popular touring pop bands. In Russia he is also very famous as a successful songwriter for chart- topping pop acts and author of many pop and rock hits, for example \\"Vstretscha na Elbe\\" by Meantraitors or \\"Matrosskaja tischina\\" by Spinglett.

Childhood  He grew up in Wuppertal, near Cologne, after his mother traveled there at the start of World War II to be with her parents. His father disappeared in Poland during the war.  Career  Janowski served as music director in Freiburg and at the Dortmund Opera conducting the Dortmunder Philharmoniker, the latter from 1973 to 1979. From 1983 to 1987 he was principal conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. He served as Kapellmeister of the G√ºrzenich Orchestra in Cologne from 1986 to 1990. He developed an important profile in France as well, becoming music director of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France (then called the Nouvel Orchestre Philharmonique) in Paris in 1984 and retaining that post for sixteen years before moving to the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra as its principal conductor, where he remained until 2009. From 2002 through 2016 Janowski was chief conductor of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, initially with a contract for life with the orchestra at the time. In the 2005/06 season, Janowski began his tenure as Artistic and Music Director of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR), with an initial contract of five years. In September 2008, his contract with the OSR was extended to 2015. However, in January 2010, in a change to the September 2008 contract extension, Janowski and the OSR mutually agreed on the scheduled conclusion of his directorship of the OSR after the 2011‚Äì2012 season. = Pittsburgh = In the USA, beginning in 2005, Janowski served as one of the conductors in a \\"triumvirate\\" of conductor leadership with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), with Sir Andrew Davis and Yan Pascal Tortelier, providing artistic guidance for the orchestra in the absence of a single music director. This arrangement ended in 2008 after the accession of Manfred Honeck as the PSO's music director. Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO. He has recorded the four symphonies of Johannes Brahms with the PSO. = Recordings = Janowski has made a number of operatic recordings, including the first digital recording of the complete Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner between 1980 and 1983 for RCA, with the Staatskapelle Dresden. He and that orchestra had earlier made the first recordings of Die schweigsame Frau by Richard Strauss, in 1976 for EMI, and of Euryanthe by Carl Maria von Weber, in 1974 for EMI, with Jessye Norman and Nicolai Gedda singing the lead roles. Another operatic first recording was of Krzysztof Penderecki's The Devils of Loudun with the Hamburg State Opera, shortly after he led the world premiere of the work in 1969.

The family tree is an updated version of the family tree that originally came with A Real Dead One in 1993. Eddie's Archive was originally released as a limited edition, with the family tree numbered. However, due to demand, it was later re-released with a different colour inlay (changed from blue to red) and with the family tree unnumbered, in order to preserve the value of the original issue. Speaking about the box set, bassist and band founder Steve Harris commented, \\"Eddie's Archive was released for the real collector. We always try hard to keep the quality there for people.

Four book collections of Ogri strips have been produced, and a VHS video. Ogri is a tough, leather- jacketed biker with Thor-like wings attached to his helmet. The actor Ewan McGregor is a fanAmple Sample for all at the Shropshire Magazine and owns an Ogri leather jacket, bought from Paul Sample on eBay. Paul Sample draws in black ink line and colour from 1997,Legend of Ogri by Hugo Wilson, The Telegraph 19 May 2001, Retrieved 11 May 2015 in a style similar to Robert Crumb. As with some other cartoonists, such as Carl Giles, a lot of the pleasure in the cartoons comes from looking at the detail in the cartoon frames; there is almost inevitably a subplot going on. The funny and well observed stories about British bikers usually take place within one page, though two-pagers are sometimes drawn. Several compilation cartoon books collecting the strips have been published in the UK. Sample also produces a variety of Ogri-related memorabilia, including T-shirts, coffee mugs, posters, greetings cards, and badges. The Paul Sample archive, including many original Ogri strips along with other Paul Sample artwork, was auctioned in Shrewsbury in January 2010.Sale of Ogri strips nets ¬£55,000 There is also an Ogri Motorcycle Club (Osnabruck Garrison Riders Institute), founded in Germany in 1978 when all the members were serving in the Army or RAF. Ogri himself Bearing a stubbly, unshaven lantern jaw that would not disgrace Desperate Dan, and a nose that appears to have sustained an impact with a solid object at some time in its history, Ogri's rough and unhandsome face belies its essentially good-natured owner. Ogri originally had a blond mane of hair that showed under his helmet, however this changed early in his history to the better-known black scruff he now sports. Well able to deal out violence when it is warranted, Ogri normally asks little of the world except that it should leave him alone and he does not trouble it when it does not trouble him. He enjoys his beer but is seldom if ever seen worse the wear for drink, and certainly never to the extent of being unfit to ride. Ogri is an all-weather rider, and treats inclement weather in the same manner as the risk of injury - with respect, but defiance. Ogri's bike In his original incarnation (1972-1983) Ogri rode Armageddon, a 1000cc Norvin which he may well have built himself. Sometimes he would experiment with another mount, including on one heroic occasion a scooter into which he 'shoehorned' an engine from a Kawasaki H2 Mach IV 750cc two-stroke triple, but he invariably returned to Armageddon. On his return to Bike in 1986, Ogri sold Armageddon to a collector (and on learning that the buyer never intended the bike to be ridden again, opportunely removed most of the working parts for further use). He now rides a slightly more modern machine, but doesn't usually have either the means or the inclination to follow the latest manufacturing trends. Besides, Ogri is the living embodiment of the principle that it is the rider, not the machine, that determines speed; he can outrace lesser mortals over any going whatever, no matter what they are riding. Engineering Ogri is a gifted tinkerer who can repair most mechanical faults with a spanner, a screwdriver and a spot of know-how. He once reduced his bank manager's BMW to its component parts at the roadside in order to find out why it wouldn't go (obliging the manager to reconsider Ogri's loan application before he would put it back together). Caught out in a severe rainstorm while riding a sidecar combination, Ogri jury-rigged the machine to be controlled from the comfort of the sidecar (with a dummy on the bike to give the illusion of normality and, as matters turned out, to be arrested by an over-zealous traffic policeman, while Ogri sped off in the confusion). He once equipped his grandmother's hand lawnmower with a spare bike engine; thus adapted, the mower cut the lawn in a matter of seconds. He has fitted motorcycles with war-surplus superchargers intended for aero-engines, and has even built a turbojet into a motorcycle frame (a la the actual MTT Superbike). Unfortunately, his few forays into making a living out of motorcycle engineering foundered, as though predestined, on the rocks of sidekick Malcolm's well-meaning incompetence. Law and order Traffic police are one bane of Ogri's existence, although not the worst. He has been stopped for speeding on numerous occasions, but he is hard to catch and so (at least in cartoon land) generally escapes unidentified and unpunished. On one topic however he and the police do see eye to eye: motorcycle theft. When a friend of his had his bike stolen, and caught up to the thief at about the same time as the police, Ogri thoroughly approved of letting the police throw the book at the criminal before pursuing any kind of personal revenge. And other than motoring offences, Ogri manages not to cause the police any trouble; although many times guilty of at least minor public-order offences, Ogri steers clear of anything serious. He is more than willing, though, to take the law into his own hands where necessary. He once dealt with a road-hog by catching up to him, reaching through his open window, and tearing out his steering-wheel. He is not averse to handing out a severe beating to anyone who has endangered his life through careless driving or malice, nor is he above booby-trapping his bike to deal with vandals or thieves. Again, the moral is: you can leave Ogri alone (and he will leave you alone), or you can wish you had. Kickstart Ogri keeps a pet dog, a small white mongrel with a strong strain of terrier, that accompanies him wherever he goes. Kickstart never speaks, but his thought-bubbles betray human-like intelligence. He sits placidly on Ogri's pillion seat heedless of speed or danger, asking little of life except the occasional sausage or saucer of beer. In spirit he is a fiercely protective guardian of Ogri's bike and other property, but in practice he is too small to be much of a deterrent. However, on one occasion Kickstart, while leashed to Ogri's bike, scented a lady dog in heat several streets away, and proved strong enough to drag the machine behind him while in pursuit of romantic excitement. Malcolm Permanently acne-ridden and runny-nosed, Malcolm is Ogri's utter antithesis; a bumbling incompetent whether riding or maintaining his bike (originally Lunge, a blue Triumph pre-unit twin of 1960s vintage),Bike magazine, February 1976, Ogri No.34, p.64 Accessed 11 May 2015 attempting to charm the opposite sex, or indeed even the most routine and uncomplicated task. His blunders are many and varied. Once he designed a revolutionary means of supercharging his bike's engine by feeding the exhaust gases back into the intake. Another time he used a whole-body plastic bag to keep the rain off (and nearly suffocated a few minutes later). He has ridden round a race-track in the wrong direction, and collided with Ogri (Malcolm's boundless incompetence versus Ogri's massive adequacy is a classic encounter between the irresistible force and the immovable object); he has borrowed Ogri's bike to ride around a race-track and fallen off through following the map of another course. Ogri once gave Malcolm a handful of engine parts to de- grease; he dropped them into a bath of caustic soda, unaware that the chemical dissolved aluminium. He gave him most of an engine to de-coke; Malcolm put it in the washing machine, destroying both the engine and the washing machine. And testing the spark from his spark-plug at the same time as checking the petrol in his tank led to a predictable conflagration that Ogri at once recognised as Malcolm's handiwork from at least a mile away. Somehow or other, Malcolm manages to avoid permanent injury, whether self-inflicted or as a result of a beating from an infuriated Ogri, and Ogri, no matter what loss Malcolm's unexampled stupidity has occasioned him, invariably forgives the poor, useless article in time for the next strip, and Malcolm's cry of \\"Aargh! I don't wanna die!\\" will probably be heard for as long as the cartoon is drawn. In the animated cartoon \\"Ogri - Biker Hero\\", Malcolm is referred to as Ogri's cousin. Mitzi Beautiful girls feature large in Ogri's world, although not such as to detract from the main themes of bikes and biking. A long-running addition to the cast is Mitzi, who is stacked like a porn starlet and habitually rides wearing a PVC basque and stockings. It would be a mistake to write Mitzi off as a brainless lust-object, though. She is nearly Ogri's equal as a rider (in a straight race between them, it would be a case of whether Ogri could tune-out Mitzi's distracting appearance well enough to keep his mind on the job, and hardly any other bikers would be even a serious contest) and is dangerous to cross. Plainly an advocate of the look-but- don't-touch ethos, Mitzi is used to men drooling over her but resents unwarranted familiarity and certainly doesn't need to hide behind Ogri. The exact nature of their relationship is not well-established; at times they have been lovers, at other times apparently uninvolved.

It was released on their 1964 album All Summer Long and was also featured on their EP, Four by The Beach Boys. Composition \\"Wendy\\" was originally credited to just Brian Wilson. Mike Love's name was added as a result of a lawsuit filed by him against Wilson in the 1990s. The opening chords are whole notes played on electric guitar and bass. The song begins with a minor i chord in the key of D minor, moves to a major IV, comes back to the minor i, and then moves to a major VI chord, a IV in the key of F. The song then modulates to the key of F major (the relative major of D minor) through a substituted plagal cadence, using a I-ii progression to solidify the new tonic of F. The verse begins with another I-IV-I progression, ending on an IV chord in the first line. The second line begins the same as the first, but moves to a major ‚ô≠VII (in D minor the neapolitan chord), and then modulates to the relative minor through use of a iii chord (A minor, the V in the key of D minor), the A minor moving to a D minor via an authentic cadence. The chorus/bridge (\\"I never thought a guy could cry\\") uses the same chord progression found in the introduction (D: i-iv-i-VI(IV in F), coming back to the key of F for the final line. This repeats for the second verse, before going into the organ solo. After the second chorus, the song modulates again from F to D minor, this time through the usage of the ‚ô≠VII (E‚ô≠ major), which is a tritone substitution for the V of D. The solo follows the same general progression of the introduction and chorus. Another run of the verse/chorus follows, and the song then fades out with repeated I-IV cadences.

Use in media The song is featured in the 1973 film American Graffiti as the closing credits roll, although the movie is set in the summer of 1962, two years before the song's release. The song was included in the film to be a metaphor for the end of the time period that the movie celebrates. There was a comparatively fast changing of the cultural and music scene as the basic rock and roll and relative innocence of the 1950s and early 1960s in America gave way to the actual cultural end of the 1950s in America, signaled by the assassination of President John Kennedy‚Äîa popular, youthful, and charismatic president, impending American civil rights legislation, the arrival of the Beatles and their influence on America ‚Äì on the popular music and style of the time, including that of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys ‚Äì as well as the beginning of American's divisive involvement in the Vietnam War and its subsequent impact, leading to the greater political involvement of young Americans, which was to then be reflected in the culture of the time. Shortly before the ending credits of the film begin, there is silence as a montage shows how Vietnam and the future directly affects certain characters in the film. The tacit, sobering reality brought to the audience at this point is made even greater when it is broken by the bright, upbeat opening xylophone of this energetic and positive Beach Boys song as the ending credits begin, with the song's nostalgic lyrics of idyllic summers past creating a certain bittersweet tone that effectively washes over the audience.Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever By Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz, page 110 It also appears as the closing credits roll on The Simpsons episode \\"Summer of 4 Ft. 2\\".

Renella had previously been accused of involvement in the murder of local businessman Nick Velentzas, who had been threatened by Renella and his associates on numerous occasions regarding loansharking and protection payoffs. *March 5 - Gambino crime family associates killed con artists Nicolina and Michael Lizak in retaliation for killing soldier Robert Russo. *March 23 - Future pentito, Salvatore Contorno, is arrested in Rome where he had gone to prepare the killing of Giuseppe \\"Pippo\\" Cal√≤, who Contorno held responsible for the murder of his boss Stefano Bontade. While in hiding from both the authorities and the Corleonesi, Contorno started to collaborate with the police. Police superintendent Antonino \\"Ninni\\" Cassar√† used Contorno to create a map of the families of the Palermo region and a report on their increasingly conflictual relations and involvement in narcotics (the so-called Greco+161 report on July 13, 1982). *April 30 - Sicily's Communist Party chief Pio La Torre and his driver Rosario Di Salvo are killed by the Mafia. La Torre had proposed an Anti-Mafia law that stipulated that being a member of the Mafia would be a specific criminal offence and enabled the seizure of properties of convicted mafiosi. *May 1 - Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is appointed as prefect for Palermo to stop the violence of the Second Mafia War. He is killed the same year on September 3. *June 16 - In Sicily, Catania mafioso Alfio Ferlito is killed in an ambush when he was escorted by the Carabinieri during a transfer between to prisons. Three policemen are killed as well. The killers were from Palermo and linked to the Corleonesi, to please their ally Nitto Santapaola - the Mafia boss of Catania. *June 17 - Italian banker Roberto Calvi is murdered in London. In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated a member of the Sicilian Mafia, Giuseppe Cal√≤, in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, a Sardinian businessman with wide-ranging interests. Two other men, Ernesto Diotallevi (one of the leaders of the Banda della Magliana, a Roman Mafia-like organization) and former Mafia member turned informer Francesco Di Carlo, were also alleged to be involved in the killing. In July 1991 the Mafia pentito (a mafioso turned informer) Francesco Marino Mannoia claimed that Roberto Calvi had been killed because he had lost Mafia funds when the Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. According to Mannoia the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, and the order to kill Calvi had come from Mafia boss Giuseppe Cal√≤ and Licio Gelli, the head of the secret Italian masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). When Di Carlo became an informer in June 1996, he denied that he was the killer, but admitted that he had been approached by Cal√≤ to do the job. However, Di Carlo could not be reached in time, and when he later called Cal√≤, the latter said that everything had been taken care of already. According to Di Carlo, the killers were Vincenzo Casillo and Sergio Vaccari, who belonged to the Camorra from Naples and have been killed since. *July 13 - Police superintendent Antonino \\"Ninni\\" Cassar√† releases his investigative report on the Sicilian Mafia, partly based on the revelations of Salvatore Contorno. Contorno's revelations were the first time the authorities really learned of Michele Greco's high-ranking membership of the Mafia. Previously he had just been regarded as a rather secretive landowner with a suspiciously high-income, although he did come from a long line of mafiosi. Working closely with judge Giovanni Falcone, the police two months later unleash a dragnet roundup of 162 mafiosi wanted for drug trafficking and homicide. *July 20 - Cleveland Family boss James \\"Blackie\\" Licavoli is convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) of illegal gambling, murder for hire, and conspiracy charges by a U.S. District Court in Cleveland, Ohio and sentenced to 17 years imprisonment. *August 11 - Vincenzo Sinagra, a Sicilian mafia associate of the sadistic Corso dei Mille Clan capo Filippo Marchese and witness to countless murders in the \\"Death Chamber of Piazza Sant'Erasmo\\" is arrested. *August 17 - Nicodemo Scarfo's bail is revoked by a U.S. District Court in Camden, New Jersey due to a prior conviction for possession of firearms by a convicted felon. Although remaining in custody, Scarfo was retained control of the Philadelphia crime syndicate through underboss Salvatore \\"Chuckie\\" Merlino and consigliere Nicholas \\"Nicky Buck\\" Piccolo. *August 23 - Alphonse \\"Little Al\\" D'Arco is initiated as an official member, a \\"made guy\\", of the Lucchese crime family. *September 3 - Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is murdered by the Mafia in the Via Carini in Palermo. The hit team was sent from Catania by Nitto Santapaola, an ally of the Corleonesi, who paid back the service for the killing of his rival Alfio Ferlito by the Corleonesi on June 16. Dalla Chiesa had just been appointed prefect of Sicily to end the violence that was the result of the Second Mafia War between rival Mafia families. In his last public interview it had become clear that Dalla Chiesa started to focus on the emerging role of the Catania Mafia. Swapping hit teams proved to be a successful way to distract police investigations. *September 11 - In a reaction to the murder of Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa on September 3 and Communist politician Pio La Torre on April 30, the Italian parliament passes the La Torre-Rognoni Anti-Mafia Law. The law stipulated that being a member of the Mafia would be a specific criminal offence and was used by judge Giovanni Falcone to prosecute the Sicilian Mafia in the Maxi Trial that started in 1986. The law had been proposed by La Torre. *October 14 - The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Program is officially formed. *November 30 - Rosario Riccobono, the boss of Partanna Mondello, a suburb of Palermo, and eight of his men vanished without trace at the end of November 1982. Three of his associates were gunned down a few days later and his brother, Vito Riccobono, was found decapitated in his car. The Italian media blamed Tommaso Buscetta as being responsible for wiping out the Riccobono Family, as revenge for the slayings of Buscetta's two sons. In fact, Salvatore \\"Tot√≤\\" Riina, Riccobono's supposed ally in the Second Mafia War, had ordered the slaughter of Riccobono and his associates and relatives because they were no longer of any use by the time the Mafia War was ending with the victory of Riina and the Corleonesi. A number of informants have said that Pino Greco was the man who garrotted Riccobono and orchestrated the murders of a dozen of Riccobono's associates and relatives. *December - Joey \\"The Clown\\" Lombardo is arrested and later convicted of attempting to bribe Nevada Senator Howard Cannon. *December 6 - After an extensive investigation by the Denver Division, Denver crime family boss Eugene \\"Checkers\\" Smaldone, along with his underboss brother, Clarence \\"Chauncey\\" Smaldone and consigliere Paul \\"Fat Paul\\" Villano, is convicted for extortionate credit transactions, tax evasion, and conspiracy and sentenced to 10 year imprisonment. *December 15 - Chicago insurance executive Allen M. Dorfman, reportedly associated with organized crime figures through the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Union, is convicted of attempted bribery by a U.S. District Court in Chicago, Illinois. Dorfman's conviction concludes the investigation regarding the attempted bribery of Nevada Senator Howard Cannon, in regard to trucking industry deregulation. *Sometime around the end of 1982, Sicilian mafioso Filippo Marchese is killed. He was in charge of what became known as the Room Of Death, a small apartment along the Piazza Sant Erasmo road. Victims who stood in the way of the Corleonesi of Tot√≤ Riina during the Second Mafia War were lured there to be murdered, usually by being garrotted. Their bodies were either dissolved in acid or chopped up and dumped out at sea. Marchese was also garrotted and dissolved in acid like so many of his own victims. He was so elusive that the authorities did not learn of his death until the late 1980s through an informant.

Pre-War Rotmistrov joined the Red Army in 1919, and served during the Russian Civil War, during which he was involved in the suppression of the Kronstadt Rebellion and in the Polish Soviet War. He commanded a platoon and later rifle company in 31st Rifle Regiment of 11th Rifle Division. In 1928 he entered Frunze Military Academy. From 1937 to 1940 he was an instructor at the Moscow Higher Military Academy. In May 1941 he became Chief of Staff of the 3rd Mechanised Corps. Second World War He commanded 5th Guards Tank Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka during the Battle of Kursk, and in Operation Bagration. The unit under his command, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged in a brutal tank battle near Prokhorovka against the attacking Waffen SS divisions Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Das Reich and Totenkopf almost in a point-blank range of 100-200 meters. As the German advance was noticed, spearheaded by the three most elite Waffen SS divisions towards Prokhorovka advancing in force, Rotmistrov ordered direct counter-attack from the army that was prepared to go by radioing \\"Steel, Steel, Steel\\" against the Germans to get close to them as possible to make up for the better guns the German tanks had. In the ensuing battle, a close-quarter open field tank battle ensued so that most shots from both sides were a direct hit. The distance between the forces was such that tanks were shooting each other from left and right one after another and close enough to ram the German tanks to disable their relatively powerful guns from turning. As the battle ended, significant losses were reported from the 5th Guards Tank Army. He was removed from command following Bagration and became deputy head of armored troops at the General Staff. The manner in which he conducted the battle including the heavy losses the 5th Guards Tank Army took was not unnoticed by Joseph Stalin that he planned to have Rotimstrov court-martialed and sacked for the heavy losses. This did not occur since Aleksandr Vasilevsky interceded. It is possible that the high losses incurred by the 5th Guards Tank Army at the Battle of Minsk led to his removal from command. It is notable that he never held an active unit command again. He was promoted to colonel-general in October 1943 and became the first Marshal of Armoured Troops in February 1944. Post-War Following the war he commanded the mechanized forces of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, and he became an assistant minister of defense. He became the first Chief Marshal of Armoured Troops on 28 April 1962.

The name of this dish comes from the Gujarati word \\"undhu\\", which translates to upside down, since the dish is traditionally cooked upside down underground in earthen pots, termed \\"matlu\\", which are fired from above. The dish is a seasonal one, comprising the vegetables that are available on the South Gujarat coastline, including the Surat, Navsari and Valsad regions, during the winter, including (amongst others) green beans or new peas (typically used along with the tender pod), unripe banana, small eggplants, muthia (dumplings/fritters made with fenugreek leaves and spiced chickpea flour (besan) or handva no lothttp://momscookingadventures.blogspot.in/2013/02/wnter-special-surti- undhiyu.html, and either steamed or fried), potatoes, and purple yam, and sometimes plantain. These are spiced with a dry curry paste that typically includes cilantro leaves, ginger, garlic, green chili pepper, sugar and sometimes includes freshly grated coconut. The mixture is slow cooked for a long time, with some vegetable oil and a very small amount of water sufficient to steam the root vegetables. The finished preparation is dry: individual chunks of vegetables are coated with a thin layer of spice and oil but retain their shape: the contents of the dish must therefore be stirred relatively infrequently during the cooking. Crisp vegetables such as bean pods must ideally retain a little of their crunchy texture. To ensure that no individual component is overcooked, the vegetables may need to be cooked in stages: the root vegetables and eggplant are half-cooked before adding the quick-cooking bean pods and ripe plantain. The finished dish is garnished with chopped cilantro leaf and lemon or lime juice before serving. Surti undhiyu is a variant that is served with puri at weddings and banquets. Again it is a mixed vegetable casserole, made with red lentils and seasoned with spices, grated coconut, and palm sugar in a mild sauce. It is garnished with chopped peanuts and toasted grated coconut, and served with rice. Undhiyu with puri and shrikhand is often eaten in Gujarati houses during the winter.  Related Dishes  The theme of cooking the seasonal winter vegetables into a stew is common across the Indian subcontinent and around the world. Few common examples are, Avial from the Kerala cuisine and Shukto from the Bengali cuisine. The French cuisine has its equivalent dish, the famous Ratatouille.

In response, Mehmed raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the Night Attack where Vlad attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed. The assassination attempt failed and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of T√¢rgovi»ôte, where he found a few men with cannons. After leaving the capital, Mehmed discovered 23,844 impaled Turks whom Vlad had killed during his invasion of Bulgaria. The number is mentioned by Vlad himself in a letter to Matthias Corvinus. The sultan and his troops then sailed to BrƒÉila and burned it to the ground before retreating to Adrianople. Both sides claimed victory in the campaign and Mehmed's forces returned home with many captured slaves, horses, and cattle.  Background  After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed set his sights on other campaigns. In Anatolia, the Greek Empire of Trebizond was still resisting the Ottomans, and to the East the White Sheep Turkomans of Uzun Hasan, together with other smaller states, threatened the Ottomans. In the West, Skanderbeg in Albania continued to trouble the Sultan, while Bosnia was sometimes reluctant in paying the jizya. Wallachia controlled the left bank of the Danube, and Mehmed wanted to have control over the river, as naval attacks could be launched against his empire all the way from the Holy Roman Empire. On September 26, 1459, Pope Pius II called for a new crusade against the Ottomans and on January 14, 1460, at the Congress of Mantua, the Pope proclaimed the official crusade that was to last for three years. His plan, however, failed and the only European leader that showed enthusiasm for the crusade was Vlad »öepe»ô, whom the Pope held in high regard.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 129 Because of a lack of enthusiasm shown by Europeans for the crusade, Mehmed took the opportunity to take an offensive stand. Later that same year (1460), he captured the last independent Serbian city, Smederevo, and in 1461, he convinced the Greek despot of Morea to give up his stronghold; soon thereafter, its capital, Mistra, and Corinth followed suit and surrendered themselves without struggle.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 130 Vlad »öepe»ô's only ally, Mih√°ly Szil√°gyi, was captured in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szil√°gyi's men were tortured to death, while Szil√°gyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed jizya. Vlad »öepe»ô provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Bra»ôov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 131 Vlad »öepe»ô had not paid the annual jizya of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1,000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad »öepe»ô refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started to do their own recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, pp. 131‚Äì32 The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him. At the end of November 1461, Vlad »öepe»ô wrote to Mehmed that he could not afford to pay the jizya, as his war against the Saxons of Transylvania had emptied his resources, and that he could not leave Wallachia and risk having the Hungarian king take over his domains. He further promised to send the Sultan plenty of gold when he could afford to and that he would go to Constantinople if the Sultan would send him a pasha to rule over Wallachia in his absence.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 132 Meanwhile, the Sultan received intelligence reports that revealed Vlad's alliance with Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. He sent the bey of Nicopolis, Hamza Pasha, to stage a diplomatic meeting with Vlad at Giurgiu, but with orders to ambush him there; and thereafter, take him to Constantinople.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 133 Vlad was forewarned about the ambush and planned to set an ambush of his own. Hamza brought with him 1,000 cavalry and when passing through a narrow pass north of Giurgiu, Vlad launched a surprise-attack. The Wallachians had the Turks surrounded and fired with their handgunners until the entire expedition- force was killed. Historians credit Vlad »öepe»ô as one of the first European crusaders to use gunpowder in a \\"deadly artistic way\\".Geringer, Joseph, Staggering the Turks , Crimelibrary.com In a letter to Corvinus, dated February 11, 1462, he wrote that Hamza Pasha was captured close to the former Wallachian fortress of Giurgiu. He then disguised himself as a Turk and advanced with his cavalry towards the fortress where he ordered the guards in Turkish to have the gates open. This they did and Vlad »öepe»ô attacked and destroyed the fortress. In his next move, he went on a campaign and slaughtered enemy soldiers and population that might have sympathized with the Turks; first in southern Wallachia, then, in Bulgaria by crossing the frozen Danube. While in Bulgaria, he divided his army into several smaller groups and covered \\"some 800 kilometers in two weeks\\", as they killed over 23,000 Turks. In a letter to Corvinus, dated February 11, 1462, he stated: > I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza > and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to Rahova, which is > located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and > Ghighen. We killed 23,884 Turks without counting those whom we burned in > homes or the Turks whose heads were cut by our soldiers...Thus, your > highness, you must know that I have broken the peace with him (Sultan Mehmet > II). The Christian Bulgarians were spared and many of them were settled in Wallachia.Stoicescu, Vlad »öepe»ô p. 99 His precise numbers were counted as such: At Giurgiu there were 6,414 victims; at Eni Sala, 1,350; at Durostor 6,840; at Orsova, 343; at H√¢rsova, 840; at Marotin, 210; at Turtucaia, 630; at Turnu, Batin, and Novograd, 384; at Sistov, 410; at Nicopolis and Ghighen, 1,138; at Rahova, 1,460. When hearing about the devastation, Mehmed ‚Äî who was busy besieging a fortress in Corinth ‚Äî sent his grand vizier, Mahmud, with an army of 18,000 to destroy the Wallachian port of BrƒÉila. Vlad »öepe»ô turned back and defeated the army, and according to the Historia Turchesca of Giovanni Maria Angiolello, sometimes attributed to an Italian chronicler Donado da Lezze, only 8,000 Turks survived.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 134 Vlad »öepe»ô's campaign was celebrated among the Saxon cities of Transylvania, the Italian states, and the Pope. A Venetian envoy, upon hearing about the news at the court of Corvinus on March 4, expressed great joy and said that the whole of Christianity should celebrate Vlad »öepe»ô's successful campaign. An English pilgrim to the Holy Land, William Wey, passing through the island of Rhodes while on his way home, wrote that \\"the military men of Rhodes, upon hearing of Vlad »öepe»ô's campaign, had Te Deum sung in praise and honour of God who had granted such victories....The lord mayor of Rhodes convened his brother soldiers and the whole citizenry feasted on fruit and wine.\\" The Genoese from Caffa thanked Vlad »öepe»ô, for his campaign had saved them from an attack of some 300 ships that the sultan planned to send against them.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 136 Many Turks were now frightened of Vlad and left the European side of their empire and moved into Anatolia. Mehmed, when hearing about the events, abandoned his siege at Corinth and decided to go against Vlad »öepe»ô himself.  Preparations for war  = The Turks = Mehmed II, picture by Gentile Bellini Mehmed sent messengers in all directions to assemble an army, 'in which in numbers and armaments must have been equal to that which he had employed on the siege of Constantinople.'Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror, pp. 204‚Äì5 On April 26 or May 17, 1462, the sultan moved with his army from Constantinople with the objective of conquering Wallachia and annexing the land to his empire.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 139 The Sultan himself wrote in a letter addressed to one of his grand viziers, that he took 150,000 men with him.Stoicescu, Vlad »öepe»ô p. 107 The Greek historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles wrote of Mehmed's army as \\"huge, second in size only to the one that this sultan had led against Constantinople.\\"Chalkokondyles 9.90; translated by Anthony Kaldellis, The Histories (Cambridge: Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, 2014), vol. 2 p. 377 He estimated the force at 250,000, while the Turkish historian Tursun Bey mentioned 300,000. The same numbers were put by an anonymous Italian chronicle found in Verona, believed to have been written by a certain merchant named Cristoforo Schiappa.Noi Izvoare Italiene despre Vlad »öepe»ô »ôi »òtefan cel Mare A letter of a Leonardo Tocco to Francesco I Sforza, duke of Milan, wrote that Mehmed had recruited 400,000 men from Rumelia and Anatolia, with 40,000 being constructors of bridges armed with axes. Another point is the one given by Venetian envoy at Buda, Tommasi, who mentioned a regular force of 60,000 and some 30,000 irregulars. These consisted of the janissaries (the elite slave troops); infantry soldiers; sip√¢his (the feudal cavalry); saiales (the sacrificial units composed of slaves who would win their freedom if they survived); acings (the archers); silahd√¢rs (the custodians of the sultan's weapons who also protected the flanks); azabs (the pikemen); beshlis (who handled the firearms); and the praetorian guard that served as the sultan's personal bodyguards. Vlad's half- brother, Radu the Handsome, who willingly served the sultan, commanded 4,000 horsemen. In addition to this, the Turks brought with them 120 cannon, engineers and workers that would build roads and bridges, priests of Islam (ulema) and muezzin, who called the troops to prayer, astrologers who consulted Mehmed and helped him make military decisions; and women \\"reserved for the night pleasures of the men.\\"Florescu, McNally, Dracula, pp. 139‚Äì40, 143 Chalcocondyles reported that the Danube shipowners were paid 300,000 gold pieces to transport the army. In addition to this, the Ottomans used their own fleet that consisted of 25 triremes and 150 smaller vessels.Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror, p. 205 = The Wallachians = Vlad's portrait at Schloss Ambras, Innsbruck Vlad »öepe»ô asked the Hungarian king for assistance. He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \\"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\\"Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 141 Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback‚Äîwho were few in numbers‚Äîwere armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \\"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\\".  Battle  The Turks first tried to disembark at Vidin, but were pushed back by an archery attack. On June 4, a contingent of janissaries landed in the night, at Turnu Severin, where 300 of them died from Wallachian attacks. The Serbian-born janissary, Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, recounted their encounter with Vlad »öepe»ô:Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 143 > When night began to fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the > Danube and crossed over to the other side several miles below the place > where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug ourselves trenches, so that > cavalry could not harm us. After that we crossed back over to the other side > and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire > infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against > Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had > brought with us.

The Ottoman army managed to advance as Vlad »öepe»ô instituted a policy of scorched earth, poisoned the waters, and also created marshes by diverting the waters of small rivers. Traps were created by the digging of pits, and then covered with timber and leaves. The population and animals were evacuated to the mountains and as Mehmed advanced for seven days, his army suffered from fatigue as \\"he found no man, nor any significant animal, and nothing to eat or drink.\\"Florescu, McNally, Dracula, pp. 143‚Äì4 Vlad adopted guerrilla tactics as his cavalry made several hit-and-run attacks. He would also send ill people suffering from lethal diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis ‚Äî and in more significant numbers ‚Äì those who suffered from the bubonic plague, to intermix with the Turks and infect them. The bubonic plague managed to spread in the Ottoman army. The Ottoman fleet launched a few minor attacks on BrƒÉila and Chilia, but without being able to do much damage, as Vlad »öepe»ô had destroyed most of the ports in Bulgaria. Chalkokondyles writes that the Sultan managed to capture a Wallachian soldier and at first tried to bribe him for information; when that didn't work, he threatened him with torture, to no avail. Mehmed was said to have commended the soldier by saying, \\"if your master had many soldiers like yourself, in a short time he could conquer the world!\\"Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 142 The Turks continued with their advance towards T√¢rgovi»ôte, after failing to capture the fortress of Bucharest and the fortified island of Snagov. On June 17, when the Turks camped south of the capital, Vlad »öepe»ô launched his night attack with 24,000, or possibly with only 7,000 to 10,000 horsemen. Chalkokondyles retells the story that, before making his attack, Vlad went freely into the Turkish camp disguised as a Turk, and wandered around to find the location of the Sultan's tent and learn about his organization.Chalkokondyles, 9.98; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 385 The anonymous Italian chronicle of Verona mentions that Mehmed had disallowed his soldiers to exit their tents during the night, as to not cause panic in case of an attack. The chronicle goes on explaining that Vlad »öepe»ô, being aware of Mehmed's strategy, had decided for an attack in the night, knowing how to proceed in his offensive when the enemy soldiers would have to remain in their tents. The skirmish would last from \\"three hours after sunset until four the next morning\\"Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 145 and would cause great confusion in the Ottoman camp. The Wallachians made noise from their buglers and illuminated the battle with their torches; and in that night, they launched not one, but several attacks. Documents differ on the exact result of the skirmish: some sources say that the Wallachians slaughtered a great number of Turks, while others say the Ottoman losses were minimal. Many horses and camels were, however, killed. Some chronicles blame a Wallachian boyar named Gale≈ü, who supposedly led a simultaneous attack on the Turks with a second army, for not being brave enough to cause the expected devastation on the enemy.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, pp. 145‚Äì46Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror, pp. 206‚Äì7 Vlad »öepe»ô himself aimed for the tent of the sultan, as he routed the Asian cavalry, but mistakenly went for the tent of the two grand viziers Ishak Pasha and Mahmud Pasha. A Wallachian point of view of the events was recorded by the papal legate, Niccol√≤ Modrussa, years later at the court of Buda when Vlad was being imprisoned by Corvinus. It is said to have been told by a Wallachian veteran: > The sultan besieged him and discovered him in a certain mountain where the > Wallachian was supported by the natural strength of the place. There Vlad > had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed > him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or fall into > the hands of the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities > unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: > calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily > persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either > they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should > destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge themselves against the > enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, > who had been caught at twilight when they were wandering about imprudently, > at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, > all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped like > lightning in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, > had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been > equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from > the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would > have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander > (a boyar named Gale≈ü) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as > had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without > losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He > abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain > from which he had come. No one dared pursue him, since he had caused such > terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in > this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During > that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And > he would have continued to this way, had he not been reprimanded by his > friends and brought back, almost against his will. The janissaries, under the command of Mihaloƒülu Ali Bey,According to Ya≈üar Y√ºcel-Ali Sevim the name of the Akƒ±ncƒ± commander was Evrenos pursued the Wallachians and killed 1,000‚Äì2,000 of them. According to the chronicle of the Venetan bailo at the Porte, Domenico Balbi, the total casualties for the conflict are numbered as 5,000 for the Wallachian side and 15,000 for the Ottomans. Even though the morale of the sultan and his army was low, Mehmed decided to besiege the capital, but instead found it deserted with its gates wide open. The Turkish army entered the capital and for half an hour, the army marched on the road that was bordered by some 20,000 impaled Turks.Florescu, McNally, Dracula, p. 148 There, they found the rotten corpse of Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, to symbolize his 'high ranking'.Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror, p. 207 Other sources say that the city was defended by the soldiers, while the impaled corpses lay outside the city-walls for a distance of 60 miles. Chalkokondyles, when remarking the reaction of the sultan, wrote: \\"The sultan was seized with amazement and said that it was not possible to deprive of his country a man who had done such great deeds, who had such a diabolical understanding of how to govern his realm and its people. And he said that a man who had done such things was worth much.\\"Chalkokondyles, 9.104; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 393 Mehmed ordered for a deep trench to be dug out around the Turkish encampment in order to prevent enemy penetration and the following day (June 22), the Turks retreated. A few days later, Vlad's cousin, Stephen III of Moldavia, who wanted to retake Akkerman and Chilia, decided to launch an attack on the latter. The Wallachians rushed to the scene with 7,000 men and managed to defend the town, while wounding Stephen in his foot by artillery fire.Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror, p. 206 On June 29, the Sultan reached BrƒÉila, which he burned down, and then sailed to Adrianople, where they arrived on July 11. On July 12, the Turks called for a celebration for their \\"Great victory\\" over Vlad »öepe»ô. The Turks had enslaved many of the local inhabitants, which they marched on their way south together with 200,000 cattle and horses.  Popular culture  * French writer, Victor Hugo, wrote about the conflict in his poem La L√©gende des si√®cles (The Legend of the Centuries). * The film Bram Stoker's Dracula begins in 1462 with the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia; a night battle takes place (ostensibly the Night Attack), ending with Vlad »öepe»ô' victory. * The Big Finish Productions audio drama Son of the Dragon depicts the battle from the perspective of the Fifth Doctor and his companions. * The 2014 film Dracula Untold includes an altered rendition of the Night Attack, in which Dracula blocks the sun with black clouds instead of the battle occurring at night. * In the video game Age of Empires II: The Forgotten, this attack is showcased in one of the final Dracula campaigns. After killing several Ottoman troops and suffering losses of his own, Dracula calls off the attack because he realizes Mehmed II fled the camp before the attack began.

The game itself took place from July 27 to August 4, 2006 in √Ñlvdalen in Sweden, close to the border of Norway. There were 325 players from several countries. While there was little media coverage in other countries, it received the attention of Scandinavian newspapers and gaming publications.  The Game  Cinderhill Temple Fireworks The game events took place in the fictional village of Cinderhill. The game setting was based on the world of Valenor, from Mike Pohjola's game Myrskyn aika (Age of the Storm). The setting mixed influences from the late Iron Age and the Middle Ages. The game aimed for total immersion and there was no out-of-character area.  Organisation and arrangements  Dragonbane was an unusually large LARP project with a budget approaching 1 million euros. Most of the funding came from dozens of corporate sponsors, including several major corporations, such as Hewlett- Packard. An entire village was built for the game, as was a large electromechanical dragon.  The Village of Cinderhill  Cinderhill's People's Funeral Speech, written in Cinderhill font Interior of the Cinderhill Main Long House A quasi-medieval town called Cinderhill was constructed for the game, and for the future games to be. The building of the village begun in spring 2005 and lasted (few winter months excluded) until the very day the game began on July 4, 2006. The Cinderhill Village was burnt down in summer 2012, because the land owners did not want to keep it there any longer. The village contained 4 long houses, a smithy, a bakery, a healers hut, toilet facilities, wash house, carpentry and a grand temple. All in all 12 buildings with 320 indoors sleeping places and a floor area of over 500 square meters. Cinderhill was very much a work in progress. There were many ideas that stayed to be realized.  Outcome  The Dragonbane project was one of the most ambitious projects in the history of LARP, and some critics expected it would never run. The originally advertised event in Estonia was postponed and moved to Sweden. Less than a third of the 1000 player spaces were filled. But still the project went ahead, and after several preliminary events (to help build the site and establish characters) the 5-day game was run. Several last-minute technical problems restricted the mobility and articulation of the dragon. Some of the camping areas (outside the village) were reported as inadequately provisioned. Player response to the event was mixed, dwelling both on the high standards of immersive environment and on the technical and organisational flaws. The game was billed as a single event, and as yet no plans have been announced for sequel events.

Inmates were forced to carry heavy rocks up the stairs. In their severely weakened state, few prisoners could cope with this back-breaking labour for long. Commemorative plaque in Hamburg-Neugraben Extermination through labour (or \\"extermination through work\\", ) was the practice in concentration camps in Nazi Germany of killing prisoners by means of forced labour.European History Quarterly, 2009, Vol. 39(4), 606‚Äì632. doi: 10.1177/0265691409342658. As part of the Holocaust, forced labour served a dual purpose: providing useful work to the Nazis, and killing prisoners who would otherwise have to be killed by other methods. It was a cruel twist of the phrase Arbeit macht frei \\"Work sets you free\\", which was emblazoned on the gates of multiple concentration camps. The work was designed to be absolutely destroying. Concentration camp inmates worked up to 12 hours a day with very little food, clothing, or medical care; the average labourer died after 4 months. Some historians, notably Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, claim that the Soviet Gulag system was also a form of extermination through labour. Similar claims have been made about the Laogai system under Mao Zedong's China. Terminology The term \\"extermination through labour\\" (Vernichtung durch Arbeit) was not generally used by the Nazi SS. However, it was specifically employed by Joseph Goebbels and Otto Georg Thierack in late 1942 negotiations involving them, Albert Bormann, and Heinrich Himmler, relating to the transfer of prisoners to concentration camps. The phrase was used again during the post-war Nuremberg trials. In the 1980s and 1990s, historians began debating the appropriate use of the term. Falk Pingel believed the phrase should not be applied to all Nazi prisoners, while Hermann Kaienburg and Miroslav K√°rn√Ω believed \\"extermination through labour\\" was a consistent goal of the SS. More recently, Jens-Christian Wagner has also argued that not all Nazi prisoners were targeted with annihilation. In Nazi Germany The Nazis persecuted many individuals because of their race, political affiliation, disability, religion, or sexual orientation.Hitler's Ethic By Richard Weikar, page 73. Groups marginalized by the majority population in Germany included welfare-dependent families with many children, alleged vagrants and transients, as well as members of perceived problem groups, such as alcoholics and prostitutes. While these people were considered \\"German-blooded\\", they were also categorized as \\"social misfits\\" (Asoziale) as well as superfluous \\"ballast-lives\\" (Ballastexistenzen). They were recorded in lists (as were homosexuals) by civil and police authorities and subjected to myriad state restrictions and repressive actions, which included forced sterilization and ultimately imprisonment in concentration camps. Anyone who openly opposed the Nazi regime (such as communists, social democrats, democrats, and conscientious objectors) was detained in prison camps. Many of them did not survive the ordeal. While others could possibly redeem themselves in the eyes of the Nazis, Germany encouraged and supported emigration of Jews to Palestine and elsewhere from 1933 until 1941 with arrangements such as the Haavara Agreement, or the Madagascar Plan. During the war in 1942, the Nazi leadership gathered to discuss what had come to be called \\"the final solution to the Jewish question\\" at a conference in Wannsee, Germany. The transcript of this gathering gives historians insight into the thinking of the Nazi leadership as they devised the details of the Jews' future destruction, including using extermination through labour as one component of their so- called \\"Final Solution\\". Jewish forced labourers, marching with shovels, Mogilev, 1941 In Nazi camps, \\"extermination through labour\\" was principally carried out through what was characterized at the Nuremberg Trials as \\"slave work\\" and \\"slave workers\\", in contrast with the forced labour of foreign work forces. Working conditions included no remuneration of any kind; constant surveillance; physically demanding labour (for example, road construction, farm work, and factory work, particularly in the arms industry); excessive working hours (often 10 to 12 hours per day); minimal nutrition, food rationing; lack of hygiene; poor medical care and ensuing disease; insufficient clothing (for example, summer clothes even in the winter). Torture and physical abuse were also used. Torstehen (\\"Door standing\\") forced victims to stand outside naked with arms raised. When they collapsed or passed out, they would be beaten until they re-assumed the position. Pfahlh√§ngen (\\"Post Attachment\\") involved tying the inmate's hands behind their back and then hanging them by their hands from a tall stake. This would dislocate and disjoint the arms, and the pressure would be fatal within hours. (Cf. strappado.) =Concentration camps= Gate in the Dachau concentration camp memorial. Imprisonment in concentration camps aimed not merely to break and exploit but to destroy inmates. The admission and registration of the new prisoners, the forced labour, the prisoner housing, the roll calls ‚Äî all aspects of camp life ‚Äî were accompanied by humiliation and harassment. Compare: Admission, registration and interrogation of the detainees was accompanied by scornful remarks from SS officials. The prisoners were stepped on and beaten during roll call. Forced labour partly consisted of pointless tasks and heavy labour, which aimed to wear down the prisoners. Many of the concentration camps channeled forced labour to benefit the German war machine. In these cases the SS saw excessive working hours as a means of maximizing output. Oswald Pohl, the leader of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (\\"SS Economy and Administration Main Bureau\\", or SS-WVHA), who oversaw the employment of forced labour at the concentration camps, ordered on April 30, 1942: Up to 25,000 of the 35,000 prisoners appointed to work for IG Farben in Auschwitz died. The average life-expectancy of a slave laborer on a work assignment amounted to less than four months.Auschwitz Museum and Raul Hilberg: Die Vernichtung der europ√§ischen Juden. extended edition Frankfurt 1990. Volume 2 Page 994f The emaciated forced-labourers died from exhaustion or disease or they were deemed to be incapable of work and killed. About 30 percent of the forced labourers who were assigned to dig tunnels, which were constructed for weapon factories in the last months of the war, died. Michael Zimmermann: \\"Kommentierende Bemerkungen ‚Äì Arbeit und Vernichtung im KZ- Kosmos\\". In: Ulrich Herbert et al. (Ed.): Die nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager. Frankfurt/M 2002, , Vol. 2, p. 744 In the satellite camps, which were established in the vicinity of mines and industrial firms, even higher death-rates occurred, since accommodations and supplies were often even less adequate there than in the main camps. The phrase \\"Arbeit macht frei\\" (\\"work shall set you free\\"), could be found in various places in some Nazi concentration camps (for example, on the entrance gates). The Buchenwald concentration camp was the only concentration camp with the motto \\"Jedem das Seine\\" (\\"To each what he deserves\\") on the entrance gate. Extermination by labour outside Nazi Germany = In the Soviet Union = The Soviet Gulag is sometimes presented as a system of death camps,Gunnar Heinsohn Lexikon der V√∂lkermorde, Rowohlt rororo 1998, Joel Kotek / Pierre Rigoulot Gefangenschaft, Zwangsarbeit, Vernichtung, Propyl√§en 2001Ralf Stettner Archipel Gulag.

This controversial position has been criticized, considering that with the exception of the war years, a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive. Alexander Solzhenitsyn introduced the expression camps of extermination by labour in his non-fiction work The Gulag Archipelago.Alexander Solzhenitsyn Arkhipelag Gulag, Vol. 2. \\"Novyy Mir,\\" 1990. According to him, the system eradicated opponents by forcing them to work as prisoners on big state-run projects (for example the White Sea-Baltic Canal, quarries, remote railroads and urban development projects) under inhumane conditions. Political writer Roy Medvedev claims: \\"The penal system in the Kolyma and in the camps in the north was deliberately designed for the extermination of people.\\" Soviet historian Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev expands upon this, claiming that Stalin was the \\"architect of the gulag system for totally destroying human life\\".Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev. A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia. Yale University Press, 2002. p. 15 Political theorist Hannah Arendt argued that although the Soviet government deemed them all \\"forced labor\\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in some of the camps was deliberately pointless, since \\"forced labor is the normal condition of all Russian workers, who have no freedom of movement and can be arbitrarily drafted for work at any place and at any time.\\"Hannah Arendt The Origins of Totalitarianism, Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 - 45\\" She differentiated between \\"authentic\\" forced-labor camps, concentration camps, and \\"annihilation camps\\". In authentic labor camps, inmates worked in \\"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \\"essentially organized for labor purposes.\\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \\"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\\" She criticizes other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labor. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labor and were overall economically irrelevant.\\"Hannah Arendt The Origins of Totalitarianism, Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 - 45\\" The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. According to formerly secret internal Gulag documents, some 1.6 million people may have died in the period between 1935 and 1956 in Soviet forced labour camps and colonies (excluding prisoner-of-war camps). Some 900,000 of these deaths fall between 1941 and 1945,A. I. Kokurin / N. V. Petrov (Ed.): GULAG (Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerej): 1918‚Äì1960 (Rossija. XX vek. Dokumenty), Moskva: Materik 2000, , pp. 441‚Äì2 coinciding with the period of the German-Soviet War when food supply levels were low in the entire country. These figures are consistent with the archived documents that Russian historian Oleg Khlevniuk presents and analyzes in his study The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror, according to which some 500,000 people died in the camps and colonies from 1930 to 1941.Oleg V. Khlevniuk: The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror New Haven: Yale University Press 2004, , pp. 326‚Äì7. Khlevniuk points out that these figures don't take into account any deaths that occurred during transport.ibd., pp. 308‚Äì6. Also excluded are those who died shortly after their release owing to the harsh treatment in the camps,Ellman, Michael. Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments Europe-Asia Studies.

Otto Pohl states that 2,749,163 prisoners perished in the labour camps, colonies and special settlements, while stressing that this is an incomplete figure.Pohl, The Stalinist Penal System, p. 131. = In Maoist China = Like the Soviet system, Mao Zedong's rule of China also included a forced labor prison system known as the Laogai or \\"reform through labour\\". According to Jean-Louis Margolin during the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the harshness of the official prison system reached unprecedented levels, and the mortality rate until 1952 was \\"certainly in excess\\" of 5 percent per year, and reached 50 percent during six months in Guangxi.Stephane Courtois, et al. The Black Book of Communism. Harvard University Press, 1999. pp. 481-482 In Shanxi, more than 300 people died per day in one mine. Torture was commonplace and the suppression of revolts, which were quite numerous, resulted in \\"veritable massacres\\". In Mao: The Unknown Story, the Mao biographer Jung Chang and historian Jon Halliday estimate that perhaps 27 million people died in prisons and labor camps during Mao Zedong's rule.Chang, Jung and Halliday, Jon. Mao: The Unknown Story. Jonathan Cape, London, 2005. p. 338: \\"By the general estimate China's prison and labor camp population was roughly 10 million in any one year under Mao. Descriptions of camp life by inmates, which point to high mortality rates, indicate a probable annual death rate of at least 10 per cent.\\" They claim that inmates were subjected to back-breaking labor in the most hostile wastelands, and that executions and suicides by any means were commonplace. Writing in The Black Book of Communism, which describes the history of repressions by Communist states, Jean-Louis Margolin claims that perhaps 20 million died in the prison system.St√©phane Courtois, Jean-Louis Margolin, et al. The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression.

On June 19, 1988, thousands of overseas Vietnamese worldwide gathered at the Vatican for the Celebration of the Canonization of 117 Vietnamese Martyrs, an event chaired by Monsignor Tran Van Hoai. Their memorial is on November 24 (although several of these saints have another memorial, as they were beatified and on the calendar prior to the canonization of the group). History The Vatican estimates the number of Vietnamese martyrs at between 130,000 and 300,000. John Paul II decided to canonize those whose names are known and unknown, giving them a single feast day. The Vietnamese Martyrs fall into several groupings, those of the Dominican and Jesuit missionary era of the 18th century and those killed in the politically inspired persecutions of the 19th century. A representative sample of only 117 martyrs‚Äîincluding 96 Vietnamese, 11 Spanish Dominicans, and 10 French members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (Missions Etrang√®res de Paris (MEP))‚Äîwere beatified on four separate occasions: 64 by Pope Leo XIII on May 27, 1900; eight by Pope Pius X on May 20, 1906; 20 by Pope Pius X on May 2, 1909; and 25 by Pope Pius XII on April 29, 1951. All these 117 Vietnamese Martyrs were canonized on June 19, 1988. A young Vietnamese Martyr, Andrew Ph√∫ Y√™n, was beatified in March, 2000 by Pope John Paul II. Vietnamese martyrs Paul Mi, Pierre Duong, Pierre Truat, martyred on 18 December 1838. The tortures these individuals underwent are considered by the Vatican to be among the worst in the history of Christian martyrdom. The torturers hacked off limbs joint by joint, tore flesh with red hot tongs, and used drugs to enslave the minds of the victims. Christians at the time were branded on the face with the words \\"t√† ƒë·∫°o\\" (, lit. \\"Left (Sinister) religion\\")Les Missions Etrangeres, p. 291 and families and villages which subscribed to Christianity were obliterated.Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John.

During the turmoil, the missions revived, however, as a result of cooperation between the French Vicar Apostolic Pigneaux de Behaine and Nguyen Anh. After Nguyen's victory in 1802, in gratitude to assistance received, he ensured protection to missionary activities. However, only a few years into the new emperor's reign, there was growing antipathy among officials against Catholicism and missionaries reported that it was purely for political reasons that their presence was tolerated.Jacob Ramsay. \\"Extortion and Exploitation in the Nguy√™n Campaign against Catholicism in 1830s‚Äì1840s Vietnam\\". Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 35, No. 2 (June 2004), pp. 311‚Äì328. Tolerance continued until the death of the emperor and the new emperor Minh Mang succeeding to the throne in 1820. Converts began to be harassed without official edicts in the late 1820s, by local governments. In 1831 the emperor passed new laws on regulations for religious groupings in Viet Nam, and Catholicism was then officially prohibited. In 1832, the first act occurred in a largely Catholic village near Hue, with the entire community being incarcerated and sent into exile in Cambodia. In January 1833 a new kingdom-wide edict was passed calling on Vietnamese subjects to reject the religion of Jesus and required suspected Catholics to demonstrate their renunciation by walking on a wooden cross. Actual violence against Catholics, however, did not occur until the L√™ VƒÉn Kh√¥i revolt. During the rebellion, a young French missionary priest named Joseph Marchand was living in sickness in the rebel Gia Dinh citadel. In October 1833, an officer of the emperor reported to the court that a foreign Christian religious leader was present in the citadel. This news was used to justify the edicts against Catholicism, and led to the first executions of missionaries in over 40 years. The first executed was named Francois Gagelin. Marchand was captured and executed as a \\"rebel leader\\" in 1835; he was put to death by \\"slicing\\". Further repressive measures were introduced in the wake of this episode in 1836. Prior to 1836, village heads had only to simply report to local mandarins about how their subjects had recanted Catholicism; after 1836, officials could visit villages and force all the villagers to line up one by one to trample on a cross and if a community was suspected of harbouring a missionary, militia could block off the village gates and perform a rigorous search; if a missionary was found, collective punishment could be meted out to the entire community. Missionaries and Catholic communities were able to sometimes escape this through bribery of officials; they were also sometimes victims of extortion attempts by people who demanded money under the threat that they would report the villages and missionaries to the authorities. The missionary Father Pierre Duclos said: > with gold bars murder and theft blossom among honest people. The court became more aware of the problem of the failure to enforce the laws and applied greater pressure on its officials to act; officials that failed to act or those tho who were seen to be acting too slowly were demoted or removed from office (and sometimes were given severe corporal punishment), while those who attacked and killed the Christians could receive promotion or other rewards. Lower officials or younger family members of officials were sometimes tasked with secretly going through villages to report on hidden missionaries or Catholics that had not apostasized. The first missionary arrested during this (and later executed) was the priest Jean-Charles Cornay in 1837. A military campaign was conducted in Nam Dinh after letters were discovered in a shipwrecked vessel bound for Macao. Quang Tri and Quang Binh officials captured several priests along with the French missionary Bishop Pierre Dumoulin-Borie in 1838 (who was executed). The court translator, Francois Jaccard, a Catholic who had been kept as a prisoner for years and was extremely valuable to the court, was executed in late 1838; the official who was tasked with this execution, however, was almost immediately dismissed. A priest, Father Ignatius Delgado, was captured in the village of Can Lao (Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province), put in a cage on public display for ridicule and abuse, and died of hunger and exposure while waiting for execution; the officer and soldiers that captured him were greatly rewarded (about 3 kg of silver was distributed out to all of them), as were the villagers that had helped to turn him over to the authorities. The bishop Dominic Henares was found in Giao Thuy district of Nam Dinh (later executed); the villagers and soldiers that participated in his arrest were also greatly rewarded (about 3 kg of silver distributed). The priest, Father Joseph Fernandez, and a local priest, Nguyen Ba Tuan, were captured in Kim Song, Nam Dinh; the provincial officials were promoted, the peasants who turned them over were given about 3 kg of silver and other rewards were distributed. In July 1838, a demoted governor attempting to win back his place did so successfully by capturing the priest Father Dang Dinh Vien in Yen Dung, Bac Ninh province. (Vien was executed). In 1839, the same official captured two more priests: Father Dinh Viet Du and Father Nguyen Van Xuyen (also both executed). In Nhu Ly near Hue, an elderly catholic doctor named Simon Hoa was captured and executed. He had been sheltering a missionary named Charles Delamotte, whom the villagers had pleaded with him to send away. The village was also supposed to erect a shrine for the state-cult, which the doctor also opposed. His status and age protected him from being arrested until 1840, when he was put on trial and the judge pleaded (due to his status in Vietnamese society as both an elder and a doctor) with him to publicly recant; when he refused he was publicly executed. A peculiar episode occurred in late 1839, when a village in Quang Ngai province called Phuoc Lam was victimized by four men who extorted cash from the villagers under threat of reporting the Christian presence to the authorities. The governor of the province had a Catholic nephew who told him about what happened, and the governor then found the four men (caught smoking opium) and had two executed as well as two exiled. When a Catholic lay leader then came to the governor to offer their gratitude (thus perhaps exposing what the governor had done), the governor told him that those who had come to die for their religion should now prepare themselves and leave something for their wives and children; when news of the whole episode came out, the governor was removed from office for incompetence. Many officials preferred to avoid execution because of the threat to social order and harmony it represented, and resorted to use of threats or torture in order to force Catholics to recant. Many villagers were executed alongside priests according to mission reports. The emperor died in 1841, and this offered respite for Catholics. However, some persecution still continued after the new emperor took office. Catholic villages were forced to build shrines to the state cult. The missionary Father Pierre Duclos (quoted above) died in prison in after being captured on the Saigon river in June 1846. The boat he was traveling in, unfortunately contained the money that was set for the annual bribes of various officials (up to 1/3 of the annual donated French mission budget for Cochinchina was officially allocated to 'special needs') in order to prevent more arrests and persecutions of the converts; therefore, after his arrest, the officials then began wide searches and cracked down on the catholic communities in their jurisdictions. The amount of money that the French mission societies were able to raise, made the missionaries a lucrative target for officials that wanted cash, which could even surpass what the imperial court was offering in rewards. This created a cycle of extortion and bribery which lasted for years.

First version The first version of the show premiered in September 13, 1958, on the NBC system airing Saturdays at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. It was hosted by Jack Lescoulie and Fred Davis and directed by Paul Bogart. There were two teams comprising two contestants each; two celebrity guests formed the \\"Brain\\" portion (hosted by Davis) and two other contestants formed the \\"Brawn\\" portion (hosted by Lescoulie). The complex structure of the show puzzled audiences and sponsors (it ran as a sustaining program) and was cancelled after just three or four months. Second version A second and final version was hosted by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, shown as part of NBC's teen-oriented Saturday morning programming and ran from July 10 to October 16, 1993. Gosselaar's co-host in early episodes was Danielle Harris; she was replaced by Tatyana M. Ali, who was a team captain on a previous episode. \\"From the backlot of Universal Studios in Hollywood\\", the show pit two teams of teens against each other in fast-paced rounds of academic and physical challenges accompanied by music and special effects. =Format= Two teams of three teenagers, one of whom was a celebrity captain, competed. They competed in five events for points, which they would use in the Obstacle Course at the end of the show. Games played include: * \\"2-Minute Drill\\" ‚Äì Each contestant stood at a podium. Mark-Paul would read a question with three possible answers, and each one punched in what they believed was the right answer. The round lasted for 2 minutes, and each right answer won the team 10 points. * \\"Hockey\\" ‚Äì One contestant from each team played; one would be the goalie, while the other would try to hit balls with a hockey stick into their net. Each team had 30 seconds to score goals, and would earn 10 points for every goal. * \\"Swing Shot\\" ‚Äì Two contestants from one team had to throw balls through three large holes in a wall. However, a member of the opposing team sat on a pendulum swinging in front of the holes, and would try to block the balls as they flew past. Each team got 30 seconds to do this, and each ball that made it through a hole earned 10 points. * \\"Oddity\\" ‚Äì Each team faces an identical board, with ten rows of three items. One item in each row was the oddity that did not belong with the rest. Each team had 60 seconds to move the oddities into a column in the center. They received 20 points for each oddity correctly identified. * \\"Volleyball\\" ‚Äì The teams played a 3-minute game of volleyball, with 20 points awarded for each score. Two things made this game more difficult; first, each teammate was connected to each other with a bungee cord. Second, the net was a solid trip of fabric, so the ball could not be seen through it. After five events, both teams went to the Obstacle Course. First, the contestants had to run through tires, then climb a fire escape ladder. Then, they had to slide into a large air cushion. After that, they cross a balance beam to reach a zip line. Then they enter a three-seater, pedal-driven buggy to pedal to the finish line. The first team to cross the line won the course and the game. The team in the lead received a head start; for every 10 points the team had scored over their opponents, they would receive one second. Each member of the winning team received a Bushnell telescope.

In the speech, he condemned the Norwegian Communist Party. He also strongly criticized Norwegian Communists, and announced the final break between the Norwegian Labour Party and Norwegian Communist Party. The speech attracted great attention at the time, both in Norway and abroad. It has since become a part of Norwegian political history, signaling the end of communism as a force in Norwegian politics, as well as the beginning of a purge of communists and leftist radicals within the Labour Party. The speech has been coined \\"A declaration of war on Norwegian communists\\".  Background  The background for the speech was the communist coup in Czechoslovakia on 25 February, just four days prior, as well as the Soviet Union's offer to Finland of a non- aggression pact on 27 February. At the time of the coup, Czechoslovakia was preparing a highly anticipated parliamentary election, which was due that very spring. Both the coup itself and the timing was a source of widespread concern within the Norwegian government, who were at the time uncertain as to how it would affect Norway. Furthermore, the Moscow-aligned Norwegian Communist Party (NKP) and its leader Peder Furubotn had publicly voiced support for the Soviet Union and accepted its version of events. This had caused fear throughout the population that a similar coup and subsequent soviet invasion could happen in Norway. Prime Minister Gerhardsen had until then followed a conciliatory line towards both the Communist party as well as hard-line leftists in his own party. However, after the coup events he joined with the anti-communist Party- Secretary Haakon Lie in purging the Party.  Excerpts from the speech  > The Czechoslovak people stands before us as a freedom-loving people, who > have fought bravely against invaders and oppressors of all kinds. We have > felt a remarkable kinship with these people, sympathized with them and > revered them. That's why it pains us so deeply to witness what is happening > now. The communists are surely the only ones who are excited. They say that > it is the popular will and the people who have triumphed. The rest of us > have a hard time understanding how it could be necessary to completely > disregard the parliament that the Czech people have elected. And we have a > hard time understanding that the communists were not able to await the > results of the elections that would have taken place in a few months. Under > these circumstances, one must accept that there is no more than one obvious > explanation, namely that the Communists did not dare leave the decision to > the people in free elections. > Events in Czechoslovakia have with most Norwegians not only aroused sadness > and anger - but also anxiety and a feeling of discomfort. The problem for > Norway, as far as I can see, is primarily a domestic problem. There is a > threat to the Norwegian people's freedom and democracy - that is the danger > that the Norwegian Communist Party forever represents. The most important > task in the fight for Norway's independence, for democracy and the rule of > law is to reduce Communist Party and Communist influence as much as > possible. > We must not create a witch hunt against them. We will not fight them with > the same methods as their Czech comrades fight their political opponents. > The Norwegian communists will still be able to enjoy all democratic rights. > They will be able to speak and write freely. No action committees from other > parties will carry out purges of their editors, or among their officers. > Their representatives in parliament and local government will be able to > continue their work there until the voters in free elections replace them > with others. And they will continue their efforts to win positions in the > trade unions and use their influence to take action which disturbs our > economy. We will fight against communism with democratic means and spiritual > weapons. > We will try to convince the many that joined them during the war, in good > faith, because they believed the Communist Party was national and > democratic. Today, nobody is permitted to have that good faith. Those who > stand at the head of the Communist Party of Norway are Comintern and > Cominform communists. Like their comrades in other countries, in their > hearts they are supporters of terror and dictatorship. Beautiful > declamations can no longer prevent people from seeing the brutal truth with > open eyes - even if for many it will be a grim discovery. The only ones who > can prove that this strong judgment is incorrect are the Norwegian > Communists themselves. They can do this by clearly rejecting the procedure > their Czech comrades have used, and by openly breaking with the > international communist organizations. But this, Peder Furubotn's party will > never do. Those members of the Communist Party who wish to put Norway ahead > of other countries, and freedom and democracy before other ideals, must > break with the Communist Party. Because I believe that the current problem > is a domestic problem, I think one has the right to say that for the moment > there is no danger for Norway. I say that in the confidence that the free > Norwegian people will themselves reduce the Communist Party to the > insignificant sect that it was before the war. And with it, the danger of > Czechoslovak conditions in Norway will be reduced accordingly. We shall see > the seriousness of the situation with open eyes, but there is no reason to > paint too dark a picture either. > At a time like this, there lies a great responsibility on all political > parties and their representatives, on all organizations and the press. If > one should ever have the right to demand fairness and decency in public > debate, it should be in a time like the one we are living through now.  Aftermath  Due to the events in Czechoslovakia, Norway became one of the original members of NATO when it was established the following year. In 1950 the Kr√•ker√∏y Speech's main principles became law in the form of \\"The Emergency laws\\" (). The speech was also the prelude to a major political shift which saw a wave of anti-communist measures, peaking in the 1960s, including party exclusions, censorship of far-left media and introduction of the most comprehensive monitoring of communist and left-wing radicals in the post-war era, as documented by the report of the Lund Commission, amongst others. A group of leftists who had been excluded in 1961 formed a new political party, the Socialist People's Party, which that same year had 2 MPs elected to Parliament. This tipped the balance enough for the Labour party to lose the absolute majority it had enjoyed since the end of World War II. In 1982, thirty-four years after the original speech, Gerhardsen returned to the same assembly hall in Kr√•ker√∏y. At the event he replicated sections of the speech and commented on his thoughts behind it.

The original version of the song was written and recorded for the aborted 1966 album Smile. The band completely re-recorded the song for inclusion on their next album, Smiley Smile. That version was released on the b-side of \\"Wild Honey\\", their 1967 single which charted at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Early versions and alternate mixes of the song were later released on the Beach Boys' box sets Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys (1993) and The Smile Sessions (2011). When Brian Wilson returned to finish Smile as a solo project in 2004, he would record the song again. This version was also used as a b-side, this time for Wilson's solo recording of \\"Wonderful\\", which charted at #29 in the UK. Composition Marilyn Wilson said: \\"We went shopping one day and we brought home some wind chimes. We hung them outside the house and then one day, while Brian was sitting around he sort of watched them out the window and then he wrote the song. I think that‚Äôs how it happened. Simple. He does a lot of things that way.\\"‚ÄúThe Beach Boys‚Äù by Byron Preiss. 1979 Recording In its original version, \\"Wind Chimes\\" was in AAB form. The finished 'A' sections feature Carl Wilson on lead vocals, singing over a backing track consisting of marimbas, percussion, and double bass. As with all parts of the project, Brian Wilson experimented with a number of variant arrangements for \\"Wind Chimes\\" - Takes 1-3 and Takes 8-9 of the A-section backing track feature an alternative arrangement in which the marimbas were replaced by multiple keyboards (possibly celeste, organ, piano and/or harpsichord). There is also a surviving alternate vocal version of the A section (possibly a demo) on which Brian sings the lead vocal. The B section consists of variations on the bass line from the A section, first sung by the whole group over a full backing track, and then, repeated much more quietly, by three pianos. The session tapes reveal that while Brian was usually exacting in his musical demands as a producer, he was also very alert and responsive to improvisations and even apparent \\"mistakes\\" made by his session musicians. During a 'pickup' take for the 'B' Section backing track, one of the keyboard players accidentally plays a 5-semitone scale, instead of the central 3-semitone riff. Wilson immediately stops the take, enthusiastically declares \\"That was a good mistake!\\", and then instructs the musicians to incorporate this accidental change into the next take.The Smile Sessions, 2011 liner notes and session tracks. The song was recorded in three sessions. On August 3, 1966 at Gold Star Studios, Brian Wilson produced the backing track. Two months later, on October 5, the A sections of the backing track were redone with a much smaller band, and the band recorded their vocals on October 10. The October recording sessions were at Western Studios and were engineered by Chuck Britz. After Smile was abandoned, the group quickly recorded an album to be released in its place. Smiley Smile was released in September 1967, featuring both new songs and new recordings of songs originally intended for Smile. The new version of \\"Wind Chimes\\" was recorded by the band on July 10 & 11 at Brian Wilson's home studio. It starts with 2 A sections, just like the original version, but the rest of the song is different, ending with a vocal tag that was later used on a Smile Sessions track called \\"Holidays\\", albeit pitch-shifted. As with the other Smile songs that were re-recorded for Smiley Smile, the arrangement on that album is much sparser than on the original recording.

He was born in Maugerville, New Brunswick in 1797 and grew up in Norfolk County in Upper Canada. Ryerson served with his father as a volunteer during the War of 1812. He converted to Methodism after the war and left home, settling in Oxford County. In 1823, he was assigned to the Niagara circuit, where he rode alongside Ezra Adams. The pair oversaw increase in church membership of seven, including Henry Wilkinson of St. Catharines.Carroll, volume II, page 453 Ryerson was ordained a deacon in 1825. In 1829, he was involved in establishing a separate Canadian church and helped send his brother Egerton to England to attempt to unite the Canadian church with the British Wesleyan Methodist Church. When this failed, in 1840, William became the first president of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada; he was reelected in 1847, but gave up this position when the Canadian church reunited with the British church later that year. He was active in attempting to establish missions and schools for native people. In 1830, with his brother John, Ryerson was a member of committee to establish the Upper Canada Academy, which later became Victoria College. He served with the militia that put down the Upper Canada Rebellion, but also pleaded against the death penalty for the rebel leaders.

It was the first album to feature new guitarists Joe Comeau and Sebastian Marino. Overview In 1995, both guitarists Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant decided to leave Overkill. Overkill then hired Joe Comeau, former singer of the band Liege Lord (now playing guitar). Comeau brought along former Anvil guitarist Sebastian Marino, with whom he had worked with in the past. The new line up recorded The Killing Kind in 1996 It was self-produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Helloween). While staying well within the thrash genre, the album was a departure from its predecessor's more traditional thrash metal style and featured many modern elements, such as hardcore, while vocally some influences were drawn from outside the rock and metal genres. Since Comeau was also a singer, backing vocals on The Killing Kind and subsequent albums were more elaborate and frequent than before, adding another new element to the band's sound. Press response to The Killing Kind was positive. However, the fan's response to The Killing Kind was split, some fans claiming it to be one of their worst albums with other fans calling one of their finest efforts. Overkill toured Europe twice in support of The Killing Kind, first in February 1996 with Megora and Accu¬ßer, and then again in November with Anvil and Stahlhammer.

History After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many designs were used by separatists from Crimea.fotw.net ‚Äî Crimea - 1992 Proposals (Ukraine) The most commonly used design in public was a white flag with a blue outline map of Crimea, reminiscent of the flag of Cyprus. However, many Supreme Council of Crimea members had supported the version of a white flag with seven rainbow colors at the top.fotw.net ‚Äî Crimea in the Soviet Union Crimea proclaimed self-government on 5 May 1992, but no official flag was chosen. On 5 June 1992, five proposals were submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea (Crimean Parliament): # Blue‚Äìwhite‚Äìblue triband with large white space and narrow blue strips at the top and bottom edges of the flag. # White flag with seven rainbow colours at the top. # White over light blue field. # Yellow‚Äìgreen‚Äìblue tricolor with a same size red vertical stripe at the hoist. # The current blue‚Äìwhite‚Äìred design with the coat of arms in the center. Proposal 5, designed by V. Trusov and A. Malgin, was selected to be the flag of Crimea. The coat of arms of G. Jefetov and V. Jagunov was recommended for display on the flag. The final design for the flag was submitted in the second session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on 24 September 1992. The flag was only officially adopted on 21 April 1999. Ethnic flags of Crimean Tatars Flag of the Crimean Tatar people (Qƒ±rƒ±mtatar bayraƒüƒ± or K√∂k bayraq). Earlier rulers of Crimea, the Crimean Tatars, introduced their own flags under the Crimean People's Republic of 1917-1918\\\\. A light blue flag with a golden tamƒüa, known as the K√∂k Bayraq \\"Blue Banner\\", was used as the state and civil flag, the green colored flag was used for religious purposes, and the red colored flag was used as the Tatar's military flag.Jaume Olle', Crimea: The Tatars (Ukraine), Flags of the World ‚Äî (10 July 2000). \\"adopted November 1917, abolished January 1918\\" (Jaum√© Olle, Historical Flags, 1998).

The Crimean Tatars' independence was short-lived, and when Russia took control of Crimea in the beginning of 1918, the flag was abolished. =Crimean Regional Government under General Sulkiewicz (1918)= The short-lived Crimean Regional Government (), led by General Maciej (Suleyman) Sulkiewicz (a Lithuanian Tatar by origin), existed during the German occupation of Crimea (25 June‚Äì15 November 1918), in which the Crimean government proclaimed a self-rule. Sulkiewicz's government adopted a flag which seemed to be a compromise between Crimean Tatars and the Russians. It was a traditional Crimean Tatar blue-colored banner, but it had the coat of arms of the Russian Empire's Taurida Governorate instead of the Crimean Tatar damƒüa. =Soviet Union= When the Crimean ASSR was established as part of the Russian SFSR on 18 October 1921, it received its own flag. The flag was red, and spelled in golden letters were the initials of the name of the republic: in Cyrillic letters –ö—Ä–°–°–†, and in the local Arabic alphabet ('). The lettering on the flag was changed to include –ö—Ä–ê–°–°–†, and QrMS≈û√á in the Uniform Turkic Alphabet in 1929 in order to indicate Crimea as an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The flag was amended yet again in 1938 with the lettering Cyrillic –†–°–§–°–† at the top (for Russian SFSR) and –ö—Ä–ê–°–°–† at the bottom. After Crimea was transformed into the Crimean Oblast (region) on 30 June 1945, its flag was abolished.

On the track, the group sings in unison about wanting a \\"little pad in Hawaii\\" while accompanied by a Hawaiian guitar, an organ, and clip-clop percussion. Music A psychedelic pop collage with elements of Hawaiian music, the song's only lyrics deal with the possibility of having a little house by the sea in Hawaii. Unlike many other tracks on Smiley Smile, \\"Little Pad\\" did not originate during the sessions for Smile, the album that was aborted by the band and replaced by Smiley Smile. Beginning life as the brief piece \\"Hawaiian Song\\", it and \\"Little Pad\\" were tracked on June 19‚Äì21 and 28, 1967. Both songs were later combined into one.

Like many of the songs on that album, it has roots in the abandoned Smile album, as the short song \\"He Gives Speeches\\". Both compositions follow the \\"How Dry I Am\\" progression. Background \\"He Gives Speeches\\" was recorded for the abandoned Smile. After the collapse of Smile, \\"He Gives Speeches\\" was left unreleased. The song was later rewritten and rerecorded for Smiley Smile as \\"She's Goin' Bald\\" with new lyrics by Mike Love. In 1995, Brian Wilson said that it was only a coincidence that Love himself \\"was on his way to goin' bald then,\\" and that the group did the song without being aware that he might have thought it was about him. Brian then called it \\"one of the funnier songs [the Beach Boys] ever done, very current for its time.\\" In 1976, Dennis Wilson claimed: \\"I took that song in a very strange way, I thought it was more or less about oral sex. You know, [sings] 'Get a job, sha na na na, sha na na na na. What a blow...' And I thought, Jesus, that's funny as shit ‚Äî [moronic voice] 'Hey, it's about getting a blow job, huh huh huh.'

We were laughing our asses off when we recorded that stuff.\\" This version includes some unusual effects, including the novel use of an \\"Eltro Information Rate Changer\\" to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo. An example of this obscure effect is present in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. When it came time to assemble the Smile material for Brian Wilson Presents Smile in 2004, Wilson passed on the song's inclusion.

Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, it was one of the last tracks recorded for the unfinished album Smile and was briefly projected to be that album's lead single. Like other tracks on Smiley Smile, the finished arrangement was more stripped-down than the version conceived for Smile. The song was partly inspired by Wilson's obsession with physical fitness in the late 1960s. In a contemporary article, he stated, \\"I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach.\\" Another reported inspiration for the song was a humorous comment Wilson heard about the effect of marijuana turning him and his friends into a \\"vegetative\\" state. The Beatles' Paul McCartney is rumored to be a guest contributor on early versions of the track that were released for the compilations Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys (1993) and The Smile Sessions (2011). While many witnesses support that he contributed chewed celery noises at an early session, held in April 1967, researchers failed to uncover any audio evidence that would confirm his presence on any surviving recording of the song. Background The song was composed in 1966 and first attempted during the aborted Smile sessions. In a contemporary article, Wilson said, \\"I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach.\\" Biographer David Leaf wrote that the song was based on Wilson's reported health obsession at the time. The Saturday Evening Post writer Jules Siegel said that while using marijuana with Wilson and the \\"Beach Boys marijuana-consumption squad\\" Michael Vosse mused at how violence in their \\"vegetative\\" state could not be achieved, provoking laughter and further discussion of being a vegetable. Siegel said that this encounter was what inspired Wilson to write the song. Although it is not definitely known to be true, \\"Vega-Tables\\" is generally believed to fulfill the Earth part of \\"The Elements\\" suite that Brian envisioned for Smile. One of the illustrations created for the album included \\"Vega-Tables\\" as part of \\"The Elements\\", however, a preliminary track list from December 1966 indicated \\"The Elements\\" and \\"Vega-Tables\\" as separate tracks. An early recording of the song, referred to as the \\"cornucopia\\" version, features discarded lyrics that were likely to be written by Van Dyke Parks: \\"Tripped on a cornucopia / Stripped the stalk green and I hope ya / Like me the most of all / My favorite vegetable\\". Some versions also feature an interpolated section after the verses involving Barbershop-style vocal harmonies sung by the Beach Boys. The lyrics are \\"mom and dad say / sleep a lot, eat a lot / brush 'em like crazy / run a lot, do a lot / never be lazy\\". At one point, this section was considered for inclusion on \\"Heroes and Villains\\" under the subheaders \\"Do a Lot\\" or \\"Sleep a Lot\\". The \\"Vega-Tables\\" spelling may have been inspired by the Vejtables, a group who opened for the Beach Boys at a concert on January 1, 1966. Artwork Artist Frank Holmes, who designed the Smile cover artwork, created an illustration that was inspired by the song's lyrics, \\"The Elements\\" / \\"My Vega-Tables\\". Along with several other drawings, they were planned to be included within a booklet packaged with the Smile LP. In 2005, Holmes shared a background summary of his design choices: Smile sessions =Overview= Recording for \\"Vega-Tables\\" or \\"Vegetables\\" spanned from through . On November 4, 1966, Wilson produced a session dedicated to capturing a \\"humorous\\" situation featuring himself, Parks, Danny Hutton, Vosse, and a man named Bob. Towards the end of the exercise, the group plays a rhythm on bongos while chanting \\"Where's my beets and carrots\\" and \\"I've got a big bag of vegetables\\". On November 16, Wilson produced another humor session, this time dedicated to recording mock disagreements between Vosse and session drummer Hal Blaine. The latter play-acts as a man that is irate at Vosse for trespassing into his garden. It later turns into a serious conversation between Blaine, Vosse, and Wilson about the planetary alignments. Wilson completes the session by having his own mock disagreement with Blaine. Badman writes, \\"At one point, it is believed that these recordings will somehow figure into the 'Vegetables' track itself.\\" In February 1967, Wilson announced that \\"Vega-Tables\\" would be the lead single from Smile, although he had only recorded the \\"cornucopia\\" demo of the song at this point. To taunt the record company, Wilson staged a mock promotion of the \\"Vega-Tables\\" by holding a photoshoot at the Los Angeles Farmers Market, where he posed in front of a fruit and vegetable stand. Parks was against having the song as the album's single. He later commented, \\"I am sure I would not have wanted 'Vega-Tables' to be given too much emphasis. For Smile, that celebrated collaboration, to be dependent on a commercial release of 'Vega-Tables' as a single, was to me tremendously ill-advised, wherever it came from.\\" In early April, the band spent at least eight studio dates recording \\"Vega-Tables\\" before embarking on a US tour on the 14th of the month. Parks' last recorded appearance on the album's sessions was for a \\"Vega-Tables\\" date on April 14, after which he withdrew from the project. Afterward, Wilson took a four-week break from the studio. On April 29, publicist Derek Taylor reported that a single, \\"Vegetables\\" backed with \\"Wonderful\\", would soon be released. He described it as \\"a light and lyrical, day to day, green grocery song on which Al Jardine sings a most vigorous lead.\\" =McCartney visit= Paul McCartney (pictured 1976) contributed celery-crunching noises at an early session for the song During the April 10 vocal session at Sunset Sound Recorders, which also saw work on \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Child Is Father of the Man\\", Paul McCartney of the Beatles joined the Beach Boys in the studio for several hours. Al Jardine remembered that: KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer said he was present at this session with McCartney: \\"We were in a booth, and we were supposed to shout out the names of vegetables. I was a young, punk kid at the time, and I shouted out 'TV dinners!' I didn't know ...\\" McCartney supported the story, recalling in 2016: On the existing tapes for these sessions, McCartney's presence cannot be verified, and it is unclear if any record of his performance has survived. Archivist Craig Slowinski, who assembled the sessionography included with The Smile Sessions box set, stated: \\"I was ready to credit Sir Paul with 'veggie munching' ... but since no tapes were found with his voice or reference to him, we figured I'd better not. Too hard to say that any veggie munching on his part remained on tape through the final stages of production.\\"http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php/topic,25265.msg614389.html#msg614389 Sessions co-producer Mark Linett explained: \\"Unless Paul is being very quiet, there‚Äôs no evidence that he‚Äôs a part of the chomping. And there‚Äôs quite a lot of discussion going on while that particular track is being recorded.\\" After the \\"Vega-Tables\\" session, McCartney performed his song \\"She's Leaving Home\\" on piano for Wilson and his wife. Wilson said: \\"We both just cried. It was beautiful.\\" He performed \\"Wonderful\\" on piano for McCartney. Beatles roadie Mal Evans wrote about singing the traditional \\"On Top of Old Smokey\\" with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: \\"Brian then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session.\\" In a January 1968 interview, Wilson stated of the McCartney episode that \\"it was a little uptight and we really didn't seem to hit it off. It didn't really flow. ... It didn't really go too good.\\" Smiley Smile sessions The Smile album was reported scrapped on May 5, 1967. Starting on June 3, \\"Vega-Tables\\" was rerecorded for the new album Smiley Smile, where it was respelled \\"Vegetables\\" and reworked as a kind of campfire song, Apart from its coda (recorded April 1967), the track was remade entirely from scratch. Wilson played the electric bass on this version. According to Al Jardine, \\"I remember telling Brian, 'We‚Äôve got to do something different on this thing.' What the hell, it was four in the morning. I filled some water bottles, tuned it to the key of the song and blew air into the bottles. What you hear sounds like an old organ.\\" \\"Mama Says\\" In 1967, the song was revisited for the last time as the closing track \\"Mama Says\\" on Wild Honey (1967). This version consisted of an extended re-recording of the unused \\"Do or Lot\\" or \\"Sleep a Lot\\" module. It was the first time a track with thematic links to Smile was used to close a later Beach Boys album, the others being 20/20 (1969) and Surf's Up (1971). Inexplicably, Parks' songwriting credit was not honored, and instead Mike Love was listed as the song's only co-writer.

It is used to identify a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context (a unique data session) in the Mobile Station (MS) and in the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). It is dynamically selected by the MS (however, the MS should ensure that the selected NSAPI is not currently being used by another session management entity in the MS). When the MS requests a PDP context, it selects an NSAPI that it sends to the SGSN with the request. NSAPI is also used as part of the Tunnel Identifier between GPRS Support Nodes (GSNs). The user identity (International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)) and the application identifier (NSAPI) are integrated into the Tunnel Identifier (GTPv0) (TID) or Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (GTPv1) (TEID) that uniquely identifies the subscriber's sublink between the GSNs (SGSN and GGSN). The SGSN inserts the NSAPI along with the SGSN address in the ‚ÄúCreate PDP Context Request.‚Äù One PDP context may have several (secondary) PDP contexts and NSAPI. The NSAPI is an integer value within the PDP context header. In the UMTS system the data connection between a GPRS Core Network and a mobile station is identified using an NSAPI, that identifies as well a radio access bearer.

Los Chalchaleros were an Argentine musical folkloric ensemble consisting of four men, and arguably the most famous folk singers in the history of Latin America. The group was established in 1948 in the northern province of Salta. It was named after a local song-bird, the chalchalero. They left the stages and recording in 2003. The original group was formed by Victor Jos√© Zambrano (\\"Cocho\\"), Carlos Franco Sosa, Aldo Saravia, and Juan Carlos Saravia. They performed their first public concert on June 16, 1948. The group members by the time the group stopped performing were Juan Carlos Saravia, Eduardo Rom√°n (\\"Polo\\"), Ricardo Francisco Figueroa (\\"Pancho\\"), and Facundo Saravia. Other components during the group's history include Jos√© Antonio Saravia Toledo, Ricardo Federico D√°valos (\\"Dicky\\"), and Ernesto Cabeza. Los Chalchaleros have published close to 50 records, typically focusing in traditional Argentinian folk music: zamba, cueca, chacarera, gato, and chamam√©. In addition, an Argentine book publisher, Editorial Ritmos del Andes, released a book in 1964 titled \\"Canciones folkloricas con Los Chachareros: Exitos del Momento\\" (\\"Folkloric songs with Los Chachaleros: modern hits\\"). A rodent species discovered in La Rioja Province, Argentina, Salinoctomys loschalchalerosorum (the Chalchalero viscacha rat), from the family Octodontidae, was named after the group. The researcher in charge of the naming (Michael A. Mares from the University of Oklahoma at Norman), states that he named the new species after Los Chalchaleros because his crews had sung their songs during thirty years of field research across Argentina.

History East London Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 at Mansion House station in April 2007 Route 15 was introduced in November 1908 between Shepherd's Bush and East Ham. On 16 December 1909, LGOC X-type buses were introduced to the route, running between Putney and Plaistow. In 1914 it was extended to Putney Common, with a Sunday extension eastwards to Plaistow. By 1921 route 15 had been cut back to Ladbroke Grove, extending in the east to Barking and North Woolwich on weekdays. A Sunday extension from Ladbroke Grove to Acton Vale was launched, and the North Woolwich journeys were diverted to Becontree Heath. In May 1949, Leyland Titan RTWs were introduced on route 15. By November 1949, the route ran on from Ladbroke Grove to Poplar (Blackwall Tunnel), extending to East Ham during Monday to Friday peak hours and evenings, and all day on Saturdays and Sundays, with a further Sunday extension to Kew. From January 1967 journeys to Kensal Rise were introduced, and in October 1969 the route was suspended between Acton and Kew, being reinstated in 1970. In May 1975 the Sunday service was rerouted to Richmond bus station. In May 1985, the route was diverted between to serve Cannon Street and the Tower of London. In June 1987 the Sunday service was converted to one-man operation. On 15 March 1989 an express commuter service named The Beckton Express and numbered X15 began operating between Beckton and Aldwych using former London Country AEC Routemasters. This ceased on 22 November 1991. On 18 July 1992, the Monday to Saturday service was withdrawn between Ladbroke Grove and Paddington, being replaced by new route 23. In May 1993 this section was withdrawn on Sundays, and in September 1999 route 15 was withdrawn between Poplar and Canning Town, with buses diverted to serve Blackwall station.

Formerly named Cwmbran Shopping, it was officially renamed Cwmbran Centre on 3 July 2017Cwmbran Shopping Centre renamed As a New Town the town centre was planned in a single Master Plan along with the surrounding residential neighbourhoods. It is the second largest shopping centre in Wales. History The Cwmbran Development Corporation prepared the Master Plan for the development of the New Town which resulted in the creation of the original seven neighbourhoods which contained some local services, and housing and were located within easy reach of the Town Centre. The early years of the New Town were dominated by housebuilding with a lack of services for the town. In 1959 construction of the central retail area began, although considerations of its design began in 1951. The Town Centre was developed as a purpose-built central area by the Development Corporation and the Town Centre has been the focal point for retail development in Torfaen since its inception as a New Town. North Walk and Gwent Square were the first area to be constructed. General Rees Square, which housed the South Wales Electricity Board and Post Office, was named after General Wynford Rees (1898-1959), a Commander of the British Indian Army, Deputy Lieutenant of Monmouthshire and First Manager of the Cwmbran Development Corporation. In 1964, David Evans opened ‚Äì this was the largest department store in the area at the time. From 1967 to 1972 the town centre grew at speed, with the opening of the Tower, Glyndwr, Monmouth and Gwent Houses, Monmouth Square and the Water Garden, the cinema, theatre, social club, police station and Magistrate's Court. Flagship stores followed; Woolco in 1975 (now Llewelyn Walk), Sainsbury's in 1976 (relocated in 1994, original site now Asda) and Marks and Spencer in 1977 (closed in 2019). The bingo hall in Monmouth Walk was the last building to be built in 1981 before the centre was sold to Ladbrokes in 1985. Transport links improved by the re-opening of Cwmbran Railway Station in 1986 and Cwmbran Drive in 1988, allowing the centre to develop outside the original ringroad. In the 1990s, Lockgate Retail Park opened to the west of the centre, on derelict land once used by Guest, Keen & Nettlefold, and Aldi and Lidl opened in Forgehammer. In 2013, Morrisons opened to the east of the centre, on land once used by Girlings. Present day Cwmbran Centre is now owned by Prudential plc and houses some of the most famous High Street shops in the UK. The largest unit is occupied by Asda, opened in 2001 on the former site of J. Sainsbury's, Swalec, and the health centre. The 170+ shops include Argos; Barclays; The Body Shop; F. Hinds; HMV; House of Fraser; HSBC; Iceland; KFC; Matalan; McDonald's; NatWest; New Look; Pizza Hut; River Island; H. Samuel; Superdrug; Wetherspoon's (the John Fielding); W H Smith, Wilko, B&M; Bargains; B&Q; Next; Pets at Home; Lidl, Aldi, Primark and Morrisons. Construction has begun on the new Torfaen Sixth Form Centre, due to open in September 2020, on land between Morrisons and Meritor (formerly Girlings). A McDonald's drive-thru has also been planned within the Morrisons car park, and Lidl is to be relocated to the Stagecoach depot site on Somerset Road, which is moving to new premises north of the industrial estate. Plans have also been submitted for the refurbishment of Gwent and Monmouth Squares, having been untouched since their construction in the 1970s.

During the 2000s drought most of them become dried and people rushed for water pump drills. However, there is another problem villagers are disagree with water pumps because they will dry the rest of the Kariz's in the region. There is no main road specially, in the south during the winter about 2 or half months access to the area blocks by snow, people only go by foot.

Running between Tower Hill and Trafalgar Square, it is operated by Stagecoach London. It is a short working of the standard route 15 and it is the only preserved AEC Routemaster route. History This route and route 9 (Heritage) were announced initially as 'A' and 'B' as short workings on existing routes to avoid any potential complications as Government's legislation requires buses to be fully wheelchair-accessible by 22 October 2014 in the entire United Kingdom. For Transport for London, they aimed to comply earlier with the last non-wheelchair accessible buses withdrawn in June 2008 with two exemptions - the heritage routes. Only one route, the 15H remains after the withdrawal of the 9H in 2014. One of the two routes, awarded to Stagecoach London, was for services between Trafalgar Square and Tower Hill, covering the most touristy section of route 15 taking in the Tower of London, Monument, St Paul's Cathedral and Trafalgar Square. An extension to the Oxford Street area was excluded due to severe congestion there. The number of the parallel route 15 was adopted for the AEC Routemasters, despite potential for confusion with the main 15. Ten buses were allocated to the operator; 5 for the daily turnout, 3 operational spares and 2 as a \\"strategic reserve\\". Despite having only a couple of weeks to prepare the vehicles after they left normal service, Stagecoach turned out 5 immaculately presented Routemasters for the first day of service, 14 November 2005. The first journey was driven by Peter Hendy, managing director of TfL surface transport. In April 2008, one of the buses was painted in a special Indian Red and Silver livery, to promote Bow Garage's Centenary. It was first revealed at the LBPT's Cobham bus rally, and soon after entered regular service. In 2015, it was revealed that 10 Routemasters were to be refurbished which will include opening windows being refitted.Heritage Routemasters receive their Eastleigh refits Buses Magazine August 2015 page 25 From 2 March 2019, the heritage service will continue to operate only on weekends and bank holidays, from the last (2019: first) Saturday in March until the last weekend in September.

Early life and conversion John Van Cott was descended from a Dutch settler named Claes Cornelissen Van Cott who came from Holland to what is now New York [Nieuw Amsterdam] in 1662. His father died of consumption when John was 10 years old. He first heard of The Book of Mormon and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from his cousin LDS Apostle Parley P. Pratt who was seven years his senior. (John's mother, Lovina Pratt and Parley's father, Jared, were siblings.) Some accounts put this first introduction as early as 1833 but, unlike his cousin, he did not join for some time. In 1835 he married Lucy Sackett and they had four children in Canaan, New York. There is some disagreement regarding whether their family name links to a famous old Van Cats family of Holland. While some claim no official proof of the connection, and assert there has been no acceptance of any claims of the connection between these two different family names made by any Dutch officials, there is ample genealogical work to demonstrate a reasonable connection through Claes Van Cats, who emigrated to America in 1652 as a boy. Claes Van Cats subsequently married Catalyn Jans in 1670. Their line continued through Johannes Van Cats (1674) to Nicolaes Van Cats (1715) and on to Johannes (John) Van Cott (baptized 1747), finally arriving at Losee Van Cott, John Van Cott's father. The Van Cott line can be traced back from Claes to the first Lord Giselbert Van Welle, Lord Van Cats, who was born about the year 1060. In 1843, Lucy joined the Latter Day Saint church. Historical material is somewhat sketchy here as most sources say that Van Cott himself was baptized by Pratt in Nauvoo in 1844 or 45, but others imply that the family moved to Nauvoo after he was baptized. Records are consistent in saying that the family was in Nauvoo in 1846 and stayed for a time at Pratt's home and that Van Cott donated about $400 towards the completion of the Nauvoo Temple. Pioneer and church servant The winter of 1846 was spent at Winter Quarters, where Van Cott became well acquainted with Brigham Young. According to historical records, he was chosen to be a bishop at this time to watch after the families of men who had joined the Mormon Battalion. He was ordained a Seventy on February 25, 1847. As a Mormon pioneer, John made the \\"trip across the plains\\" multiple times. In 1847 he, his wife, two children (their two other children died in New York), and 59-year-old mother traveled with the Daniel Spencer/Perrigrine Sessions Company, wherein John was appointed to be a \\"captain of 10\\" and a marshal. They arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on September 25. After arriving in the valley, at the behest of Young, Van Cott went back out on the trail to assist other companies who were having difficulties. He assisted in the exploration of the new land. He was chosen to be the first marshal of Salt Lake City. John Van Cott in his older years In 1852 Van Cott began a four-year assignment as the president of the Scandinavia Mission, headquartered in Denmark. He was called to the same assignment again in 1859 and served for two-and-a-half years. He became proficient in Danish as a result of his work there. On the journey home to Utah, Van Cott led a group of church members from Scandinavia to the United States aboard the ship Waldemar, and then on the journey across the midwest to Salt Lake. He is listed as being the President of the Madsen and Liljenquist companies, leading a group of Scandinavian Saints to Salt Lake in July‚ÄìSept 1862. This may be the same group he led on the Waldemar, but further information is needed. In 1862 Van Cott was sustained as one of the Seven Presidents of the Seventy. He died at his home a short distance south of Salt Lake City, February 18, 1883, after a lingering illness of several months. Family Like several church leaders of his time, John Van Cott was instructed to practice plural marriage. He had five wives and 28 children. His first child was born in 1838, his last in 1878. Some did not live to see adulthood, while others did; some became prominent members of their communities. He has thousands of descendants.

Having moved to England following an impressive showing for PNG in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup, Gene enjoyed a long career in the British game with spells at Hull Kingston Rovers, Huddersfield Giants, Bradford Bulls, Hull F.C. and Halifax. Gene was a versatile player with the ability to cover virtually any position on the pitch, though he spent most of his test career playing at stand off (off- half). He was a regular for the PNG Kumuls for 14 years between 1994 and 2008, and captained the side on at least three occasions, including being the PNG captain during the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, before retiring from international rugby league following the 2008 tournament. Gene is considered a hero in his home country and almost universally regarded as a rugby league legend. Career =Club career= Gene was born in Goroka. After playing in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup for Papua New Guinea, Gene was offered a contract to play for Hull Kingston Rovers in the old Second Division. After moving to the United Kingdom, Gene played for Hull KR from 1996 to 2000. He scored 94 Tries in 111 matches during that period, and was a massively popular figure at the club. He moved to Gateshead and was then forced to play for rivals Hull F.C. when they merged. However, he had a frustrating time there, mainly featuring as a substitute. He was granted a release from his contract midway through 2001 and allowed to look for another club. Gene signed with Huddersfield Giants midway through 2001, but was unable to save them from relegation. However, he was instrumental in the club's unbeaten run and promotion back into Super League the following year. He went on to establish himself as one of Huddersfield's most important players. Gene moved to the Bradford Bulls for the 2006 Season. Along with fellow Papua New Guinea national Marcus Bai, Gene's first match for the club was their win the 2006 World Club Challenge against the Wests Tigers. He played from the interchange bench and scored a try in the Bradford Bulls' 30-10 victory. After only one season with the Bradford Bulls, he was allowed to rejoin Hull Kingston Rovers. Gene returned to Hull Kingston Rovers, his first English club, following their promotion to Super League in 2007. He provided experience and a steadying influence as the club established itself in Super League, before being allowed to leave at the end of the 2009 season. Following his release from Hull Kingston Rovers, Gene signed for Cooperative Championship side Halifax for the 2010 season along with fellow countryman and close friend Makali Aizue. =PNG= Gene's representative career lasted over a decade. He made his test d√©but for PNG against France at the Lloyd Robson Oval in Port Moresby during the France's tour of Oceania in 1994. Selected as a substitute for his first test, Gene contributed a field goal in PNG's 29-22 win.. He then went on to play for the Kumuls during the 1995 Rugby League World Cup in England, and also played in the 2000 and 2008 World Cups. In addition, he represented his country in numerous test matches before announcing his intention to retire from international rugby league following the 2008 World Cup. Following PNG's exit from the tournament, he was tearfully carried from the field by his team mates and given a standing ovation by the 16,239 strong crowd at the Dairy Farmers Stadium in Townsville, Australia (his last game was a 46-6 defeat by the Kangaroos). He is regarded in Papua New Guinea as a sporting legend. =Coaching= In 2010, Adrian Lam stepped down as the coach of the PNG national team. Within a few days, it was announced that Gene would be installed as his replacement. The first game under Gene's leadership was the annual fixture between PNG and the Australian PM's XIII. Gene went on to coach the team for the 2010 Four Nations in Australia and New Zealand, failing to register a victory over tournament winner New Zealand, runner up Australia, and England. In September 2013 Gene was appointed head coach of Gateshead Thunder (now Newcastle Thunder) for the 2014 season. Personal life Gene lives in Yorkshire , Gene has two sons, Elliott and Leo. In 2006, he paid for the installation of electricity in his home village of Segu, located on the outskirts of Goroka. In 2012, he set up the Stanley Gene Foundation, aiming to supply donations to the deprived areas of Papua New Guinea. =Pronunciation of 'Gene'= There has been confusion over the pronunciation of 'Gene'. \\"When I first arrived in England people called me Gene (Jean) and I thought it sounded quite posh, so I got used to it, but it is Gene (Gennay), that's how it is pronounced back home.\\" =Stanley Gene's age= Stanley Gene's age was a major talking point about the player for many years. Although his date of birth registered with the Rugby Football League (RFL) was 11 May 1974, many of his former team mates and coaches insisted he was considerably older than this. In 2008, Gene himself stated that he was 34, and explained that some people believe that Papua New Guineans \\"look older in the face\\" than in other countries. Despite this explanation, it was rumoured that he was unable to provide a birth certificate to prove his age, and that he allegedly held several passports with different dates of birth. Former Wigan player Bryan Fletcher predicted that Gene could be as old as 45. On 11 May 2013, Gene confirmed that it was his 39th birthday. He showed guests at his birthday dinner his birth certificate, which confirmed that his date of birth is 11 May 1974.

Students cover the same material as those studying in hospital settings. Third year Deakin University medical students in the RCCS program are hosted in general practices in regional and rural Victorian towns including Bacchus Marsh, Daylesford, Colac, Ararat, Camperdown, Casterton, Horsham, Stawell and Hamilton. Teaching is provided by face-to-face instruction by general practitioners, clinical skills trainers, visiting medical and surgical specialists, online lectures and tutorials. Unlike in the other clinical schools attached to Deakin, the RCCS curriculum follows a Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (LIC) model.Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship Program at Deakin RCCS. https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1767-8 Through this model, rather than cycling through set rotations throughout the year, students encounter a wide range of patient presentations which, with the complementation of online teaching, cover the same content that is encountered through conventional rotation-based learning. Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship Program. https://www.mededpublish.org/manuscripts/2265 Another aspect of the RCCS program is that students perform \\"parallel consulting\\" in general practice. This means the student consults one-on-one with a patient, then presents their findings to the supervising doctor. The doctor completes the consultation with the student observing, giving the student opportunities to develop practical clinical skills such as history taking, physical examination, case presentation and medical management. By placing students in rural general practices rather than major metropolitan hospitals, the aim of RCCS is to give students exposure to primary care and country family medicine, with the ultimate objective of encouraging more medical graduates to work in regional Australia, particularly in general practice.  Deakin Medical Students' Association  MeDUSA, the Deakin Medical Students' Association, was established in 2008 to coincide with the entry of the first cohort of students.

It was shot in English in the United States, featuring Ben Gazzara and Ornella Muti in the leading roles. The film's title and subject matter are based on the works and the person of US poet Charles Bukowski, including the short story The Most Beautiful Woman in Town (published by City Lights Publishing in the 1972 collection Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness). The film's protagonist, Charles Serking, is based on Bukowski's autobiographical character Henry Chinaski. At the time, the director Taylor Hackford owned the rights to the Chinaski name, having acquired them when he optioned Bukowski's 1971 novel Post Office. Plot The film follows the meandering (sexual) adventures of the poet and drunk, Charles Serking, laying bare the sleaze of life in the less reputable neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Serking's life takes a turn for the better when he meets Cass, a young hooker with self destructive habits. They have a stormy relationship. When Serking gets an offer from a major publishing house, Cass tries to stop him from leaving, but fails. Serking gives in to the temptation of the big bucks, but soon realises his mistake and returns to L.A only to find that Cass has killed herself in his absence. Devastated he hits the bottle in a nightmarish drinking bout, but finally reaches catharsis and returns to the seaside guesthouse where he spent his happiest moments with Cass. Here he rekindles his poetry with the aid of a young admirer in one of Ferreri's trademark beach scenes. Reception While successful in Europe, the film met with a lukewarm reception in the US despite its American setting. Janet Maslin of the New York Times gave the film a negative review.  Awards  The film won 4 David di Donatello and 2 Nastro d'Argento both including Best Director. =David di Donatello= *Marco Ferreri: Best Director *Sergio Amidei & Marco Ferreri: Best Script *Tonino Delli Colli - Best Cinematography *Ruggero Mastroianni - Best Editing  References   External links  * Category:English-language films Category:1981 films Category:1981 drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian drama films Category:Films based on works by Charles Bukowski Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Films directed by Marco Ferreri Category:Films scored by Philippe Sarde Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films based on short fiction Category:French films Category:French drama films ","title":"Tales of Ordinary Madness"},{"id":"4822811","text":"Coverkill is a cover album consisting of cover songs released by thrash metal band Overkill in 1999.

Although considered an American invention there is evidence of outdoor cinemas in Western Australia where some patrons attended in their cars as far back as 1938, and it is possible that these facilities may even predate the first American-style drive-in theatre. History Bass Hill Drive-In Cinema The first American-style drive-in theatre to open in Australia was the Skyline in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood on 18 February 1954. It was the first of 330 drive-in theatres that would open across Australia. Many have since closed with the large amounts of land taken up by drive-ins being sold off to build houses or shopping centres, although in recent years a number of drive-in theatres have reopened or expanded the number of screens available. In the 1990s, the Coburg Drive-in Theatre in Melbourne was expanded to three screens, as was the Dromana Drive-in Theatre. In more recent times the former Dandenong Panoramic Drive-in, in Victoria, has been reopened as the Lunar Drive-in Theatre and now has four screens making it Australia's largest drive- in theatre with the most screen choice. In 2002 the Rodeo Drive-in at Mareeba, near Cairns, re-opened, with the Tivoli Drive-in near Ipswich re-opening in 2008. The longest running Drive In Theatres in Western Australia that is still open today is located in Dongara. This opened in 1967 and still operates every summer, the projector has been upgraded to digital to show the latest movies. Along with a few metropolitan operations, there are a number of drive-in theatres serving remote communities such as Jericho in Queensland. By state The remaining drive-ins provide a glimpse of what was a very popular pastime in the 1950s and 1960s. The following is a listing of Australia's remaining open drive-in theatres. It includes portable operations in which patrons can either drive or sit down to see a movie outdoors. =Victoria= Lunar Drive-in Theatre Dandenong Victoria Australia Following a visit to the United States in the early 1950s, Hoyts' southern division manager, George Griffith Jnr, believed that drive-in theatres would be successful in Australia. Hoyts and Fox however did not share Griffith's enthusiasm for the establishment of a drive-in theatre, so Griffith subsequently formed a syndicate, Auto Theatres Pty Ltd, which decided on a site in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood for Australia's first drive-in theatre. Construction proceeded through the latter half of 1953 from plans drawn up by AC Leith Bartlett & Partners in conjunction with RCA Australia. The Skyline Burwood officially opened on 18 February 1954 and proved extremely popular, with traffic jams in both directions along the Burwood Highway. Hoyts subsequently bought out Griffith and his partners. Following the success of the first drive-in theatre, the Skyline (Burwood), Hoyts quickly opened Skyline drive-in theatres at Preston in 1954, and Oakleigh in March 1955. The next Hoyts drive- in was constructed in Broadmeadows (1958), but then there was a break of almost 10 years until Hoyts acquired drive-ins at Coburg and Oakleigh and constructed new drive-ins in Bulleen (1965), Wantirna (1968) and Altona. In 1972 the Broadmeadows Skyline was the first of the Melbourne suburban drive- ins to close, whilst the Oakleigh site was the last drive-in operated by Hoyts in the world, when it closed in 1990. Sandringham drive-in theatre (now closed) was located between Tulip and Talinga Roads in Sandringham Victoria. With the entrance being on Tulip St. Today Melburnians have 10 screens in their immediate vicinity to choose from (counting Dromana as being basically suburban Melbourne). Rural Victorians however have no drive-in theatres currently in operation. * Lunar Drive-in Theatre (four screens), Dandenong :The Lunar Dandenong is now Australia's largest and oldest (still in operation) drive-in theatre. It was first opened 4 May 1956 and was constructed by J and K Houlahan from plans drawn up by Baily and Tilley. The original capacity was to be for 400 cars however this was redesigned to accommodate 600 cars, with the final capacity being 634 cars. The drive-in closed on 18 April 1984 and was subsequently purchased by Trash and Treasure Australia Pty Ltd, who operated a Sunday market on the site in the 1970s. On 19 September 2002 it reopened as a two-screen drive-in, with a third screen added in September 2003 with a 950-car capacity. * Village Coburg Drive-in (3 Screens), Coburg :Coburg opened in November 1965, under the ownership of Sillman and Sharp. It was acquired by Hoyts in 1967 until it closed in 1984. Hoyts were unable to sell the site despite numerous attempts and in 1987 Village joined with Hoyts and re-opened Coburg as a twin screen in 1987. A third screen was added in 1995. Coburg was Australia's largest drive-in theatre with an 850 car capacity, until the expansion at Dandenong in 2003. * Dromana 3 Drive-in (3 Screens), Dromana :The Dromana was opened in 1961 with a capacity of 485 cars. It has since been expanded to a three screen operation and has a Sunday market operating from the site. It is only one of three that have never closed (since the 1960s), operating continuously since its inception (1961) to the present..http://www.nattrust.com.au/trust_register/search_the_register/dromana_drive_in =New South Wales= The Skyline Drive-ins at Frenchs Forest and Dundas were Sydney's first. They opened simultaneously on Wednesday 24 October 1956, with Frenchs Forest screening 3 Ring Circus and Dundas screening The Racers. The Skyline in Bass Hill opened in November 1956, with a 724 car capacity and until its closure in September 2007 was Australia's oldest continually operating drive-in theatre. This was followed by a Skyline in Newcastle in December 1956 at a cost of $200,000, with a capacity for 722 cars and a holding area for a further 420. The Newcastle Skyline closed in June 1985. The North Ryde Skyline, on Lane Cove Road, accommodated 620 cars and operated for 30 years from 1956. Caringbah drive-in is now a shopping mall. A few small community drive-ins remain in rural NSW. Until recently the Greater Union Blacktown Drive In was one of Sydney's last remaining drive-ins, however a new seasonal facility with a blow up screen has recently started at Randwick Racecourse. From late May 2020, the rooftop carpark at the Entertainment Quarter in Moore Park will also host a drive-in theatre. * Greater Union Blacktown Drive-In (2 Screens), Blacktown :Blacktown Skyline was opened in the 1960s. It was the first of the Consolidated circuit to add a second screen in 1984 and has a capacity of 700 cars. It is currently operated by Greater Union. Tamworth Drive-in theatre opened in July 1965 and closed circa 1980. Featured a children's playground and mini-golf with full food amenities. * Heddon Greta Skyline (1 Screen), Heddon Greta The Drive in was opened in the 1960s but between 1984 - 1996 the theatre was closed, however it has been reopened. The theatre has the capacity of 676 cars. It is currently operated by Skyline (Greater Union/Hoyts) and Donna and Scott Seddon. * Dubbo Westview Drive In (1 Screen), Closed in the mid 1980s recently restored and reopened to special events- . =Queensland= Queensland had at one stage over fifty drive-ins. Now all of the suburban Brisbane drive-in theatres have closed leaving the Tivoli Drive-In in Ipswich, and the Gold Coast's Yatala as the closest drive-in theatres to Brisbane. In rural Queensland however, there are still a number of drive-in theatres operating. Boondall Drive-In, May 1958 Brisbane's first drive-in was the Capalaba which opened in 1955. The Boondall Drive-in opened on 8 February 1956, at the time it had the largest screen in Australia. Kids were well catered for with a Merry-Go-Round, miniature Cobb & Co coach and Shetland Ponies to ride (Brisbane Telegraph, 6 Feb 1956). The site of the Boondall Drive-In has now been developed into housing. The Burleigh Heads Drive-in was one of Queensland's first drive-ins when it opened in 1957 with a 500 car capacity. It was followed by the Starlight drive-in at Aspley, which was opened in January 1957 (at a cost of ¬£100,000). Fourth to open, in April 1957, was Hoyts Skyline Drive-in located at Coopers Plains at a cost of ¬£200,000. It could hold 650 cars on its 17 acres and also had a children's railway line, putt putt, badminton facilities and a dance floor. The Starline Drive-In opened near Ipswich in the early 1960s. Other drive-ins opened in and around Brisbane in the late 1960s, early 1970s. These included the Keperra, the Western at Oxley, the Galaxy at Cannon Hill and the Redcliffe Drive-In on the city's northern outskirts. In 2002 a small boutique drive-in was opened in Wonga (north of Gympie), with a second screen added in 2004, increasing it to a 250 car capacity. A third screen was subsequently added; however in January 2010 the drive-in closed, when its owner went into receivership. In September 2010 a new owner took over the operation of the drive-in reopening in December that year. The drive-in has recently closed. * Ayr Stardust Drive In, Ayr :The Stardust drive-in was opened in September 1964, with a capacity of 360 cars. Built within the grounds is a hardtop cinema, so patrons can choose between outdoor and indoor movies. Yatala Drive- In during a themed event in 2013 * Yatala 3 Drive-In (3 screens), Yatala :The Yatala Drive-In is the Gold Coast's last open-air drive-in theatre (in an area which formerly had over 20 drive-in theatres), formerly Beenleigh Drive-In, it opened on 27 October 1974, and in 2000 the theatre was renamed Yatala Twin Drive-In when a second screen was added. A third screen was added in 2013. * Charters Towers Tors Drive-In, Charters Towers :The Charters Towers Tors drive-in was opened in 1966 and has two screens with capacity for 300 cars. * Jericho Drive in, Jericho :The Jericho drive-in is the smallest public drive- in located in Australia, and possibly the world, with a capacity for 36 cars. It was opened in 1969. Movies are screened once a month. * Rodeo Drive In Mareeba, Mareeba :The Mareeba Rodeo drive-in was built by Far Northern Theatres in the 1960s. Far Northern Theatres had a circuit that extended right through far northern Queensland and into Papua New Guinea. The circuit was sold to Birch Carrol & Coyle in the 1970s. In the mid-1980s, Birch Carrol & Coyle pulled out and the Rodeo was sold to Norm Janke. Janke operated the drive-in until 1998 when it closed. It subsequently re-opened in 2002, with a 300 car capacity. =Western Australia= The first conventional drive-in located in Western Australia was the Highway, opened in the Perth suburb of Bentley on 24 October 1955,Banks, Ron.(1987) Brief history of drive-in theatres Western mail, 19 Sept 1987, p. 38,Bowley, Michelle(1988) Drive-in theatres in WA.Media information - Australia, Feb 1988, p. 12-16, with the screening of Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth. The Highway, owned and operated by John Pye (who founded the Ace entertainment and hospitality group), was located on a former dairy farm, fronting Albany Highway. It featured a high by wide screen on concrete footings, with a 642 car capacity, children's playground, mini golf course, cafeteria and approximately 30 staff. The resultant success of the Highway started a boom in suburban drive-ins which saw a further eight operating by the end of the decade (the Skyline in Floreat in November 1955, Mott's in Gosnells in January 1956, the Panorama in Roleystone in March 1956, the Metro in Innaloo, the Lakeway in Swanbourne in April 1957, the Melway in Melville, the Wirrina in Morley in March 1959 and the Eastway in Belmont in July 1959), with another nine sites opening in the 1960s (including the Starline in Hilton). The growth of Perth's suburban drive-ins then slowed to only five more built during the 1970s with the last drive-in theatre, Aceway, in the suburb of Morley, constructed in 1980.Yelland, R. A.

Records from Consolidated Theatres Pty Ltd and related organisations in the film exhibition industry, especially drive-in cinemas in Western Australia. The records include items from Consolidated Theatres, Greater X-Tone Amusements, National Theatre Supply Company, Metropolitan Cinemas, West Australian Motion Pictures Exhibitors Association, Great Northern, City, Twin City, Carnarvon, Pingelly, Carnamah and Laverton Drive-ins. In the country areas, the first to open was the Oasis in Geraldton in 1957, and there were only three more built in the 1950s; the Mayfair in Bunbury, the Avonway in Northam and the Morcady in Wongan Hills. The boom years in the country were the sixties, which saw 61 drive-ins opened, with growth then slowing to only six more built in the seventies and one in the eighties.Perth's drive-in theatres closing due to competition from videos Daily news, 15 July 1988, p. 14, By the 1990s there were only three suburban drive-ins that remained, but then the Metro (a twin screen site as of 1984) in Innaloo closed in 1993 followed by the Highway (a twin screen site as of 1986) in Bentley which closed on 19 June 1994; only the Galaxy (established 1 November 1973) in Kingsley remains open within the Perth surrounds. There are however a few drive-in theatres and car-friendly outdoor cinemas still operating in rural Western Australia. The Dongara Drive-in, built in 1966 and opened in January 1967, has been in continual operation since this time. After a storm in 2008 the screen was replaced and the original projector upgraded. In 2015 the projector was upgraded to digital. The drive-in can accommodate 200 cars, whilst it only operates in summer it is the longest continually running drive-in in Western Australia. The Koorda Community Drive-in opened in October 1965; it closed in 1983 but reopened in 1987. It has a capacity of 110 cars, has been updated to digital, and screens monthly. =South Australia= The Blue-Line drive-in located in West Beach, Adelaide was the first drive-in located in South Australia, and the first to be constructed outside of Melbourne. It was opened on 28 December 1954, it was followed by the Mainline Drive-In theatre at Gepps Cross on 7 October 1955, which was Australia's first drive-in / walk-in theatre (with a capacity for 500 cars and seating for 400 patrons). It was followed by the Shandon in Seaton in early July 1956, the Hi- Line in Panorama in March 1957, and the MGM Metro at Marion in June 1957. The first country drive-in opened at Port Pirie in September 1957. Following the closure of the Valleyline at Modbury in May 2003 left only the Wallis Mainline Drive-in at Gepps Cross as the only remaining drive-in located in metropolitan Adelaide. It still exists as at March 2020 and has had a boost in patronage during the coronavirus pandemic. In the country areas, the closing of Riverview at Murray Bridge in February 2005 (after 46 years) and the Riverland in Barmera in September 2008, only the community run facility at Coober Pedy, the Coober Pedy Open Air Outback Cinema, remains. Over the years, the list of drive-in's in metropolitan Adelaide included: * Ocean Line Drive-In Theatre - Dyson Rd, Christie Downs * Star Line Drive In Elizabeth - Main North Rd, Hillbank * Mainline Drive-In Theatre - Gawler Rd, Gepps Cross * Star Line Drive In Gilles Plains - Blacks Rd, Gilles Plains * Star Line Drive In Hectorville - Glynburn Rd, Hectorville * Metro Drive-In Theatre Marion - Oaklands Rd, Marion * Park Line Drive-In Theatre - Marion Rd, Mitchell Park * Valley Line Drive-In Theatre - Tolley Rd, Modbury * Star Line Drive In O'Halloran Hill - Majors Rd, Darlington * Harbour Line Drive-In Theatre - Victoria Rd, Osborne * Hi-Line Drive-In Theatre - Goodwood Rd, Panorama * Hollywood Drive-In Theatre - Winzor St, Salisbury Downs * Star Line Drive In Seaton - Tapleys Hill Rd, Seaton * Blue Line Drive In Theatres - Military Rd, West Beach * Star Line Drive In Woodville North - Grand Junction Rd, Mansfield Park =Northern Territory= Darwin was home to the Paspalis (Nightcliff) Drive-in Theatre, the largest privately owned drive-in located in Australia, which was opened in 1965 and closed in 1985. The Alice Springs Star line Drive-in operated from 1975 to 1990 closing when The Alice Springs Cinema opened in 1989. * None still open, although Darwin's Deckchair Cinema provides seats in an outdoor setting. =Tasmania= Tasmania previously had drive-in theatres at Glenorchy and Warrane in Hobart, and in Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. The last of Tasmania's drive-in theatres at Elwick and Mowbray closed in March 1985. * None still open =Australian Capital Territory= Former Starlight drive-in sign, first neon sign in Canberra and the only drive-in sign in Australia that is still in its original location. The ACT had two drive-in theatres, the Starlight in Watson (opened in January 1957 and closed in 1993), which has now been redeveloped for medium-density housing, and the Sundown at Narrabundah (opened in 1968 and closed in 1984), which is now a motel and private housing village. The ACT has a one drive-in theatre Southern Cross Drive-In, which opened on 2 February 2018.

Quasi- peak detectors for specific purposes have usually been standardized with mathematically precisely defined dynamic characteristics of attack time, integration time, and decay time or fall-back time. Quasi-peak detectors play an important role in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing of electronic equipment, where allowed levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio frequency interference (RFI), are given with reference to measurement by a specified quasi-peak detector. This was originally done because the quasi-peak detector was believed to better indicate the subjective annoyance level experienced by a listener hearing impulsive interference to an AM radio station. Over time standards incorporating quasi-peak detectors as the measurement device were extended to frequencies up to 1 GHz, although there may not be any justification beyond previous practice for using the quasi-peak detector to measure interference to signals other than AM radio. The quasi-peak detector parameters to be used for EMC testing vary with frequency . Both CISPR and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limit EMI at frequencies above 1 GHz with reference to an average-power detector, rather than quasi-peak detector. Conceptually, a quasi-peak detector for EMC testing works like a peak detector followed by a lossy integrator. A voltage impulse entering a narrow-band receiver produces a short-duration burst oscillating at the receiver centre frequency. The peak detector is a rectifier followed by a low-pass filter to extract a baseband signal consisting of the slowly (relative to the receiver centre frequency) time- varying amplitude of the impulsive oscillation. The following lossy integrator has a rapid rise time and longer fall time, so the measured output for a sequence of impulses is higher when the pulse repetition rate is higher. The quasi-peak detector is calibrated to produce the same output level as a peak- power detector when the input is a continuous wave tone . The CISPR quasi-peak detector is used in EMC testing and is defined in Publication 16 of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The CISPR quasi-peak detector applied to most conducted emissions measurements (0.15 - 30 MHz) is a detector with an attack time of 1 ms, a decay time of 160 ms and an IF filter setting of 9 kHz. The quasi-peak detector applied to most radiated emissions measurements (30 - 1000 MHz) has an attack time of 1 ms, a decay time 550 ms and an IF filter bandwidth of 120 kHz. In audio quality measurement, quasi- peak rectifiers are specified in several standards. For example ITU-R 468 noise weighting uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging time constants. The PPM or peak programme meter used to measure programme levels is actually a quasi-peak reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. Flutter measurement also involves a standardised quasi-peak reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief that we do not perceive them, and weighting those of intermediate duration according to audibility.

After completing his doctoral studies, he returned to Calvin to teach history and political science in 1946. In 1956, after becoming president of the college, Spoelhof was responsible for the initiation of the school's move to its current Knollcrest campus. The move was not completed until 1973. Toward the end of the 1960s Spoelhof also had to deal with the impact of nationwide student protest movements on the Calvin campus. In 1935 Spoelhof married Angeline Nydam, and they had three children. The asteroid 129099 Spoelhof is named in his honour. Spoelhof died on December 3, 2008 just five days shy of his 99th birthday.

A sibling organisation of the same name exists in New Zealand. History The Ulysses Club was formed for motorcyclists aged 40 years and older at the instigation of Stephen Dearnley in Sydney, Australia in December 1983 in reply to a letter in the now defunct Bike Australia magazine, the editor being Peter \\"The Bear\\" Thoeming. The name Ulysses Club was the idea of Rob Hall, while the club's motto of \\"Grow Old Disgracefully\\" was devised by his then-girlfriend Pat Lynch. Peter \\"The Bear\\" Thoeming sketched the \\"old man\\" logo that is still used by the club in its original hand-sketched form. The inaugural meeting of the club was held in Sydney on 6 December 1983 when the five people present approved a draft constitution and the Ulysses Club was duly formed. From this meeting a draft constitution was adopted, and the three basic principles or purposes of the club were formulated. These principles are: # To provide ways in which older motorcyclists can get together for companionship and mutual support; # To show by example that motor cycling can be an enjoyable and practical activity for riders of all ages; # To draw the attention of public and private institutions to the needs and views of older riders. These original purposes are entrenched in the club's constitutions and have remained unchanged. At that initial meeting the five founding members became an interim management committee, until two months later, on 7 February 1984, 11 of the club's total membership of 25 members attended the club's first annual general meeting, formally electing the very first National Committee and adopting the club's constitution.(1) - from the Ulysses members handbook. The name comes from Ulysses by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. It tells how the great Greek hero Ulysses, now middle-aged and securely in charge of his kingdom of Ithaca, is getting bored with things around him and longs to go adventuring again with his shipmates of old. It describes very well indeed the sort of person who still has enough spark to go on riding into middle and later years. It is the largest organisation of its kind with over 138 branches in Australia and it now has branches in Germany, Vietnam (2008), South Africa (1997), Norwayhttp://www.ulyssesclub.no/, Zimbabwe, the Netherlands, Switzerlandhttp://www.ulysses-club.ch/, Francehttp://ulysses- club.fr/index.php/en/, Great Britainhttp://ulyssesclubgb.org/ and Cuba, with external members of the Australian club in Italy, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Fiji, China, Austria, Thailand and the United States. Membership of the club is open to any person, subject to National Committee approval, who has attained the age of 40 years and who holds a current motorcycle licence. Additionally, the spouse or regular companion of a member, who has attained the age of 40 years, may also be admitted as a member on application. Membership now stands around 16,000. New Zealand A number of New Zealanders joined the Ulysses Club in the 1980s, creating an informal \\"New Zealand branch\\" with about 100 members, but the cost of administering members across the Tasman and sending them the newsletter cost the club more than the membership fees, so in 1988 the Secretary Pete Reynolds visited members in Hawkes Bay and Invercargill and encouraged them to form a New Zealand organisation. By the end of 1988, the New Zealand Ulysses Club has a membership of 360. By early 2013, the club had 3000 current members in 29 branches.  Annual general meeting  The club's annual general meeting (AGM) is held each year between 1 January and 30 June. The purpose of the AGM is to affirm minutes of the previous meeting, receive reports, consider the financial statements for the year ending 31 December previous and to elect office bearers.  Ulysses Club National Rally  Each year the Ulysses Club National Rally is held in a different location throughout Australia. The locations of the Ulysses Club National Rally are chosen by the National Committee and ratified by the Extended NatCom meeting, usually three years prior to the event being held. The Ulysses Club National Rally event has formal fixtures running for four days of the event, namely the Road Safety Forum on the Thursday, the Extended NatCom meeting held on the Friday, the Grand Parade and Opening / Civic Ceremony on the Saturday morning and the AGM itself on the Saturday afternoon. These are followed by the Saturday night dinner and the Sunday morning church service, and finally the closing ceremony after the church service. Additional to these fixtures, trade displays, bike test rides, organised rides, and social gatherings have been included in past events by the host committee, starting as early as the Monday preceding the actual meeting weekend, for the benefit and entertainment of visiting members. In 2009 the Annual General Meeting was held in Penrith, New South Wales and attracted some 3,500 members to the city. Albany, Western Australia was the scene of the 2010 Annual General Meeting and club members camped at Centennial Oval for the week of the event. Approximately 3200 members attended the event. The 2011 annual general meeting was held in Newcastle, New South Wales with about 3,000 members participating in the parade through town prior to the meeting commencing. In 2012 Mildura was selected as the venue for the event with approximately 4,000 members attending and contributing between 5 to 10 million to the local economy.

The teams were: *(1) Atlanta Braves (Eastern Division champion, 101‚Äì61) vs. (3) Chicago Cubs (Central Division champion, 88‚Äì74): Cubs win series, 3‚Äì2. *(2) San Francisco Giants (Western Division champion, 100‚Äì61) vs. (4) Florida Marlins (Wild Card, 91‚Äì71): Marlins win series, 3‚Äì1.The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage (Games 1, 2 and 5 at home), which was determined by playing record. Although the team with the best record was normally intended to play the wild card team, the Braves played the Cubs, rather than the wild card Marlins, because the Braves and Marlins are in the same division. The Cubs and Marlins went on to meet in the NL Championship Series, for the right to advance to the 2003 World Series against the American League champion New York Yankees. Matchups =Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs= =San Francisco Giants vs. Florida Marlins= Atlanta vs. Chicago =Game 1= Turner Field in Atlanta In Game 1, Kerry Wood of Chicago faced Russ Ortiz of Atlanta. Both pitchers were on their game and in the bottom of the third the Braves struck first when Marcus Giles's home run put them up 1‚Äì0. The score remained that way until the top of the sixth, when the Cubs loaded the bases with three consecutive leadoff singles. However, Ortiz got the next two outs, with the last being an RBI groundout by Paul Bako. Wood doubled in two runs, then scored on Kenny Lofton's single to make it 4‚Äì1 Cubs. The Braves loaded the bases in the eighth off Wood on a strike-three wild pitch and two walks, but scored only one run on Chipper Jones's forceout off Mike Remlinger. Kyle Farnsworth stranded the bases loaded while Joe Borowski pitched a scoreless ninth to give the Cubs a series lead. Combined, the Cubs bullpen allowed only one hit, a ninth-inning single by Vinny Castilla. This was the Cubs' first road postseason victory since Game 3 of the 1945 World Series =Game 2= Turner Field in Atlanta In Game 2, Carlos Zambrano of the Cubs faced Mike Hampton of the Braves. Hampton ran into trouble in the first when two leadoff walks put two men on for Sammy Sosa, who doubled in the first run of the game, then Mois√©s Alou brought in a run on a fielder's choice. After Aramis Ram√≠rez singled to load the bases, Hampton recovered to strikeout six consecutive batters. Hampton struck out Eric Karros, Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez and Damian Miller to end the first. He then struck out Carlos Zambrano, Kenny Lofton and Mark Grudzielanek in the second. Sosa led off the third with a single to end the streak. Hampton's six consecutive strikeouts set a Division Series record and tied an overall postseason record held by three other pitchers: Todd Worrell in 1985, Moe Drabowski in 1966 and Hod Eller in 1919. The Braves cut the lead in half when Chipper Jones forced Mark DeRosa out at second, allowing Rafael Furcal to score in the bottom half of the first. Then Andruw Jones's RBI single tied the game in the fourth. In the bottom of the sixth, Marcus Giles would give the Braves the lead with an RBI single to left field. A sacrifice fly by Tom Goodwin off John Smoltz tied the game in the eighth. However, Mark DeRosa's clutch two-out, two-run double off Dave Veres in the bottom half put the Braves ahead 5‚Äì3 and Smoltz finished it with a perfect ninth. =Game 3= Wrigley Field in Chicago In Game 3, Greg Maddux faced Mark Prior. In the bottom of the first, the Cubs put two runs on the board thanks to Randall Simon's two-run single, but neither team could score off Maddux or Prior again until the eighth inning. A sacrifice fly by Marcus Giles cut the lead in half after Mark DeRosa doubled and moved to third on a ground out, but Aramis Ram√≠rez gave Prior insurance with an RBI double after a one-out single in the bottom of the eighth off Kevin Gryboski. Prior pitched a complete-game, two- hit masterpiece. Game 3 was Maddux's final game with the Braves after 11 seasons, as he returned to the Cubs as a free agent in 2004. =Game 4= Wrigley Field in Chicago In Game 4, Russ Ortiz faced Matt Clement, hoping to end the series. Both pitchers held off the opposition until the Cubs broke through in the bottom of the third. Mois√©s Alou would double in Sammy Sosa, who walked with two outs, to give the Cubs a 1‚Äì0 lead. However, Darren Bragg's forceout allowed Julio Franco to score to tie the game in the top of the fourth. Then Chipper Jones's two-run home run gave the Braves a 3‚Äì1 lead in the fifth. After a two-out walk and single, Vinny Castilla added another run with an RBI single to make it 4‚Äì1 Braves. Eric Karros's home run in the sixth cut their lead to 4‚Äì2, but Chipper Jones's second two-run home run off Mark Guthrie made it 6‚Äì2 Braves in the eighth. Karros's second home run of the game in the bottom of the inning off Will Cunnane made it 6‚Äì3 Braves, then back-to- back leadoff doubles by Randall Simon and Damian Miller off John Smoltz in the ninth made it 6‚Äì4, but Smoltz retired the next three hitters with the final out being a long fly ball to center field off the bat of Sosa to end the game and send the series back to Atlanta. =Game 5= Turner Field in Atlanta In Game 5, Kerry Wood this time faced Mike Hampton. Hampton once again gave up early runs when the Cubs took a 1‚Äì0 lead in the first with a Mois√©s Alou RBI single. Then Alex S. Gonzalez's leadoff home run next inning gave the Cubs a 2‚Äì0 lead. Aramis Ram√≠rez's two-run home run silenced the crowd in the sixth and made it 4‚Äì0 Chicago. An RBI forceout by Gary Sheffield gave the Braves their only run of the night in the sixth, but the Cubs would add a run in the ninth off Will Cunnane thanks to an errant throw to first by Vinny Castilla on a ground ball by Eric Karros, who scored on Tom Goodwin's double, to take a commanding 5‚Äì1 lead. Joe Borowski sent down the Braves 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 in the ninth and the Cubs' win in Game 5 gave the Cubs their first postseason series win since the 1908 World Series. =Composite box= 2003 NLDS (3‚Äì2): Chicago Cubs over Atlanta Braves San Francisco vs. Florida The Florida Marlins completed their second winning season in franchise history. The San Francisco Giants were the defending NL Champions and making their second straight postseason appearance. =Game 1= Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco In Game 1, Josh Beckett faced Jason Schmidt and a classic pitcher's duel began. The game remained scoreless until the bottom of the fourth. Two walks to lead off spelled doom for Beckett, as an error by Miguel Cabrera on Edgardo Alfonzo's single allowed a run to score to make it 1‚Äì0 Giants. Both pitchers kept the game close and Beckett allowed only two hits (a Ray Durham single to lead off the first). Schmidt allowed only three hits for a complete game win. Alfonzo brought in the game's other run on an RBI double in the eighth off Chad Fox after Barry Bonds was intentionally walked with two outs. =Game 2= Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco In Game 2, Brad Penny faced Sidney Ponson. The game would feature six pitching changes for each team as both starters would last less than half the game. An RBI groundout in the top of the first by Derrek Lee after two leadoff singes and a wild pitch gave the Marlins their first lead in the series, but Barry Bonds tied the game with a two-out double after a leadoff single in the bottom half. The game then quieted until the bottom of the fourth when Edgardo Alfonzo doubled in two runs after a single and walk and then scored on Marquis Grissom's groundout. The Giants now had a 4‚Äì1 lead, but in the top of the fifth, after singles by Jeff Conine and Todd Hollandsworth, RBI singles by Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez and Juan Pierre as well as Luis Castillo's groundout tied the game. The Giants would recapture the lead with an RBI hit by J. T. Snow off Rick Helling in the bottom of the fifth. However, Juan Encarnaci√≥n's home run with one out off Joe Nathan tied the game in the sixth. The Marlins then loaded the bases on three singles before Pierre's go- ahead two-run double off Jason Christiansen made it 7‚Äì5 Marlins. Next inning, the Marlins loaded the bases on a single, Snow's error, and walk before Jeff Conine's groundout made it 8‚Äì5 Marlins. In the ninth, center fielder Marquis Grissom's error on Lee's fly ball with two on allowed another run to score off Jim Brower. The Marlins' 9‚Äì5 tied the series heading to Florida. =Game 3= Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida In Game 3, Kirk Rueter faced Mark Redman. Eventual NLCS MVP Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez got the scoring started with a two- run home run in the bottom of the first. The game quieted down with Redman and Rueter dueling until the sixth. The Giants tied the game on a bases-loaded forceout by Jos√© Cruz followed by a pinch-hit RBI single by Pedro Feliz. The game moved to extra innings and the Giants took the lead in the eleventh thanks to an error by √Ålex Gonz√°lez, allowing a run to score on Edgardo Alfonzo's single off Braden Looper. The Marlins would strike back in the bottom half off Tim Worrell: an error by Cruz, San Francisco's Gold Glove right fielder, and a walk put two men on with nobody out. A sacrifice bunt moved the runners over, and the Giants would counter by intentionally walking Juan Pierre to load the bases and set up a force out. It would work initially as Worrell was able to field Luis Castillo's grounder and get the out at the plate, but Rodr√≠guez would hit a two-strike single to right field, scoring both Gonz√°lez and Pierre to win the game. =Game 4= Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida In Game 4, Jerome Williams faced Dontrelle Willis. In the top of the second, a sacrifice fly by Yorvit Torrealba put the Giants out in front 1‚Äì0. However, Rich Aurilia's error on Jeff Conine's ground ball allowed Miguel Cabrera, who doubled to lead off, to score to tie the game in the bottom half. After Luis Castillo walked, a double by Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez gave the Marlins the lead in the third. Then Derrek Lee singled home Rodriguez to make it 3‚Äì1. That marked the end of the day for Williams. In the fourth, the Marlins took a commanding 5‚Äì1 lead on Cabrera's bases-loaded two-run single, but Willis ran into trouble in the top of the sixth. After two leadoff singles, Rich Aurilia's RBI double made it 5‚Äì2 Marlins. Then Barry Bonds's sacrifice fly made it 5‚Äì3. Edgardo Alfonzo doubled in a run to make it a one- run game. Willis was finished as well and Brad Penny came on in relief. He got the second out, but relinquished the lead when J. T. Snow singled home Alfonzo to tie the game. Both bullpens would keep the game quiet until the bottom of the eighth. F√©lix Rodr√≠guez came on in relief for the Giants and after two quick outs, allowed a base hit and hit a batter to put two men on for Cabrera, who singled in two runs aided an error by the Giants. They now had a 7‚Äì5 lead going into the ninth. With Ugueth Urbina coming on to close, the Giants put together a quick rally. A leadoff double and a base hit by Snow made it 7‚Äì6. Then Urbina got the next two outs. But Urbina hit a batter to put Snow in scoring position. Then, Snow tried to score on a single to left. Jeff Conine's throw was on target, and Rodriguez tagged Snow at the plate as Snow barreled into him. Rodriguez fell backwards and, as he rose, showed that he held on to the ball, preserving the Marlins win. The Marlins won the series three games to one. For the first time in postseason history, a series ended with the potential tying run thrown out at the plate, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. =Composite box= 2003 NLDS (3‚Äì1): Florida Marlins over San Francisco Giants Notes External links *CHC vs. ATL at Baseball- Reference *FLA vs. SFG at Baseball-Reference Category:National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:Florida Marlins postseason Category:Chicago Cubs postseason Category:San Francisco Giants postseason Category:Atlanta Braves postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:2003 in Atlanta Category:2000s in Chicago Category:2003 in Illinois National League Division Series National League Division Series ","title":"2003 National League Division Series"},{"id":"4823048","text":"Melmerby is a village and civil parish in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire, England, that lies north of Ripon and west of the A1(M) motorway. The population was 386 in the 2011 census. Etymology The name is of Old Norse origin and means a sandy settlement (malmr \\"sandy field\\" and b√Ω \\"farmstead or village\\"). The form of the name has been influenced by Melmerby in Coverdale, west, which has a different origin. Many of the fields in the area have Norse names too, e.g. Halikeld, where 'keld' is an Old Norse word for 'spring'. History Melmerby was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was historically a manor and chapelry in the parish of Wath in the North Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in 1866.Vision of Britain website Until the late 1950s, the village was the site of a major rural railway junction that was situated on the main Harrogate to Northallerton via Ripon railway line (closed 1968). A branch line ran westwards from Melmerby to the small market town of Masham, which is famous for its brewing. This line stopped carrying passengers in 1930 and closed completely in 1963. Another line (closed 1959) also ran north-eastwards linking Melmerby with the East Coast Main Line at Thirsk. During the war the village was the site of a large munitions store, taking advantage of the railway access. The parish now shares a grouped parish council, Melmerby and Middleton Quernhow Parish Council, with the neighbouring parish of Middleton Quernhow. The village has a pub, The George and Dragon Inn, a cricket team, the Wath & Melmerby Cricket Club, who play in the Nidderdale League and the village also stages an annual road race which has been held since 1984.

It features Toxie, the lead character of the films leading a group of misfit superheroes who combat pollution. This followed a trend of environmentally considerate cartoons and comics of the time, including Captain Planet and the Planeteers, Swamp Thing, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures. As this incarnation was aimed at children, Toxic Crusaders is considerably tamer than the edgy films it was based on (although it nevertheless contained many adult-oriented jokes that would go over most children's heads). Thirteen episodes were produced and aired, with at least a few episodes airing as a \\"trial run\\" in Summer 1990Kahn, Eve M. \\"Television; Cartoons for a Small Planet\\" The New York Times (March 3, 1991). followed by the official debut on January 21, 1991.Toxic Avenger Issue #1, Marvel Comics, \\"Toxic Times\\" letters page; photo here. It aired on YTV 1991 to 1997 in Canada. The US cable network G4 aired the first two episodes on July 25, 2009. Overview Prior to Toxic Crusaders, cartoons based on R-rated (under-17s must be accompanied) films had indeed been attempted with programs like Rambo: The Force of Freedom. However, the content of the Toxic Avenger films was arguably more controversial than many such films, featuring strong sexual content in addition to intense violence. Created by New York-based Troma, Inc., a company famous for such low-budget classic films as Chopper Chicks in Zombietown, Class of Nuke 'Em High, and Sgt. Kabukiman, NYPD, the animated Toxic Crusaders departed significantly from its live-action source. The Toxic Avenger film series starred Melvin Junko, a scrawny nerd who, through exposure to toxic waste, was mutated into a \\"hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength.\\" In the films, \\"Toxie\\" took his revenge on industrial America by means of gory violence and bloodbaths. True to Troma's reputation, other R-rated material abounded as well. Only thirteen syndicated episodes of Toxic Crusaders were produced, but like the feature films, the episodes became cult favorites, spawning a string of merchandising. Plot Toxic Crusaders cleaned up Toxie's act considerably. Toxie was still a grotesque mutant endowed with superhuman powers, but underneath it all, he was a good-hearted, law-abiding citizen of the fictional town of Tromaville, New Jersey (the setting of most of Troma Entertainment's films). Another change from the films was that the toxic waste also mutated his mop into a sentient being that would sometimes battle enemies by itself or motion to Toxie ideas on how to solve problems. The villains were still polluters, albeit polluters from a different world. Hailing from the planet Smogula, Czar Zosta, Dr. Killemoff, and Psycho wreaked ecological havoc with the help of Tromaville's corrupt Mayor Grody. Bonehead, a street punk who bullied Melvin, joins them in the first episode. Dr. Killemoff and Czar Zosta were cockroach-like extraterrestrials from the planet Smogula, which is a world where pollution is natural as fresh air and water is natural to Earth. Natives of Smogula thrive on pollution and need it to survive. For unexplained reasons, Czar Zosta and other Smogulans were able to withstand Earth's atmosphere without problems while Dr. Killemoff wears a breathing apparatus to survive. Dr. Killemoff, like most villains, also had a seemingly endless army of foot soldiers called Radiation Rangers. Other villains and heroes made their appearances on the show with equally ridiculous origins as the Crusaders. Few if any of these characters made more than one appearance.  Characters  = Toxic Crusaders = * Toxie (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) ‚Äì The main protagonist of the series. Melvin Junko is a wimpy janitor at a health club who was often picked on by Bonehead and his friends. When Bonehead and his friends played a trick on Melvin which involved him wearing a tutu and unknowingly kissing a sheep, Melvin ran in embarrassment and ended up falling into a drum filled with toxic waste that turned him into a creature of superhuman size and strength. Toxie's weapon of choice was a superpowered mop (named quite appropriately Mop) which had a mind of its own as it was also exposed to the toxic chemicals. * No-Zone (voiced by Paul Eiding) ‚Äì No-Zone was originally a test pilot who flew through a hole in the ozone layer and crashed into a silo of radioactive pepper. He gained the appearance of a blue- skinned humanoid with a wheel for a right foot and powerful sneezes emitted from his enormous nose. * Major Disaster (voiced by Ed Gilbert) ‚Äì Major Disaster was originally a military soldier who gained the ability to control plants after falling into a radioactive swamp. * Headbanger ‚Äì A fusion of two opposing personalities into a two-headed body made up of Dr. Bender (voiced by Hal Rayle) the cantankerous mad scientist for the right half and Fender (voiced by John Mariano) the surfer-like singing telegram boy for the left half. The Fender part was responsible for the accident where they fell into the atom-smasher and got joined into one body. Bender mutated into a green creature akin to Toxie, but Fender retained his human appearance. Headbanger originally worked with Dr. Killemoff when it came to his plot to put chemicals in the food at a fast food restaurant, but defected to Toxie's side after seeing that girls preferred the Toxic Crusaders. * Junkyard (voiced by Gregg Berger) ‚Äì Junkyard was originally a junkyard dog and a homeless man who took shelter in Junkyard's kennel which was covered in toxic waste when lightning struck it and merged them together into one humanoid dog. He joined up with the Toxic Crusaders upon helping them fight Dr. Killemoff's forces at the time when Dr. Killemoff disguised City Island as a resort. = Villains = * Czar Zosta (voiced by Patric Zimmerman) ‚Äì One of the primary antagonists of the series and the ruler of Smogula. Czar Zosta is a small bug-like Smogulan who is Dr. Killemoff's boss. * Dr. Killemoff (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) ‚Äì One of the primary antagonists of the series. He comes from the planet Smogula. Dr. Killemoff wears a breathing apparatus (which resembled a mask giving him a somewhat human appearance) in order to survive on non-polluted worlds. Two recurring gags involving Killemoff are that he always corrects someone when they only refer to him as Killemoff by shouting \\"That's DR. Killemoff\\" and that he never listens to Psycho's predictions despite the fact that they could help him succeed. * Psycho (voiced by Michael J. Pollard) ‚Äì An obese bio- mechanical being that had an uncanny ability to guess the future which was a key point in the TV show where his guesses would end up as the spoiler to how Dr. Killemoff's plans would fail. * Bonehead (voiced by Hal Rayle) ‚Äì Bonehead was a bullying Earth punk who embarrassed Melvin in front of girls. He later attempts to fight Toxie when he finds Bonehead and his friends harassing Yvonne. In self-defense, Toxie throws him into a barrel of acid rain in the first episode resulting in his near-skeletal appearance. Bonehead then joins forces with Dr. Killemoff. He was mostly brainless and incompetent. He is based on Bozo from the first movie. * Mayor Max Grody (voiced by Chuck McCann) ‚Äì The corrupt Mayor of Tromaville who is allied with the Smogulans. He is based on Mayor Peter Belgoody from the first movie. ** Mona (voiced by Susan Blu) ‚Äì Mayor Grody's secretary. * Polluto ‚Äì A living oil slick monster created by Dr. Killemoff. Toxie managed to destroy Polluto in \\"The Maxing of Toxie\\" by having No-Zone sneeze a pile of cat litter on Polluto which caused it to explode. In \\"Club Fred,\\" Polluto was recreated and unleashed on the Toxic Crusaders. The Toxic Crusaders threw large antacid pills which caused Polluto to dissolve. * General GarBage ‚Äì A Smogulan general who appeared in \\"Invasion of the Biddy Snatchers.\\" He was called in by Czar Zostas to replace Dr. Killemoff. His plot involved having his infiltrators taking over the elderly citizens of Tromaville by biting them and becoming a four-armed clone of the elderly citizens. This plan went into action with some of the victims being Mrs. Junko and Mayor Grody's mother. When Dr. Killemoff is surprised that General GarBage's plan is actually working, he states to Psycho and Bonehead that they will be out of a job resulting in Dr. Killemoff having to call the Toxic Crusaders for help. With help from Toxie's mom and the other elderly citizens, the Toxic Crusaders ended up defeating the clones with the elderly citizens using their hair spray to regress the clones back to normal form. General GarBage then appeared and unleashed the Radiation Rangers on the Toxic Crusaders. Under the idea of his mop, Toxie uses the hair spray to shrink General GarBage causing him to retreat back to Smogula. * Radiation Rangers ‚Äì A bunch of hunched-over mutants in yellow hazmat suits and intimidating gas masks that serve as Dr. Killemoff's foot soldiers. = Other characters = * Blobbie ‚Äì Toxie's pet which resembles a little blob of goo. Toxie first met Blobbie when he first arrived in the toxic waste dump * Yvonne (voiced by Kath Soucie in a Bronx accent) ‚Äì Toxie's buxom blonde girlfriend. Yvonne is often playing the accordion and singing soprano so high that it would break things, but Toxie is too polite to criticize her about it. One time the show literally broke the fourth wall in the form of Yvonne's singing causing the viewer's TV to break (in the form of animated broken glass), and Toxie apologizing to the viewer and saying the Toxic Crusaders will come by to buy them new TV sets. She is based on Toxie's blind girlfriend Sarah from the movies, yet Yvonne is nearsighted. * Mrs. Junko (voiced by Susan Silo in a Brooklyn accent) ‚Äì Toxie's mother. * Lloyd ‚Äì A friend of the Toxic Crusaders. A joke about him in this series is that his wife and children also had the same full beard as he did. * Snailman ‚Äì Crash Shelby is a race car driver who careened off a bridge into a barge full of snails where the engine oil merged him with a snail. He once helped the Toxic Crusaders fight Dr. Killemoff and Czar Zosta. * Mower Man ‚Äì Mower Man was originally a gardener who took a nap in a garden shed that happened to contain leaking gardening chemicals, which exploded in the heat of the day and made him into a half-man, half gardening equipment hybrid or as he preferred: \\"A hideously deformed creature of superhuman shears and strength.\\" He once worked with Dr. Killemoff in a plot that involved Weed Monsters. After being fired for accidentally mowing the Weed Monsters, Mower Man was last seen applying for a job in the want ads to help Mayor Grody destroy incriminating evidence.

It had no regular writer. Each issue was written by such notables as Steve Gerber (issues #3 and #5), Ann Nocenti (issue #7), David Leach and Jeremy Banx (lead strip script and artwork) and David Michelinie (back up strip) (issue #8), Hilary Barta (issue #2), and Simon Furman (issues #1, 4, and 6). A four book mini series was written and drawn by David Leach & Jeremy Banx. The series was solicited and the first issue written and drawn before being canceled along with all of Marvel TV tie-in titles. One issue was a direct parody of Captain Planet and the Planeteers. Issue #8 was the only mainstream US comic book ever published to carry an 'Approved by the Comic Code Authority' stamp while at the same time featuring a man sat on a toilet defecating. In the UK, Fleetway published their own Toxic Crusaders comic book which would last for ten issues. Playmates Toys, the same company responsible for Ninja Turtles action figures, released a line of similarly styled Toxic Crusader figures in 1991. The majority of characters featured bright neon colors and glow-in-the-dark accessories. TV commercials for the figures used the tag line \\"They're gross, but they still get girls!\\" A total of nine characters as well as some rather unorthodox vehicles saw toy shelves. Similar to the Ninja Turtles' Retromutagen Ooze, Playmates also marketed a canister of slime labeled Toxie's Toxic Waste. A toy line principally conceived by Aaronian and the design team at Troma and Pangea Corporation, some of the toys came packed with \\"Toxic Tips,\\" which instructed kids how to make messes in their homes and otherwise muck up the environment. Other tie-in products included coloring books, junior novels, Halloween costumes, Colorforms, Topps trading cards, a board game, a card game, and puzzles. Video games of the same name were also produced by Bandai and Sega, which were released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis.Amazon.com: Toxic Crusaders Amazon.com. A Super NES version was planned by Bandai around at the same time with the NES and Game Boy versions but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. Several years later, Troma released two Toxic Crusaders DVDs. The first was Toxic Crusaders: The Movie which consisted of the first three episodes of the series spliced together to form one story. The second release, Toxic Crusaders: Volume 1, is a collection of the first four episodes. A box set, featuring all 13 episodes and all four Toxic Avenger movies, was released on April 29, 2008. Troma was in talks to make a live action version of Toxic Crusaders at New Line Cinema. In Lloyd Kaufman's first book, \\"All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger\\", he claims that New Line did not live up to their end of the contract and the film was not made. Kaufman has speculated that New Line bought the rights because they were in negotiations to make the sequels to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and wanted to use the Toxic Crusaders movie as leverage against the owners of the rights to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Troma sued New Line Cinema and was awarded an undisclosed amount in damages.

Special Adjudicator ex parte Ullah, also known as Do v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 26 on appeal from [2002] EWCA Civ 1856, was a legal case in the United Kingdom. This was a joint decision, meaning two cases were heard at the same time, so the case may be cited as either of the case titles. Decision This was a decision of the United Kingdom Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, composed of Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Steyn, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Carswell. The decision was made on Thursday 17th June 2004. The issue in the case was whether a person can be deported from the United Kingdom to a state where there are known human rights abuses, or refused asylum to the United Kingdom when the applicant is from such a state. The appellants in the cases, Mr Ullah and Miss Do, wished to rely on an Article of the European Convention on Human Rights other than Article 3 (no body shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment). The Appellants wished to rely on Article 9 of the Convention, guaranteeing the right to freedom, thought and conscience. At first instance and in the Court of Appeal the Appellants' submissions were rejected and it was held that deporting a person to a country which violated Article 9 would not amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, and thus an applicant could be deported to the state in violation of Article 9. Particular notice should be drawn to Paragraph 4-6 of the judgment of Lord Bingham. Here it is stated (using the judgment of the Court of Appeal, [2002] EWCA Civ 1856, as authority) that the Appellants, in order to rely on Article 9, would have to prove that the interference with Convention Rights was 'flagrant'. In the present case it was decided that the interference was not flagrant (see Paragraph 69-70 of the judgment by Lord Carswell for a brief discussion of the term 'flagrant'), which is why the appeal was dismissed in all courts. Lord Walker and Baroness Hale delivered concurring judgments. Constitutional significance As stated, Bingham's judgment is significant in establishing (as the \\"Ullah principle\\") conditions on the applicability of judgments from the European Court of Human Rights. Bingham states that Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 should be interpreted as stating that British courts \\"should, in the absence of some special circumstances, follow any clear and constant jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court\\".

What is usually referred to as St Cuthbert's coffin is a fragmentary oak coffin in Durham Cathedral, pieced together in the 20th century, which between AD 698 and 1827 contained the remains of Saint Cuthbert, who died in 687. In fact when Cuthbert's remains were yet again reburied in 1827 in a new coffin, some 6,000 pieces of up to four previous layers of coffin were left in the burial, and then finally removed in 1899. This coffin is thought to be Cuthbert's first wooden coffin, and probably to date to 698, when his remains were moved from a stone sarcophagus in the abbey church at Lindisfarne to the main altar.Wilson, 49‚Äì50; here for number of fragments The coffin is almost the only survival of what was no doubt a very large body of Anglo-Saxon wood carving, being inscribed or engraved with linear images which have tituli in Latin lettering and Anglo-Saxon runes with names of apostles and saints; many names are illegible. History The most recent resting place of Cuthbert's remains, in Durham Cathedral Cuthbert died on 20 March 687 in his hermit's cell on Inner Farne Island, two miles from Bamburgh, Northumberland, and was taken back to the main monastery at Lindisfarne to be buried. Eleven years later the coffin was re-opened, and according to his biographies (including prose and verse ones by Bede from about 720) his remains were found to be \\"incorrupt\\" or undecayed. This was a traditional attribute of sainthood and helped greatly in his subsequent cult. He was reburied in a new coffin, apparently over the original one, which is described in his biographies, and matches the surviving coffin closely; this is called a levis theca (\\"light chest\\" in Latin) in Bede's biography. This was placed above ground at the altar, and apparently covered with a linen cloth, an indication that Cuthbert was already regarded as a saint.Lexicon, 112‚Äì113; Bonner et al, xxi‚Äìxxii, and 105 In 875 the monks evacuated the abbey with the coffin, in anticipation of the Great Heathen Army moving into the area. For seven years they carried it with them to various places in modern Scotland and Northumbria before settling it in the still existing St Cuthbert's church in Chester-le-Street until 995, when another Danish invasion led to its removal to Ripon. It was at Chester- le-Street that King Athelstan visited it, and the textiles were placed inside.Brown, 28 Travelling once again, the cart with the coffin became stuck at Durham, which was taken as a sign that the saint wished to remain there. A new stone church‚Äîthe so-called 'White Church'‚Äîwas built, the predecessor of the present grand cathedral. The body was moved within the cathedral at various points; perhaps in 1041, in 1069 to escape the Harrying of the North by William the Conqueror, in 1104 when the Norman cathedral was constructed, and in 1541 when the medieval shrine which was one of the principal English pilgrimage sites was destroyed during the Reformation.Lexicon, 112‚Äì113; Bonner et al, xxi‚Äìxxii The coffin was opened at various times during this period: a mid-11th century priest named Alfred Westou was in the habit of often combing the hair of the saint, and is also traditionally considered to have been responsible for placing the purloined bones of Bede in the coffin.Brown, 28‚Äì29Crook, 1, 98‚Äì99 In 1827 the coffin was once again removed, having been found in a walled space at the site of the shrine. By then there were up to four layers of coffin in fragmentary condition, taken to date from 1541, 1041, 698 and 687, housing a complete skeleton, and other human remains, though many of the contents had been removed earlier. The textiles were removed in 1827. The human remains were reburied in a new coffin under a plain inscribed slab, with the remains of the old coffins, which were removed in yet another opening of the burial in 1899. These totalled some 6,000, of which 169 showed signs of having been carved or engraved. The art-historian Ernst Kitzinger, then with the British Museum, made a reconstruction of the carved oak sections in 1939, which has subsequently been slightly re-arranged.Cronyn & Horie, 247 The reconstructed coffin and most of the contents are on now view in the Cathedral Museum; the St Cuthbert Gospel has been often on display in London since the 1970s. The fragments of St Cuthbert's coffin have been exhibited at Durham Cathedral since 2017. Engraving and contents From the several thousand fragments collected in 1899 the art historian Ernst Kitzinger pieced together in 1939 a selection of 169 to make the fragmentary montages of the 7th century coffin now exhibited in the museum in Durham Cathedral, with engraved figures of Christimage surrounded by four Evangelists' symbols on the lid, on one end the earliest surviving iconic representation of the Virgin and Child outside Rome from the medieval art of the Western Church,As opposed to their inclusion in scenes of the Nativity or Adoration of the Magi. There is at least one Virgin and Child, with another figure, in the Catacombs of Rome. There is a group of icons in Roman churches, some of which are probably older. with the archangels Michael and Gabriel on the other. The sides show the Twelve Apostles and five archangels. The coffin also contained the Stonyhurst or Saint Cuthbert Gospel (now British Library) and the best surviving examples of Anglo-Saxon embroidery or opus Anglicanum, a stole and maniple which were probably added in the 930s, and given by King Athelstan.Wilson, 154‚Äì155; Brown, 28; see also the articles at pp. 303‚Äì366 in Bonner et al. Other probable possessions of Cuthbert found inside are an ivory comb, a portable altar, and a pectoral cross with gold and garnet cloisonn√©, a rare and important early example of Christian Anglo-Saxon jewellery.Wilson, 49‚Äì50, Image of pectoral cross Inscriptions The runic inscription reads: :ihs xps mat(t)[h](eus) The ma and possibly the eu are bind runes. The t is inverted. Then follows: :marcus The ma is again a bind rune, then: :LVCAS In Latin letters, followed by runic: :iohann(i)s Followed by Latin: :(RAPH)AEL (M)A(RIA) The names of Matthew, Mark and John are thus in runes, while that of Luke is in Latin letters. The Christogram is notably in runic writing, ihs xps ·õÅ·öª·õã ·õâ·õà·õã, with the h double-barred in the continental style, the first attestation of that variant in England. The monogram reflects a runic variant of a partly Latinized XPS from Greek ŒßŒ°ŒôœπŒ§Œüœπ, with the rho rendered as runic p and the eolc rune (the old Algiz rune z) used to render chi. It is difficult to account for the mixture of scripts, or find significance in which parts are in which script, but it can be said that such mixtures are not uncommon among inscriptions of the period from northern England, including the Franks Casket and stones from Lindisfarne and Monkwearmouth.Page, 264‚Äì265 Notes References * Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred the parish to Oxfordshire and from the former Wallingford Rural District to the new district of South Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 420. Manors The Domesday book of 1086 refers to Moretune. Its meaning is not entirely clear but four of the five manor houses are identifiable. Saunderville is still called The Manor. It is a moated manor house with horses grazing in the railed paddocks, seen to advantage from the railway. Huse or Bray is a recently renovated low building nearby, with a paddock in front, at the T-junction at the east end of the village. The only trace of Adresham is the terrace on which it once stood, opposite the village school. There is a 1950s house on the site. Fulscot is west of the village, and is still a farm. At the time of the South Moreton Inclosure Act, 1818 c.18,An Act for inclosing lands in the Parish of South Moreton in the County of Berks. 58 Geo III Cap. 18, Berkshire Record Office D/EX 1215/1 1818 the main landlord was Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham and many of the inclosures were allotted to him.South Moreton Inclosure Award and Map Later in the century a London butcher called Hedges used Rich's Sidings of the new Great Western Railway west by Didcot railway station, to supply much of the London meat trade. Hedges amassed a fortune and much local land, including the inclosures at Hall Farm and Fulscot Manor, both of which are still owned and farmed by his descendants. Churches The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist at Bethesda, with its possibly Saxon doorway, stands by ancient earthworks at the southwestern edge of the village, by a ford on the former pilgrim route from the Downs to Dorchester. The church holds services only on major feast days and a few other occasions. Weddings, funerals and baptisms are also held by arrangement. The parish is part of the Churn Benefice, along with the neighbouring parishes of North Moreton, Aston Tirrold, Aston Upthorpe, Blewbury, Hagbourne, and Upton. South Moreton has a Strict Baptist chapel which has three services a week. Character and amenities There are a few large old houses on the High Street, some newer cottages at the east of the village, modern social housing to the West, and some 17th-century cottages between, many thatched. The largest house in South Moreton is The Hall, very close to the Huse. It is the last working farm in the village. Much Victorian history of the village is recorded in The Rector's Book, handwritten around 1905 from memories extending to 1845. It now deposited in the Berkshire County Archives at Reading. Amenities South Moreton has a school but no shop or village hall. Both Moreton Cricket Club and the North & South Moreton Women's Institute are both based in North Moreton. =School= Gothic Revival Lodge (built 1825 as the previous village school) at the junction of the High Street with Church Lane (left) and Clement's Green (right) South Moreton School, 200 yards east of Gothic Lodge on the High Street, is a County Primary School.South Moreton School: primary school =Transport= Thames Travel route 94 provides a limited service to South Moreton from Mondays to Fridays, linking the village with Didcot town and with Didcot Parkway railway station. Buses run only during school terms, and there is no Saturday or Sunday service. The nearest railway station is . =Former pub= The Crown Inn is in High Street. It was closed for some years around 1990, but re-opened as the last pub to be rebuilt by Wadworth Brewery before the implementation of statutory limits on breweries owning public houses. It declined in the 2000s and ceased trading in 2011. It re-opened again on 21 September 2012 but ceased trading again in July 2016.

The Cup is named after William Webb Ellis, who is often credited as being the inventor of rugby football. The trophy is silver gilt and has been presented to the winner of the Rugby World Cup since the first competition in 1987. It has been won three times by New Zealand (1987, 2011 & 2015) and South Africa (1995, 2007 & 2019), twice by Australia (1991 & 1999), and once by England (2003). The 38-centimeter trophy weighs 4.5 kg, is gilded silver and has two cast scroll handles. One handle bears the head of a satyr, the other the head of a nymph. On the face of the trophy, the words International Rugby Football Board, and below that arch The Webb Ellis Cup are engraved. The Webb Ellis Cup is also referred to (incorrectly) as the \\"Webb Ellis Trophy\\" or colloquially as \\"Bill,\\" a nickname coined by the 1991 Rugby World Cup winners, the Wallabies. History The cup and cover by Paul de Lamerie inspired Carrington and Co to design the trophy. There are two official Webb Ellis Cups, which are used interchangeably. One is a 1906 trophy made by Carrington and Co. of London, featuring a Victorian design of a 1740s cup by Paul de Lamerie, while the other is a 1986 replica. John Kendall-Carpenter, former England forward and the organizer of the first Rugby World Cup, and Bob Weighill, the secretary of the International Rugby Board and also a former England forward, visited Garrard & Co, the crown jeweller in Regent Street, London. Director Richard Jarvis, brought the particular cup down from the vault and showed it to both of them. It was chosen for use in February 1987. Ronnie Dawson of Ireland, Keith Rowlands of Wales, Bob Stuart and Dick Littlejohn of New Zealand and the Australians Nick Shehadie and Ross Turnbull approved the choice of the trophy. The trophy is cared for and restored after each tournament by silversmiths Thomas Lyte.Thomas Lyte lifts Webb Ellis CupBBC Radio 4: Friday Boss - business presenter Simon Jack interviews Kevin Baker, chief executive, Thomas Lyte It was soon named \\"The Webb Ellis Cup\\". New Zealand became the first nation to win the Webb Ellis Cup when they won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The Webb Ellis Cup has been held by four nations; New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and England. The current holders are South Africa, after they beat England 32‚Äì12 in the 2019 Final in Japan. The trophy was on display in Newlands, South Africa until 2009, where it had stayed for two years following their victory in the 2007 tournament. Later, it was returned to the home of World Rugby, Ireland.

The arch over the main door has the most detailed Victorian carving in the city.

History In the early 1500s, Saint Wilfrid's was an advowson of the Benedictine Saint Mary's Abbey, York.Palliser, David Michael. The Reformation in York, 1534-1553, Borthwick Publications, 1971, p. 13 In 1585, the parish could not support itself; the church became redundant, had fallen into disuse, and was demolished.\\"Church of St Wilfrid\\", History of York It was eventually built over and the parish united with Saint Michael le Belfry. Saint Wilfrid's parish was revived by York Catholics in 1742 when they established their Mission in Little Blake Street. The Mission was founded by the Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District of England, Edward Dicconson. A Catholic priest's house was established at number 7 Little Blake Street (now Duncombe Place), known as Chapel House. In 1760, the first public place of worship for Catholics opened in York. The chapel continued until 1802 when another chapel was built on the opposite side of the street (on the present site). At this time there were still strong anti-Catholic feelings, so the chapel was hidden from the street by its presbytery. The chapel could hold 700 people and the Catholic population continued to increase in York. Present church A church dedicated to Saint Wilfrid has stood in York since medieval times. The original site of the church was on land now occupied by the Judges Lodgings in Lendal and part of the Assembly Rooms behind in Blake Street. In 1848, plans were drawn up to build a new church. The funds, however, were diverted to build a much needed church in the Walmgate area for the large number of Irish Catholics who settled there during the Potato Famine. Saint George's Church was built and it became the Pro-Cathedral of the Catholic diocese of Beverley. In 1859, York Corporation were planning a new approach road to Lendal Bridge. This prompted Dean Duncombe to apply to the corporation to continue the route by the chapel and towards the Minster. The old narrow lane (Lop Lane or Little Blake Street) was replaced with a wide thoroughfare. The houses on the opposite side to the chapel were demolished and the road widened to create Duncombe Place, named after the Dean. Saint Wilfrid's became the Pro-Cathedral Church of the Beverley Diocese. This was short lived as Beverley diocese was split to make the Dioceses of Leeds (south of the River Ouse) and of Middlesbrough (north of the river). Nevertheless, the Oratory Church of Saint Wilfrid still stands as the \\"Mother Church of the city of York\\". Architecture The Oratory Church, as it stands today, was to be built on the site of the old chapel. The architect of the building was George Goldie, son of a prominent parishioner Dr. George Goldie, and was baptised in Saint Wilfrid's chapel. He later designed Saint Wilfrid's Primary School nearby, but died in 1887 before the school was built. The church was designed as Gothic Revival, a copy of 13th‚Äì14th century style. The arch over the main door has the most detailed Victorian carving in the city. The foundation stone was laid in April 1862 by Bishop Cornthwaite. The present church was completed in 1864 for the sum of ¬£10,000. It was opened by Cardinal Wiseman in June 1864. It was considered to be \\"one of the most perfectly finished Catholic Churches in England, rich in sculpture, stained glass and fittings\\". Part of the porch way, believed to belong to the original Saint Wilfrid's Church, was found under the floor of the Assembly Rooms during the 19th century renovations. The church became a grade II listed building in 1968. = Tower = The tower is some 147 ft high and is visible around much of York. The design of the tower makes it appear as though the Oratory is taller than the Minster in the background; it is only when a person has passed the Oratory Church that they can see the Minster is taller. The tower holds a fine peal of ten bells, in addition to an Angelus bell (added in 2019 and named ‚ÄúJohn Henry‚Äù) with the heaviest eight bells dating from 1938. The chime was cast at the foundry of Gillett & Johnston in Croydon, and installed at Saint John's Church in Thornham. The bells became available in 1993, and relocated to Saint Wilfrid's.\\"History\\", St. Wilfrid's York Bellringers Two lighter bells were added in 1995 to create a peal of ten.

In mathematics and mathematical logic, a metatheory is a mathematical theory about another mathematical theory. Meta-theoretical investigations are part of the philosophy of science. A metatheory is not applied directly to practice, but may have applications to the practice of the field it studies. The emerging field of metascience seeks to use scientific knowledge to improve the practice of science itself.  Examples of metatheories  =Metascience= Metascience is the use of scientific methodology to study science itself. Metascience seeks to increase the quality of scientific research while reducing waste. It is also known as \\"research on research\\" and \\"the science of science\\", as it uses research methods to study how research is done and where improvements can be made. Metascience concerns itself with all fields of research and has been described as \\"a bird's eye view of science.\\" In the words of John Ioannidis, \\"Science is the best thing that has happened to human beings ... but we can do it better.\\" In 1966, an early meta-research paper examined the statistical methods of 295 papers published in ten high- profile medical journals. It found that, \\"in almost 73% of the reports read ... conclusions were drawn when the justification for these conclusions was invalid.\\" Meta-research in the following decades found many methodological flaws, inefficiencies, and poor practices in research across numerous scientific fields. Many scientific studies could not be reproduced, particularly in medicine and the soft sciences. The term \\"replication crisis\\" was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem. Measures have been implemented to address the issues revealed by metascience. These measures include the pre-registration of scientific studies and clinical trials as well as the founding of organizations such as CONSORT and the EQUATOR Network that issue guidelines for methodology and reporting. There are continuing efforts to reduce the misuse of statistics, to eliminate perverse incentives from academia, to improve the peer review process, to combat bias in scientific literature, and to increase the overall quality and efficiency of the scientific process. =Metamathematics= Introduced in 20th-century philosophy as a result of the work of the German mathematician David Hilbert, who in 1905 published a proposal for proof of the consistency and completeness of mathematics, creating the field of metamathematics. His hopes for the success of this proof were dashed by the work of Kurt G√∂del, who in 1931, used his incompleteness theorems to prove this goal of consistency and completeness to be unattainable. Nevertheless, his program of unsolved mathematical problems, out of which grew this metamathematical proposal, continued to influence the direction of mathematics for the rest of the 20th century. The study of metatheory became widespread during the rest of that century by its application in other fields, notably scientific linguistics and its concept of metalanguage. A metatheorem is defined as: \\"a statement about theorems. It usually gives a criterion for getting a new theorem from an old one, either by changing its objects according to a rule\\" known as the duality law or duality principle or by transferring it to another area (from the theory of categories to the theory of groups) or to another context within the same area (from linear transformations to matrices).Barile, Margherita. \\"Metatheorem.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W.

Whereas logic studies how logical systems can be used to construct valid and sound arguments, metalogic studies the properties of logical systems. Logic concerns the truths that may be derived using a logical system; metalogic concerns the truths that may be derived about the languages and systems that are used to express truths. The basic objects of metalogical study are formal languages, formal systems, and their interpretations. The study of interpretation of formal systems is the branch of mathematical logic that is known as model theory, and the study of deductive systems is the branch that is known as proof theory. = Metaphilosophy = Metaphilosophy is \\"the investigation of the nature of philosophy\\". see also the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy article by Nicholas Joll: Contemporary Metaphilosophy Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods. Thus, while philosophy characteristically inquires into the nature of being, the reality of objects, the possibility of knowledge, the nature of truth, and so on, metaphilosophy is the self-reflective inquiry into the nature, aims, and methods of the activity that makes these kinds of inquiries, by asking what is philosophy itself, what sorts of questions it should ask, how it might pose and answer them, and what it can achieve in doing so.

The series premiered in the fall of 1990 on NBC and lasted thirteen episodes. The show was developed as an animated vehicle for Moranis, building on his star appearances in the series of Ghostbusters and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids film franchises. Storyline The show revolves around the misadventures of human teacher Max Schneider who has unwittingly taken a job at Gravedale High, a school for monsters, near the city of Midtown. Schneider, the only human in the school, presides over a group of ghoulish teenagers that are latest-generation versions of classic movie monsters. Most are either disruptive, uninterested, and/or unduly self- preoccupied in school, and the class is generally considered disreputable if not uncontrollable (not unlike \\"the Sweathogs\\" in Welcome Back, Kotter), the implication being Schneider was hired to teach the class because no monster teacher would take the job. The actual \\"town\\" of Gravedale is occasionally seen and consists primarily of various cemeteries including the Eastside Cemetery and the Midtown Mausoleum. It can thus arguably be considered a \\"suburb\\" of Midtown, although few humans seem to know of its existence. In addition to the students' homes, it is known to include a doctor's office (which is run by a medical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as seen in \\"Fear of Flying\\") and a literal body shop where people can purchase parts to assemble monsters. The existence of a charitable organization known as the United Monster Fund (dedicated to helping schools like Gravedale High \\"around the world\\") indicates Gravedale is part of an entire monster subculture. Characters =Main characters= * Maxwell Schneider (voiced by Rick Moranis) - A human teacher in his late 30s to early 40s. Slight frame and very thin physique. Very much the grown up nerd and very proud of being a teacher who can make a difference. Dresses in a plain preppy business suit attire. He always wears a polka-dotted bow tie and thick dark horn-rimmed glasses, and he has wavy auburn hair and warm brown eyes. His personality is quirky but very steady (it has to be... being in charge of his motley young crew); friendly, fun, open-minded, and one of the hardest-working teachers on the Gravedale High staff. He'd be just like one of the monsters, if he wasn't already human. A dedicated instructor who truly cares for each of his students. * Vinnie Stoker (voiced by Roger Rose) - A vampire who is a Fonz-esque version of Count Dracula. His name is an homage to Bram Stoker and the common habit in fiction of giving vampires names that begin with V. He dresses like a 1950s greaser and often arrives late to class, which stems more from his lack of interest in academia than nocturnal habits. This is source of much debate between Schneider and Vinnie, who spends a lot of his time keeping Vinnie's boots off his desk. Vinnie is lazy by nature, but will do \\"studious things\\" or hard work if it serves his best interest. * Frankentyke (voiced by Frank Welker) - A child reminiscent of both Frankenstein's Monster and Bart Simpson (to the extent that he addresses everyone as \\"man\\"). His short stature is the antithesis of the classic image of a hulking, frightening monster. As seen in Night of the Living Dad, his father is a human scientist who evidently created him; he apparently has no mother. * Reggie Moonshroud (voiced by Barry Gordon) - A geeky red-haired werewolf, Reggie is prone to shedding a great deal when nervous, and can sometimes howl, but overall has his emotions under control (the opposite of werewolves being associated with carnal instincts). As a nod to Richie Cunningham from Happy Days, he and the Fonz-like Vinnie are best friends, which was also a play on the show's antithesis of the classic monster movie genre, which often depicts werewolves and vampires as mortal enemies. * J.P. Ghastly III (voiced by Frank Welker impersonating Peter Lorre) - A wealthy blue-skinned gnome-like monster. Sid once referred to him as a \\"quirk.\\" His monster classification is unidentified. There is a bit of rivalry between him and Vinnie. * Gill Waterman (voiced by Jackie Earle Haley) - A lagoon creature and surfer dude. His name is a pun on both concepts, and he frequently uses, and overuses, surfer lingo. Best friends with Frankentyke. Gill likes to surf, idolizes famed surfer Kahuna Bob, and has a voracious appetite. As seen in Night of the Living Dad, Gil's parents dress in Southern aristocracy attire (perhaps as a nod to the Black Lagoon's location in South America), but Mr. Waterman shares his son's fondness for surfer lingo. * Cleofatra (voiced by Ricki Lake) - An obese and somewhat nerdy mummy in contrast to the emaciated appearance generally associated with mummies. Her name is usually abbreviated as \\"Cleo.\\" Best friends with Duzer. Cleofatra has a crush on TV monster celebrity Billy Headstone who is the star of the daytime soap opera \\"Trudy and the Beast\\" (which is a parody of the 1980s show Beauty and the Beast). * Sid (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A student based on the Invisible Man. Sid is the class clown and does various impersonations (implying that perhaps he and his name were inspired by Sid Caesar), in contrast to the idea of the \\"invisible\\" one of the class being unnoticed. Oddly, Sid, like many cartoon anthropomorphic animals, apparently does not wear pants, unless his pants are invisible as the rest of his wardrobe is not. Sid's parents are also talented impersonators as seen in the episode \\"Night of the Living Dad.\\" * Blanche (voiced by Shari Belafonte) - A zombie Southern belle who loves to shop, making her a literal \\"mall zombie.\\" Her name and personality comprise a pun on \\"blanche\\" as a synonym for \\"turn pale,\\" 'carte blanche', and Blanche DuBois (in the episode \\"Monster Gumbo\\", she comments that she has \\"always depended on the kindness of monsters\\" parodying a line from A Streetcar Named Desire). Blanche frequently dates J.P., although it is implied she finds his money the most attractive trait. Blanche is a shopaholic who is frequently teased by her classmates about how many credit cards she's maxed out. She is a bit of a clothes horse. She does sew her own clothes and can cook, though she doesn't like domestic duties, her ambition being to marry the richest monster in the world; J.P.'s ambition, in turn, is to be the richest monster in the world. * Duzer (voiced by Kimmy Robertson) - A snake- haired gorgon Valley girl and parody of Medusa (which is her actual first name with \\"Duzer\\" being an abbreviation) minus the petrifying gaze. Her response to anyone who annoys her is \\"Get a life!\\" which is ironic in that many Gravedale students and staff members are in fact already dead. She is very pretty, vain, competitive, bossy, and likes to be the center of attention with all the boys, particularly Vinnie, who she seems to have an unrequited crush on. In the first episode, Duzer replies that she can't do anything with her snake hair and Cleo offers to help her \\"get her hair ready for Vinnie.\\" Duzer states that she doesn't have a crush on Vinnie Stoker. Frankentyke swipes her diary off her desk and reads out loud a passage about that reveals otherwise. Schneider enters the classroom just as Duzer gives chase and states that Frankentyke took her diary. Tyke throws the evidence out the window. Vinnie flies into the window with said diary and tries to read it before Duzer yells at him \\"If you read that, you're dead.\\" Afterwards nothing was mentioned about the relationship in the animated series. =Other students= Other recurring students include: * Alpha-Mae Centauri - A centaur. * Blobby - A student reminiscent of The Blob. * Busby - A human fly. * Elephant Boy (voiced by Frank Welker) - A literally elephant-like parody of the Elephant Man. He speaks with a cultured British accent. One of two students who seriously campaigned for Class President (although Vinnie campaigned just for kicks and won). * Iggy - A hunchbacked student that resembles the stereotypical \\"Igor\\" type of mad scientist assistant. Iggy has a zipper along the length of his scalp implying he is both hunchback and a Frankenstein-type monster. He tends to forget his brain and is often scolded by Headmistress Crone for this. * Moorehead - A Metaluna Mutant that is a student in Coach Cadaver's class. * Nardo - A gargoyle jock who is Vinnie's rival in sports. He is also a student in Coach Cadaver's class. * Natasha Neckinski - A vampire girl with a European accent in contrast to the thoroughly Americanized Vinnie. * Rover (voiced by Frank Welker) - A dog-boy who speaks in a manner similar to Scooby-Doo. * Seymour (voiced by Barry Gordon) - A cyclops. * Suey - A pig-girl. Like Elephant Boy, she seriously campaigned for Class President. The two performed a Romeo and Juliet-like recital at a talent show, suggesting they are dating. There are also some unidentified students resembling the monsters from The Brain from Planet Arous, The Crawling Eye, and other films. =Teachers= The bespectacled Mr. Schneider has his hands full with his new students, but he has Gravedale's spooky staff (where some of them initially do not trust Schneider due to his human status but develop a camaraderie with him as the overall story arc develops) to help him out. Like Schneider, each teacher oversees a specific class of students. Gravedale High's staff include: * Headmistress Crone (voiced by Georgia Brown) - The strict principal who runs the school with an iron albeit easily detachable left hand. As her name implies, she is a witch-like monster. Her grandfather Cretin Crone founded the school and later passed it on to his son Addlepate. She can be ruthless to trouble-making monsters and faculty who do not toe the line, but is generally an able administrator. Although Headmistress Crone considered herself taking a risk hiring a human teacher, she knew she made the right decision when Schneider disciplined the unruly \\"misfit\\" class and now works to give him support. ** Clawford (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) - Headmistress' Crone's undead cat who is periodically seen hunting and being outwitted by a hunchbacked rat called Bella. * Boneyard (voiced by Brock Peters) - A lanky white-haired staff member dressed like an undertaker. He does various odd jobs at Gravedale High including bus driver, driver's ed teacher, and Gravedale Gazette printing press operator. He somewhat resembles the Tall Man from the Phantasm films and is a little reminiscent of Digby O'Dell from The Life of Riley. * Coach Cadaver (voiced by Jonathan Winters) - A strict hot-headed zombie (his head is stitched together at the top, making his brain removable) who works as a gym teacher. He is categorized by Crone as a \\"human-hater.\\" Coach Cadaver dislikes Schneider's students (calling them \\"misfits\\") as well as Schneider himself (whose hiring he opposed). His attitude is generally disliked by the Gravedale faculty as opposed to Schenider's easygoing demeanor. * Miss Dirge (voiced by Eileen Brennan) - A teacher that resembles the Bride of Frankenstein. She shows a mild romantic interest in Schneider as she admits some monster women find human men attractive. Her name is a play on dirge or mournful funeral song. * Chef Sal Monella (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - An unspecified monster that works as a chef in the school cafeteria. Sal takes pride in his filthy kitchen. His name is an obvious pun on salmonella. * Mr. Tutner (voiced by Tim Curry) - A 5,000 year old mummy history teacher with bad breath who wears sunglasses, a coat, and a tie. Like Cleofatra, Mr. Tutner is pudgy, the opposite of mummies associated with sickliness and emaciation. He gets along well with Schneider and tried to compete for a charity fundraising award by attributing his long life to pyramid power as seen in \\"Monster Gumbo.\\" * Miss Webner (voiced by Sandra Gould) - As the word \\"web\\" in her name suggests, she is a spider-woman having six arms and two legs.

Jacob Kramer (26 December 1892 ‚Äì 4 February 1962)Oxford Dictionary of National Biography was a Ukrainian-born painter who spent all of his working life in England. Early life Jacob Kramer was born in the small town of Klintsy in 1892, then part of the Russian Empire, into an artistic middle-class Jewish family, who moved to Saint Petersburg shortly after.Bernard Silver(2000) Three Jewish Giants of Leeds Jewish Historical Society of England (Leeds) His father, Max, was a painter who had studied at the St Petersburg Fine Art Academy under Ilya Repin, and had become a court painter to Baron Ginsburg. Kramer's mother, Cecilia, was also artistic being a trained singer who was well known for touring a regional network of theatres established by her father, at which she performed traditional Slavic and Hebrew folk songs. He had two sisters. Life in England In the anti-Jewish events following assassination of the Tsar the family, like many Jews decided to leave. The father. Max, was in poor health so would not pass the health checks for admission to the USA, so instead they came to England, arriving in Leeds (which had an established Jewish population) in 1900. In 1902, aged only ten, Kramer ran away from his new home in Leeds, taking various jobs in different parts of the north of England, and even going away to sea for six months, being big for his age. During this sojourn away from his family Kramer attended occasional art classes, but his first formal art education was at Leeds School of Art where he had a scholarship from 1907 till 1913. During this time he was also to become involved in the radical modernist organisation the Leeds Arts Club, which introduced him to the ideas of expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky and the spiritual beliefs that came to underpin his work. Writing to his close friend and fellow Arts Club member Herbert Read in 1918, Kramer stated that when he looked at an object he saw both its physical appearance and its spiritual manifestation. His struggle, he claimed, was to escape the physical appearance and only paint the spiritual form. Such ideas came straight from the expressionist and Theosophical spiritualism that dominated the Leeds Arts Club, and show clearly that Kramer was himself an English Expressionist artist. Slade School of Art and Early career With a scholarship from the Jewish Educational Aid Society, Kramer was able to study at the Slade School of Art from 1913 to 1914. Here be befriended other leading artists of the day, including Augustus John, David Bomberg and William Roberts, and he was involved in the Vorticist movement led by Roberts and Wyndham Lewis, although was never really a follower of the style. Nonetheless, several of his woodcuts did appear in the Vorticist literary magazine BLAST, and other periodicals including Colour, Rhythm and Art and Letters. In London Kramer rapidly became well known in the hedonistic artistic circles that dominated before the First World War and was to be seen frequently at well-known artistic haunts, including the cabaret-club The Cave of the Golden Calf, The Cafe Royal and The Tour Eiffel. His first one-man show was in Bradford, and he had several exhibitions in London, as well as Glasgow and Leeds. He also gained a reputation as a portrait artist in addition to his more avant-garde work. Leeds Kramer was called up for military service in 1917, serving for two years including in France during the March 1918 campaign. On completion of military service, he returned to Leeds where he became something of a local artistic celebrity.Nicholson, Virginia. (2002). Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900‚Äì1939. London: Viking. p. 303. . He was naturalised on 16 January 1922. After the collapse of the Leeds Arts Club in 1923 he had numerous schemes to establish a new artistic meeting place in the city, almost all of which came to nothing. The great exception to this was the informal gathering called the Yorkshire Luncheon Club, which met regularly at Whitelock's public house in Leeds, and invited some of the leading cultural figures of the 1930s, 40s and 50s to Leeds to speak. He became an established artist, and also taught at the Leeds School of Art. As a portrait painter, his sitters included Mahatma Gandhi and Frederick Delius Kramer was commissioned to illustrate portions of the Soncino edition of the Bible and Prophets He died 4 February 1962, unmarried and with no children, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Gildersome. A memorial service was held in Leeds City Art Gallery. In 1968 Leeds School of Art was renamed Jacob Kramer College (it changed the name in 1993 to Leeds College of Art and Design). His friend Jacob Epstein made a bust of him, copies of which can be found in the Tate in London and at Leeds City Art Gallery. The Tate, the Victoria & Albert Museum and the British Museum all hold examples of Kramer's work, but the most extensive collections can be found in Leeds at the Leeds City Art Gallery and Leeds University Art Gallery.

An ex-lover of Dwight McCarthy, she manipulates men with her good looks and an innocent facade for her own personal gain or amusement. An expert liar, she is considered a goddess by Manute, her towering manservant, and a \\"manipulative bitch\\" by Dwight. She represents the classic femme fatale, acting as a foil to Dwight's hard-boiled antihero.  Background  One night, Dwight McCarthy receives a call from Ava, asking him to meet her at a seedy bar called Kadie's Club Pecos. She had broken his heart nearly four years prior -- a month or so before John Hartigan's release from prison in That Yellow Bastard -- but he agrees to meet her. Marv is also there and greets Dwight. Ava arrives late and tries to persuade Dwight to take her back, claiming that her life is \\"a living Hell.\\" Dwight refuses as Manute arrives, taking Ava away. Dwight goes home, but cannot sleep, so he decides to check up on Ava and her new husband, Damien Lord. He hops a fence and, using his photography equipment, scopes out the estate. He is discovered and claims that he is a peeping tom. Manute seemingly doesn't recognize him, but beats him brutally anyway. Dwight calls Agamemnon for a ride home, and they stop to get pizza. As he arrives home, he finds his Ford Mustang returned and his door unlocked. In his bedroom is a nude Ava. They eventually reconcile and make love. Manute arrives and violently beats a naked Dwight. Dwight is knocked out of his upper story apartment window, where he blacks out momentarily. He awakens to find Manute driving off with Ava. Dwight arrives at Kadie's, where Marv is in the middle of a squabble with some out-of-town punks. One of them pulls a gun on Marv, who knocks him flat. Dwight convinces Marv to help him storm Damien's estate. They drink together and watch Nancy Callahan dance. As they approach the mansion, Dwight insists Marv leave the punk's gun, which Marv has procured, in the car. Marv tackles the guards as a distraction and eventually takes on Manute. Marv rips Manute's right eye out and beats him savagely. With Manute occupied, Dwight makes his way to Damien. When he finds him, he beats him to death. Ava appears, and explains how Dwight was all a part of her plan to get Damien murdered so she could inherit his estate. She shoots Dwight six times, including once in the head. Dwight once again falls out of a window and is picked up by Marv. Two detectives following up on Damien Lord's death, Mort and Bob, talk to Ava. She claims that Dwight was a stalker who killed Damien out of jealousy. They believe her story, and Mort starts sleeping with her. They interrogate Agamemnon, who defends Dwight as an upright man who went clean after a wild youth of alcoholism. When they speak with Dwight's landlady, she says she let Ava in the night of Damien's murder, and heard a loud fight. Bob doubts Ava considerably now, while Mort, still sleeping with Ava, becomes more on-edge towards his partner. This culminates with Mort killing Bob, then committing suicide. Meanwhile, Dwight is recovering from his near-fatal wounds and calls Ava to inform her he's coming for her soon. Ava, with her late husband's financial assets, is joining her corporation with the mob boss Wallenquist. Wallenquist, unaffected by Ava's flirting, warns her not to flirt with him again and tells her to tie up her loose end with Dwight and has someone arriving from Phoenix soon to meet her about that. Dwight, who now has a new face, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix, accompanied by Gail and Miho. Once inside Ava's estate, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims at Dwight as Ava grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute in his shoulder. Manute falls through a window and upon landing, Miho stabs him in the arms, pinning him to the ground. Ava then tries telling Dwight that Manute had her under mind control to manipulate her and Damien and that it would be a cruel irony if he killed her now. Dwight finally sees through all the lies and kills Ava.  Film portrayal  Ava Lord appears in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, the sequel to the 2005 movie Sin City, which was based on Miller's graphic novels, released in 2014. She features prominently in the third and most substantial story of the film, A Dame to Kill For, which is based on the same story by Frank Miller. In the film, Ava is portrayed by actress Eva Green, whose role was announced in January 2013. Prior to Green's casting, actresses Rose McGowan and Salma Hayek were rumoured to play Ava, while director Robert Rodr√≠guez and Miller had expressed interest in 2006 for Angelina Jolie to play Ava.

He is the former Chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party. He was the Tennessee State Senator for the 24th district for 16 years and for 10 years before that the State Representative for the 76th district. He was the 2010 Democratic nominee for U.S. Representative for . The senate district encompassed Benton, Decatur, Henry, Henderson, Lake, Obion, Perry, Stewart, and Weakley counties.  Early life, education and career  Roy Herron grew up in Weakley County, Tennessee, where his ancestor was one of the first two settlers in the 1820s. Herron grew up working on his family's farm and became an Eagle Scout. Roy Herron graduated with highest honors from the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1975. Herron was the 9th Governor of the Tennessee Intercollegiate State Legislature, a statewide organization of college students. Before serving as Governor, he was Lieutenant Governor of the organization.Archives of the Tennessee Intercollegiate State Legislature Foundation, Special Collections, Vanderbilt University Library In 1975 and 1976 he was a Rotary Scholar in Scotland at the University of St. Andrews. He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1980, with a M.Div. and a J.D. as one of the first two joint law and divinity graduates. Herron works as an attorney and a businessman. He served for many years as adjunct faculty at Vanderbilt University's law and divinity schools where he taught courses he created. He also worked as a United Methodist minister. He helped found and served as the co-chair of FaithfulDemocrats.com, an online community for Democrats of Christian faith. He also founded and leads the non-profit Volunteer Center for Rural Development.  Tennessee Legislature  Herron was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1986 to fill Governor Ned McWherter's seat. He served in the House in the 95th through 99th Tennessee General Assemblies and in the Senate in the 100th through 107th. He rose to become floor leader and then chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. He also chaired the Select Committee on Children and Youth, the Senate General Welfare, Health and Human Resources Committee, and the Joint Tenncare Oversight Committee. He was a member of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Government Operations Committee, the Joint Committee on Charitable Gaming, and the Joint Select Committee on Education. Herron was known for his work ethic (he attended every legislative session for 26 years except the day his youngest son was being born), his debating skills and his strong advocacy for those he called \\"the working people and the hurting people\\". Herron did not seek re-election in 2012.  2010 U.S. Congressional campaign  In April 2009, Herron announced that he would be running for Governor of Tennessee in the Democratic primary, but in December 2009, he declared as a candidate for when Congressman John S. Tanner announced his retirement. Herron quickly became the frontrunner and other strong contenders did not challenge him. He was easily victorious in the August 2010 primary. Herron faced Republican nominee Stephen Fincher, Tea Party candidate Donn Janes, who earlier dropped out of the Republican primary, and Independent Mark J. Rawles. Despite raising over $2 million, a record amount for a Tennessee Democratic congressional candidate, Herron lost to Fincher in November in the massive Republican wave that swept through Tennessee and the nation. Herron did not have to give up his state senate seat to run in the congressional race; Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms. =Endorsements= In the congressional race, Herron was endorsed by the state's two largest newspapers, the Memphis Commercial Appeal and the Nashville Tennessean, as well as every other endorsing newspaper, a total of at least eight newspapers.  2013-2015 TNDP Chairmanship  Roy Herron was elected in 2013 as Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman. His work as chairman was categorized as successful, despite challenging times with a divided State Executive Committee and Democratic superminorities in the Tennessee General Assembly. Herron set records in Jackson Day fundraising and spoke out with unprecedented numbers of op-ed essays in major newspapers in the state. In the summer of 2014, he led a quiet but effective effort to save the Democratic justices on the Tennessee Supreme Court, successfully raising unprecedented funds for retaining the court. In the fall, he also led the party to victories in five of their seven targeted races in 2014 despite Republican advantages in numbers of office holders, funding and outside groups weighing in heavily in state races. In January 2015, Democratic activist and former candidate for State Senate Mary Mancini was elected to succeed Herron.

In the United States, it was released in June, 1958Warren, Bill (1986). \\"Keep Watching The Skies Volume 2\\". McFarland & Co., Inc. . Page 776 on a double bill with Curse of the Demon. The Revenge of Frankenstein was a sequel to The Curse of Frankenstein, the studio's 1957 adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus and the second installment in their Frankenstein series. Plot In 1860, Baron Victor Frankenstein, sentenced to death, escapes execution by the guillotine by having a priest beheaded and buried in his place with the aid of a hunchback named Karl. Three years later, Victor, now going by the alias Doctor Stein, has become a successful physician in Carlsbr√ºck, catering to the wealthy while also attending to the poor in a paupers' hospital. Hans Kleve, a junior member of the medical council, recognises Victor and blackmails him into allowing him to become his apprentice. Together with Karl, Victor and Hans continue with the Baron's experiment: transplanting a living brain into a new body, one that is not a crude, cobbled-together creature. The deformed Karl is more than willing to volunteer his brain thereby gaining a new, healthy body particularly after meeting the new assistant at the hospital, the lovely Margaret. The transplant succeeds, but when the excited Hans tells Karl that he will be a medical sensation, Karl panics and convinces Margaret to free him. Hans notes that the chimpanzee into which Victor had transplanted the brain of an orangutan ate its mate, and worries about Karl, but his concerns are brushed off by Victor. Karl flees from the hospital and hides in Victor‚Äôs laboratory, where he burns his preserved hunchback body. He is attacked by a drunken janitor, who takes him for a burglar, but manages to kill the man. Victor and Hans discover Karl is missing and begin searching for him. The next morning, Margaret finds Karl in her aunt's stable. While she goes to fetch Hans, Karl experiences difficulties with his arm and leg. When Hans and Margaret arrive, he is gone. At night, Karl ambushes and strangles a local girl. The next night, he rushes into an evening reception. Having redeveloped his deformities, he begs Victor for help, using his real name of Frankenstein, before he collapses and dies. Victor, disregarding Hans' pleas that he should leave the country, appears before the medical council, where he denies being the infamous Baron Frankenstein. The unsatisfied councilors open Victor's supposed grave, only to discover the priest's body, and conclude that the real Frankenstein is still alive. At the hospital, the patients violently attack Victor out of fear, and Hans rushes his dying mentor to the lab. The police arrive to arrest Victor, but when Hans shows them Victor's dead body, they leave. Hans then transplants Victor's brain into a new body that Victor had prepared earlier, which he made to resemble him. Sometime later in London, Hans assists Victor, now calling himself Doctor Franck, in welcoming some patients. Cast Production According to Jimmy Sangster James Carreras presold the film in America taking a poster with him. When Carreras returned he approached Sangster with the project asking him to write the sequel. Sangster responded, \\"I killed (Baron) Frankenstein in the first film.\\" Sangster stated that Carreras told him he had six weeks to write the project before shooting started and that \\"you'll think of something\\". The film was shot at Bray Studios and production commenced on January 6, 1958, three days after filming wrapped on Dracula (1958), which likewise starred Cushing and was directed by Fisher. Conductor and composer Leonard Salzedo was hired to write the score, and most of the regular Hammer crew returned in other roles, including Jack Asher as cinematographer, Bernard Robinson on design and Phil Leakey on make-up. Novelization Three novelizations of the film were published. The first one by Jimmy Sangster (using the pen name Hurford Janes) was published by Panther Books in 1958; the second was by John Burke as part of his 1966 Pan book The Hammer Horror Film Omnibus. A third novelization, by Shaun Hutson was published in March 2013 ().  Critical reception  Variety called The Revenge of Frankenstein \\"a high grade horror film\\" with \\"rich\\" production values and a script that was \\"well- plotted, peopled with interesting characters, aided by good performances.\\" Motion Picture Daily noted, \\"a horror picture turned out with creative skill and imagination. The most notable contribution the Hammers have made to the genre is their stunning use of color for frightening effects\\". Hammer Films \\"have demolished once and for all the theory that horror films should always be in black-and-white\\". Harrison's Reports declared it \\"a first-rate picture of its kind.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin was negative, writing: \\"A contrived plot and a notable lack of pace and imagination are responsible for the failure of this lavish and painstaking production to be convincing even on the level of a horror film. Peter Cushing's stylish and diffident performance serves only to underline the farcical effects of a crude and pedestrian handling of the little legitimate horror left.\\" The Revenge of Frankenstein currently holds a 92% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on eight reviews.

ICTY, 30 May 2006. p. 4 para. 3 while being tried for war crimes at the ICTY in The Hague, which was a major news story internationally. Milo≈°eviƒá died a few months before the verdict was due for his four-year trial. It occurred shortly after the Tribunal rejected his request to seek specialized medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Moscow,\\"Decision on Assigned Counsel Request for Provisional Release\\" , ICTY, 23 February 2006 but the report of 30 May 2006 confirmed that he had died of natural causes and that there was \\"no poison or other chemical substance found in his body that contributed to the death\\". Establishment of death Milo≈°eviƒá was found dead in his cell on 11 March 2006 in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention centre in the Scheveningen section of The Hague. An official in the chief prosecutor's office said that Milo≈°eviƒá had been found at about 10 a.m. and had apparently been dead for several hours. His trial had been due to resume on 14 March with testimony from the former president of Montenegro, Momir Bulatoviƒá. A request for the autopsy in the presence of a Serbian pathologist was granted, and his body was transported to the Dutch Forensic Institute. It was established that Milo≈°eviƒá died of a heart attack. Suspicions have been voiced: #that he was deliberately given the wrong medication, causing the heart attack (Milo≈°eviƒá had claimed to have been given the wrong medication three days before he died). #that he took the wrong medication himself in order to worsen his condition or commit suicide. ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, suggested Milo≈°eviƒá might have committed a suicide in order to foul the court and \\"evade justice\\"; (the prosecutor, ICTY PR, some Western media, and many U.S. politicians) #that he was, deliberately or through negligence, not given the standard treatment that would have prevented the heart attack. (Spanish doctors, Russian doctors, Serbian doctors, Milo≈°eviƒá family, academician and philosopher Mihailo Markoviƒá) Milo≈°eviƒá had been suffering from heart problems and high blood pressure. Initially, the Dutch coroner failed to establish the cause of his death.theaustralian.news.com.au Consequently, the president of the ICTY ordered an autopsy and a toxicological investigation. Immediately after his death was announced, rumours that Milo≈°eviƒá had been poisoned started circulating. Investigation =12 March= An autopsy was held in the Netherlands; its preliminary results found that Milo≈°eviƒá had died of myocardial infarction, the scientific term for a heart attack. The Tribunal warned that it was impossible to rule out poisoning at the time of their statement, as the toxicological tests had not been completed. The Tribunal had denied Milo≈°eviƒá's request for travel to Russia for specialist medical treatment. He planned to appeal against this decision, saying that his condition was worsening. Shortly before his death, Milo≈°eviƒá complained about wrong medical treatment to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it received the letter from Milo≈°eviƒá with his medical complaints. In the letter as provided by Milo≈°eviƒá's lawyer Zdenko Tomanoviƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá complained that he was being given a drug used against tuberculosis and leprosy, and that it was done in secrecy and without him (Milo≈°eviƒá) knowing anything about it. In his hand written letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Milo≈°eviƒá said he never used any drugs on his own, nor he was ill and in need to take medicines: Milo≈°eviƒá complained, in the same letter, that even though the medical report containing information about the fact the drug against leprosy was found in his blood dated from 12 January, he had only found out and received the report four days earlier before his death. The same was reported later by former pro- Milo≈°eviƒá Montenegrin President Momir Bulatoviƒá, who was due to testify for Milo≈°eviƒá's defence. According to Bulatoviƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá had stopped taking the drug and consequently was afraid of being poisoned. In his letter, Milo≈°eviƒá motivated his desire to be treated in Russia (by \\"Russian physicians, who rank among the most respected physicians in the world\\"), saying that: Lawyer Zdenko Tomanoviƒá told reporters that his client had feared Milo≈°eviƒá was being poisoned and cited the aforementioned letter, as well as the medical report two months before his death, according to which Milo≈°eviƒá's blood contained rifampicin - a drug that is normally used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis and which would have neutralized some of the effects of Milo≈°eviƒá's medicines for his high blood pressure and heart condition. Tomanoviƒá said he had made a formal request for the autopsy to take place in Moscow. The Tribunal rejected the request, allowing instead a pathologist from Serbia to attend the autopsy. In his statement, Tomanoviƒá said: \\"I demanded protection for Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá over his claims that he was being poisoned. I still haven't received any reply and that's all I have to say at this time.\\"sbs.com.au =13 March= Dutch toxicologist Donald Uges confirmed that the drug had been found in Milo≈°eviƒá's blood and suggested that he may have deliberately taken these drugs in order to get out of jail and seek medical treatment in Russia, where Milo≈°eviƒá's widow, Mirjana Markoviƒá, and son, Marko, were still living in exile. Likewise, sources at the Tribunal stated that Milo≈°eviƒá had regular access to unprescribed drugs that were smuggled into his cell under a lax prison regime. Timothy McFadden, the prison governor responsible for Milo≈°eviƒá, is reported to have complained, in vain, in December and January that he could no longer monitor drugs taken by the former leader. Milo≈°eviƒá has the key to his own office, which had a fax machine, a computer and a telephone, and access to a private \\"comfort room\\" for visits by his wife.aljazeera.net =17 March= The Tribunal confirmed that preliminary results of blood tests shows there is no indication that Milo≈°eviƒá's death by heart attack was caused by poisoning. Judge Fausto Pocar, president of the UN war crimes tribunal, told a news conference: \\"So far no indications of poisoning have been found. I would like to stress that these are provisional results.\\" Tribunal registrar Hans Holthuis confirmed that traces of rifampicin were found in an earlier 12 January blood test. However, Pocar said that there are no traces of the drug were found at the time of Milo≈°eviƒá's death. According to The Hague, district public prosecutor Moraal, referring to the NFI/Dutch Forensic Institute, \\"rifampicin disappears from the body quickly, and the fact that no traces were found implies only that it is not likely that rifampicin had been ingested or administered in the last few days before death\\". Leo Bokeria, Director of Moscow's Bakulev Heart Surgery Center, confirmed that Milo≈°eviƒá had died of a heart attack, but said adequate treatment in Moscow or in any one of many countries, including the Netherlands, would have rescued him. According to Bokeria, the necessary medical procedures (coronary angiography and stenting) were \\"elementary\\". Bokeria said he saw \\"nothing showing signs of suicide\\", but there remained questions over whether Milo≈°eviƒá received adequate care while standing trial at the U.N. tribunal. Bokeria also claimed that the center had sent Pocar a letter informing him that Milo≈°eviƒá needed hospital treatment and naming several countries beside Russia where that could be done. The Times' medical columnist Thomas Stuttaford commented that, taking into account what had been known about Milo≈°eviƒá's health condition for years, he was \\"surprised that he (Milo≈°eviƒá) lived for as long as he did\\". According to Stuttaford, given the data that existed, Milo≈°eviƒá should have been considered for a coronary bypass or angioplasty; while these operations might be rendered impossible by severe heart defects, that can only be established by a careful analysis of the heart, and one would have thought that if this had been done, someone would have mentioned it. According to Stuttaford, using rifampicin might have been a cunning way to kill a man that needs no expertise. =5 April= The conclusions of the Dutch investigation into Milo≈°eviƒá's death were finally announced.aljazeera.net Investigators concluded that Milo≈°eviƒá had died of natural causes, and final toxicological studies had confirmed there were no traces of poisoning or substances which could have triggered the heart attack. Tribunal prosecutors also announced that although non-prescribed medicines had been found in Milo≈°eviƒá's cell three months earlier, no such medicines were found in his cell on the day he died. The president of the UN Yugoslav war crimes tribunal welcomed the final report that formally closed the Dutch investigation, but he said that the Tribunal will continue to investigate the medical treatment Milo≈°eviƒá had received during his five-year detention.  Political reactions  =ICTY= ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte deplored Milo≈°eviƒá's death, saying that it had \\"deprived victims of justice\\". Concerning the causes of Milo≈°eviƒá's death, she concluded that suicide could not be ruled out and declined to comment on speculation that Milo≈°eviƒá may have been poisoned. In an interview with the Rome newspaper, La Repubblica, Del Ponte stated: =Serbian reactions= In Serbia, tens of thousands of Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters criticized the Tribunal for allegedly being more or less responsible for his death. Members of his Socialist Party advisors were particularly harsh - for example, senior official Ivica Daƒçiƒá said that \\"Milo≈°eviƒá did not die in The Hague, he was killed in The Hague\\". President Boris Tadiƒá, who was an opponent of Milo≈°eviƒá and the Socialist Party, said that in his opinion the U.N. war crimes tribunal was responsible for Milo≈°eviƒá's death, but he added that it would not hamper Serbia's future cooperation with the court.  Milo≈°eviƒá family reactions  Most notable was a letter Marko Milo≈°eviƒá, son of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, sent to The President of the ICTY, The Chairman of the Security Council of the OUN, The Secretary General of the OUN, and to Judge Parker who led the investigation into Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's death. In his letter, Marko Milo≈°eviƒá accuses the Hague Tribunal for negligence and for the death of his father. In one part of the letter, Milo≈°eviƒá agrees that his father was not poisoned and accuses the ICTY for being misleading: Marko Milo≈°eviƒá then continues about the logic of the investigation into his father's death: The Milo≈°eviƒá family raised questions about the legitimacy of the ICTY conducted investigation: Marko Milo≈°eviƒá then concludes that the ICTY is playing on \\"straw man\\" policy: Marko Milo≈°eviƒá doubted the intentions of the ICTY: As (one of the) conclusion(s), Marko Milo≈°eviƒá offers: Funeral and burial There was a strong controversy across Serbia regarding on Milo≈°eviƒá's funeral, as the Socialist Party and nationalist leaders demanded that it should be state-sponsored and high- profile. In particular, it was argued that Milo≈°eviƒá ought to have a prominent resting place in the \\"Alley of the Greats,\\" where other Serbian leaders are buried, which the Tribunal rejected such requests. As a result, the Socialist Party threatened to withdraw its support, which was essential for the ruling coalition. Finally, the Tribunal decided that Milo≈°eviƒá should have a private burial in his hometown, Po≈æarevac.telegraph.co.uk Nevertheless, a farewell ceremony was organised by the Socialist Party outside the federal parliament in Belgrade. About 50,000 of Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters attended the ceremony, which turned into a mass demonstration, with a succession of fiery speeches by prominent supporters.reuters.co.uk Afterwards, Milo≈°eviƒá's coffin was taken to his hometown for burial in the backyard of his family home. Milo≈°eviƒá's family and close friends pulled out of his funeral, citing anonymous threats and contradictory statements from Serbian authorities regarding the requested guarantees that they would not be arrested.abc.net.au Milo≈°eviƒá's daughter Mirjana stated that the Socialist Party had hijacked the funeral for political ends.

System, a Khiama Boys alumnus, grew sick of not receiving his fair share of royalties and decided to form his own band. Both his stints in Khiama Boys and the Sungura Boys had ended without any financial compensation. He recruited some experienced musicians, including his bassist brother Peter. The band of five are veterans of the Zimbabwe music scene. His brother Peter is a Nyami Nyami Sounds alumnus. Guitarist LeeRoy Lunga had played with both the Super Sounds and the Kasongo Band, while percussionist Lucky Mumiriki had experience with the Hurungwe Sounds and the Sungura Boys. The group is also known as Boyz DzeSmoko. Music style The group successfully mixed elements of sungura, jazz, South African mbaqanga and traditional sounds, creating an appealing and popular blend. The Chazezesa Challengers produced a string of hit albums in the mid-to-late 1990s; their debut, Rudo Tsika Nemagariro, sold more than 20,000 copies, while Mutunhu Unemago topped 30,000. Some of their top songs include Anodyiwa Haature, Kaserura Ndizvo, Smoko, Ndiridze Mhere, Ukarambwa Usacheme, and Vaforomani. System Tazvida is known for stressing that he liked better playing for rural crowds who he said liked and appreciated his music by singing along and dancing to it spiritedly when he did live shows. The Challengers were known for their humorous love lyrics and satirical subjects. The band also toured in Mozambique, where they were popular. Descent The band experienced two deaths in quick succession, as drummer Wezhira Shoko and talismanic leader System Tazvida both died near the turn of the millennium. Peter Tazvida, System's brother who assumed leadership of the group after his brothers death also succumbed to illness in mid-2002. This, did not stop the group. Under the leadership of Lee Roy Lunga, the boys released their twelfth album, Smoko Pachena/Chabvondoka, in December 2002. The group however has seen waning popularity of Smoko and a decrease in sales of their music Other projects The Chazezesa Challengers operate a variety of community projects in Zimbabwe.

It should not be confused with Pontnewydd in nearby Cwmbran.  Location  It lies in between Pontypool to the south and Snatchwood to the north. The area of Torfaen is historically industrial and the Pontnewynydd Iron Works once employed many people in the area. This works became known as the Partridge Jones and John Paton (PJ & JP) Iron Works. During the Second World War the works produced much of the corrugated iron for the Anderson shelters that were constructed throughout the country as makeshift air raid shelters. It finally closed in 1961, along with a number of other local works when the Llanwern Steelworks opened in Newport. The Monmouthshire Canal which ran from Newport to Pontnewynydd was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 3 June 1792. The section of canal from Pontymoile to Pontnewynydd was drained in the 1850s and the canal bed used to lay a railway line, which was eventually extended to Blaenavon.  Amenities  There is a small selection of shops and a car repairs garage. In 2001 the population was 1527 (49.5% Male, 50.5% Female) with an electorate of 1,174. Torfaen County Borough website The main social club built for the workers at the PJ & JP works was located adjacent to the works on Hanbury Road and continued long after the works closed. An example of its prominence in the area is that the club was the official host to the visiting South African Springboks rugby touring team during 1961 when they played at Pontypool. The club hosted regular live entertainment and boxing bouts. The local Pontnewynydd Sports & Social Club has recently ended a very long association with The Royal British Legion. Membership applications have soared since this happened and it is looking forward to being the premier entertainments centre in the village. Trevethin AFC who play their football in the village, and who head their division, use the Club as its base. There are regular buses south to Pontypool, Cwmbran and Newport and north to Abersychan, Varteg Hill and Blaenavon. However, there is no longer a train service - the local station (on the Newport - Blaenavon line) having closed in April 1962, which was more than a year before the \\"Beeching Axe\\". In financial terms the line was doing no worse than any of the other lines in the South Wales valleys but, like the local ironworks, the closure of the railway line was also linked to the opening of Llanwern steelworks. The amount of freight traffic the new plant generated was causing severe rail congestion in the Newport area and in an era when passenger rail transport was in decline a number of local services in Monmouthshire were withdrawn by the British Transport Commission as an operational measure. Education Education in the village was provided by Pontnewynydd Primary School. The school, located in a building constructed in 1901, opened in 1903. It closed in July 2015  Notable residents  *Sir John Ballinger, CBE, the first librarian at the National Library of Wales was born here in 1860.

It was originally called the Sam Melville/Jonathan Jackson Unit, and its members became known as the Ohio 7 when they were brought to trial. Between 1975 and 1984 the UFF carried out at least 20 bombings and nine bank robberies in the northeastern United States, targeting corporate buildings, courthouses, and military facilities.Smith 111-12 Brent L. Smith describes them as \\"undoubtedly the most successful of the leftist terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s.\\" The group's members were eventually apprehended and convicted of conspiracy, murder, attempted murder, and other charges. Only one, Jaan Laaman, remains incarcerated today. Tom Manning died in prison on July 30, 2019. Activities The group was founded in 1975 as the Sam Melville/Jonathan Jackson Unit, setting off a bomb at the Massachusetts State House under that name, but changed its name to the United Freedom Front the same year.Smith 110Gus 433 The initial members were Raymond Luc Levasseur (the UFF's leader), Tom Manning, and their respective spouses, Patricia Gros and Carole Manning. Levasseur and Tom Manning were both Vietnam War veterans and ex-convicts. The four had worked together in prison reform groups before forming the UFF. Four other members joined the group in the following years: Jaan Laaman and Barbara Curzi (another married couple), Kazi Toure (born Christopher King), and Richard Williams.Smith 110, 112 The UFF strongly opposed US foreign policy in Central America, as well as South African apartheid. The UFF's targets included South African Airways, Union Carbide, IBM, Mobil, courthouses, and military facilities.Smith 111 The UFF called in warnings before all of its bombings, attempting to avoid casualties. However, 22 people were injured in one 1976 bombing at the Suffolk County Courthouse in Boston, including a courthouse worker who lost a leg. The group was most active in the early 1980s. The UFF's members lived undercover in middle-class suburbs. Toure was captured in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in 1982. Two state troopers were wounded in the course of arresting him. On November 4, 1984, police apprehended Levasseur and Gros near Deerfield, Ohio, and Laaman, Curzi, and Williams in Cleveland.Smith 112 The Mannings were captured six months later in Norfolk, Virginia. Gus notes that the UFF was \\"the most enduring of all New Left terrorist groups of the era,\\" evading capture for almost a decade.425 Trials and imprisonment The UFF's members were tried repeatedly on various federal and state charges. In March 1986, seven of them (the so-called \\"Ohio Seven\\") were convicted of conspiracy, receiving sentences ranging from 15 to 53 years.Smith 112-13 In 1987 all eight members were charged with sedition and racketeering.Smith 113 Eventually five accepted plea bargains, had charges against them dropped, or were tried separately, and the trial of the remaining three ended in 1989 with an acquittal for sedition for all three and acquittal for Patricia Levasseur (formerly Gros and now Rowbottom) for RICO Conspiracy and a locked jury on the substantive racketeering charges. Thomas Manning and Richard Williams were given life sentences for the 1981 murder of state trooper Philip Lamonaco, and Laaman was convicted in the 1982 attempted murder of two state troopers. The activist defense lawyer William Kunstler represented UFF members in some of these proceedings. Toure, Curzi, Gros, and Carol Manning were released during the 1990s, and Levasseur was released in November 2004.

It was directed by John Gilling, and starred Noel Willman, Jacqueline Pearce, Ray Barrett, Jennifer Daniel, and Michael Ripper. Plot summary At the turn of the 20th century in the fictional village of Clagmoor Heath in Cornwall several locals are dying from what is deemed to be the \\"Black Death\\". Harry Spalding (Ray Barrett) inherits his late brother's cottage and arrives with his new bride, Valerie (Jennifer Daniel) . The inhabitants of the village keep clear of the newly arrived couple and only the publican, Tom Bailey (Michael Ripper), befriends them. Bailey explains that the hostility exhibited by the townspeople is the result of many mysterious deaths in the community. The sinister Dr. Franklyn (Noel Willman), the owner of the nearby Well House, is the only resident in the vicinity of the cottage and he lives with his daughter Anna (Jacqueline Pearce). The Doctor treats his daughter with cruel contempt and she is attended by a silent Malay servant (Marne Maitland). Hoping to learn something of the deaths, Harry invites the local eccentric, Mad Peter (John Laurie), home for dinner. After warning them that their lives are in danger, Mad Peter quickly departs only to return later that evening foaming at the mouth, with his face blackened and swollen. He dies within a few minutes. The Spaldings attempt to alert Dr. Franklyn, but Franklyn arrogantly states that Peter's death is not his concern, explaining that he is a Doctor of Divinity, not a surgeon. In an attempt to help Harry clear up the mystery, Tom Bailey illegally unearths Mad Peter's corpse and discovers a strange neck wound like a snake bite. Harry and Tom dig up the coffin of Harry's dead brother, Charles, and find that corpse also has those same strange marks. Realizing that they are threatened by something far worse than they had ever imagined, Harry is quick to answer an urgent message from the Well House. There he is bitten by a mysterious reptilian creature, but he still manages to return to his home and recover from the bite. Meanwhile, at the eerie abode, Valerie witnesses Dr. Franklyn's attempt to kill his own cursed daughter (who was changed into the reptile creature after being abducted by a Malay snake cult that included the doctor's own servant). She also witnesses a fierce struggle between the doctor and the deranged Malay servant. During the battle, a lantern is overturned and Dr. Franklyn is bitten by the venomous fangs of his reptilian daughter. Both the doctor and the reptile die in the fire and the Well House crumbles in flames, with Harry and Valerie fleeing for their lives. Cast * Noel Willman as Dr. Franklyn * Ray Barrett as Harry George Spalding * Jennifer Daniel as Valerie Spalding * Jacqueline Pearce as Anna Franklyn * Michael Ripper as Tom Bailey * John Laurie as Mad Peter * Marne Maitland as The Malay * David Baron as Charles Edward Spalding * Charles Lloyd-Pack as The Vicar * Harold Goldblatt as The Solicitor * George Woodbridge as Old Garnsey Production The production was filmed back to back with The Plague of the Zombies, and used many of the same sets, including exterior shots in the grounds of Oakley Court near Bray, Berkshire (seen burning in the final frames). Pearce and Ripper appeared in both films. The cottage used in the film was located in Brentmoor Road, West End, Woking, Surrey. The heathland shots were of West End & Chobham Common. As documented in books on Hammer Film's history, actress Jacqueline Pearce disliked wearing the Reptile make-up as she suffered from claustrophobia. After this film she vowed never to wear \\"creature\\" make-up in her future acting projects. The film was released in some markets on a double feature with Rasputin, the Mad Monk. A novelization of the film was written by John Burke as part of his 1967 book The Second Hammer Horror Film Omnibus.  Critical reception  The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films called the film \\"classic sixties Hammer\\"; while Allmovie wrote, \\"there are some inconsistencies in Anthony Hinds' script, but the film is handsomely mounted and delivers its share of shocks\\" ; Time Out wrote, \\"it's slower and moodier than its companion-piece (Plague of the Zombies), but strikingly Conan Doyleish in its stately costume horrors. Jacqueline Pearce is terrific\\"; and British Horror Films said simply, \\"it's superb\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that it \\"has an unusually controlled dignity for a Hammer production; instead of the customary blood-lettings, we are invited to observe with nervous curiosity the slow self-destruction of a proud but superstitious man incapable of rescuing his daughter from the fate half-wished upon her by himself ... Altogether, a film of quite some merit.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times panned the film, writing that \\"the script is too silly for all but the most uncritical.\\"Thomas, Kevin (June 3, 1966). \\"Horror Double Bill Feeble\\".

The plan was for two IRA members to enter the shop with a time bomb, force out the customers at gunpoint and flee before it exploded; killing those at the meeting. As they believed the meeting was being held in the room above the shop, the bomb was designed to send the blast upwards.

It had an eleven-second fuse, and the IRA explained that this would have allowed just enough time to clear the downstairs shop but not enough for those upstairs to escape. Begley and two other IRA members from the Ardoyne area hijacked a blue Ford Escort and drove it to the fish shop. When they arrived, Begley and Sean Kelly, wearing the white coats and caps of delivery men, entered the shop carrying the bomb.

Brotherton Wing to left, Leeds Civic Hall to right Millennium Square is a city square in the Civic Quarter of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was Leeds' flagship project to mark the year 2000, and was jointly funded by Leeds City Council and the Millennium Commission. Total cost of production was ¬£12 million. Description OpenStreetMap map of area It is an L-shaped pedestrian and events area, on a South-facing slope running down from Leeds Civic Hall and bounded on the West by Calverley Street, on the other side of which is the Brotherton Wing of Leeds General Infirmary. It consists of three portions, a large open events area running East from Calverley Street; a smaller area to the East with seats and plants; and an area of seating, gardens and water features to the South. The events area is roughly rectangular and paved in York stone with granite strips dividing it into a grid, with the Civic Hall bordering about half of it. The other edge on the North is occupied by the newbuild Cuthbert Brodrick pub and restaurant (named after Leeds architect Cuthbert Brodrick). The East area with seats and plants goes up to the front of the Leeds City Museum (one of Brodrick's buildings). The South part by Calverley Street is called the Mandela Gardens, after Nelson Mandela. Beside this is the new Carriageworks Theatre, the north front of this being in white to allow use as a projection screen having a large TV screen and carrying the facilities for a stage which can be erected for events. Power and utilities, plus dressing rooms and toilets, are under the flat area for the stage. A control tower and electric substation are in a tower on the northeast of the square, by the Cuthbert Brodrick, disguised in a sculpture called \\"Off Kilter\\" by Richard Wilson which has been described as 'grenade shaped'. To the East of the Carriageworks Theatre are older buildings with frontages on Great George Street: the Electric Press, a former 1900 printworks in red brick with a distinctive square chimney and a Grade II listed building, is now combined with adjacent properties based on a former carriageworks (hence the name of the theatre) which is also Grade II, and nowadays also signed The Electric Press. These have been adapted to contain bars, restaurants, and the Film and Media school of Leeds Beckett University. The commercial use of these buildings and the inclusion of the Cuthbert Broderick helped to pay for the square. On the southeast corner of the square, on the crossroads with Cookridge Street and Great George street is another former printworks and Grade II listed building, the Leonardo Building. It was refurbished and a modern extension put on it on the north side in 1998, just as work was beginning on Millennium Square. The architect was Leeds Civic Architect, John Thorp.

It also has the bronze sculpture \\"Both Arms\\" by Leeds sculptor Kenneth Armitage intended to represent reconciliation. The garden was remade again in a form which won a bronze award for the Council at the 2004 Chelsea Flower Show entitled \\"Freedom for the Future\\" and installed in Leeds in 2006. This also celebrates a partnership between the cities of Leeds and Durban, South Africa. Links are demonstrated by a bronze plaque with the handprints of the Durban mayor and the leader of Leeds City Council at the time, and also a \\"Freedom Path\\" with resin blocks of footprints of both Leeds and Durban children.Leeds Council information sign on the Mandela Gardens, viewed 24 June 2018 There are two flower beds, one with South African plants and one with British ones. These are linked by a pathway and water feature in Portland stone which has a water sculpture representing the bars of Mandela's prison. History When the Civic Hall was constructed in 1933 it had Calverley Street to the West and Portland Crescent to the East creating a triangle to the South, which was made into civic gardens. Demolition of older terrace housing to the East of Portland Crescent in the 1960s created space belonging to the Council used as a car park,Ordnance Survey maps (online) 1970s and 1980s and there were other more historic buildings for which a use was needed. Leeds City Council prepared a proposal for a bid to combine the civic gardens and car park into Leeds' first public square for 60 years The final requirements agreed with the Millennium Commission was for an open space with all technical provisions and facilities to accommodate up to 5000 people in a variety of events. In addition there should be a quiet garden space and seating. The budget was ¬£12 million. Work began in 1997 by closing the street in front of the Civic Hall, and Portland Crescent going through the area. Later the part of Cookridge Street going through was also paved over, but still provides access for emergency vehicles. Phase one was completed in December 2000 in time for Millennium celebrations, with Phase 2 in April 2001, and a final cost of ¬£12.5 million. The architect was Leeds Civic Architect John Thorp, with design assistance from Leeds City Council's in-house Design Agency and its Highway Agency. Further development of buildings around the perimeter took place until August 2008, including the conversion of the Leeds Institute building into Leeds City Museum. In 2002, work began on ¬£15 million development of the Electric Press printworks and adjacent buildings, followed in 2003 by construction of a new ¬£5 million theatre next door (and integrated with the other building) to be the home of Leeds Civic Theatre, which was to move from the nearby Leeds Institute. Meanwhile the Leeds Institute was to be converted to be the home of Leeds City Museum. However, from the beginning the cube shape of what came to be called the Carriageworks Theatre was controversial. It was described by councillors as \\"the most important building to be developed since the Civic Hall in the 1930s\\" and \\"a hideous insult\\". The theatre opened in 2005, and in 2006 hosted the annual Leeds Architecture Awards, where it won in the category for best lighting, and along with the Electric Press, the altered building award. From 2005 to 2008 work was carried out to convert the Leeds Institute into Leeds City Museum, using funds from the Council, Yorkshire Forward and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Activities As well as civic ceremonies, fairs, markets and major events on the TV screen, the site has hosted concerts by Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs and other performers including The Cribs, Meat Loaf, Embrace, Simple Minds, Ocean Colour Scene and The Bluetones. On 30 April 2001, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela appeared on stage in the square to open the adjoining Mandela Gardens and was given the Freedom of the City. He famously mis-acknowledged the crowd by saying how happy he was to be in Liverpool. On 4 June 2002 the square hosted the BBC Music Live Jubilee Party with 12 hours of music plus a beacon and fireworks to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. =Annual events= The square is used for New Year celebrations with a funfair, street entertainers and fireworks at midnight. In January 2001, 1250 square metres of ice were used to create an ice rink, which had 24,000 visitors over a four week period. Because of the success it was repeated the following year and is an annual feature, called the Ice Cube. From 2002, there has been a German- style Christmas Market or Christkindlesmarkt every November and December, one of the largest in the UK. It is used for the start and end of St Patrick's Day parade, plus music and dance. On the first Sunday of August every year the Square is host to the first part of Leeds Pride festivities and the start point of the parade of floats.

The 11th August 2020 a very different type of event took place. Professionals from across the Events Supply Chain (including lighting designers, audio technicians, event production managers and logistics managers to name a few) came out of the shadows to draw attention to the lack of support for the supply chain. BBC Look North provided coverage of the demonstration including interviews with Neil Hunt of Zig Zag Lighting and Chris Ayre of AYRE Event Solutions both who have been severely affected by the lack of support for the industry. Nathan Clark of the Brudenell Social Club, Neil Hunt of Zig Zag Lighting and Helen Tytherleigh a freelance event professional gave speeches on how the events industry is suffering and the urgent support required. The Leeds #WeMakeEvents demonstration was held as part of a wider UK demonstration to draw attention to the urgent support required for the industry.

Minneapolis and St. Paul, together known as the Twin Cities, are the core of the 15th largest metropolitan area in the United States. With a population of 3.6 million people, the region contains approximately 60% of the population of Minnesota. Due to its location in the northern and central portion of the U.S., the Twin Cities has the coldest average temperature of any major metropolitan area in the nation. Winters can be cold, summer is warm and humid, snowfall is common in the winter and thunderstorms with heavy rainfall occur during the spring, summer and autumn. Though winter can be cold, the area receives more sunlight hours in mid-winter than many other warmer parts of the country, including all of the Great Lakes states, the Pacific Northwest, parts of the South, and almost all of the Northeast.General Climate Information from Climate Atlas of the United States. Western Regional Climate Center. Unless otherwise indicated, all normals data presented below are based on data at Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport, the official Twin Cities climatology station, from the 1981‚àí2010 normals period. General climatology A lakeside bike path in summer The climate of the Twin Cities is classified as hot-summer humid continental without dry season (K√∂ppen Dfa). A feature of the humid continental climate in the United States is that weather can be unpredictable with extremes occurring in many phases of measurements. For example, the Twin Cities has a hotter all-time record high temperature of than the entire state of Florida, despite being located nearly 1000 miles farther from the equator. Conversely, temperatures during the winter months are colder in the Twin Cities than in any other major metropolitan area in the continental United States, and are about equal to those in Anchorage, Alaska, which is around closer to the North Pole. The Twin Cities can also experience droughts, floods, and on average are windier than Chicago, Illinois (the \\"Windy City\\", although that is not the origin of the phrase). =Temperature= Because of its location in the center of North America, the Twin Cities region is subjected to some of the widest temperature ranges in the United States. Temperatures in the Twin Cities region range from an average of in January to in July. With no natural barriers to block cold air from pouring south from Canada, the Twin Cities are subjected to many arctic air masses throughout the winter months. These arctic air masses bring with them cold temperatures and sometimes strong winds. The Twin Cities has a comparable average summer temperatures to other nearby metropolitan areas such as Chicago, but the arctic outbreaks during the winter push the average winter temperature of the Twin Cities below that of Chicago's. Despite being located just from Chicago, the Twin Cities' average January temperature of is below Chicago's .National Weather Service Chicago, ILClimate During summer months, Minneapolis can be subject to hot temperatures from May to September, and high humidity. Records With temperature records dating to 1 October 1872, the range in temperatures has officially ranged from on January 21, 1888, up to on July 14, 1936 during the Dust Bowl years. The coldest daily maximum temperature was , set six days before the all-time record low, while the warmest daily minimum was , again set one day before the all-time record high. The monthly average temperature has ranged from in January 1875 to in July 1936, while for the annual mean temperature, the range is in 1875 to in 1931 and 2012. Time series =Urban heat island effect= A significant impact on temperatures in the Twin Cities the past several years has been the urban heat island effect. Large amounts of concrete and asphalt, coupled with numerous tall buildings (which block wind) help to trap heat close to the surface, resulting in warmer temperatures, especially at night, than those of the surrounding areas (even those further to the south). For example, the average annual temperature of 45.4 at the Minneapolis St. Paul International airport is warmer than those of Rochester (43.4) and Mankato (44.7) which are both located farther to the south. =Precipitation= A wintry February day in St. Paul The Twin Cities experiences a wide range of precipitation types. Rain is the most common form during the summer months, while snow, sleet, freezing rain, and occasionally rain occur during the winter. The summer months of June, July and August account for nearly half of the annual precipitation total across the Twin Cities. Most of this rain falls from thunderstorms, a frequent summer occurrence. Even though summer is the primary season for the Twin Cities to experience thunderstorms, they can occur from March to November. On rare occasions thundersnow can occur, where thunder and lightning accompanies winter or (more usually) spring snowstorms. During spring and summer, some thunderstorms are severe. These storms produce damaging straight line winds, large hail and, occasionally, a tornado. The Twin Cities has experienced several major derecho events, most recently during the Late-May 1998 Tornado Outbreak and Derecho which traveled from South Dakota to New York on May 30 - May 31, 1998. Summertime thunderstorms are fueled by dew points that often reach into the 70s ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) and sometimes even . St. Anthony Falls after a spring storm Winter precipitation comes in a few different forms. Snow is the main form of precipitation, but freezing rain, ice, sleet and sometimes even rain are all possible during the winter months. Larger storm systems, often Panhandle hooks or other storms that occur with a meridional flow, can bring large amounts of snow and even blizzard conditions. The average annual snowfall in the Twin Cities is , with an average of 100 days per year with at least of snow cover. The most snow the Twin Cities has officially seen during one winter was in 1983-1984 with , and the least was in 1930-1931 with . Weather events =Tornadoes= A tornado over Minnetonka, Minnesota on May 6, 1965.The Twin Cities metropolitan area lies near the northern edge of Tornado Alley, and as such the region experiences tornadoes almost annually. The first recorded tornado observed in the Twin Cities metro area was in 1820 at Fort Snelling. A destructive tornado struck St. Paul in 1891. The worst tornado event to affect the Twin Cities was on May 6, 1965. On that day, six tornadoes touched down in several counties in and around the western and northern metro area, killing 13 people and injuring over 600. Four of the tornadoes were rated F4, two of which hit Fridley, Minnesota about an hour apart. This outbreak was notable because this was the first time in Minnesota history that civil defense sirens were used to warn people of impending severe weather. The live coverage by the Twin Cities media was also unprecedented. WCCO's continual broadcast of the weather situation is credited with warning people about the tornadoes and saving lives. Damage to homes from the EF3 tornado in Hugo, Minnesota on May 25, 2008.In 1981 a twister dubbed the Har-Mar tornado touched down in Minneapolis, proceeding to affect the northern suburbs of the metro area, including killing a man near Lake Harriet. On July 18, 1986 a tornado touched down in Fridley, and video captured from KARE 11 news helicopter was broadcast live on their 5:00 pm newscast. The aerial video captured on that day was unprecedented at the time, and was heavily researched. On May 25, 2008 an EF3 tornado hit the town of Hugo during the Late-May 2008 tornado outbreak sequence. The twister damaged or destroyed several homes in the town, causing an estimated $25 million in damage. =Derechos= Though derechos do not have winds as strong as tornadoes, they impact larger areas and thus can easily cause just as much damage. The costliest severe weather event in the Twin cities history was a derecho that occurred on May 15, 1998. Large hail and damaging wind caused most of the $1 billion in damages reported. Two weeks later on May 30, another large derecho produced winds of over over a large portion of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. These two events combined to cause $1.5 billion in damage, and they created the largest debris cleanup project in Minnesota history. =Snow= On November 11, 1940 the Armistice Day Blizzard affected all of southeast Minnesota, killing 60 people in Minnesota. The Twin Cities recorded 17 inches of snow, and temperatures dropped nearly sixty degrees over the course of one day. The largest snowstorm to affect most of the Twin Cities area was the Halloween Blizzard on October 31 - November 2, 1991. Officially, of snow was reported at the Twin Cities airport. The heaviest snow fell in a line from there, northward to Duluth. Lesser amounts fell to the east and west of that line, but it was the largest early-season snowstorm for the entire region. =Floods= The largest flash flood in Twin Cities history occurred on July 23-July 24, 1987. Dubbed locally The Super Storm, more rain fell from this event than any other in recorded Twin Cities history. The storm caused damage to 9,000 homes, killed two people, and caused $27 million in damage. Some areas in the southern metro area recorded of rain. The that fell on July 23 is the largest official single-day rainfall for the Twin Cities. Overall, at least of rain fell over , and at least fell over . This event was voted the eighth most significant weather event in the state of Minnesota during the 20th century. Three days before this event on July 20-July 21, up to of rain fell over some of these same areas. These two storms combined to help the Twin Cities to their wettest summer on record, with of rain falling from June to August. The Minnesota River and Mississippi River both flow through the Twin Cities, and in turn there is some degree of river flooding almost annually. The worst floods in Twin Cities history on these rivers were in 1965. Other substantial floods occurred in 1969, 1993, 1997 and 2001.

Over 250,000 residents of the land near the Lyari River were left homeless by the construction of the highway, but provided land and compensation for relocation in areas including new developments Hawke's Bay, Baldia and Taiser Town. Background Karachi is not only the largest city of Pakistan, it is also one of the most populated cities in the world. During the past six decades since Independence its population has swelled from a mere 250,000 to more than 15 million. As such, it constitutes ten per cent of the total population of the country. Due to uncontrolled influx of population from all parts of the country, the city has developed a multitude of problems ‚Äì from shortage of potable water and dilapidated roads to hardships pertaining to housing, education and transport. Being an industrial and commercial hub, and the only city where two big ports are located, the trade in other cities is routed through Karachi. Transportation of industrial and commercial goods is also carried out through this city. It is for this reason that the traffic pressure on the roads and street of Karachi is enormous and is increasing day by day. One-third of the total automotive in the country is registered here. For the huge number of motor vehicles, the flow of traffic is hampered, causing environmental pollution and numerous difficulties for the citizens. To facilitate the traffic in the city it has become imperative that the traffic headed for out- of-city places should not be allowed to ply on the city roads, and the transportation of good from the ports should be bypassed without transporting it through the city. It is only in this way that the traffic pressure could be eased off in the city. In this regard, the government planned a number of projects for the construction of bypasses and highways. Under the 1975‚Äì85 Master Plan, the Northern Bypass was presented but it was left incomplete for a number of reasons. Had it been completed by that time, the flow of traffic in the city would have eased off and all the heavy vehicular traffic would have headed directly towards the Superhighway instead of passing through the city. The citizens would have spared the pollution caused the heavy transport. In 1989, citizens groups had presented the Lyari Expressway along the Lyari River but this project too was shelved. The present government took these projects seriously and stepped towards their implementation. At present, the Lyari Expressway and the Northern Bypass projects are on the priority list, and implementation has started on these projects. Lyari Expressway which is almost complete being built along the bank of the Lyari River, beginning from Mauripur and ending at Sohrab Goth will reduce traffic pressure on city roads. History The resettlement was started eight years back and is in final stages of its completion. There are 5,434 plots in Hawksbay Site. 5,100 families have been given possession of their homes. During the first phase of resettlement, the people are being transferred to sectors 6, 9 and 10 of the Hawksbay Scheme 42. Provision of all amenities of life have been ensured here, that includes roads, water supply, sewerage, power transmission, installation of street lights, and facilities for transport, education, health, playgrounds, parks, community centre, shopping centre, etc. In the first phase completed and more than 5000 families have already settled here. In the second phase of resettlement under way at Taiser Town, over 21,000 families have been given a plot of 80 sq-yd and Rs.50,000 each. Of these, some 15,000 families have built their homes and are comfortably living there. There is quality education available for every children of the shifted family. There is no education fee and the school children are provided free school uniform and books. In keeping with the vision for peoples welfare hundreds of children have been admitted into schools. At present 40 schools, including a high school, are functioning in the newly resettlement sites of Hawksbay and Taiser Town, on behalf of Lyari Expressway Resettlement Project (LERP)‚Äú summer schooling‚Äù is also organized during summer holidays so as to make holidays beneficial for children. In summer schooling, the children are imparted quality education while at the end, they are taken to a visit to Karachi‚Äôs historical and recreational places. As per decision, anyone coming to site to take possession of plot, will be provided one plant and school admission form then and there so that right from the start an educational and environment-friendly atmosphere is built up. In the newly resettlement sites, a trend has been set to mark national days with tree plantation. Pakistan Day was observed in the Lyari Expressway Resettlement Project (LERP) sites of Hawksbay and Taiser Town in a unique manner. It was celebrated by shiftees of Lyari Expressway who got their children admitted to schools as part of LERP efforts for promotion of education of children, who otherwise, could have been seen playing in the stinking environment if they had continued to live there in the river-bed and on its banks. Under the program, groups of teachers and students both girls and boys were formed in Hawksbay and Taiser Town each group consisted of three teachers, three boys and three girls. These groups went home to home, contacted the parents and their children and apprised them about the significance of knowledge and education. They got admission forms filled from such children who hitherto were not going to schools. As a result, a large number of children were admitted to schools in their respective areas. The girls were more enthusiastic and paid special attention to admission of their fellow girls not going to school. The school children had started tree plantation drive in Hawksbay and Taiser Town putting special attention on national days such as independence Day, Pakistan Day. The inhabitants of Hawksbay and Taiser Town sites have started a new tradition together that whenever the construction of a new house commence, they offer thanksgiving prayer and plant a tree to make the occasion memorable for their bright future. In the new resettlement sites, hawkers bazaar and shopping canters have also been set up to provide employment opportunities to local population and economic activities are fast growing there. The resettlement project have also provided health and medical facilities. Besides, government dispensaries at Hawksbay and Taiser Town, one dispensary each of Edhi, Alamgir Trust and Gospel are also functioning. In order to supply construction material to shiftees, shops of construction material have also been established to ensure supplies at a rate cheaper than the open market price. In the new resettlement sites, supply of electricity has also been ensured. Poles have been erected having road and street lights. Baldia site is spread over 145 acres where 2924 plots have been allocated for shiftees.

It was created in the 1980s and now has over 40,000 residents. The real number of people living temporarily there can hardly be estimated. It is one of the most diversified areas in Sofia, with old dwellings from the communist era which are inhabited by the students of different Sofia universities, and new nightclubs, trade, business and residential centres. The construction boom has already taken its toll as overdevelopment appears ubiquitous. Parking lots and green areas remain inadequate. The year 2011 marked the set-up of the largest skatepark on the Balkans situated within the park area in front of the University of National and World Economy. Two multifunctional halls, Hristo Botev and the Winter Palace of Sports, host a number of events on regular basis. Because of the usually cheap rent (less than ‚Ç¨20 per month), it is very attractive for living. Recent renovations have brought about improvements in many dormitories, including those hosting foreign students. They are mostly from the Bulgarian diaspora in Macedonia, Moldova, Ukraine, Serbia, and since 2004, non-Bulgarians from Turkey. The area is famous for its busy nightlife. A variety of taverns and disco clubs make the campus one of the central night entertainment locations of Sofia. Studentski grad hosts a district police department that strives to tackle the fast-growing alcohol-driven offenses, thefts, vandalism, football fans clashing, etc. The brutal murder of the student Stojan Baltov by drunken youths outside a disco club sparked debates on social environment and security issues, including the development of an integral video surveillance system. Places for eating out vary from high-end restaurants to cheap pizzerias. Particularly popular is the so-called Mandzha street where a number of banitsa pastry, burger, D√∂ner kebab and pancake shops are lined up. Unlike most campus areas in Western Europe and Northern America, Studentski grad is a common living place for most of the students of Sofia's numerous universities rather than being in the vicinity of one particular university. This helps students from different higher education institutions meet and interact, but on the other hand causes major transportation issues as the bulk of Sofia's university faculties are situated relatively far from the city center and public transport is often unable to cope with Studentski grad's needs. The traffic is frequently congested especially during rush hours - mornings and late afternoons. Regular buses run on average every ten minutes. Fixed-route minibus taxis called marshrutka alleviate the situation. Sofia municipality plans to connect Studentski grad with its metro system. The neighbourhood is affectionately known as \\"Stuttgart\\". The abbreviation from Stud. (Studentski, \\"student\\") and grad (\\"city\\") resembles the name of the German city of Stuttgart.http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2007-09-27&article;=205114  Universities located in Studentski grad  * Technical University of Sofia * University of National and World Economy * University of Mining and Geology * University of Forestry, Sofia * University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy * National Sports Academy, Vassil Levski File:Bulgaria-Sofia- Students-town.jpgView of Studentski grad with the chapel and the polyclinic File:–ë–ª–æ–∫59 2006.jpgA student dormitory in Studentski grad File:Studentski- Grad-Zimnia-Dvorets.jpgThe Winter Palace of Sports on the right along \\"Akad.

The 75 mm Schneider-Danglis 06/09 () was a Greek-designed and French-manufactured mountain gun. The invention of a mountain gun that could easily be broken down to pieces for transport, and reassembled into a highly efficient weapon is claimed by two Greek army engineers, (then) Engineering Corps Major P. Lykoudis, who made such a design in 1891, and then Artillery Major Panagiotis Danglis (Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ ŒîŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒªŒÆœÇ), who made his own design in 1893. Danglis' proposal to the Greek Army Ministry caused an immediate reaction by Lykoudis, who claimed that his designs had been copied. Surprisingly, at the time no particular interest was shown, neither by the Greek military, nor by foreign weapon manufacturers; the rivalry between the two men would continue, though, for several years. Danglis devoted personal effort into developing the design, and eventually convinced French Schneider- Creusot armaments company to construct and test his design. Prototype development, construction and testing were completed between November 1905 and June 1906. Meanwhile, Lykoudis had arranged with the German manufacturer Krupp to develop his design. The final \\"victory\\" for Danglis came in 1907. In that year, after testing, the Greek Army determined that the Schneider-Danglis weapon was superior to the Krupp-Lykoudis and placed an order for the gun with the French manufacturer. Other nations followed with orders, and this mountain gun proved its merits in action (it was used by Greece in the Balkan Wars, World War I and World War II), while Schneider developed the technology further in later models. Danglis' efforts came to a successful conclusion altogether, when a fair financial settlement was made with the French manufacturer concerning the rights to use his design. Notes References * *L.S.

Dick. It was expanded from his short story \\"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\\", first published in the August 1966 edition of Amazing Stories. The novel describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves (\\"old-birth\\"), living their lives in reverse, and eventually returning to the womb where they split into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man.  Plot summary  The story takes place in a (then-future) fictional 1998, and centers on Anarch Peak, a black religious leader who had died in 1971 and is expected to rise soon. Sebastian Hermes, an owner of a small Vitarium (a business that digs up the dead and gives them the treatment they need before returning them to society), discovers Peak's resurrection is imminent. After accidentally discovering the burial place of Peak, he decides, against the law, to dig up the body before the Anarch awakes. (As with contemporary controversies about brain death, it seems not to be judged morally significant if a heartbeat can be heard, but it is illegal to dig anyone up before they start talking, which suggests resumed brain function is a marker of \\"old- birth.\\") Various groups are interested in controlling the affairs of the 'old- born', such as the Vitaria (technically, a person resurrected is in the legal custody of their Vitarium until claimed by family members) and the Library, an organization dedicated to erasing books which have passed beyond the initial date at which they were written. Religious institutions are also interested in 'old-birth', particularly in the resurrection of Anarch Peak in the case of the Udites (an African-American religion) and The Rome Syndicate (the highest authority in Caucasian matters, as well as the owner of numerous religious artifacts and other items, like a syringe that can stop the Hobart Phase for short periods of time). These factions then argue over the ownership of Anarch Peak after his resurrection. When the Library kidnaps Anarch Peak, both factions send Sebastian Hermes to recover him. In the end Peak is killed and there may be an interracial war as a consequence of Peak's permanent death. = The Hobart Phase = The Hobart Phase is the new order of life where people rise from the dead and are rejuvenated. Time reversal apparently began in 1986. Other than aging, Hobart Phase resurrection has changed nutritional and excretion processes and associated social taboos. People do not eat, but instead consume \\"Sogum\\" anally through a pipe, and later \\"plop\\" out food orally, which is done in private, due to its 'shameful' nature. As for smoking, cigarettes are no longer smoked, but the smoke instead blown back into them, making them grow back to normal size (this also clears and freshens the air). \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"hello\\" have reversed their order within standard greetings, and \\"food\\" is used as a drop-in replacement for the expletive \\"shit\\". It is stated that Mars colonists do not have the Hobart Phase on their world, and it is limited to Earth, and presumably its lunar colonies as well. = Divided USA = As hinted in the book, the United States of America has been partitioned into eastern and western segments. Hawaii and Alaska have also seceded from the WUS and FNM, but this is only mentioned in passing. In the WUS (Western United States), California is predominantly white, while the eastern \\"Free Negro Municipality\\" (FNM) is inhabited by African Americans. The fictitious religion of Uditi is the national religion of the East. Uditi is an offshoot of Christianity with apparent influences from Roman Catholicism and the Rastafari movement, and is centered on \\"the udi\\", an experience of a group mind. Inhabitants of the WUS view the religion with suspicion, and it is hinted that their media demonizes its adherents. Library-sanctioned murders and civil unrest are claimed to be the works of religious fanatics. FNM currency is claimed to be worthless, as is WUS currency (stated earlier in the book), but its citizens ignore this due to patriotism.

The book is mostly about the adventures of five-year-old Betsy Ray and her new best friend, Tacy Kelly. It takes place in fictional Deep Valley, Minnesota, based on Mankato, Minnesota, the author's home town. This first book is set in roughly 1898-1899. Plot The adventures between the two friends range from the real life (such as going to school for the first time, making a playhouse out of a piano box, and dressing up to go calling) to the extraordinarily fanciful (such as being taken for a ride in the milkman's magic wagon by his talking horse, and flying away on a cloud while enjoying a picnic). The fanciful adventures are provided by Betsy's active imagination and her love of telling stories. The book deals with the themes of shyness, with the birth of new siblings, with the joys of an active imaginations, and even touches on death within the family. Main characters Betsy Ray (Elizabeth Warrington Ray)- the main character of the series, based on Maud Hart Lovelace herself as a child. Betsy is a gregarious, imaginative child who dreams of being a writer. She loves to tell stories above all else. She is described as chunky with brown braids that stick out from behind her ears. Tacy Kelly (Anna Anastacia Kelly)- Betsy's best friend based on Maud's friend Frances \\"Bick\\" Kenney. A very bashful child with a sensitive soul. Loves listening to Betsy's stories, and helps embellish a few. She is described as spindly with long red ringlets. Julia Ray- Betsy's older, somewhat bossy sister. While she's only three years older than Betsy, she considers herself quite grown-up, and feels free to lord that over the younger Betsy and Tacy. Has a pronounced interest in music that is developed much more extensively in later books. Katie Kelly- Tacy's older, somewhat bossy sister. There are 11 children in the Kelly household in the opening of the book, and Katie is the fourth youngest. She and Julia are best friends. Margaret Ray- a new baby born to the Ray's during the course of the book. Betsy at first feels jealous of the newcomer usurping the 'baby' spot, but after a talk with Tacy, realizes the fun of being an older sibling. Beatrice Kelly- Tacy's baby sister, who dies shortly before Easter. Just as Tacy comforted Betsy in the gaining of a new sibling, Betsy comforts Tacy in the loss of a sibling. Papa (Robert Ray) and Mama (Julia Warrington Ray)- Betsy's parents. Papa runs a shoe store, while Mama minds the home. Her parents aren't particularly well developed until later books. Tom- a neighborhood boy who plays the violin and has a little crush on Tacy. Tib Muller (Thelma Muller)- A little girl who moves into the neighborhood shortly before the end of the book. She's tiny and blond, and knows how to stand on her head. She lives in a chocolate-colored house with a pane of colored glass over the door. She meets Betsy and Tacy because they left Mrs. Ray's calling cards in the Muller's mailbox. Mrs. Muller returned the call, and the three girls eventually met. All become best friends in the two years in between the first book and the second.

Traditionally the Northern side of the LaHave is predominantly on the Lighthouse Route, offering a diverse culture, with both French and English backgrounds. Following the colonization by British and French settlers, German families also immigrated to the South Shore, founding Lunenburg in 1753. Culture Their culture and traditions are apparent in the area from the dialect to the architecture. Middle LaHave has a wide variety of inhabitants, including traditional and local families such as Crouse, Corkum, Schmeisser, Lohnes and Mosher. The culture of the LaHave and its founding fathers continues to spread throughout Nova Scotia.

It is about the death of a gunner in a Sperry ball turret on a World War II American bomber aircraft. > From my mother's sleep I fell into the State, And I hunched in its belly > till my wet fur froze. Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, > I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. When I died they washed me > out of the turret with a hose. Jarrell, who served in the Army Air Forces, provided the following explanatory note: > A ball turret was a Plexiglas sphere set into the belly of a B-17 or B-24, > and inhabited by two .50 caliber machine guns and one man, a short small > man. When this gunner tracked with his machine guns a fighter attacking his > bomber from below, he revolved with the turret; hunched upside-down in his > little sphere, he looked like the fetus in the womb.

The poem inspired the play, \\"The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\\" by Anna Moench, which premiered in New York City at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2008 and was extended to play at The Space in Long Island City. A nod to the poem can also be found in John Irving's 1978 novel The World According to Garp, in which the protagonist's father died from a \\"rather careless lobotomy\\" by enemy gunfire while serving as a ball-turret gunner in World War II, as well as in the name of the Salt Lake City, Utah, based instrumental progressive and post rock band, Black Flak and the Nightmare Fighters.

The instrument is played with a drum stick or notched stick and has a distinctive sound.  History  In outports and remote villages, social gatherings such as concerts, \\"times,\\" mummering, and kitchen parties were an important part of the rural culture. The principal melody instruments were accordions and fiddles. Starting in the 20th century, rhythmic accompaniment came from the ugly stick. The instrument's early history is vague, but there are clear precursors: While often described as a \\"traditional\\" Newfoundland instrument, the ugly stick likely only became familiar to Newfoundland and Labrador audiences in the early 1980s. The Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival Guide for 1987 featured an ugly stick player on the cover. The guide noted the instrument was \\"Not available in any music store\\" and included the following explanation: A 1988 article about a local folk club also deemed it necessary to describe what an ugly stick was, stating: By the 1990s, references to ugly sticks start to appear in local publications. The instrument was likely given a boost by its use by the Folk of the Sea Choir, a fisher choir that formed after the cod moratorium in 1992. At the Choir's first concert in 1994, it was introduced by the Dunne Brothers, Rick and Doug, from Renews, accompanied by Gerard Hamilton. Doug explained his instrument to the audience: Also during the 1990s, ugly sticks became widely available in local music and gift stores, crafted by makers such as Grenfell Letto. Originally from the Labrador Straits, Letto started making mini ugly sticks that tourists could take home more readily than the larger version. In 2012, he was reported as making around 150 large ugly sticks and between 200 and 300 of his mini ugly sticks per year for the tourist market. The name ugly stick was not universal even into the 2000s. In 2007, folklorists Maureen Power and Evelyn Osborne documented the playing of a \\"silly stick\\" by Melvin Combden, Seldom-Come-By, Fogo Island. In the early 2000s, communities started to organize ugly stick making workshops. One early community-organized workshop was held in Trepassey, as part of a Come-Home-Year celebration. Yvonne Fontaine was the then Coordinator for the Southern Avalon Development Association: The Mummers Festival, established in 2009, regularly includes ugly stick making workshops, often featuring Trepassey-based maker Wayne Cave. Founding festival director Ryan Davis noted in 2014, The Festival expanded its workshop program outside of St. John's, including a workshop in Portugal Cove- St. Philips where the sticks were made mostly by families with young children. A workshop on making ugly sticks was included as part of The International Council for Traditional Music World Conference, held in St. John's in 2011, and workshops have been organized independently in communities such as Summerside and Bauline, which held an \\"Ugly Stick Clinic\\" in 2018. Expats and travelling musicians have spread the use of ugly sticks across Canada and internationally. Traditions continued to evolve in the 2000s: a 2000 wedding in Pembroke, Ontario with a \\"Nova Scotia born Newfoundlander\\" bride involved an ugly stick: In 2015, the Terre-Neuve Newfoundlanders & Friends Association organized an ugly stick contest during the Newfie Days Festival in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In 2016, a children's book by Joshua Goudie on ugly sticks was published to emphasize Newfoundland and Labrador's musical culture.  Construction  The instrument's main body is a mop or broom handle, sometimes cut to a desired length. Often, an old rubber boot is attached to the bottom and a tin can acting as a cymbal is attached at the very top. At strategic intervals along the length of the shaft, nails or screws affixed with bottle caps, felt tins, and other noisemakers are nailed into the shaft. The instrument is then decorated with items of colour and fluff to the artist's taste to create an instrument unique to the maker. Art educator Jason Sellers noted in 2008: > The stick must be chosen wisely.Remember: your creation can be simple or > complicated, but either way it will be eccentric. To acquire enough bottle > caps for one ugly stick, you‚Äôll need to preplan at least two long weekends > before your first big gig. A couple dozen will do, but the more bling you > collect, the louder and uglier your stick will be. Go out back to the tool > shed (just like Pop would do) and dig out all that jingles and clangs. If > you can stick a nail through it, and it makes noise, it will work great on > an ugly stick. The instrument has been described as a testament \\"to the creativity of Newfoundlanders to make something inventive out of what would normally be thrown into the garbage.\\"  Playing  The ugly stick is held in one hand at about ÔøΩ up the shaft and the musician would hold a drum stick in the other. The instrument would be lifted and dropped on the floor in a rhythmic fashion while the musician would strike the attachments and cymbal to embellish the sound.  Idiomatic usage  \\"Beaten with an ugly stick\\" and its grammatical forms (\\"[It] looks like someone beat [direct object] with an ugly stick,\\" etc.) are an American English idiom used in reference to someone or something that looks ugly or unappealing, and are unrelated to the musical instrument.

Betsy's Wedding (1955) is the tenth and final book in the Betsy-Tacy series written by Maud Hart Lovelace. Set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the book tells the story of the early married life of the main character, Betsy Ray, and her high-school sweetheart. The characters of Tacy Kelly and Tib Muller also recur in this novel, as they did in all the novels covering the high-school years.  Plot summary  Betsy returns to New York from her European trip, where Joe Willard is waiting for her. He wants to take her to Tiffany's and buy an engagement ring, but the more practical Betsy suggests he buys a wedding band instead. They spend the day in New York City enjoying many of Joe's favorite places, but more importantly renewing their love. Betsy takes a train to Minneapolis, where her parents and younger sister are now living. She breaks the news of her engagement to her family, who are surprised that Joe wants to marry Betsy without first asking her father and without having a job in Minnesota. Her father is very upset. He thinks that Joe should have a job. When Joe arrives at the train station, Betsy tells him that her father is uncomfortable about him not having a job. He immediately drives from newspaper office to newspaper office before finding a job on a publicity campaign to help the people of Belgium (who were the victims of atrocities during World War I). Betsy's father respects Joe's go-getter attitude and allows the wedding to proceed. Joe and Betsy live with her parents while looking for an apartment to rent. With younger sister Margaret's help they find the perfect newlywed's home. Betsy struggles with her first forays into cooking, but eventually becomes a very good cook - and even has fun making some of Joe's favorite foods! Several happy months later, Joe's widowed aunt asks to live with them & Joe tiells her yes, although Betsy resents her coming. Joe is aware of her feelings (she had been hoping to bring a baby into their happy home; not Joe's aunt) & this is the first serious difference of opinion in their marriage. Betsy wants to agree with Joe but cannot help feeling bitter until she has an epiphany & realizes that Joe's generosity is one of the things she loves about him. In the end she enjoys Joe's aunt's company and her wonderful stories, especially when Joe begins working the night shift writing headlines for the newspaper. Meanwhile, Betsy and Tacy unite to try to find a husband for Tib. They introduce her to Mr. Bagshaw (a colleague of Harry's), who quickly falls in love with Tib. He proposes & Tib turns him down. Betsy and Tacy are relieved, having realized that if she had married him, Tib would have moved to NYC. Betsy then introduces Tib to Rocky, a \\"Tramp\\" journalist they meet at \\"The Violent Study Club\\" (a group of friends & fellow writers with whom Betsy & Joe hone their writing skills). But Rocky is terrible to Tib, even ridiculing her in front of friends! Finally Tib ends the relationship with Rocky & he leaves (thank goodness)! Eventually Tib meets a kind & handsome soldier while ice skating and they fall in love. As the book ends, America enters World War I and Joe goes to a nearby officer's training camp. They rent out their house & Betsy returns to her parents' home to live with them for the duration of the war. Before Joe leaves, they are able to attend Tib's wedding in Deep Valley with family members and old friends!

This family of proteins has been suggested to play an important role in innate anti-viral immunity. APOBEC3G belongs to the family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the deamination of cytidine to uridine in the single stranded DNA substrate. The C-terminal domain of A3G renders catalytic activity, several NMR and crystal structures explain the substrate specificity and catalytic activity APOBEC3G exerts innate antiretroviral immune activity against retroviruses, most notably HIV, by interfering with proper replication. However, lentiviruses such as HIV have evolved the Viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein in order to counteract this effect. Vif interacts with APOBEC3G and triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3G via the proteasomal pathway. On the other hand, foamy viruses produce an accessory protein Bet () that impairs the cytoplasmic solubility of APOBEC3G. The two ways of inhibition are distinct from each other, but they can replace each other in vivo.  Discovery  It was first identified by Jarmuz et al. as a member of family of proteins APOBEC3A to 3G on chromosome 22 in 2002 and later also as a cellular factor able to restrict replication of HIV-1 lacking the viral accessory protein Vif. Soon after, it was shown that APOBEC3G belonged to a family of proteins grouped together due to their homology with the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1.  Structure  Figure 1: ‚ÄúStructure model of the N-terminal [catalytic deaminase domain] of [APOBEC3G]. Zinc-coordinating residues are indicated by circles, Œ±-helices are in yellow, and Œ≤-strands are in pink. The position of residue D128 is indicated in the predicted loop between Œ≤4 and Œ±3.‚Äù APOBEC3G has a symmetric structure, resulting in 2 homologous catalytic domains, the N-terminal (CD1) and C-terminal (CD2) domains, each of which contains a coordination site. Each domain also has the typical His/Cys-X-Glu-X23‚Äì28-Pro-Cys-X2-Cys motif for cytidine deaminases. However, unlike the typical cytidine deaminases, APOBEC3G contains a unique alpha helix between two beta sheets in the catalytic domain that could be a cofactor binding site. (Figure 1) CD2 is catalytically active and vital for deamination and motif specificity. CD1 is catalytically inactive, but very important for binding to DNA and RNA and is key to defining the 5‚Äô->3‚Äô processivity of APOBEC3G deamination. CD2 has no deaminase activity without the presence of CD1. Native APOBEC3G is composed of monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers. While it is thought that APOBEC3G functions as a dimer, it is possible that it actually functions as a mix of monomers and oligomers. The D128 amino acid residue, which lies within CD1 (Figure 1), appears to be particularly important for APOBEC3G interactions with Vif because a D128K point mutation prevents Vif-dependent depletion of APOBEC3G. Additionally, amino acids 128-130 on APOBEC3G form a negatively charged motif that is critical for interactions with Vif and the formation of APOBEC3G-Vif complexes. Furthermore, residues 124-127 are important for encapsidation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 virions and the resulting antiretroviral activity.  Mechanism of action  APOBEC3G has been widely studied and several mechanisms that negatively affect HIV-1 replication have been identified. = Cytidine deamination and hypermutation = Figure 2: ‚ÄúThe mechanism of cytidine deamination by direct nucleophilic attack at position 4 of the pyrimidine ring. This mechanism has been proposed for bacterial cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that shows homology to APOBEC1 and activation- induced deaminase (AID) in the vicinity of the nucleotide or Zn2+ binding region.‚Äù Because APOBEC3G can acts as an AID and is a member of the APOBEC superfamily like APOBEC1, it is likely that a similar mechanism is mediated by APOBEC3G for cytidine deamination. APOBEC3G and other proteins in the same family are able to act as activation-induced (cytidine) deaminases (AID). APOBEC3G interferes with reverse transcription by inducing numerous deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine mutations in the negative strand of the HIV DNA primarily expressed as complementary DNA (cDNA) in a 3‚Äô->5‚Äôprocessive manner. Because APOBEC3G is part of the APOBEC superfamily and acts as an AID, it is likely that the mechanism mediated by APOBEC3G for cytidine deamination is similar to that of an E. coli cytidine deaminase that is known to be highly homologous to APOBEC1 and AID around the nucleotide and zinc-binding region. The predicted deamination reaction is driven by a direct nucleophilic attack on position 4 of the cytidine pyrimidine ring by the zinc-coordinated enzyme. Water is needed as a source of both a proton and hydroxyl group donor (Figure 2). The deamination (and resulting oxidation) at position 4 yields a carbonyl group and results in a change from cytidine to uridine. The deamination activity ultimately results in G‚ÜíA hypermutations at ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù of the proviral DNA. Such hypermutation ultimately destroys the coding and replicative capacity of the virus, resulting in many nonviable virions. APOBEC3G has a much weaker antiviral effect when its active site has been mutated to the point that the protein can no longer mutate retroviral DNA. It was originally thought that the APOBEC3G-mediated deamination can also indirectly lead to viral DNA degradation by DNA repair systems attracted to the mutated residues. However, this has been discounted because human APOBEC3G reduces viral cDNA levels independently of DNA repair enzymes UNG and SMUG1. = Interference with reverse transcription = APOBEC3G interferes with reverse transcription of HIV-1 independent of DNA deamination. tRNA3Lys typically binds to the HIV-1 primer binding site to initiate reverse transcription. APOBEC3G can inhibit tRNA3Lys priming, thereby negatively affecting viral ssDNA production and virus infectivity. It is predicted that reverse transcription is also negatively affected by APOBEC3G binding to viral RNA and causing steric alterations. = Interference with viral DNA integration = APOBEC3G was associated with interference of viral DNA integration into the host genome in a manner dependent on functional catalytic domains and deaminase activity. Mbisa et al. saw that APOBEC3G interferes with the processing and removal of primer tRNA from the DNA minus strand, thus leading to aberrant viral 3‚Äô long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA ends. These viral DNA ends are inefficient substrates for integration and plus-strand DNA transfer. As a result, HIV-1 provirus formation is inhibited. Biological Function Figure 3: Four proposed mechanisms of APOBEC3G encapsidation in HIV-1 virions. The mechanisms involving interaction with viral RNA and interaction with Gag proteins have been extensively confirmed. APOBEC3G mRNA is expressed in certain cells, referred to as non-permissive cells, in which HIV-1 cannot properly infect and replicate in the absence of Vif. Such cells include physiologically relevant primary CD4 T lymphocytes and macrophages. The encapsidation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 virions is very important for the spread of APOBEC3G and the exertion of anti-retroviral activity. Encapsidation of APOBEC3G may occur by at least the following four proposed mechanisms (Figure 3): 1. Non-specific packaging of APOBEC3G 2. APOBEC3G interaction with host RNA 3. APOBEC3G interaction with viral RNA 4. Interaction of APOBEC3G with HIV-1 Gag proteins. Only the latter two mechanisms have been extensively supported. The amount that is incorporated into virions is dependent on the level of APOBEC3G expression within the cell producing the virion. Xu et al. conducted studies with PBMC cells and found that, in the absence of Vif, 7¬±4 APOBEC3G molecules were incorporated into the virions and resulted in potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication. In addition to deterring replication of exogenous retroviruses, A3G also acts upon human endogenous retroviruses, leaving similar signatures of hypermutations in them.  Disease relevance  APOBEC3G is expressed within the non-permissive cells and is a key inhibitory factor of HIV-1 replication and infectivity. However, Vif counteracts this antiretroviral factor, enabling production of viable and infective HIV-1 virions in the presence of APOBEC3G activity . In particular, Vif prevents incorporation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 virions and promotes destruction of the enzyme in a manner independent of all other HIV-1 proteins. While APOBEC3G has typically been studied as a vital protein exhibiting potent antiviral effects on HIV-1, recent studies have elucidated the potential of APOBEC3G-mediated mutation to help to facilitate the propagation HIV-1. The number of deaminations in the preferred regions varies from one to many, possibly dependent on the time of exposure to APOBEC3G. Additionally, it has been shown that there is a dose response between intracellular APOBEC3G concentration and degree of viral hypermutation. Some HIV-1 proviruses with APOBEC3G-mediated mutation have been shown to thrive because they carry too few mutations at APOBEC3G hotspots or because recombination between a lethally APOBEC3G-restricted provirus and a viable provirus has occurred. Such sublethal mutagenesis contributes to greater genetic diversity among the HIV-1 virus population, demonstrating the potential for APOBEC3G to enhance HIV-1‚Äôs ability to adapt and propagate.

Operation A gamma ray may interact with a single Ge crystal and deposit its full energy. The resulting charge collected will then be proportional to this energy. However, through the process of Compton scattering, a gamma ray may interact with two (or possibly more) crystals resulting in the energy (and thus the liberated charge) being shared by the crystals. In this case, a process known as add-back, where the charge collected by each of the crystals is summed, can be used to determine the energy of the incident gamma ray. Advantages There are a number of advantages offered by using clover detectors as opposed to the more conventional single crystal germanium detectors. Large volume high purity single crystals of Ge can be expensive. By mounting four smaller crystals in a common cryostat a detector of a given volume can be created at a reduced cost. In addition, the individual smaller Ge crystals present a smaller solid angle than a large volume Ge detector thus significantly reducing the effects of Doppler broadening on the resulting spectra. A clover detector can also be used to determine the electric or magnetic nature of the incident photons (e.g. if the gamma ray is an electric quadrupole or a magnetic dipole) as the Compton scattering process for these two types of radiation is different.

In her will Isabel named King Richard as her heir, requesting him to grant her younger son, Richard, an annuity of 500 marks. The King complied.

How it operated  The hovering Flymo lawnmowers are based on a hovercraft, where there is a fan, and it floats on a cushion of air. To do this, it has a fan attached to the cutting blades, that pushes air downward, making the lawnmower float. The mowers body is plastic, and has an petrol motor to power the fan/blade combo.  UK Manufacturing Plant  In the 1970's, Flymo had grown, and had started to produce all of their lawnmowers in their UK production plant in Durham, where they still make them today. The flagship orange colour was introduced in 1977.  Product Range Growth  * 1980s The world saw the introduction of a new kind of non-hovering electric type lawnmower; the Chevron. It is an electrically powered, wheeled lawnmower that is aimed at gardeners who wanted nice, clean mowing lines, but also want the benefit of a modern electric mower. In the United States, the Flymo was introduced to considerable advertising fanfare in the early '80s. Although the unit achieved a great deal of attention and curiosity, not many sold in America. * 1990s In the 1990's, Flymo's focus as a company changed from just making lawnmowers, to making garden tools like blowers and strimmers.

A real brainbox- practically knows everything about everything. He and Preston temporarily fall out in the first episode. Hilda and Matilda- Twins who always speak in unison. Tall Tina- A girl who towers above her classmates. Jemima- A snobbish girl on whom Preston has a crush. The feeling is not returned. =Teachers= Edith Concrete - Headmistress. She only appears in the first episode, but we get the impression that she is draconian. Mr. Nigel North - Preston and his friends' class teacher. Mr. North is a draconian teacher, hence \\"Nutter North\\", the nickname Preston gives him. His identical twin brother, Neil North, substitutes for him for a short period while he is ill. Mr. North is a draconian teacher, whereas Neil is nauseatingly nice. They are identical twins, which makes the students think that Mr. North has had a dramatic change of character, until they see them together. Another teacher, Mr. South, is mentioned very near the beginning, but never appears. We gain the impression that he is a decent man, as Preston and his friends think he is going to be teaching him this year, and are looking forward to it. =Other characters= All characters below appear in only one episode, with the exception of Basher Baines; The Queen appears in one episode, with two corgis, Kylie and Britney.

Episode 1- On a boring field trip to the concrete museum, Albert Scheinstein works out a theory to make concrete stronger, and is hailed as a hero. He becomes rich and snobbish, spurning his old friends. But everything goes wrong when it is discovered that the concrete smells of old socks. Everyone turns against him, and he loses all his wealth. Albert tries to make it up with his friends. They are reluctant, especially Preston, until Albert's rubber concrete saves them from a bus crash- then everything is forgotten. Episode 2- The class think Mr. North has become nice, but it turns out to be his twin brother, Neil, who is as different in temperament from his brother as he could possibly be. He makes learning fun through musical geography and trampolining trigonometry, but it doesn't last long- Mr. North returns, badder than ever.

The camp owner, Mr. Root, serves them some delicious food, but Mr. North throws up and passes out when he discovers what was in the sausages- squirrel.

Biography Archibald Paull Burt was born in 1810, in Saint Christopher (present day Saint Kitts and Nevis) in the West Indies. He was the son of George Henry Burt, sugar planter and Speaker of the House Assembly of Saint Christopher. He was educated in England where he qualified as a lawyer at the Middle Temple. He returned to his native island in 1835 where he practised as a barrister. Following in his father's footsteps he held the position of Speaker of the House of Assembly of the Islands and in 1848 he was made Attorney General of Saint Christopher and Anguilla and Queen's Counsel. In 1835 and 1836 Burt was awarded compensation by the British government for relinquishing slaves in Saint Christopher.Fernandes, C. Island Off the Coast of Asia: Instruments of statecraft in Australian foreign policy (Melbourne: Monash University Publishing, 2018), 15. The claim on 5 October 1835 for 3 enslaved, yielded ¬£67 0s 3d to Burt himself. Two claims were awarded on 15 February 1836 to Burt and Francis Spencer Wigley (who became President of Saint Christopher in 1880 and of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla in 1888) for 3 and 4 slaves, netting a total of ¬£119 7s 9d for seven enslaved people. In 1857 he briefly occupied the position of Chief Justice on his native island but the appointment was not confirmed by the Colonial Office as policy did not favour the appointment of locally born barristers to the judiciary. Sir Archibald began to look elsewhere for judicial office, eventually accepting the post of Civil Commissioner and Chairman of Quarter Sessions in Western Australia. He had hoped that this would be a stepping stone to returning to his native island at a later date. He arrived in Western Australia with his wife, Louisa Bryan, and five children on 29 January 1861. In June of that year, the Supreme Court ordinance was proclaimed, thus establishing the Supreme Court of Western Australia. Sir Archibald was appointed Chief Justice and Advocate General. The initial years of the Supreme Court were characterised mainly by the lack of work. Western Australia was a small colony with few legal issues. Civil work consisted mainly of insolvency and probate, and criminal offences were rare. The size of the profession was so small that only four barristers actively practised in Perth in the early 1860s. In the early years of the court, Sir Archibald was conspicuous for his support of maintaining the division between barristers and solicitors, and also for his domination of the legal fraternity. He often gave advice to the Governor and Executive Council that was at odds with that of the Attorney General, George Frederick Stone. As Chief Justice, Sir Archibald gained a reputation for applying the letter of the law. However, considering the conditions of a frontier colony like Western Australia this was necessary and gained Burt widespread respect. He was no stranger to controversy in his time as Chief Justice. In 1869 he jailed three newspaper owners for criticism of his handling of the revocation of an ex-convict's ticket of leave. Despite widespread criticism of this action, Sir Archibald remained implacable in his defence of his duty to protect the integrity of the Court. As his tenure continued, Sir Archibald gave up any hope of returning to the West Indies, and despite failing health during his last years, remained Chief Justice until his death in November, 1879. He had been a towering figure in Western Australian society and left an indelible mark on the legal profession. Sir Archibald had not courted popularity but he had earned, for himself and the new Supreme Court, widespread respect. The Burt family would continue to be part of Western Australia's legal profession for years to come. Sir Archibald's son, Septimus, would serve as Attorney General and sometime Acting Premier in the early years of responsible government in Western Australia and a century later his great-grandson, Sir Francis Burt would serve as Chief Justice, Lieutenant Governor and Governor.

Ivanov was first performed in 1887, when Fiodor Korsh, owner of the Korsh Theatre in Moscow, commissioned Chekhov to write a comedy. Chekhov, however, responded with a four-act drama, which he wrote in ten days. The first performance was not a success and the production disgusted Chekhov himself. In a letter to his brother, he wrote that he \\"did not recognise his first remarks as my own\\" and that the actors \\"do not know their parts and talk nonsense\\". Irritated by this failure, Chekhov made alterations to the play. Consequently, the final version is different from that first performance. After this revision, it was accepted to be performed in St. Petersburg in 1889. Chekhov's revised version was a success and offered a foretaste of the style and themes of his subsequent masterpieces. Characters * Nikolai Ivanov ‚Äì A government official concerned with peasant affairs, Chekhov paints him as the quintessentially melancholy Russian from the upper social strata. Severely afflicted by internal conflicts; his loss of appetite for life, love of his wife, and external pressures; managing his estate and his debts, collide in a melodramatic climax. * Anna (born as Sarah Abramson) ‚Äì Ivanov's wife of 5 years who (unknowingly) suffers from tuberculosis. She renounced her Jewish heritage and converted to Russian Orthodox in order to marry Ivanov. * Paul Lebedev ‚Äì Chairman of the rural district council. Confidant and good friend to Ivanov. * Zinaida ‚Äì Lebedev's wife. She is a wealthy lender to whom Ivanov owes a large sum of money. * Sasha ‚Äì The Lebedevs' 20-year-old daughter. She is infatuated with Ivanov, an infatuation which ends in her nearly marrying him. * Eugene Lvov ‚Äì A pompous young doctor on the council's panel, and an honest man. Throughout the play, he moralizes and attacks Ivanov's character. He later resolves to reveal what he believes are Ivanov's intentions in marrying Sasha. * Count Matthew Shabelsky ‚Äì Ivanov's maternal uncle, a geriatric buffoon. He indulges in antisemitic jokes but his tenderness to Anna is unmistakable. * Martha Babakina ‚Äì A young widow, estate-owner, and the daughter of a rich businessman. She has a turbulent relationship with the Count. * Michael Borkin ‚Äì A distant relative of Ivanov and manager of his estate. Somewhat of a jester, he comes out with many money-making schemes throughout the play ‚Äì including his proposal for the Count and Martha Babakina to marry. * Dmitry Kosykh ‚Äì An excise officer. Synopsis The play tells the story of Nikolai Ivanov, a man struggling to regain his former glory. For the past five years, he has been married to Anna Petrovna, a disinherited 'jewess', who has become very ill. Ivanov's estate is run by a distant relative, Mikhail Borkin, who is frequently advising people on how he can help them make money. The doctor, Lvov, an 'honest' man as he frequently reminds the rest of the cast, informs Ivanov that his wife is dying of tuberculosis, and that she needs to recover by going to the Crimea. Unfortunately, Ivanov is unable, and unwilling, to pay for the trip. He is heavily in debt and already owes Zinaida Lebedeva 9000 roubles. Ivanov is criticised for heartlessness and for spending time with the Lebedevs instead of his seriously ill wife. At the end of Act One, Ivanov departs to visit the Lebedevs, and unbeknown to him is followed by Anna and Lvov. Act Two shows a party at Lebedevs', and features various people discussing Ivanov. They say his only motive for marrying Anna was for the large dowry; however, when she married him, she was forced to convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy and was disowned. Lebedev is married to Zinaida, who manages his money-lending, and they have a daughter, Sasha, who is infatuated with Ivanov. She throws herself at Ivanov and he is unable to resist: the act concludes with the two kissing. Unfortunately, Anna arrives unexpectedly at just this moment and witnesses the betrayal. Act Three shows a number of conversations between Ivanov and other members of the cast ‚Äì Lebedev begs Ivanov to repay his debts, and Lvov confronts Ivanov once again about the heartless way he treats Anna. Sasha then appears, concerned by Ivanov's refusal to visit since the incident at the end of Act Two. The act then ends with Anna confronting Ivanov about Sasha's visit, and about how he has lied and cheated on her for the entirety of their marriage. Ivanov's anger is aroused by the false accusation and in a fit of anger he reveals to her that she is dying. Act Four occurs around a year after the previous acts. Anna has died, and Ivanov and Sasha are preparing to marry. As the wedding is about to begin, Lvov appears, planning to unveil Ivanov's 'evil' intentions ‚Äì believing Ivanov is simply marrying Sasha for the dowry. He makes the accusation publicly and even though other characters have previously expressed doubts they all leap to Ivanov's defence and challenge Lvov to duels. Ivanov finds the whole situation amusing, returning to his old self, and takes out his gun. Sasha realises what he is about to do, but is unable to stop him: Ivanov runs away from the crowd and shoots himself, abruptly ending the play. Adaptations The play is frequently produced in English and several translations are available. The Vivian Beaumont Theater at the Lincoln Center in New York used a colloquial version from David Hare in 1997 ‚Äì that version was premiered at the Almeida Theatre in London earlier that year and revived with a few changes at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2015 alongside Hare's versions of Platonov and The Seagull. David Harrower's version was presented at the National Theatre, London, in 2002. Using a translation by actress Helen Rappaport, Tom Stoppard adapted the play for a production at Wyndham's Theatre in London in 2008, starring Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hiddleston. SiNNERMAN Ensemble mounted the work at the Viaduct Theater in Chicago, to great success in 2009 with direction and adaptation by Sheldon Patinkin. An adaptation by Michael Nathanson, with the setting transported to Winnipeg, Manitoba in the 1950s, was staged by the Winnipeg Jewish Theatre in 2014.\\"WJT's Ivanov breathes life into Chekhov classic\\".

Charles Purdom recounts that, at the end of December, 1921, Upasni made several comments relating to Meher Baba. He said to his disciples: \\"I have given my charge to Meherwanji. He is the holder of my key.\\" Some time later he said \\"This boy will move the world. Humanity at large will be benefited at his hands.\\" A few days later he sent for Gustadji Hansotia, one of his leading disciples, and told him \\"I have made Meherwanji perfect. He is the Sadguru of this Age. Now you have to leave me and stick to him.\\" To Behramji he said, \\"Your friend is God-realized; carry out every command and every desire of his.\\" Finally, one night he folded his hands and said, \\"Meherwanji, you are adi-shakti: you are Avatar.\\"Purdom, op. cit., p. 26.

Career Reilly was not interested in rugby league as a child and only watched a few Huddersfield matches until a friend at school encouraged him to play for a local amateur side. Paul started playing for Moldgreen Under-14s and discovered a real talent for the game. He was playing well at Moldgreen and as a result he attended trials at Halifax Blue Sox. They offered him a contract for 1997's Super League III, but as the 1996 season was only halfway through he was training at the Huddersfield Giants, after four or five weeks the then coach of the Huddersfield Giants, Darryl van der Velde had seen enough and offered him a deal. In 2001, he spent a month on loan at Batley Bulldogs. Reilly established himself as the first choice at Huddersfield Giants, and he was a stand-out player in both the successful 2002 Northern Ford Premiership campaign and then later in the Super League, where his passionate, whole-hearted performances were a key factor in the Huddersfield Giants establishing themselves as a competitive club. He played twice for England in the 2004 European Nations Cup, including a man of the match performance in the final against Ireland, in which he scored two tries in the first seventeen minutes.https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/rugby- league/news/superstar-reilly-gets-top-accolades-5084806 He featured for his home town team in the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, where he performed a memorable try-saving tackle on Ade Gardner to keep his side in the game in the first half.

He scored 8 tries in the season and helped to steer the Huddersfield Giants to a memorable 5th-placed finish in Super League. It was announced in August 2007 that the Huddersfield Giants would not be renewing Reilly's contract, respecting his wish to retire, and he was proudly carried off the field by team-mates following the club's 16-22 play-off defeat by Hull F.C. at the end of 2007's Super League XII . Despite intending to retire, Reilly was offered a lucrative contract by Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in September 2007 and signed for the club. However, after only four appearances it was revealed that he had sustained a serious neck injury and it seemed likely he would never play again. However, he overcame this injury and played for Oldham in the Co-operative Championship 1.

The group unveiled a plaque at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas in memory of John Lennon and George Harrison. Starting in late October 2010, Cirque du Soleil offered backstage tours of the Love theatre. The experience allows visitors to see the backstage wings, training rooms, costume workshop, break area, and go up to a catwalk into the sound and lighting booths. Not every experience will be the same, as the tour is conducted around a \\"regular day\\", so performers may or may not be training, rehearsing, or even working out. Leading up to the show's 10th anniversary in July 2016, producers updated the production, which included changes to imagery, costumes, and acts, as well as the addition and removal of pieces of music. As of October of 2019, the production still continues. Set and technical information The Love stage moments before start of show; two of the scrims can be seen. Created by French designer Jean Rabasse, the Love theater at The Mirage houses 6,351 speakers and 2,013 seats set around a central stage. Each seat is fitted with three speakers,Cope, Matthew (2006). Love Story. M Lifestyle Volume 4, Issue 3: 40-42. including a pair in the headrest. The sound system was designed by Jonathan Deans. The stage includes 11 lifts, 4 traps, and 13 automated tracks and trolleys. Each lift is capable of lifting 20,000 pounds The LOVE theatre features 32 digital projectors that are used in the show. Everything is digital from source to screen, making very large high definition digital 100‚Äô wide panoramic images. Video images on two walls above the audience on two sides of the auditorium emphasize elements of the show and provide transitions. High-definition projectors also create enormous images (designed by Francis Laporte) on four translucent screens that can be unfurled to divide the auditorium. The Love theater, which replaced the Siegfried & Roy theater at The Mirage, is said to have cost more than $100 million. The theater is set up as a circular theatre in the round, with seats 360 degrees around the stage. There are four balconies in the theater, and the furthest seat from the absolute center of the stage is only 98 feet. The closest seat to the absolute center of the stage is 23 feet and 4 inches, which is only 2 feet and 9 inches from the edge of the stage. Storyline The loose story of the production traces the Beatles‚Äô biography in broad strokes from the Blitz, through the band's founding and climb into superstardom, their psychedelic and spiritual works and their break-up in 1970. The finale is a joyous celebration of The Beatles' \\"reunion\\" that the show itself represents. Love traces this path without relying on literal or historical representations of individual people. Its landscape is inhabited by fictional characters plucked from the Beatles' lyrics. Sgt. Pepper, a central figure, encounters many familiar faces, including Lucy in the Sky, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna and Mr. Kite. In an exception to this stylistic choice, the \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" scene features a character resembling Krishna. Similarly, several scenes include mop-topped, dark-haired figures in black suits who resemble the Beatles. The international cast totals 65 performers. Each song or medley is the name of a scene. Characters Love entrance at the Mirage Love has a plethora of characters which are inspired by the music of the Beatles. * Doctor Robert: The host of Love (Portrayed by Fabio Esposito de Castro). * Eleanor Rigby: An English woman (Portrayed by Silvia Aderne). * Father McKenzie: A preacher from older times (Portrayed by Eugene Brim). * Fool: A strange man on Roller skates (Portrayed by Jolly Goodfellow and Nate Cooper). * Groupies: The unrelenting fans of the Beatles * Her Majesty: As a symbol of pride for the nation, she is often seen in a large oval frame (Portrayed by Craig Berman). * Julia: Evokes John Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon (Portrayed by Alya Titarenko). * Mr. Kite and Helter Skelter: (Portrayed by Kris Carrison). * Kids of Liverpool * Krishna: Unites the cultures and sounds of the East and West. * Lady Madonna: A character who represents motherhood (Portrayed by Natasha Jean-Bart). * Lucy and the Firemen: A duo of lovers (Portrayed by Evelyn Lamontagne and Valeriy Kahrun). * Mr. Piggy: Represents the aristocratic traditional values (Portrayed by Lincoln Hudson). * Nowhere Men: Represent the zeitgeist of Love (Portrayed by Barthelemy Glumineau, Goos Meeuwsen, Jonathan Meunier, and Gabriel Rosas). * Nurses: The caregiving stagehands of Love. * Sailors * Sgt.

Many include juxtaposed elements, such as traditional and Victorian fashions being combined with colorful, imaginative designs. Many of the costumes are highly sophisticated and voluminous, almost as if taken from a cartoon. For example, Savile Row tailoring traditions were utilized for the Sgt. Pepper Parade, turning the outfits inside out. Music Unlike most other Cirque productions, which feature live music, Love uses prerecorded material from The Beatles catalog. Many of the original Abbey Road Studios recording session tapes have been reorchestrated and inspired Love's dance, acrobatics, as well as visual and theatrical effects. Sir George Martin, The Beatles original producer, and his son Giles Martin worked with the entire archive of Beatles recordings to create the musical component for Love. The result is an unprecedented approach to the music for a stage production. Love samples 120 songs to create 27 musical pieces. The songs are mixed so that the lyrics and instrumentation from one song blend into the next. One musical highlight of the show is a new version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", which matches the first studio demo of the song with a string arrangement written for Love by Sir George Martin. A commercial soundtrack of the show was released in November 2006. Filmography A documentary on the making of Love titled All Together Now was released on October 20, 2008.

On December 9, 1852, the Pacific Railroad had its inaugural run, traveling from its depot on Fourteenth Street, along the Mill Creek Valley, to CheltenhamFrisco Depots: St. Louis County, Missouri in about ten minutes. By the following May, it had reached Kirkwood; within months tunnels west of Kirkwood were completed, allowing the line to reach Franklin. The Southwest Branch of the Pacific Railroad was authorized in 1852 and split off at Franklin (renamed Pacific, Missouri, in 1859), as the Southwest Pacific Railroad (later the main line of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway) in 1866. Financial difficulties meant that Pacific Railroad did not reach Washington, eighteen miles away, until February 1855. Later that year, the line reached Jefferson City, the state capital. By July 1858 the Pacific Railroad reached Tipton, the eastern terminus for the Butterfield Overland Mail, an overland mail service to San Francisco. The combined rail/coach service reduced mail delivery times between St. Louis and San Francisco from about 35 days to less than 25 days. In 1865, it became the first railroad to serve Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railroad by new investors after a railroad debt crisis.

WightFibre provides telephone and broadband internet services. It is the last remaining cable company in the UK which is not part of Virgin Media, which since March 2006, has operated more than 95% of cable services in the UK. Historically WightFibre has operated a hybrid fibre-coaxial network (HFC) service around 25% of the Island. In November 2017 WightFibre secured ¬£35M of funding from Infracapital Partners (ICP, part of M&G; Investments) matched funded by private investors and the UK Governments Digital Infrastructure Fund. This funding is allowing WightFibre to upgrade its HFC network to a full-fibre (Fibre to the Premise(FTTP)) network and to extend coverage to around 60,000 homes on the island. WightFibre's Gigabit Island project commenced in Autumn 2018. By January 2019 the rollout of the new full fibre network was in full flow. The first 50,000 homes are expected to be complete by December 2020. Broadband speeds of up to 900Mb are on offer. Company History The Isle of Wight Cable and Telephone Company (IOWCTC) was formed in 2000 and commenced offering service on the island in January 2001. IOWCTC was taken over by CLS Holdings in 2002 and rebranded to Wightcable. CLS Holdings sold the assets of Wightcable to private investors in 2005 who formed WightCable (2005) Ltd. New branding was introduced, services upgraded and internet speeds increased. When Virgin Media acquired Smallworld in 2014 this left WightFibre as the sole independent UK cable company. In 2012, WightCable changed its name to WightFibre, promising increased internet speeds up to 100Mbit/s, and introducing IPTV with high-definition channels and on-demand services. A ¬£500,000 investment saw the launch of 50Mb broadband in July 2012, 100Mb broadband in September 2012 and 152Mb broadband in 2013. The company advertised heavily and returned to growth in October 2012. A small scale trial of the company's new IP based TV service was held in Nov & Dec 2012 but technical difficulties and difficulties in striking content agreements led to the cancellation of the project in 2013. In February 2013 WightFibre was acquired by Keith Young, a serial entrepreneur who was also an original investor in Easynet (which was later purchased by Sky). The management team remained in place and the company's strategy remained unchanged. Keith Young invested in the company to accelerate the turnaround. WightFibre has partnered with two Isle of Wight-based wireless operators ‚Äì Click4Internet and Wight Wireless ‚Äì to extend island coverage with plans to improve that coverage to provide speeds of 50Mb to 80Mb throughout the island. In 2015 WightFibre acquired Click4Internet. In November 2017 WightFibre was acquired by Infracapital Partners as part of its ¬£35M investment in the company.

Renamed the Bermuda Rifles in 1951, it was amalgamated into the Bermuda Regiment in 1965. Formation Although Bermuda had maintained its own militia from 1612 until the end of the American War of 1812, it had been allowed to lapse thereafter due to the large garrison of regular soldiers that had been established following US independence. The reason for the military garrison in Bermuda was ultimately the protection of the Royal Naval dockyard on Ireland Island. At the time, the primary defence was seen to be by the coastal artillery, mounted in various batteries and fortifications and manned by the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). A voluntary reserve was created for the RGA at the same time, titled the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA). If, despite the best efforts of the artillery, enemy vessels succeeded in landing military forces on Bermuda (which was most likely to be achieved using small boats to cross over the reefs to reach beaches on the South Shore), the infantry was expected to tackle them, in the worst scenario, making a fighting withdrawal into the forts and the dockyard itself. Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps cap badge The BVRC was formed under an act of the Colonial Parliament, passed in 1892. Captain Charles Spencer Brown Evans-Lombe, of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), arrived in November, 1894, to oversee the raising of the Corps, and became the first Adjutant. The BVRC was originally divided into three companies (A, B, and C), one each located in the West End, the centre, and the East End of Bermuda. Headquarters was located centrally, where a fourth Company, D, was added. Twelve officers were appointed, including the Commanding Officer, Major Sir Josiah Rees, three for each of the original three companies, a Surgeon-Lieutenant and a Chaplain. To these were added four Permanent Staff, attached from the Regular Army, including Captain Evans-Lombe, a Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), and two Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO). The mandated strength of the Corps was 300, all ranks.\\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History Of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\\", Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M. Hind), . Printed by The Island Press Ltd., Pembroke, Bermuda. The lowest rank in the BVRC, as with other rifle regiments, was Rifleman, which was equivalent to a private in a normal infantry regiment (the first rifle regiments had been distinguished from infantry units by their weapons, their tactics, and their green (camouflage) uniforms. When the Enfield rifle replaced the musket as the standard weapon of the British Army, there ceased to be any distinction between the equipment and tactics of the infantry and those of the rifle and light infantry regiments). Recruitment into the BVRC was restricted to white males, aged 17 to 50, although the barrier to non-whites was achieved by requiring volunteers to be members of a rifle club. All of the private rifle clubs, at the time, restricted their membership to whites. The terms of service for the Bermudian volunteers were similar to those of Volunteers in Britain. Enlistment was voluntary, and a member could leave the Corps by giving fourteen days notice, except while embodied for active service, or training on a military camp-when he also became subject to Military Law. Whereas Volunteers in Britain were originally expected to pay for their uniforms and equipment (including their rifles), Bermudian volunteers were issued these. The uniform was rifle green with black buttons, in conformity with other rifle regiments throughout the Empire, but khaki uniforms were issued from 1898. A minimum attendance at drills, and completion of annual inspection and musketry tests, was required for a volunteer to be returned as 'efficient'. The Corps could be called out in times of War, or in response to an invasion, but volunteers could not be sent overseas without their consent. Great War BVRC officers attached to 2/4th Btn East Yorkshire Regiment in 1918 The BVRC continued to train and develop over the next two decades. When war was declared in 1914, it was embodied to fulfill its role within the Garrison.The Royal Gazette, 6 August 1914: Government Notices. A (Martial Law Regulations). As the economy would have suffered from taking so many young men from their jobs, some soldiers continued to perform their civil jobs, before taking their turns standing sentry at the many places around Bermuda that the BVRC guarded. The primary task the BVRC was given was guarding the coastline but it filled other roles, the most important of which was as a staging point for trans-Atlantic convoys, overseen from the Royal Navy's dockyard on Ireland Island. =Overseas contingents= Bullock's Boys.

This contingent was composed of volunteers who were already serving, as well as those who enlisted specifically for the Front. The Contingent trained at Warwick Camp through the winter and spring. It consisted of Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks.The Royal Gazette, 26 January 1915: B.V.R.C. The Active Service Contingent. Memorandum From His Excellency The Governor. Appeal For Recruits. As there was a shortage of officers, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Sir George Bullock, filled the role of Adjutant, a position normally filled by a Captain. As a consequence, the contingent was popularly known as Bullock's Boys. The Contingent left Bermuda for England in June 1915, travelling to Canada, then crossing the Atlantic in company with a much larger Canadian draft. It had been hoped that the Contingent could be attached to the Second Battalion of The Lincolnshire Regiment (2 Lincolns), which had been on Garrison in Bermuda when the War began. When the Contingent arrived at the Lincolns depot in Grimsby, the 2nd Battalion was already in France and it was attached to 3 Lincolns instead (at least one Bermudian, though not from the BVRC, Corporal G.C. Wailes, did serve with the 2nd Lincolns).The Royal Gazette, 29 December 1914: Corporal Wailes Wounded.The Royal Gazette, 27 April 1915: Corporal G. Wailes. The First to Return. Although commanders at the Regimental Depot had wanted to break the Contingent apart, re-enlist its members as Lincolns, and distribute them as replacements, a letter from the War Office ensured that they remained together as a unit, under their own badge. The contingent was attached to 1 Lincolns (although its men remained on the strength of 3 Lincolns) as an extra company, and arrived in France in July 1915, the first colonial volunteer unit to reach the Front. The contingent remained as such until the following summer, by when its strength had been too reduced by casualties to compose a full company, having lost 50 percent of its remaining strength at Gueudecourt on 25 September 1916. The survivors of the First Contingent were merged with a Second Contingent, of one officer and 36 other ranks, who had trained in Bermuda as Vickers machine gunners, which had recently arrived from Bermuda. The Second Contingent was stripped of its Vickers machine guns (which had been collected, in the Army, under a new regiment, the Machine Gun Corps). The merged contingents were retrained as Lewis light machinegunners, and provided 12 gun teams to 1 Lincolns headquarters. By the War's end, the two contingents had lost over 75 percent of their combined strength. Forty had died on active service, one received the O.B.E and six the Military Medal. Sixteen private soldiers from the two contingents were commissioned, including the Sergeant Major of the First Contingent, Colour-Sergeant R. C. Earl, who became Commanding Officer of the BVRC after the war. Some of those commissioned moved to other units in the process, including flying ace Arthur Rowe Spurling and Henry J. Watlington, who both went to the Royal Flying Corps (at least seventeen other Bermudians served the RFC, including another BVRC rifleman, later Major Cecil Montgomery- Moore, who detached from the Corps in Bermuda and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross in France. An NCO from the overseas contingent also transferred to the RFC). By the end of the war, the BVRC had earned the battle honours Ypres 1915, Neuve Chapelle, Loos, Somme 1916, Ypres 1917, Lys, Hindenburg Line, Messines 1917, Somme 1918. They had not seen the last of warfare, however. In 1918, the 1 Lincolns were withdrawn from France and sent to Ireland to combat the army of the Irish Republic, declared in 1916. The BVRC benefited from Army Order No.1, which increased the pay of most soldiers in the British Army‚Äîbut that same Order did not benefit the British West Indies Regiment, which was treated as being \\"native\\". Between the wars At the end of the First World War, both the BVRC and BMA were demobilised and disembodied, though both were soon rebuilt through new recruitment. Many former members of the BVRC re-enlisted. In Britain, the Volunteer Force had been re-organised in 1908, absorbing the remaining militia and Yeomanry units, to form the Territorial Army (TA). Among other changes, the TA introduced terms of service. A volunteer could no longer quit with fourteen days notice, but had to complete the term for which he was enlisted, as was the case for professional soldiers in the British Army. The re-embodied BVRC was re- organised as a Territorial, although it remained nominally a Volunteer unit. Its association with the Lincolnshire Regiment was made official, with the Lincolns taking on the paternal role it played with its own Territorial battalions. A third local Territorial, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers (BVE), was formed in 1931 to man Defence Electric Lights at coastal batteries, and absorbed the signals section of the BVRC a decade later. The Regular Army artillery and engineering detachments to the garrison were withdrawn in 1928, with the BMA and BVE, respectively, assuming complete responsibility for their vacated roles. There would no longer be a full infantry battalion in Bermuda. Instead, a detached company would be provided from the battalion sent to Jamaica.

Governor and General Officer Commanding, Lieutenant-General Sir Denis Bernard, inspects the First BVRC Contingent to the Lincolnshire Regiment at Prospect Camp on 22 June 1940. The BVRC began mobilisation on 3 September 1939, even before news was received of the declaration of war, when Britain issued Germany with an ultimatum to withdraw from Poland. As in the previous war, it took up positions guarding the coastlines, but its duties soon grew more numerous. Members of the Territorials were called up for the duration, and conscription was introduced to increase their strengths in October, 1940. Another infantry unit, the Bermuda Militia Infantry, had been raised in October, 1939, recruiting blacks, and linked administratively with the BMA. The infantry duties of the Garrison were split between these two Territorials, and the detachment from the 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) at Prospect Camp. Also as in the previous war, a Contingent was soon detached, composed of volunteers for service at sharper ends of the War. A few members of the BVE and the BMA travelled with this contingent to England (departing Bermuda in June, 1940), where the BVRC members were re-enlisted into the Lincolnshire Regiment. This Contingent included two officers, Robert Brownlow-Tucker and Anthony 'Toby' Smith, who became Company Commanders in the Lincolns before the War's end. They were among four Bermudians who would reach the rank of Major with the Lincolns (although one, future Major-General Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert, MC, never served in the BVRC, and the last, Major Patrick Lynn Purcell, had left Bermuda as a BMA Lieutenant attached to the 1940 BVRC Contingent. After coastal artillery service in Sierra Leone, he had transferred from the Royal Artillery to the Lincolnshire Regiment). Due to fears of stripping the Garrison, a moratorium was placed on further drafts being sent overseas from Bermudian units. This moratorium was not lifted until 1943, when both the BVRC and the Bermuda Militia (the BMI and BMA together) detached contingents to send overseas. The two contingents trained together at Prospect Camp, before going their separate ways. The BVRC left Bermuda in May, 1944, to join the Lincolns in England. The contingent members were rebadged as Lincolns, and most joined 2 Lincolns in Belgium, as the Allies advanced into North-West Europe. They had travelled as part of a Company of reinforcements under the command of Bermudian Major AF 'Toby' Smith, who was killed-in-action shortly after, along with three other Bermudians. While in England, eleven of second contingent had volunteered to join the Airborne Division, training as parachutists. Post-Second World War RM Gorham DFC at 1953 Coronation US President JF Kennedy inspects Bermuda Rifles in 1961 Battle Dress was the standard field uniform for Bermudian Territorials in the 1940s and 1950s, but tropical dress was worn in the summer months. After the War, the BVRC men, who had travelled to Europe as units, returned individually, as each waited for his 'number' to come up. The BVRC and the BMA sent contingents to the Victory Parade in London. In 1946, however, both units were demobilised and reduced to skeleton command structures. The other two Territorials were both disbanded, but the BVRC and BMA were brought back up to strength in 1953. At that time, the BVRC was retitled the Bermuda Rifles. The loss of the word 'volunteer' was probably prudent, as conscription was re-introduced to both units. In 1953, it was announced that the HM Dockyard would be closed. This meant that the military garrison, which had existed primarily to guard the naval base, would be closed, also. The last Regular Army unit (a detachment of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry) was withdrawn by 1955, and the Dockyard closed in 1958. 1953 was also the last year of the Imperial Defence Plan, under which the Bermudian units had been tasked, and the year in which the last of the coastal artillery was taken out of use. The BMA, while still wearing Royal Artillery uniform and cap badge, converted to the infantry role. With no tasking under the War Office, and its successor, the Ministry of Defence, or under NATO, both units might have been disbanded, but the Bermuda Government, for reasons of its own, chose to maintain them entirely at its own expense. A new role began to appear as Bermuda moved into the 1960s, when increasing tension resulting from the racial division and inequity of Bermudian society occasionally spilled over into violence. By then, it was rapidly becoming politically, as well as economically, inexpedient to maintain two, racially divided infantry units. As a result, the Bermuda Rifles and the Bermuda Militia Artillery were amalgamated in September, 1965, to form the Bermuda Regiment (now the Royal Bermuda Regiment). The Royal Bermuda Regiment badge is a combination of the Maltese Cross of the BVRC badge, and the field gun of the Royal Artillery badge. The unit maintains the history and traditions of both of its predecessors. However the Battle Honors of the BVRC were not passed on. This is due to the stand down between 1946 and 1948. Attempts to rectify this have not been successful due to strict British Army policies in regards to those honors. Originally, the part-time reserve units in Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta had numbered collectively as 28th in the British Army order of precedence, but were ordered within that according to the placement of their parent corps in the regular army. This meant, that the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), as part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, preceded the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) despite being the second of the two to be raised. Today, the Bermuda Regiment, as an amalgam of the BMA and BVRC, is 28th.The Quarterly Army List, December 1946. Corrected generally to 8 October 1946. Volume 1. Page 14.

This part of the school is seen on the show's opening titles. Acland Burghley Secondary School is a mixed comprehensive secondary school in the Tufnell Park area of the London Borough of Camden, in London, England. The school received specialist status as an Arts College in 2000 and is a part of the LaSWAP Sixth Form Consortium. The 2013 Ofsted report summarised the school as follows: ‚ÄòThe school is larger than the average secondary school. Approximately two-fifths of students are White British. A significant proportion of students are from other White backgrounds, White and Black Caribbean and other Black backgrounds. Several other minority ethnic groups are represented in the school. An above average proportion of students are known to be eligible for the pupil premium, which provides additional funding for children in local authority care, students known to be eligible for free school meals and those from families in the armed forces. A similar proportion of students are entitled to the Year 7 catch-up premium. The proportion of students supported through school action is below average. The proportion of students supported through school action plus or with a statement of special educational needs is above average. The most common needs are behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and speech, language and communication needs. There are also students with physical disabilities. The school has specialist arts status and has gained the Arts Mark Gold Award.‚Äô The Good Schools Guide said that the school was \\"remarkable for its art and for the egalitarian effects of its anti-bullying and peer mentoring programme.' The school is above national average for the new Attainment 8 headline measure. The number of pupils achieving grade C or better in English and Maths is above the national average and the number of pupils attaining the English Baccalaureate is significantly above national average. The school has also twinned with Chianna Primary school from Ghana, and during the year donations are collected and sent to the school in Ghana, who are in need of basic educational supplies. Previous headteacher Michael Shew hit out at a supply teacher for secretly filming pupils misbehaving in class. He confirmed that the school had featured on Channel 5‚Äôs hidden camera documentary Classroom Chaos after he was contacted by the Camden New Journal. The documentary, which received widespread media coverage, showed pupils misbehaving during a Media Studies class. Mr Shew argued that the programme‚Äôs makers used underhand tactics to film children without their permission and had opened up the possibility of legal action. The current headteacher is Nicholas John. Former headteacher Jo Armitage was praised as having a significantly positive impact on the school in a 2010 Ofsted report . This was less positive in the 2013 inspection where the school was inspected and given notice to improve. A subsequent Ofsted monitoring report in September 2016 judged senior leaders and governors as \\"taking effective action to tackle the areas requiring improvement... in order to become a good school\\" and stated that \\"In a short space of time the new headteacher (Nicholas John) has been instrumental in delivering significant improvements.\\" The most recent Ofsted report in March 2018 gave the school a 'Good' rating again and judged the effectiveness of leadership and management as 'Outstanding'. LaSWAP Sixth Form The LaSWAP Sixth Form is the sixth form consortium of four North London schools: Acland Burghley School, La Sainte Union Catholic School, Parliament Hill School and William Ellis School. It is one of the largest sixth form consortia in the Greater London area offering some 42 different A level courses, AGCEs, BTECs, NVQs and GCSE courses.

Structure The work is in three movements that are marked: # Allegro un poco maestoso # Romanze; Andante # Finale alla Zingara: Allegro con spirito The \\"Hungarian Manner\\" is in keeping with the Joachim's Hungarian heritage. However, like most people of the time, he did not distinguish between Hungarian folk music and gypsy music. This is a very long work (with a playing time over 45 minutes) and thus is a very difficult piece for the soloist. Practicing it has been likened by the violinist Rachel Barton Pine to \\"training to run a marathon\\". Performance history Alan Walker claims that Joachim performed the concerto, with Franz Liszt conducting, on 3 October 1853 in Karlsruhe on the opening day of the Karlsruhe Music Festival.

It lasted from 13 January to 25 April 1945, though some German units did not surrender until 9 May. The Battle of K√∂nigsberg was a major part of the offensive, which ended in victory for the Red Army. The East Prussian Offensive is known to German historians as the Second East Prussian Offensive. The First East Prussian Offensive (also known as the Gumbinnen Operation), took place from 16‚Äì27 October 1944, and was carried out by the 3rd Belorussian Front under General I.D. Chernyakhovsky as part of the Memel Offensive) of the 1st Baltic Front. The Soviet forces took heavy casualties while penetrating into east- northern part of Poland, and the offensive was postponed until greater reserves could be gathered. The East Prussian Offensive The main thrust of the offensive was to be conducted by the 3rd Belorussian Front under Ivan Chernyakhovsky. His forces were tasked with driving westwards towards K√∂nigsberg, against the defensive positions of the 3rd Panzer Army and 4th Army, the northern armies of General Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Army Group Centre. From the north, on Chernyakhovsky's right flank, General Hovhannes Bagramyan's 1st Baltic Front would attack the positions of the 3rd Panzer Army on the Neman, as well as crushing its small bridgehead at Memel. Chernyakhovsky's left flank would be supported by the 2nd Belorussian Front of Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, which was initially ordered to push north-west to the Vistula, through the lines of the 2nd Army, thereby sealing off the whole of East Prussia. =Opening of the offensive= Volkssturm militiamen in K√∂nigsberg during the offensive The Soviet offensive began on 13 January with a heavy preparatory bombardment. At first, the Red Army made disappointing progress; the 3rd Belorussian Front gained just 1.5 km on the first day. Over the next five days, the Soviets managed to advance only a further 20 km, at the cost of very high casualties. Eventually, after almost two weeks of severe fighting, the Red Army began making steady progress, although again, this came at the price of high losses; the defenders having the advantage of substantial fortifications in the Insterburg Gap east of K√∂nigsberg, and around Heilsberg. Over the next few days, the 3rd Panzer Army of General Erhard Raus was largely destroyed or withdrew into K√∂nigsberg, while General Friedrich Hossbach‚Ä≤s 4th Army began to find itself outflanked. Against fierce resistance, Rokossovsky attacked across the Narew on 14 January; on 20 January, he received orders to swing the axis of his advance northward toward Elbing. This sudden change of direction caught Reinhardt and Hossbach by surprise; on Rokossovsky's right flank, the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps captured the major town of Allenstein on 22 January, threatening the rear of Hossbach's formation. On 24 January, Rokossovsky's leading tank units had reached the shore of the Vistula Lagoon, severing land communications with the rest of German armed forces for the entire 4th Army along with several divisions of the 2nd Army which were now trapped in a pocket centered on East Prussia. On the same day, Hossbach began to pull his units back from the fortified town of L√∂tzen‚Äîa center of the East Prussian defence system‚Äîand through a series of forced marches attempted to break out westward. In the meantime, Chernyakhovsky had succeeded in rolling up the defences from the East, pushing the remnants of the 3rd Panzer Army into K√∂nigsberg and Samland. On 28 January, Bagramyan's forces captured Memel; the remnants of the three divisions defending the town were evacuated and redeployed in Samland to reinforce the defence there. =The Siege of K√∂nigsberg and the Heiligenbeil pocket= Soviet assault on K√∂nigsberg from 6‚Äì9 April 1945. With the remnants of Army Group Centre effectively contained, Soviet forces could concentrate on reducing the German forces in Pomerania and eliminating any possible threat to the northern flank of their eventual advance on Berlin. Reinhardt and Hossbach‚Äîwho had attempted to break out of East Prussia and save their troops‚Äîwere relieved of command, and the Army Group (redesignated Army Group North) was placed under the command of General Lothar Rendulic. Reinhardt gave up his command with the words \\"There is nothing more to say\\". Raus and the staff of the destroyed 3rd Panzer Army were assigned to a new formation. The defending forces, in the meantime, were besieged in three pockets by Chernyakhovsky's armies: *Some 15 divisions of the 4th Army had become encircled on the shore of the Vistula Lagoon in what became known as the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After bitter fighting, these units were finally overcome on 29 March. *The remnants of 3rd Panzer Army‚Äîplaced under 4th Armys command‚Äîbecame isolated in the Siege of K√∂nigsberg. The city was finally taken by the Soviets‚Äîafter massive casualties on both sides‚Äîon 9 April. After this point the remaining German forces around the Bight of Danzig were reorganised into Armee Ostpreu√üen under the overall command of Dietrich von Saucken. *The third group of German forces‚Äîthe XXVIII Army Corps or Armeeabteilung Samland under General Hans Gollnick‚Äîoccupied the Samland Peninsula, where the port of Pillau was retained as the last effective evacuation point for the area. The last elements were cleared from Pillau on 25 April in the Samland Offensive. Even after this time, German forces continued to resist on the Vistula Spit, the long sandbar enclosing the Vistula Lagoon, until the end of the war.

Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only. Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional. (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.) In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.  Draft and registration laws  The Military Selective Service Act (Act) (1948) (revised 1967) authorizes the President to require the registration for possible military service of males, but not females, the purpose of registration being to facilitate any eventual conscription under the Act. However, registration for the draft was discontinued by Presidential Proclamation in 1974 (the Act was amended in 1973 to preclude conscription). In early 1980, President Jimmy Carter re-established the Military Selective Service System primarily because the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan. President Carter also recommended that the Act be amended so that the MSSA extended to include women. The question of registering women for the draft not only received considerable national attention and was the subject of wide-ranging public debate, but also was extensively considered by Congress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee. On April 22 in the House and June 12 in the Senate, a Joint Resolution to resume the registration process was passed. However, the full requested fund amount was not granted, rather just the funds required to register men. Registration of young men started on July 21, 1980.  Case background  In 1971 an anti-war group, the Philadelphia Resistance, gathered a group of young male high school students, including Andrew Rowland, his brother, David Sitman and David Fruedman to protest the draft. In Rowland v. Tarr (1971) the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania heard a challenge to the MSSA on several grounds, one of which was gender discrimination. In 1974, they were not granted a 3-judge court opinion because the draft was now discontinued. This group of men petitioned again in 1974 in Goldberg v. Tarr. Robert Goldberg was a medical student at Penn State who registered and claimed to be a conscientious objector. In July 1980, just a few days before registration was to commence again, the district court offered an opinion claiming that the MSSA violated the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment. The director of the Selective Service System, Bernard Rostker, filed an appeal and the circuit judge stayed the court decision and registration began as scheduled. Rostker v. Goldberg moved up to the Supreme Court.  Case arguments  The Army and Marine Corps precluded the use of women in combat as a matter of established policy, and both the Navy and the Air Force restricted women's participation in combat. Even the president, who had originally suggested that women be included, expressed his intent to continue the current military policy excluding women from combat. Since the purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops, and since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided funds should not be used to register them. As one Senator said, ‚ÄúIt has been suggested that all women be registered, but only a handful actually be inducted in an emergency. The Committee finds this a confused and ultimately unsatisfactory solution.\\" As the Senate Committee recognized a year before, \\"training would be needlessly burdened by women recruits who could not be used in combat.\\" All in all, the proponents of the current MSSA advocated not using government funds to register people who were excluded from the job anyway. The main point of those who favored the registration of females was that females were in favor of it because of gender equality principles; women, as full citizens, ought to have the same civic duties and responsibilities as men. = Ruling = In the majority opinion, Justice William Rehnquist wrote \\"[t]he existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them.\\" Implicit in the obiter dicta of the ruling was to hold valid the statutory restrictions on gender discrimination in assigning combat roles. Men and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft therefore, there is no violation of the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court therefore reversed the decision of the district court. = Dissenting opinion = White, Marshall, and Brennan dissented. Justice White did not think that excluding women ‚Äúoffended the Constitution‚Äù but rather that Congress did not ‚Äúconclude that every position in the military, no matter how far removed from combat, must be filled with combat ready men.‚Äù Marshall dissented on the principle of equal civic obligation. Later developments In 2013, the US military removed the restriction on women in certain combat situations, and by 2015, had eliminated all restrictions barring women from combat. A new suit, brought by the National Coalition for Men, charged that with the removal of service restrictions, the Selective Service System's men- only requirement failed the Equal Protection clause. Judge Gray H. Miller of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System in February 2019 in favor of the plaintiffs, that the Service's men-only requirement was unconstitutional, though issued no order or injunction.

He was the Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Stanford University and until January 2010 was the Director of the Education Program for Gifted Youth also at Stanford.  Early life and career  Suppes was born on March 17, 1922, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He grew up as an only child, later with a half brother George who was born in 1943 after Patrick had entered the army. His grandfather, C. E. Suppes, had moved to Oklahoma from Ohio. Suppes' father and grandfather were independent oil men. His mother died when he was a young boy. He was raised by his stepmother, who married his father before he was six years old. His parents did not have much formal education.Cf. Suppes autobiography Suppes began college at the University of Oklahoma in 1939, but transferred to the University of Chicago in his second year, citing boredom with intellectual life in Oklahoma as his primary motivation. In his third year, at the insistence of his family, Suppes attended the University of Tulsa, majoring in physics, before entering the Army Reserves in 1942. In 1943 he returned to the University of Chicago and graduated with a B.S. in meteorology, and was stationed shortly thereafter at the Solomon Islands to serve during World War II. Suppes was discharged from the Army Air Force in 1946. In January 1947 he entered Columbia University as a graduate student in philosophy as a student of Ernest Nagel and received a PhD in 1950. In 1952 he went to Stanford University, and from 1959 to 1992 he was the director of the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences (IMSSS). He would subsequently become the Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Stanford.  Work  = Computer-aided learning = In the 1960s Suppes and Richard C. Atkinson (the future president of the University of California) conducted experiments in using computers to teach math and reading to school children in the Palo Alto area. Stanford's Education Program for Gifted Youth and Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC, now named Pearson Education Technologies) are indirect descendants of those early experiments.Kulik, James A., \\"School Mathematics and Science Programs Benefit From Instructional Technology\\", NSF Info Brief, NSF 03-301, November 2002. At Stanford, Suppes was instrumental in encouraging the development of high-technology companies that were springing up in the field of educational software up into the 1990s, (such as Bien Logic). One computer used in Suppes and Atkinson's Computer-assisted Instruction (CAI) experiments was the specialized IBM 1500 Instructional System. Seeded by a research grant in 1964 from the U.S. Department of Education to the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences at Stanford University, the IBM 1500 CAI system was initially prototyped at the Brentwood Elementary School (Ravenswood City School District) in East Palo Alto, California by Suppes. The students first used the system in 1966.Suppes, Patrick, \\"Computer-assisted Instruction at Stanford\\" , Technical Report No.174, May 19, 1971, Psychology and Education series, Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences, Stanford UniversityHunka, Stephen; Buck, George (1996) \\"The Rise and Fall of CAI at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Education\\" . Canadian Journal of Educational Communication, 21(2), 153‚Äì170. (also: full journal issue) Suppes' Dial-a-Drill program was a touchtone phone interface for CAI. Ten schools around Manhattan were involved in the program which delivered three lessons per week by telephone. Dial-a-Drill adjusted the routine for students who answered two questions incorrectly. The system went online in March 1969. Touchtone telephones were installed in the homes of children participating in the program. Field workers educated parents on the benefits of the program and collected feedback. = Decision theory = During the 1950s and 1960s Suppes collaborated with Donald Davidson on decision theory, at Stanford. Their initial work followed lines of thinking which had been anticipated in 1926 by Frank P. Ramsey, and involved experimental testing of their theories, culminating in the 1957 monograph Decision Making: An Experimental Approach. Such commentators as Kirk Ludwig trace the origins of Davidson's theory of radical interpretation to his formative work with Suppes.http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002035082.pdf  Awards and honors  * In 1965 he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences for his work on mathematical psychology. * On November 13, 1990, President George H. W.

History Having played firstly in a field at the bottom of Vernon Avenue, then on a site currently used by Dublin Bus as a depot, the club moved to its present location in 1896 and celebrated 100 years at the Castle Avenue grounds in 1996. The \\"Bull emblem\\" used in the logo is that of the district - Cluain Tarbh, which translates as \\"the meadow of the bull\\". The red and blue colours are used by most sporting clubs in the area. The official Club title is Clontarf Football Club rather than Clontarf Rugby Football Club. The explanation for this gives an insight into the rich history of the club - the club was formed before the establishment of the Irish Rugby Union. The minutes of early club meetings show that the members used the Boat Club premises as changing rooms and that goal posts were erected each Saturday morning and taken down after the match. The club was also approached by a local group who wished to play Gaelic Football on Sundays and it was agreed to make the pitch available provided the footballers dismantled the goalposts after their matches. In 1902-03 Clontarf was admitted to Senior Ranks - Leinster League - and in the following year reached the final of the Leinster Club Senior Cup but were beaten by Landsdowne one goal (5 points) to one try (3 points). Since 1896 the grounds at Castle Avenue have been jointly occupied by the Clontarf Cricket Club and the Rugby Football Club. Until 1947 both games were played on the same ground, the wicket was fenced off in the winter. In 1982 following a disastrous fire which destroyed the bar and lounge an agreement was reached between both clubs to go their separate ways, and each club was provided with separate premises and the use of a common main bar and hall for each club's season. One of the club's finest hours was the defeat of Athletic Rugby Football Club from New Zealand in 1966. It was the only defeat during their world tour. Among the teams played were Blackheath from England and Cardiff of Wales. Athletic was captained by I.N. McEwan. This win is still regarded as one of Clontarf's greatest rugby feats. Other highlights of the club's history include the winning of the Leinster Club Senior Cup in 1936 a feat which was to elude Clontarf teams for another 63 years until the much sought after cup was returned to Castle Avenue in April 1999. However, the intervening years were not without success as various teams representing the Club won leagues and cups in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. But it has been the last two decades of the Millennium that have witnessed some of Clontarf's proudest moments with the winning of the Leinster Floodlight Competition in 1989, 1990,1997 and 1998, the All Ireland Floodlight Competition in 1990 and the All Ireland League Division II in 1996/97. Since attaining Division 1status in 1997, Clontarf has maintained its position as one of the top twelve Clubs in Ireland. It has reached three All Ireland League division one finals, two of them to record winners Shannon. The club has produced many professional rugby players such as Cian Healy, Emile Prior and Brian O'Driscoll, Tadgh Furlong, Matt D'Arcy, Michael Noone and most recently Joey Carbery. In 2014, Clontarf won the All-Ireland League for the first time in the club's history, topping the table by a point, after a nail biting finish which saw Clontarf beat Ballynahinch at Castle Avenue while Old Belvedere lost to Garryowen, giving Clontarf the title. Four days after this victory, the same Clontarf side faced the world-famous Barbarians F.C. to mark the 1000 year anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf. Clontarf were winners on the day, running out 43‚Äì42. In the community On a local level the club runs a \\"mini\\" rugby team and Youth Rugby is of large importance to the club, which has invested a lot of time and energy in this section. The club has swept the boards of mini rugby over recent seasons in home and international competitions. For the 2018/2019 season, a Girls Youth team was set up and trains twice a week at the club. The club has had a close association with the local St Paul's College, Raheny and Mount Temple Comprehensive School, as well as Belvedere College in central Dublin, for many years. The club also has a strong active social committee, with theme nights, awards balls, golf outings and Tag Rugby runs during the summer months. Teams Clontarf have teams from senior level down as young as under-8. At senior level there are five teams, the firsts play in the AIL Division 1, while the rest of the senior teams play in the Leinster Metropolitan Leagues. In 2007/2008 the first team won the Leinster League cup beating St Mary's College in the final. They were also a runner-up in the J1 Section A league, and runners-up in the J4 league. The J2 team won the J2 section B gaining promotion to J2 section A. In 2014/2015, the J4 team won the Leinster Branch Metro League Division 6 title and won promotion to division 5.

Rainer Zitelmann (born 14 June 1957 in Frankfurt) is a German historian, author, management consultant and real estate expert.  Life  Zitelmann studied history and political sciences at the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences and completed his doctorate in 1986 under Prof. Dr. Karl Otmar Freiherr von Aretin with the grade of \\"summa cum laude\\", the subject being the goals of Hitler's social, economic and interior policies. Zitelmann's doctoral dissertation, \\"Hitler: Selbstverst√§ndnis eines Revolution√§rs\\" went through four editions in Germany, and was published in English under the title \\"Hitler: The Politics of Seduction\\" (London: London House, 2000). Next, Zitelmann pursued a career in the conservative print media: Following his work as a research assistant at the Free University of Berlin, he became editorial director for the publishing houses of Ullstein and Propyl√§en in 1992. Soon thereafter, he transferred to the German daily Die Welt as head of desk for contemporary thought. Later, Zitelmann transferred to the desk for contemporary history and finally to the real estate desk. In the year 2000, he founded Dr.ZitelmannPB. GmbH, which counts numerous internationally active companies among its clients, including CBRE, Ernst & Young Real Estate, Jamestown, Cordea Savills, and NCC, among others. Zitelmann was the managing director of Dr. ZitelmannPB. GmbH until the end of February 2016, when he sold the company in an MBO.Dr. Rainer Zitelmann sold his company Dr. ZitelmannPB. GmbH to his closest employee Holger Friedrichs In: Immobilien Zeitung, 10 February 2016. In 2016, he was awarded his second doctorate, this time in sociology (Dr. rer. pol) at the University of Potsdam. The subject of his second doctoral dissertation was the psychology of the super-rich. His dissertation was published in a variety of languages, including Chinese and Korean, as well as in English under the title \\"The Wealth Elite\\"Review in the FINANCIAL TIMES: https://www.ftadviser.com/property/2018/10/24/book-review- the-wealth-elite/.  Publishing  Zitelmann has written a total of 24 books. He is a regular contributor to Le Point, Linkiesta, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, and the Washington Examiner.  Examination of National-Socialism  =Hitler's Sense of Self as a Revolutionary= As a historian, Zitelmann is best known for his argument that Nazi Germany followed a conscious strategy of modernization.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 244. In his doctoral thesis, Zitelmann strove to show that the modernising efforts of the Third Reich, already diagnosed by scholars like Ralf Dahrendorf, David Schoenbaum and Henry Ashby Turner were in fact intended as such. Unlike Dahrendorf, Schoenbaum and Turner who argued that the modernization of German society during the Nazi period was an unintentional side effect or was merely a necessary adjunct towards achieving profoundly anti-modern goals, Zitelmann argued that modernization of German society was both intended and a central goal of the Nazis. A review published in the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel dated July 14, 1988, suggests that ‚Äúthe most important finding of [Zitelmann‚Äôs] work‚Äù is the following: ‚ÄúHitler saw himself uncompromisingly as a revolutionary. Dahrendorf‚Äôs and Schoenbaum‚Äôs hypothesis, according to which national- socialism had a revolutionising and modernising effect in the social area without actually having intended this, needs to be revised.‚Äù Zitelmann argues that far from seeking the agrarian fantasies of Heinrich Himmler or Richard Walther Darr√©, Hitler wished to see a highly industrialized Germany that would be on the leading edge of modern technology.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 244-245. Closely linked to the latter goal was what Zitelmann maintains was Hitler's desire to see the destruction of the traditional values and class distinctions of German society and their replacement, for at least those Germans considered ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù of a relatively egalitarian, merit-based society. Zitelmann argued that far from being incoherent, disorganized, confused and marginal as traditionally viewed, Hitler's social ideas were in fact very logical and systematic and at the core of Hitler's Weltanschauung (worldview).Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 245. Zitelmann has argued Hitler was much influenced by Joseph Stalin's modernization of the Soviet Union, and has argued that as F√ºhrer, consciously pursued a revolutionary modernization of German society. As part of his arguments, Zitelmann has maintained that \\"modernization\\" should be regarded as \\"value-free\\" category, and links with \\"progress\\" and humanitarianism should be severed. Zitelmann's work has faced criticism from those such as Sir Ian Kershaw who have argued that Zitelmann has elevated what were merely secondary considerations in Hitler's remarks to the primary level, and Zitelmann has not offered a clear definition of \\"modernization\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 246-247. The Bonn-based historian Prof. Klaus Hildebrand reviewed the thesis for the German daily \\"S√ºddeutsche Zeitung\\" in its September 29, 1987, issue, saying: ‚ÄúTo view Hitler‚Äîjust like Stalin and Mao Zedong‚Äîas representatives of a permanent revolution or a modernising dictatorship reopens an academic debate that has been ongoing since the years between the wars of the twentieth century. To be welcomed in this context is that Zitelmann, critically controlling his sources and striving for objective balance, inquires with renewed vigour into Hitler‚Äôs motives while remaining fully aware of the fact that history fails to coincide with human intentions.‚Äù In his research overview, The Hitler of History (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), the American historian John Lukacs presented Zitelmann's thesis, as well as his book \\"Hitler. Eine politische Biographie\\" (Hitler. A Political Biography), as important contributions to the scientific study of Hitler. The echo in specialist journals, such as the \\"Journal of Modern History\\" (in a review by Prof. Klemens von Klemperer), and the \\"Historische Zeitschrift\\", were predominantly positive. ‚ÄúRainer Zitelmann has written one of those books that make you wonder why they have not been available much earlier,‚Äù Prof. Peter Kr√ºger wrote in the \\"Historische Zeitschrift\\", Germany's leading academic journal for historiography. In the historiographic quarterly \\"Vierteljahreshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte\\", the Polish historian Franciszek Ryszka reached the verdict: ‚ÄúWithout a doubt, Dr. Zitelmann‚Äôs merit is to have substantially amended, and possibly surpassed, all other Hitler biographies.‚Äù At the same time, critical voices could also be heard, for instance in the German weekly \\"Die Zeit\\", dated October 2, 1987. On September 22, 1989, the critical review in \\"Die Zeit\\" was followed by another review of the two Hitler studies that, while also containing some critical remarks, came to the overall conclusion that Zitelmann had submitted a Hitler biography that was ‚Äúemphatically sober, without any superfluous moralising, not omitting any of the dictator‚Äôs villainies.‚Äù However, the reviewer suggested, ‚Äúthe image of Hitler drawn by the author [calls for] some amendments and corrections.‚Äù The American Historical Review wrote (May 1989): ‚ÄúZitelmann‚Äôs book is an admirable example of exhaustive scholarship on an important aspect of the mind of Hitler. But it is less likely to stand as a decisive synthesis than as a provocative turn in the pursuit of the eternal enigmas of the Third Reich and its creator.‚Äù In the 2/1988 issue of the \\"Milit√§rgeschichtliche Mitteilungen\\", the American historian Prof. Gerhard L. Weinberg wrote: ‚ÄúThis work will require all who concern themselves with the Third Reich to rethink their own ideas and to reexamine the evidence on which those ideas are based. For any book to do that today is itself a major accomplishment. It would certainly be most unwise for any scholar to ignore the picture of Hitler presented here simply because it does not fit in with his or her own preconceptions.‚Äù In a feuilleton published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on October 18, 1989 Zitelmann praised Holocaust denier David Irving for having ‚Äústruck a nerve‚Äù with his provocative style and aggressive assertions.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 181 Zitelmann found much to be praised about Irving's claim that the lack of a written F√ºhrer order for the Shoah suggests that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, and argued that if that was true, then historians should stop holding the Holocaust against Hitler. Zitelmann ended his article with the claim that ‚ÄúIrving must not be ignored. He has weaknesses [but he is] one of the best knowers of sources‚Ä¶[and has] contributed much to research‚Äù. Rainer Zitelmann criticised Irving in the liberal German weekly \\"Die Zeit\\" on 6 October 1989. Zitelmann questioned the fact that Irving had said ‚Äúnot without a certain hubris‚Ä¶ that he sees no need to pay any mind to the academic debate and research findings of the ‚Äòold-school historians‚Äô he detests.‚Äù Zitelmann criticised specifically that Irving deleted the word ‚Äòextermination camp‚Äô from the new edition of his Hitler biography, and that he now appeared to share the notions entertained by revisionist historians. ‚ÄúThis entire development,‚Äù as Zitelmann said in ‚ÄòDie Zeit‚Äô, ‚Äúhas so far not been adequately acknowledged and addressed by West German historians.‚Äù He called on these historians to be more ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù when critically engaging Irving. In 1991, Zitelmann edited, together with the Bielefeld-based historian Michael Prinz, the anthology Nationalsozialismus und Modernisierung (National- Socialism and Modernisation; Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft). On September 19, 1991, the weekly Die Zeit read: ‚ÄúThe evidence presented here in order to substantiate the modernisation dynamics of national-socialism are impressive, and they underline how misleading a one-sided view of national- socialism from the perspective of the ‚ÄòBlood and soil‚Äô romanticism would be; the latter having been widely spread, and having essentially contributed to an underrating of national-socialism.‚Äù At the same time, the reviewer criticises that the volume‚Äôs contributing authors had exceeded their mark, and should have given more attention to the NSDAP art policy, for instance. ‚ÄúThe problem of national-socialism and modernisation is therefore not to be resolved with a simple formula. It needs to be constantly reconsidered and to be illuminated from various angles.‚Äù =Historicising National-Socialism= Zitelmann provoked a mixed reaction with his anthology Die Schatten der Vergangenheit (The Shadows of the Past), edited together with Eckhard Jesse and Uwe Backes. Here, the editors sought to respond to Martin Broszat‚Äôs call‚Äîraised in 1985‚Äîfor a historicising of national-socialism. As the editors emphasize in their introduction, their goal was the ‚Äúobjectification of the discussion of national-socialist times‚Ä¶ The intention is not to ‚Äòdownplay‚Äô anything: Only an emphatically sober historiography, free of moralising bias, can create the foundation for assessing the historical and political-moral dimensions of the mass crimes committed by national-socialism.‚Äù In Zitelmann's opinion, the \\"historization\\" of National Socialism suggested by Martin Broszat was a way of resolving the problem of either engaging in apologetics about the Nazi era or utter condemnation. Zitelmann sees his work as a way of allowing those living in the present to understand the Nazi period without seeking to total condemnation or apologia. In line with their program to treat the time between 1933 and 1945 as scientifically as any other epoch, this volume gathered a wide spectrum of authors, from the right-wing conservative Ernst Nolte who commented once more on the so-called historians‚Äô dispute, all the way to the liberal Imanuel Geiss, a disciple of Fritz Fischer. As historian Peter Brandt wrote in Die Welt dated October 2, 1990: ‚ÄúThe editors have presented a useful book with many important contributions.‚Äù However, he added: ‚ÄúA criticism that could be raised is that‚Äîin spite of the emphasis on keeping out any ‚Äòextra- scientific‚Äô influences‚Äîa prejudice against the supposed ‚Äòpopular pedagogy‚Äô treatment of national-socialism had guided the editors‚Äô and some of the authors‚Äô pen.‚Äù The editors deserve one hundred percent consent, however, Brandt stated, ‚Äúas they reject any kind of ban on asking questions.‚Äù Historian Brigitte Seebacher noted in the Rheinischer Merkur on October 5, 1990: ‚ÄúIn short, this volume casts light on the national-socialist epoch, and inspires a renewed discussion of how to deal with it correctly.‚Äù In the November 6, 1990, issue of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, the historian Prof. Gregor Sch√∂llgen argued: ‚ÄúSome of the essays will (and should) provoke disagreement. Taken as a whole, this meritorious volume represents an unorthodox contribution toward objectifying the discussion of national-socialism, and one ought to take note of it.‚Äù The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of November 23, 1990, commented on Die Schatten der Vergangenheit the volume was ‚Äúperfectly suitable to become the subject of dispute‚Ä¶ If it failed to meet this mark, then it would above all be for the reason that only a few readers will be likely to manage to digest the heavy academic fare of the first eighty pages.‚Äù What is favourably highlighted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung review is Zitelmann's discussion of the historian Ernst Nolte: ‚ÄúExemplary in its objectivity is Rainer Zitelmann‚Äôs discussion of Ernst Nolte. Zitelmann points out analogies with Marxist theories on fascism, and suggests that it is impermissible to pinpoint ‚Äòanti-Bolshevism in a one-sided and generalising manner‚Äô as the central motive of ‚Äòthe‚Äô national-socialists.‚Äù Zitelmann also wrote on the subject of ‚ÄúUmgang mit der NS-Vergangenheit‚Äú (‚ÄúDealing with the National- Socialist Past‚Äú) in his contribution for the book Bewusstseinsnotstand. Thesen von 60 Zeitzeugen (\\"The Perceptual State of Emergency: Hypotheses by 60 Historic Witnesses\\"), edited by Rolf Italiaander (Droste-Verlag, 1990). In 1990, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft published another anthology, edited by Zitelmann together with the American historian Ronald Smelser, that offered 22 portraits of the leading figures of the Third Reich. Like Zitelmann's doctoral dissertation, this anthology, which combined authors from several countries, was also published in English translation ‚Äî The Nazi Elite (New York: NYUP, 1993). Reviews of this volume were found, for instance, in the \\"S√ºddeutsche Zeitung\\" of September 4, 1990. The Historikerstreit During the Historikerstreit between 1986‚Äì1988, Zitelmann was a strong defender of Andreas Hillgruber and Ernst Nolte.Lukcas, John The Hitler of History, New York: Alfred Knopf, 1997 page 237. In the preface to the second edition in 1988 of his 1987 book Adolf Hitler Selbstverst√§ndnis eines Revolution√§rs included a lengthy attack on the critics of Nolte and Hillgruber. In an interview with the Swedish historian Alf W. Johansson in November 1992, Zitelmann stated that the Historikerstreit ended with the defeat of the right- wing historians and the triumph of the \\"Left-liberal\\" historians.Lukcas, John The Hitler of History, New York: Alfred Knopf, 1997 page 239. Zitelmann went on to state that \\"Politically, this means that the conservatives are rather defensive and are not united\\". Zitelmann argued \\"that has more to do with academic conditions than with the intellectual situation in Germany where now, naturally a few years after the Historians' Controversy, there is in reality a certain change, since the Leftish intellectual circles are no longer on the offensive, but, to the contrary, they find themselves in increasing difficulties\\". =Adenauer‚Äôs critic: Thomas Dehler= In 1991, Zitelmann's book Adenauers Gegner. Streiter f√ºr die Einheit (\\"Adenauer‚Äôs Opponents: Fighters for Unity\\") came out, and was published as paperback by Ullstein under the title Demokraten f√ºr Deutschland (\\"Democrats for Germany\\") in 1993. As social democrat politician Erhard Eppler wrote in the preface: ‚ÄúZitelmann‚Äôs study illustrates that Adenauer‚Äôs opponents were no dreamers out of touch with reality, but had solid arguments and concepts to present.‚Äù The book portrays the German social democrat politicians Kurt Schumacher and Gustav Heinemann, as well as the Christian Democrat politician Jakob Kaiser, the liberal politician Thomas Dehler, and the journalist Paul Sethe. On October 7, 1991, the German daily Die tageszeitung (\\"taz\\") wrote: ‚ÄúThe book comes in the nick of time‚Äîprecisely because it does not join in the supposedly up-to-date chorus of Adenauer enthusiasts.‚Äù The social democrat politician Peter Glotz wrote in Die Welt on April 24, 1991, Zitelmann's book went to show ‚Äúthat Adenauer‚Äôs critics had valid arguments when accusing him of taking Europe more important than the reunification.‚Äù Social democrat politician Egon Bahr wrote in Der Tagesspiegel of July 28, 1991: ‚ÄúWhat was later called the lived lie of the Federal Republic can be traced in its inception in Zitelmann‚Äôs book.‚Äù That Zitelmann's sympathies went toward Thomas Dehler more than toward Konrad Adenauer became also evident during an academic panel on December 8, 1997, where he gave a lecture on occasion of Dehler's birthday centennial. This symposium, organised by the \\"Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\\" in cooperation with the Liberals‚Äô parliamentary group, was documented in the conference notes titled \\"Thomas Dehler und seine Politik\\" (Thomas Dehler and His Politics, Berlin: Nicolai Verlag, 1998). Aside from Zitelmann's contribution on ‚ÄúThomas Dehler und Konrad Adenauer‚Äù, the volume contains contributions by the liberal politicians Hermann Otto Solms, Wolfgang Mischnick and Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Sociology Publications: The Wealth Elite and the psychology of the super-rich In 2017, Zitelmann‚Äôs study on ultra-high-net-worth individuals with assets in the tens and hundreds of millions was published as The Wealth Elite: A Groundbreaking Study of the Psychology of the Super-Rich, which was based, in part, on in-depth interviews with 45 exceptionally wealthy individuals. The study took the form of a qualitative social science study, as there are no large enough representative cohorts for a quantitative study of the super- rich.https://www.ftadviser.com/property/2018/10/24/book-review-the-wealth- elite/ Most of the study‚Äôs interviewees were self-made multimillionaires. The study shows that a high proportion of the super-rich were engaged in entrepreneurial activities as early as their school and/or university days. One of the study‚Äôs most striking findings is that a very large proportion of the super-rich were highly competitive athletes in their youth. In contrast, their educational achievements did not play a decisive role in the level of wealth they attained: the upper quartile of interviewees (assets of US$330 million ‚Äì US$3.3 billion) even had more members without a university degree than did the lower quartile (assets between US$11 and US$33 million). In their decision-making, Zitelmann‚Äôs ultra-wealthy interviewees tended to act intuitively rather than being guided by analysis. The study found that implicit knowledge gained as a result of implicit ‚Äì often informal ‚Äì learning experiences played a far more significant role than did academic education. All of the interviewees completed a Big Five personality test. This revealed that conscientiousness was a particularly strong trait and neuroticism a particularly weak trait. Extraversion and openness to new experiences were also pronounced traits. This corresponds with the findings of previous research. In contrast, research has so far underestimated the role of sales skills in the financial success of the super-rich. The interviewees themselves rated the importance of sales skills extremely highly. Most of Zitelmann‚Äôs wealthy interviewees have overcome considerable setbacks and crises as they built their wealth ‚Äì and it emerged from the interviews that there are many similarities in the ways they deal with defeats and setbacks. One of the study‚Äôs key findings is that many self-made people are absolute nonconformists who have repeatedly swum against the tide of prevailing opinion and have been able to build their wealth as contrarians. Sociology Publications: Stereotypes and prejudice against the rich 2020 saw the publication of Zitelmann's book The Rich in Public Opinion. In the book, Zitelmann criticizes the fact that that academic prejudice research has so far neglected to explore prejudice against one particular minority: the rich.https://libertarianbookreviews.com/the-rich-in-public- opinion.html#comment-13 His book is based on an international survey conducted by the Allensbacher Institute and Ipsos Mori in Germany, the United States, Great Britain and France. On the basis of the survey, respondents were assigned to one of three groups: ‚Äúsocial enviers,‚Äù ‚Äúnon-enviers‚Äù and ‚Äúambivalents.‚Äù Based on the survey findings, social enviers represent 33% of the population of Germany, 34% in France, 20% in the United States and 18% in Great Britain. Zitelmann also calculates a Social Envy Coefficient, which indicates the ratio of social enviers to non-enviers in any given country. A value of 1.0 would mean that the number of social enviers and non-enviers is equal. A value of less than 1.0 means that the number of non-enviers outweighs the number of social enviers. Accordingly, social envy is highest in France at 1.26, followed by Germany at 0.97. Social envy is significantly lower in the United States (0.42) and Great Britain (0.37).https://thecapitalistleague.com/blog/f/the-first-international-study- of-prejudice-against-the- rich?fbclid=IwAR2FEk3Reg2CjJS18OPr7uuXcOGP2CXv3CJC9aiVsTg5_bkqLDIRFNl45J4 The accuracy of these three groups can be seen above all in the clearly divergent responses provided by social enviers and non-enviers to dozens of the survey‚Äôs other items. For example, the traits social enviers most frequently attributed to the rich were self-centered, ruthless, materialistic, arrogant, greedy, cold-hearted and superficial. Only two of the 25 personality traits most frequently cited by social enviers are positive, 23 are negative. In contrast, the traits most frequently attributed to the rich by non-enviers were industrious, intelligent, bold/daring, materialistic, imaginative and visionary.

Goddess Sheetala is worshiped on the eighth day after festival of colors (Holi), on the occasion of Sheetala Asthami. According to Skanda Purana, when the Gods performed a sacrificial fire ceremony for Goddess Durga, from that fire emerged Goddess Shitala, who was seated on an ass, holding a pot, and a silver broom, in her two hands. At that moment, from Lord Shiva's sweat was born Jwarasura, who spread disease all over the world. Goddess Shitala rid the world from the disease, and from then onwards, Jwarasura became her servant. Name and variants Shitala literally means \\"one who cools\\" in Sanskrit. Shitala is worshiped under different names in various parts of the Indian subcontinent. Shitala is more often called Ma and Mata (‚Äòmother‚Äô) and is worshiped by Hindus, Buddhists and tribal communities. She is mentioned in Tantric and Puranic literature and her later appearance in vernacular texts (such as the Bengali 17th century Shitala-mangal-kabyas, ‚Äòauspicious poetry‚Äô written by Manikram Gangopadhyay ) has contributed to strengthen her status. Shitala is primarily popular in regions of North India. In some traditions she is identified with an aspect of Parvati, the consort of Shiva. Shitala is addressed as Mother, as a seasonal goddess (Vasant, i.e. Spring) and with honorific titles such as Thakurani, Jagrani ('Queen of the World'), Karunamayi ('She who is full of mercy'), Mangala ('The Auspicious One'), Bhagavati ('The Goddess'), Dayamayi ('She who is Full of Grace and Kindness').Ferrari (2009: 146-147) The role of Shitala in South India is taken by the Goddess incarnate Mariamman, who is worshiped by Dravidian-speaking people. In Gurgaon of Haryana state, Shitala is considered to be Kripi (wife of Guru Dronacharya) and worshiped there in Sheetla Mata Mandir Gurgaon. Shitala puja The worship of Shitala is conducted by both Brahmins and pujaris. She is primarily worshiped in the dry seasons of winter and spring on the day which is known as Sheetala Satam. There are many arti sangrah and stuties for the puja of Maa Shitala. Some of them are Shri Shitla Mata Chalisa, Shitala Maa ki Arti, and Shri Shitala Mata Ashtak. Iconography and symbolism Image of Shitala Shitala is represented as a young maiden crowned with a winnowing-fan, riding a donkey, holding a short broom (either to spread or dust off germs) and a pot full of pulses (the viruses) or cold water (a healing tool). Among low-caste Hindus and tribal communities, she is represented with slab-stones or carved heads. Sometimes, she is said to be carrying a bunch of neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, a medicinal herb used throughout India since ancient times that is believed by some to be an effective remedy to most skin diseases to this day. Shitala is the form of folk demi-goddess Katyayani. She gives coolness to the patients of fever. According to Devi Mahatyam, when a demon named Jvarasura gave bacterial fever to all the children, goddess Katyayani came in the form of Shitala to purify children's blood and to destroy the bacteria of fever in blood. In Sanskrit 'jvara' means \\"fever\\" and 'shƒ´tala' means \\"coolness\\". Shitala is sometimes also depicted with Jvarasura, the fever demon; Ghentu-debata, the god of skin diseases; Raktabati, the goddess of blood infections and the sixty-four epidemics; and is often worshiped with Oladevi, another disease goddess (some say of cholera). She is also depicted enthroned in an 8 handed form holding trident, broom, discus (cakra), jar of abrasia or pot full of water , branches of neem , Scimitar, conch and vard mudra. She is also flanked by 2 donkeys. This depiction has established her as a goddess of protection, good fortune, health, and power. Buddhism In Buddhist culture, Jvarasura and Shitala are depicted sometimes as companions of Paranasabari, the Buddhist goddess of diseases. Jvarasura and Shitala are shown escorting her to her right and left side, respectively.

Hamilton, the sixth book in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. Plot introduction The Killing Dance continues the adventures of Anita Blake. In the novel, Anita continues to explore her relationship with her two romantic interests, Richard, a werewolf, and Jean-Claude, a vampire, while attempting to resolve an assortment of conflicts ranging from werewolf politics to unsolved murders. As with its predecessors, The Killing Dance blends elements of supernatural, hardboiled and police procedural fiction. The Killing Dance also marks Hamilton's first significant introduction of elements of erotic fiction into her genre fusion. Explanation of the title The werewolves in the novel refer to both sex and dominance fights (particularly the fight to become Ulfric which must end in either the death of the current Ulfric or the death of the challenger) as \\"the killing dance.\\" This represented a slight variation on Hamilton's practice of naming the novels after a fictional location within each novel for most of the Anita Blake series. Plot summary The Killing Dance takes place in May, about a month and a half after Bloody Bones and like the previous novels, The Killing Dance begins with a potential job for Anita in her role as an Animators, Inc. employee. In this case, Anita and Jean-Claude are in Anita's office meeting with Sabin, a master vampire, and with Dominic Dumare, Sabin's human servant. Sabin and Dumare explain that Sabin, in order to please a mortal lover, promised to abstain from feeding on the blood of live humans. As a result, he has developed a condition in which his body is irreversibly rotting away, and is beginning to lose control of his powers. Dumare, a necromancer, believes that if he and Anita join their abilities and his experience, they may be able to cure Sabin, and Anita agrees to help if possible. Jean-Claude and Anita ponder the parallels between Sabin's relationship with his unnamed mortal love and their own romantic relationship, and Anita leaves for a date with her other boyfriend, Richard. (Although Jean-Claude, a vampire, is in the process of consolidating his leadership of the city, Richard is locked in an ongoing struggle for leadership of the werewolves of the city with their current Ulfric, Marcus, primarily because Richard, unlike Jean-Claude, is not willing to kill in order to assume or maintain power.) Anita and Richard go to a dinner party at Anita's friend Catherine's house. There, they meet one of Jean-Claude's vampires, Robert, and his wife, Monica. Monica announces that she is pregnant, which Anita had previously thought impossible for a vampire of Robert's age. Monica is also very friendly with Anita, notwithstanding her assistance in the plot to hyponize Catherine and blackmail Anita in Guilty Pleasures. Anita wonders if Jean-Claude deliberately planned for Robert to attend the party to spy on her and Richard. She and Richard are forced to leave the party early after she receives a call from Edward. Edward, one of the world's premier assassins and a sort of friend of Anita's, tells Anita that he has received a proposed contract to kill Anita. He has refused, but wants her to get home and begin making plans to protect herself while he investigates the identity of the person putting out the contract on her life. Anita and Richard arrive at her house and meet Mrs. Pringle. Anita suspects that someone is in her apartment, and, while Richard helps Mrs. Pringle move a television, she engages in a gun battle through her closed front door, ultimately killing Jimmy Dugan, a local thug known as \\"Jimmy the Shotgun\\". Anita is taken to police headquarters and questioned for quite some time by Detective Branswell, who eventually lets her go. Anita and Richard argue about her decision to confront Jimmy the Shotgun without asking Richard to back her up, and Anita agrees to move into Richard's house for the time being in order to protect her neighbors from any potential collateral damage. Edward contacts Anita at Richard's house and tells her that the contract on her life has been increased to $500,000 if the murder is performed within 24 hours. Edward suggests that Anita try to deduce the identity of the person offering the contract by figuring out who would need her dead that quickly, but she doesn't have any ideas. Richard then receives a call from Stephen. Stephen is being forced to participate in one of Raina's pornographic movies, and is desperate for Richard's protection. Richard and Anita leave to rescue him. At the farmhouse where Raina shoots her movies, Richard and Anita confront several werewolves and various crew members. Richard reassures Heidi, a non-dominant werewolf trapped in the middle of the conflict between Marcus and himself. One of the werewolves, Sebastian challenges Richard, but Richard easily subdues him with the raw power of his beast. Approximately 30 werewolves gang up on Richard, including Sebastian and Jamil, and Anita realizes that the situation was a trap to kill him. She goes to rescue Stephen while Richard holds off the wolves. Anita follows the sounds of Stephen's screams and finds a room where Stephen is being tortured on film by his brother Gregory while being restrained by Raina and Gabriel. Anita removes Stephen and finds Richard fighting off the twenty werewolves outside the filming room. She and Richard confront the wolves, and Anita realizes that because the wolves do not believe Richard is willing to kill, they are not afraid of him. She threatens to kill Raina if anyone uses Stephen in a film again, setting herself up as a challenger for Raina's position as the pack's lupa. After returning to Richard's home, Richard stays awake as guard while Stephen sleeps in Anita's bed for protection. Later morning, Anita wakes to find Jason, Sylvie and Lillian at Richard's house. Lillian tends wounds while Jason and Sylvie attempt to convince Richard that he must be willing to kill to lead the pack. Anita and Richard go to a separate room to argue and come close to having sex, only to be interrupted by the weres on the other side of the door. Anita worries that her relationship with Richard makes her vulnerable, because unlike Jean-Claude, Anita can't count on Richard to make the hard decisions necessary to survive. Anita leaves the bedroom to find that several more shapeshifters have arrived‚ÄîRafael, Christine, and about fifteen others. She learns that Jean-Claude and many of the city's shapeshifters support Richard's attempt to dethrone Marcus as Ulfric, but that as long as Richard is not willing to kill, his claim is weakened. Richard ultimately declares Anita as his lupa and declares himself willing to kill Marcus if necessary to assume control of the pack. In order to assume a dominant role within the pack, Anita is forced to fight Neal, one of the werewolves present until first blood is drawn. She maneuvers him into a position where she can judo throw him through a window, drawing blood. As Neal cleans himself off, Edward arrives. Edward thinks that whichever assassin accepted the contract will try to kill Anita during her date with Jean-Claude at the opening of Dance Macabre, Jean- Claude's new club. Over Richard's objections, he and Anita make plans to use Anita as bait to draw out the assassin. Jean-Claude and Anita arrive at the club and are mobbed by reporters, \\"outing\\" Anita as the vampire's girlfriend. Under pressure from Jean-Claude, Anita admits that she wanted to keep their relationship secret and that her desire to do so was unfair to Jean-Claude. Anita meets Liv and Damian, two new and powerful vampires in Jean-Claude's retinue, as well as Cassandra, a new addition to the Thronos Rokke clan of werewolves. During the floorshow, Anita is forced to intervene to stop Damian from permanently hypnotizing one of the guests. Anita helps the guest into the women's bathroom with the help of another patron, Anabelle Smith. Smith draws a gun on Anita, but is distracted when some women enter, allowing Anita enough time to draw a knife and kill her. The police arrive and arrest Anita for the second time in two days. Detective Greeley does his best to get Anita to talk, but Dolph ultimately convinces Greeley to turn Anita over to Dolph by telling Greeley that Anita is a suspect in other crime. Dolph takes Anita to a suburban home in Creve Coeur, and shows Anita the crime scene‚Äîone of Jean- Claude's vampire's, Robert has been staked out inside a magic circle and ritually killed. Anita, as a necromancer, is unable to cross the circle, which was designed to block the magic of the dead. She hypothesizes that the circle was used to prevent Jean-Claude from learning of Roberts' death, and meets Tammy Reynolds, a new member of RPIT. Anita guesses that the crime must have been performed by at least two supernatural beings with enough strength to restrain Robert, in addition to someone with sufficiently detailed knowledge of necromancy to perform the ritual. Because even John Burke and Anita herself lack the expertise to perform the ritual, Anita tells Dolph that Dominic Dumare is the only suspect she can identify. Anita and Dolph clash over what she can tell Jean-Claude about Robert's death and about whether her loyalties now lie with Jean-Claude or with RPIT. After some more investigation, Anita accompanies Robert's widow, Monica to the hospital. While at the hospital, Anita speaks to Edward, who tells her that the contract on her life has been extended another twenty-four hours and convinces her to take cover in the Circus of the Damned while he attempts to identify who is behind the hit. At the Circus, Anita tells Jean-Claude about Robert's death and learns for the first time about Jean-Claude's past with Asher and Julianna. Jean-Claude tells Anita that Asher has petitioned the Vampire Council for permission to kill Anita as revenge for Julianna's death. Later, Jean-Claude and Anita discuss their relationship, both with each other and with Richard. Jean-Claude tells Anita that he loves her, and promises not to stand in her way if she chooses Richard, but demands that she see Richard change into a wolf before committing. They kiss, and Richard enters. With Richard's control weakened by the approaching full moon, Jean-Claude baits Richard and Richard knocks Anita down in the course of attacking Jean-Claude. Jean-Claude leaves to prepare for the approaching dawn, and Richard and Anita discuss their relationship. Jason arrives, severely beaten as a result of his attempt to prevent Richard from entering earlier, and acknowledges Richard as his master. Richard feeds from Jason's blood and feeds Jason some of his own blood and power. Shaken by Richard's display of inhuman behavior, Anita worries that perhaps Richard is right that killing Marcus will mean surrendering too much of his human identity. After some hesitation, Anita proposes that Richard sleep with her that morning, and that they marry as soon as possible. Richard refuses, promising to sleep with Anita and to marry her, but only after she sees him as a werewolf. Anita is awakened by Cassandra leaning over her bed in darkness. Cassandra apologizes for the fright and explains that Richard and Jean-Claude have a plan. The men explain that they wish to experiment calling the power that the three of them summoned accidentally in The Lunatic Cafe. Richard sees the power as a way to force Marcus to back down without a death, and Jean- Claude sees it as a means to secure his control of the city and his safety. Anita reluctantly agrees to the experiment after forcing Jean-Claude to promise that he will not mark either of the others as his servant. As the three engage in the initial stages of a m√©nage √† trois, Anita is first uncomfortable, but soon overcome by a combination of lust and magical power. Acting on instinct, Anita demands blood to complete the ritual, and Jean- Claude bites Richard even as the two men continue seducing Anita. Anita is flooded with power, and instinctively raises the dead, much as she did when flooded with power by inadvertent human sacrifices in The Laughing Corpse and Bloody Bones. As Anita makes plans to investigate what she has raised from the dead and where, Richard and Jean-Claude sense an emergency and race her to the location of an old cemetery within the Circus. Anita learns that she has raised scores of zombies, as well as the resting forms of three vampires: Damian, Liv, and Willie. The three discuss their relationship some more‚ÄîJean- Claude and Richard are threatened by Anita's power and need for dominance, while Anita and Richard are threatened by Jean-Claude's ongoing seduction of them both. (On the other hand, Cassandra, a post graduate student of magical theory as well as a werewolf, is more clinically interested in the magic than in their relationship). Unsure whether, after raising them as zombies, Anita will be able to return the vampires to death in a way that allows them to rise as vampires with the setting sun, the group decides to call Dominic Dumare for assistance. (Anita reveals that a woman alibied Dumare, eliminating him as a suspect in Robert's killing.) Dominic and Cassandra are both intellectually fascinated by Anita's power to raise vampires, and, at Dominic's request, Anita experiments with the power, learning that she can heal vampires that she raises during daylight. Dominic helps her develop a ritual to combine her powers with Jean-Claude's and Richards and lay the vampires and zombies to rest, and they agree to try to use the technique to heal Sabin the next day. Jean-Claude, Richard, and Anita discuss their mutual relationship some more. Richard has agreed to accept Jean-Claude's marks as his animal servant, but will not accept a subordinate position to either Jean-Claude or Anita, and threatens to kill Jean-Claude if he attempts to assume control. Anita, for her part, will not even accept the marks. Jean-Claude claims to be threatened by Anita's new power and by the prospect of a three-way battle for dominance \\"for all eternity,\\" but he is intrigued by the amount of power the three of them can raise. Edward arrives, with an assistant, the psychopathic mercenary Harley. Edward explains that he has learned that Marcus was behind the contract on Anita's life, and Jean-Claude hypothesizes that Marcus wanted to distract Richard from concentrating on that night's battle of succession. Anita and Richard dress for the battle and leave, with Edward and Harley as backup. Using Jean-Claude's mark, Anita and Richard unite their three powers once more, this time magnifying Richard's power. Holding Anita's hand, Richard helps her \\"ride\\" his power, allowing the two of them to run through the forest like wolves. At the wolves' sacred clearing, Richard and Marcus face off. Sebastian stabs Richard in the back in order to help Marcus, but is killed by Edward, who has taken up a sniper's position nearby. Without further interference, Richard tears out Marcus's heart, killing him. In order to prevent her from killing Raina, Richard grabs Anita. He holds her down bodily as he changes to his wolf-man state. He invites Anita to share his power again, but she flees in horror, just as the pack begins eating Marcus. Anita runs back to the Circus and Jean-Claude. Distraught, Anita finally gives in to Jean-Claude's ongoing seduction, in the first of the many detailed scenes of erotica that Hamilton has since introduced into the series. The next morning, Richard arrives, and is devastated by the combination Anita's rejection of him the previous night and discovering that she has had sex with Jean-Claude. After an emotional fight, Richard declares that he will always love Anita and leaves. Cassandra arrives to help Anita clean up but then, to Anita's surprise, knocks Anita unconscious and delivers her to Raina and Gabriel. With Anita safely bound on the set of Raina's porn films, Cassandra explains that she, Dominic and Sabin are a triumvirate. Cassandra was the lover who convinced Sabin to give up feeding on humans, causing him to develop his degenerative condition. Dominic believed that by sacrificing Jean-Claude's triumvirate, they could heal Sabin, and the three of them came to St. Louis to do so. Discovering that Anita was not marked by Jean-Claude, they are going to try the sacrifice with just Jean-Claude and Richard. Anita attempts to reason with Cassandra, and promises to heal Sabin by raising him during daylight the next day. Cassandra refuses, stating that they do not have even one more day before Sabin loses his mind permanently, and leaves Anita to be raped and killed in Raina's snuff film. Gabriel, a psychotic sadomasochist, has been fantasizing about arming Anita with silver knives and raping her while she tries to kill him. Anita talks Gabriel into trying out his fantasy and gives her the knives. Unknown to Gabriel, Anita accepts the first and second vampire marks from Richard and Jean-Claude while waiting for the scene to begin; with her weapons and the extra power from the marks, she is able to kill both Gabriel and Raina. Together with Edward and Harley, Anita races to the sacrifice site to save Jean-Claude and Richard. At the site, Dominic has prepared another circle of power against the dead, which Anita, a necromancer, is unable to enter. Edward crosses the circle and kills Dominic to stop his spell but is knocked unconscious by Sabin. Harley shoots Cassandra. Anita kills Sabin and is then forced to kill Harley, who has lost control without Edward to anchor him to reality. She rushes to Richard and Jean-Claude and finds Richard dying, his heart pierced by Dominic's blade. Jean-Claude explains that he is shielding Anita from Richard's pain, and that he and Richard will probably die. Anita is unable to cope with losing both men and agrees to accept the third mark, giving blood to Jean-Claude and saving Richard and Jean-Claude's lives. In the epilogue, Anita explains that Monica's baby is doing well, and that she and Jean-Claude remain lovers, but that Richard has frozen them both out of his life, rendering the triumvirate useless. Even more ominously, Edward has declared that because Anita killed Harley, she now owes him one favor, which he will collect when he sees fit. Characters  =Major characters= The Killing Dance features the following major characters. * Anita Blake: Anita's primary developments in this novel are romantic, as she attempts, unsuccessfully, to forge a life with Richard, then ultimately selects Jean-Claude. She also experiences significant political developments, as her developing powers draw her deeper into Jean- Claude's vampire power structure and into the political world of Richard's werewolf pack. * Jean-Claude: Jean-Claude continues to present something of an enigma. Although he claims to love Anita, the character of Sabin serves as an example of the danger of absolute love to a vampire, as does Jean-Claude's story of the tragic ending of his love affair with Asher and Julianna. Although he may well be in love, Anita is well aware that Jean-Claude remains very calculating, and that, as usual, the events of The Killing Dance seem to work out to Jean-Claude's benefit more than anyone else's‚Äîby the end of the novel, Anita is Jean-Claude's lover alone, Jean-Claude's rivals, Marcus and Raina are dead, and Anita and Richard are bound to Jean-Claude as his human and animal servants. * Richard: This novel underscores Richard's essentially tragic nature. Although Richard is extraordinarily blessed‚Äîphenomenally powerful, fantastically handsome, in requited love with his apparent soulmate‚Äîhe lacks the essential self-knowledge needed to resolve his crisis. Richard is unable to integrate his human and werewolf natures, and this tragic flaw haunts him throughout the series. This novel, where Richard finally reveals his true nature to Anita and is rejected, represents the beginning of a long slide for the character that has yet to resolve. * Edward: Edward is his typical self‚Äîan inscrutable and deadly serial killer. However, in this novel, he continues to show hints of some other emotional existence. In particular, his fondness for Anita begins to look something like friendship, and to suggest the possibility of an emotional inner life. =Other characters= Recurring characters in The Killing Dance include: * Reappearances of RPIT members Dolph Storr, Zerbrowski and the introduction of RPIT's first witch Tammy Reynolds. As Anita's relationship with Jean-Claude becomes public knowledge and her public death toll rises, Dolph begins to show seeds of the distrust that would manefest between them over the course of the next several novels. * The reappearance of the vampire Willie McCoy and the introduction of newly arrived vampires Damian and Liv. * The reappearance of shapeshifters Rafael, Lillian, Christine, Jason and Stephen and the introduction of Stephen's twin brother, the wereleopard Gregory, new pack enforcer Jamil, and pack member Sylvie. * Miscellaneous other characters, particularly Catherine Maison-Gillette, Mrs. Pringle and Monica Vespucci. Non- recurring characters include: * Police detectives Greeley and Branswell. * Pack members Heidi and Neal. The death toll in The Killing Dance includes: * The dark mirror to Anita's own triumvirate: Sabin (shot by Anita); Dominic Dumare (shot by Edward) and Cassandra (shot by Harley and/or died when Anita killed Sabin). * Jean-Claude's vampire flunky Robert (heart torn out by Dominic). * Assassins for hire Jimmy \\"Jimmy the Shotgun\\" Dugan (a cheap local thug) and \\"Annabelle Smith\\" (a pricy international assassin), both killed by Anita. * Local lycanthropes Sebastian (shot by Edward); Marcus (killed by Richard in battle of succession); Gabriel (stabbed by Anita); and Raina (shot by Anita).

He studied Sciences (Mathematics) at the University of Orleans in France and obtained his PhD in 1978. He was a leader of the student movement named FEANF (Federation of Black African Students in France) and a leader of the first movement of rebellion in Chad named FROLINAT. He was also a professor and researcher in mathematics in France, Algeria, Niger, Chad (at the University of N'Djamena).

Saleh founded a political party, the Party for Liberties and Development (Parti pour les Libert√©s et le D√©veloppement, PLD), in 1993. He was dismissed as Minister of Planning and Cooperation by D√©by on May 17, 1994.\\"May 1994 - Civil service strike - Cabinet changes\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 40, May 1994 Chad, page 39996.

He was the PLD candidate in the May 2001 presidential election; the fairness of the election, which was won by incumbent president Idriss D√©by, was hotly contested by Saleh and the other opposition candidates. Saleh was arrested at this time. He boycotted the parliamentary election of 2002, the constitutional referendum of 2005 and the presidential election of 2006, saying that there were not sufficient guarantees that the processes would be free and fair. Arrest and disappearance On February 3, 2008, during a battle between government forces and rebels in N'Djamena, Saleh was arrested by unidentified military personnel, presumably presidential guards, according to the PLD.\\"Chad opposition targeted\\", AFP (The Times, South Africa), February 11, 2008. More than a week later, no information had been released about the arrest or about where Saleh was being held. One of Saleh's cousins expressed particular concern on the grounds that Saleh had been very ill for some time, hoping that medicine, food and clothing could be brought to him wherever he was being held.\\"L'opposant tchadien Lol Mahamat Choua enlev√©, vivant mais toujours absent\\" , AFP, February 15, 2008 . On February 27, with still no information available about Saleh's whereabouts or condition, his wife met with Carla Bruni, the visiting French President's wife Nicolas Sarkozy. President Sarkozy asked his counterpart Idriss D√©by to meet with her as well, but on February 28 she eventually refused to meet with D√©by.\\"Wife of missing Chadian opposition leader snubs meeting with Pres. Deby\\", African Press Agency, February 28, 2008. Fellow opposition leader Ngarlejy Yorongar, who had been arrested the same day than Saleh, said on March 6, 2008 that he believed Saleh had probably died as a result of his treatment in captivity. According to Yorongar, Saleh was severely beaten and it would, in Yorongar's opinion, be miraculous if he had survived such treatment. He urged the French to work to have the truth of the situation disclosed. A cousin of Saleh said at this time that his family had still not received any information and that they were very worried.\\"Tchad: √† Paris, l'opposant Yorongar dit aller \\"mal\\" et pense qu'Ibni est mort\\" , AFP, March 6, 2008 . Saleh is the father of four children. The three French Mathematical Societies, SFdS, SMAI and SMF have created in 2009 the prize Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh in his memory.\\"Prix Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh\\" . Commission of enquiry On March 17, 2008, the CPDC coalition called for Saleh's release and for the establishment of a \\"truly international and truly independent commission of inquiry\\" to investigate the matter, rather than the commission established by the government.\\"Tchad: la coalition d'Ibni demande une enqu√™te \\"r√©ellement internationale\\" , AFP (Gaboneco.com), March 17, 2008 . A new and more independent commission was set up to replace the earlier commission on April 2.\\"Tchad/disparition Ibni: \\"Pas de r√©ponse\\" de la commission d'enqu√™te\\" , AFP, September 2, 2008 . The commission heard testimony from over 1,500 people, including high-ranking officials and the Chadian President himself; its report was submitted to D√©by on August 5, 2008 and publicized a month later on September 3. This report concluded that Saleh had been arrested by the army at his home in N'Djamena on February 3, but said that it was not possible to reach a conclusion on what happened to him afterwards due to lack of evidence, while noting that \\"people think he is now dead\\". The commission raised also some doubts about Yorongar's testimony. Speaking after the report's release, his son, Mohamed Saleh, denounced it as a \\"parody\\", and he alleged that D√©by was responsible for Saleh's death. According to Mohamed Saleh, D√©by ordered the Republican Guard to arrest Saleh, who was then taken to the presidential palace, where he was tortured and killed. Mohamed Saleh demanded that the authorities turn his father's body over to his family.\\"Tchad: mort d'Ibni apr√®s avoir √©t√© arr√™t√© par l'arm√©e, selon la commission d'enqu√™te\\" , AFP, September 3, 2008 .
