Used interchangeably, the \\"Black Superwomen Syndrome\\" is the pressure & expectation of a woman of color to manage multiple roles of the mother, worker, homemaker, student and any other roles that usually inclusive to one person or sex. Keep in mind, this is different then a career woman because rather than sacrifice the role that supports her family in order to excel in her career, the superwoman is forced to support both the traditional Suzy Homemaker role and a career woman. This mold of being self-reliant & self-contained is damaging in a sense because if you are unable to be self-reliant (i.e. needing extra help with the electric bill) and/or self-contained (i.e. feeling overwhelmed by the extra workload but being proud of being trusted to perform well under pressure) then culturally you aren‚Äôt a true strong black woman and you aren‚Äôt to be depended on. This arrangement of social paradoxes creates a deadly environment that is damned if you, damned if you don‚Äôt stigma for black women across the diaspora. Historically, this stigma is what held black families together because of the systemic lack of strong balanced male authority is the same thing that is killing our women. When a woman has no choice to be strong all the time without a chance to breathe, anything that isn‚Äôt related to fulfilling all the roles that are needed are suppressed such as sadness or pain because of its deemed weakness.  Key elements  This standard mold is examined in studies produced by Nami.org, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Nursing & Center of Disease Control and Prevention off the basis of three key elements: (i) ability to propel the family to succeed despite limited resources, (ii) ability to resist being vulnerable or dependent, and (iii) the obligation to manifest strength regardless of situation. While each one of these studies are situationally different in terms of how important each one of these elements are for each other of these study participants to achieve these traditional standards, one thing remains constant. The cognitive dissonance between the ‚Äúreal woman‚Äù verses the ‚Äúideal woman\\" consequently causes strain on their interpersonal relationship with significant other, extended families, and their immediate community as a whole. In the contemporary spectrum of this complex. Cultural acceptance and obedience no matter what the time period in contemporary America gives these women a bound element of opposition and adversity. So even when the stress is relieved and the woman in question is no longer in the stressful situation, the health dipartites related to carrying all that stress psychological can still manifest into risk factors such as ‚Äúexhaustion, impaired judgment, hypervigilance (leading to exhaustion and impaired judgment!), glucose intolerance, (precursor to diabetes); fat and sugar overload and ultimate mismanagement (leading to obesity, diabetes and heart disorder); an over stimulated cardiovascular (CV) system correlates to stiffening of the arterial system, and plaque build-up along arterial walls‚Äù  Popular case studies  Within academia, numerous studies have been launched to figure out one simple question: Why are black women so oppressed within their communities and how can we create a healthy psychological environment for black women within the 21st century?\\" One study that studied this issue is ‚ÄúAfrican American Women‚Äôs Beliefs About Mental Illness, Stigma and Preferred Coping behaviors‚Äù By Earlise C. Ward & Susan M. Heidrich. Within this study both Ward & Heidrich examined black women‚Äô representations/beliefs about mental illness (i.e. depression/anxiety), if they felt any stigma associated with seeking treatment for said mental illness and if these perceptions differed by age group. This study was from 2005-2006 with 185 women all across America. These women were placed within 3 groups: 25‚Äì45 years old (young), 46‚Äì65 years old (middle-aged), and 66‚Äì85 years old (old) and were tested. Based on the spectrum that were presented in the previous paragraph, results indicated that within these 3 groups a couple of different factors, including family related stress, social stress because of racism and sexism within the African-American community in stimultiously created serious consequences that are recurrent and generational. These same participants affirmed high levels of stigma across the board and age differences towards those 3 stressors were found to have all variables except stigma. Ward & Heidrich found that mental illness in the African American community was associated with the stigma of shame, doubt and embarrassment within both the affected individual and that individual‚Äôs family, in which they hid the illness in response of this illness becoming public. Case in point, one of the participants in this same study was recorded in saying ‚ÄúI made the mistake of telling my best friend. He said, ‚Äòyou're crazy? Oh my God, I can't believe it. Get away from me. You're dangerous‚Äù This quote is just one example of showcasing the different reactions that occur when black women express their mental well-being to their peers. With these results within this study proves one point, as long as weak mental health or state of mind is deemed within this community as a deformity no progress can be made. Another study that examined this issue was ‚ÄúSuperwoman Schema: Using Structural Equation Modeling to Investigate Measurement Invariance in A Questionnaire‚Äù (2013) and was created by Dr. Teneka C. Steed. In this study they used structural equation modeling techniques to factor cultural social structures within the black woman and the invariances related when these women either refuse or seek relief from these same rigid social structures. According to UNCG.edu, the Superwomen Schema represents the characteristics of a superwoman packaged into five subscales: ‚Äúobligation to present an image of strength, obligation to suppress emotions, resistance to being vulnerable, intense motivation to succeed, and obligation to help others‚Äù. These subscales are examined between a group of young (18‚Äì39 years old) women and middle-aged (40‚Äì65 years old) women. These two groups were created from 48 women that all hailed from southeast America and were surveyed in private rooms within open community locations (i.e. public libraries). The results from this study were similar to the Ward & Heidrich study, in which ‚ÄúThe SWS conceptual framework suggests that socio-historical factors (i.e., racial and gender stereotyping or oppression) may result in emotional suppression, determination to achieve goals despite limited resources, and limited prioritization of self-care‚Äù. The younger women tested higher when it came to obligation to suppress emotions, resistance to being vulnerable and intense motivation to succeed while the middle-aged women scored higher in obligation to present an image of strength and obligation to help others. With these results, Dr. Steed concluded that both groups of the younger and middle aged women in her study similarly agreed in responses that no matter the subject, black women as a whole cynically take on way too many roles and/or responsibilities especially when there were already overworked or overwhelmed and feels obligated despite the circumstances to take care of others. While on the other hand, routinely neglecting their own needs and gratifications or even feeling guilty when they would take out some time for themselves.  21st century identity  In the 21st century, Black Women are using the internet in order to deconstruct the controlled image of what it means to be a strong black woman. The concept of ‚Äúcontrolling images,‚Äù discussed on ‚ÄúYou have to Show Strength‚Äù by Patricia Hill Collins, explores the control of the pop culture on confining Black womanhood to negative stereotypes. She writes that ‚Äú[the] dominant ideology of the slave era fostered the creation of several interrelated, socially constructed controlling images of Black womanhood, each reflecting the dominant group‚Äôs interest in maintaining Black women‚Äôs subordination‚Äù. Maxine Waters stated that \\"I am a strong black woman and I cannot be intimidated\\" in reference to disparaging comments about her appearance used by Bill' O'Reilly. Her interview with MSNBC indicates this term as a polysemy within the black community.

All 53 seats were up for election.  Result  There were now 53 seats on the council, compared with 49 in 1976. Gains and losses in the results table are compared with the 1976 district council election. Ward Results All results are listed below: Figures on turnout were taken from Plymouth University's Elections Centre, which gives the number of registered voters, and the percentage turnout for each ward. The number of ballots cast for each ward was calculated from these. Percentage change in turnout is compared with the same ward in the 1976 District Council election. The percentage of the vote for each candidate was calculated compared with the number of ballots cast in the ward. Note that in a ward with more than one seat, voters were allowed to place as many crosses on the ballot paper as seats. The percentage change for each candidate is compared with the same candidate in the 1976 District Council election.

Education Originally from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Thorp attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University. He went on to complete his residency and fellowship training at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Academic career In addition to his positions at UNC, Thorp is also the medical director of Reply OB/GYN & Fertility in Cary, North Carolina. At UNC, he has helped the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology establish a clinical training program in Lilongwe, Malawi. Research Thorp's research interests include preterm birth and cervical insufficiency. He also serves as the principal investigator for UNC in the National Institutes of Health's Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network. He has researched the ability of progestins to prevent preterm births, and the neuroprotective effects of magnesium in premature infants. He was also a principal investigator in the clinical trials conducted on flibanserin in the United States. Testimony in abortion cases Thorp has testified on behalf of Alabama and Wisconsin in court cases regarding admitting-privileges laws enacted in those states. In Wisconsin, Thorp testified that there were no reliable data regarding maternal deaths from abortion in the United States, to which judge William M. Conley replied by invoking Mark Twain's quote that there are \\"lies, damn lies and statistics\\". Conley later struck down Wisconsin's admitting-privileges law, writing in his decision that it had little, if any, benefit to women's health. His decision also stated, \\"In light of the deep flaws in his analysis and his testimony, which often came off more as advocacy then expert opinion, the court finds little to credit in Dr. Thorp‚Äôs opinions of the relative risks of abortions to child birth or comparable invasive procedures.\\" In 2014, U.S. district judge Myron H. Thompson rejected two of Thorp's arguments in an Alabama case regarding an admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers. Personal life Thorp and his wife, Joe Carol, live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They have four children and two grandchildren.

It is bordered to the south by South Korea, and the two countries are separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Some dishes are shared by the two Koreas. Historically, Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends. Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean foods. In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes (Banchan) and main courses like juk, Bulgogi or noodles. Soju liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit. North Korean cuisine P'y≈èngyang-raengmy≈èn () is a cold noodle dish. Some North Korean dishes and foods are also prepared in South Korea, and a multitude of dishes that originated in North Korea were brought to South Korea by migrating families after the Korean War. Many of these imported dishes became staples in the South Korean diet. In North Korea, some dishes vary in flavor compared to South Korean versions, with some North Korean dishes being less spicy and more varied in composition compared to South Korean preparations. North Korean dishes have been described as having a unique and specific tanginess that is derived from using ingredients with flavors of sweet, sour, pungent and spicy, in combinations that create this effect. Some restaurants, particularly in Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea, have expensive pricing relative to average worker wages in North Korea. Accessibility to restaurants is not always available to average North Korean citizens, with tourists and rich citizens being the primary patrons at some of them, particularly upscale ones. Per their pricing, upscale restaurants are typically only available to well- paid leaders of the North Korean government, tourists visiting the country, and the emerging affluent middle class of donju in the country. Donju means \\"masters of money\\", and the donju typically hold positions in the government, positions operating state-owned businesses outside of the country, and positions involving bringing investments and the importation of products into the country. Some street foods exist in North Korea, such as in Pyongyang, where vendors operate food stalls. North Korea's first pizzeria opened in 2009.

North Korea's legal drinking age is 18, but minors are sometimes allowed to consume alcoholic beverages, and some shop keepers readily sell them alcoholic drinks. Some North Koreans brew and distill alcoholic beverages at home, despite such home alcohol production being forbidden in North Korea, and some sell these beverages to markets, although this is also illegal. Home brewed liquor is made using ingredients such as potatoes and corn. Some North Korean consumers purchase alcoholic beverages directly from alcohol-producing factories in the country, using cash. In recent times, imported Chinese liquor has been allowed to be sold in markets, and a well-known Chinese liquor purveyed in North Korea is Kaoliang Liquor, which has a 46-50% alcohol content. North Korea has some bars and other drinking establishments, and in recent times, beer halls have become popular in Pyongyang.

As an architect he was part of the Art Nouveau architectural movement known as the Liberty style, while as an entomologist, he was an important contributor to the global knowledge of the insect order Hymenoptera. Architectural career Gribodo graduated from the Scuola di Applicazione per gli Ingegneri in Turin (\\"Technical School for Engineers\\", now the Politecnico di Torino) in 1866 and took up the post of assistant of Practical Geometry and Applied Descriptive Geometry there. As an architect he designed a number of buildings and some of these are regarded as some of the best examples of Liberty Style in Turin. Many of Gribodo's buildings can be found in the area between the Corso Francia and the Via Cibrario, in the areas of Borgo San Paolo up to edge of the Borgo della Crocetta in Turin. He was best known for creating delicate smaller houses frequently in the Via Piffetti and on the hillside in the Art Nouveau style which he interpreted with his own eclectic taste; in Italy this style was known as Stile Liberty, taking its name from the Liberty store in London. Some examples include the Casa Masino, famous for featuring a sphinx; Casa Giuliano on Via Gatti; and the 1908 Palzio Pola Pola palace in Via Piffetti, at Via Beaumont. As an architect he also published a report on the building style used in the Turin Italian Exposition of 1872. He seems to have retired from architecture in 1919 as from then until the end of his life he seems to have been able to spend all his time conducting entomological research. Entomology Gribodo's contribution to entomology was mainly around the study of the Hymenoptera and is still considered to be of great value. He described many new taxa, and his publications are characterised by an acute critical sense and a wealth of original observations as well as demonstrating his serious approach to preparation and his extensive knowledge. These traits led Gribodo being respected member of the global entomological community. He co-operated with the greatest hymenopterologists of his time and with museums and scientific institutions, both at home and abroad, who competed to work with him. He had a long and fruitful relationship with the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova and he was a prime actor in the creation of the Museum's Hymenoptera collection at the end of the 19th century, being involved in the extensive study of the specimens which he collected in Italy and overseas in the course of several expeditions. Gribodo published many papers between 1873 and 1896, which show that he was able to work extensively on his entomological studies; even then, there were two brief periods of inactivity in 1876‚Äì78 and in, 1885‚Äì91. From 1896, he ceased publishing on Hymenoptera and it was during this period that his career as an architect was at its peak. He continued to add to his own collection in his spare time, either by collecting specimens locally in Piedmont or through purchase from fellow collectors or insect dealers. After this period he was able to dedicate himself to his studies of Hymenoptera on a full-time basis, including the publication of a number of papers, as well as undertaking work to reorganise is very large collection of entomological specimens. At the age of 74, in July 1920, he is recorded as taking part in an entomological trip to Piedmont's Susa valley which lasted two days. In the early part of 1923 he developed a serious circulatory disorder which caused debilitating pain, but he recovered from this and returned to his work. However, in the spring of 1924, he suffered a relapse of greater severity and after months of painful illness he died on September 24th, 1924. He worked for as long as he could, and his last paper was published posthumously. Gribodo's collection of entomological specimens was purchased by the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova in December 1924, and it is still held by that institution. It remains an important entomological resource; as well as his own specimens, which include many rare specimens and many type specimens collected by Gribodo, it contains many collected by other renowned Hymenopterists such as Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, Heinrich Friese, Alexander Mocs√°ry, Henri Louis Fr√©d√©ric de Saussure and Frederick Smith. The collection also contains many of the important type specimens which were originally collected and named by F√©lix √âdouard Gu√©rin-M√©neville. The collection is now housed in boxes in the museum and the museum was able to add the collection of cuckoo wasps of the family Chrysididae, which Gribodo had given to Fabio Invrea shortly before his death, on its procurement of Invrea's collection subsequent to the latter's death. The collection is an extensive representation of Aculeata although has no ants. Gribodo's library, including some manuscripts and correspondence, was donated by his daughters to the Civic Library of Turin, where it remains. He was one of the first members of the Societ√† Entomologica Italiana as well as being a member of many other societies, including the Reale Accademia di Agricoltura di Torino, Societ√† Italiana di Scienze naturali and various foreign entomological and scientific associations. Publications and taxa Gribodo published 42 papers during his life and left one unpublished manuscript on the Hymenoptera of Tunisia; these are listed in Penati and Mariotti (2015), which includes a comprehensive list of the 377 taxa named by Gribodo, 199 of which are still regarded as valid.

Bronner is a professor of sociology at Universit√© Paris-Diderot and is a member of the Institut Universitaire de France (University Institute of France). He is one of the main proponents of cognitive sociology in France and is known for his work on collective beliefs as well as for his involvement in jihadist radicalization prevention programs with the French government. More generally, his research has focused on the key success factors of a belief in social contexts. Career After finishing his dissertation (‚ÄòThe sociological implications of aversion to uncertainty‚Äô), Gerald Bronner became a lecturer at Universit√© de Nancy in 1998. He was head of the sociology department there from 1999-2001. In 2000, at a conference of the Association Internationale des Sociologues de Langue Fran√ßaise (International Association of Francophone Social Scientists, AISLF), he met Jean-Michel Berthelot with whom he started a multi-year collaboration. Bronner and Berthelot co-headed an AISLF research committee, which gave way in 2008 to a research committee on ‚ÄòLogic, methodology, and knowledge theories‚Äô headed by Bronner. In 2003, he published L‚ÄôEmpire des croyances (PUF) which earned him the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques prize. In 2004, he joined the Sorbonne, where he became co-head, again with Berthelot, of the Centre d‚Äô√©tudes sociologiques (Center for sociological studies). Around the same time, he was named to the editing committee of L‚ÄôAnn√©e sociologique, and publishing house Editions Hermann asked him to establish their ‚ÄòSociety and Thoughts‚Äô collection. In 2006, he defended an HDR (post-doc dissertation) on the import of the cognitive bias concept in sociology, which was subsequently published as L‚ÄôEmpire de l‚Äôerreur. In 2007, he was named professor at Universit√© de Strasbourg. That year he joined the admission committee for the ‚Äòagr√©gation de sciences √©conomiques et sociales‚Äô where he served as vice-president (2008-2010). In 2008, his nomination gave him the opportunity to do further research in the United States. He finished that year The Future of Collective Beliefs. In 2010, he earned the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences for his book La Pens√©e extr√™me : comment des hommes ordinaires deviennent des fanatiques that focuses on mental processes leading ordinary individuals toward radicalism and fanaticism. In 2012, he began serving as a professor at the Universit√© Paris-Diderot (Paris VII) where he co-heads the Laboratoire interdisciplinaire des √©nergies de Demain (Interdisciplinary laboratory for future energies) and teaches a course on ‚Äòthe cognitive sociology of energy‚Äô. In 2013, he published La D√©mocratie des cr√©dules, for which he received the Revue des deux Mondes prize. In the same year he received the Union rationaliste prize, and in January 2014, the Procope des Lumi√®res prize. He writes for mainstream publications (Cerveau & Psycho, Le Nouvel Observateur, Sciences Humaines, Le Point, _Pour la Science_ ) and often appears in the media. Following the series of terror attacks in France in 2015 and 2016, and a rise in conspiracy theories around these events, he was invited to take part in the first ‚Äòderadicalization center‚Äô at Beaumont-en- V√©ron. He joined the Conseil Scientifique de Lutte contre la Radicalisation Violente created by the French Ministry of Justice and co-authored a report of the Mission Interminist√©rielle de Vigilance et de Lutte contre les D√©rives Sectaires ([Interministerial mission against cult like] - MIVILUDE) in 2015. Theoretical views Bronner‚Äôs work centers on collective beliefs and more generally social cognition phenomena. He is a proponent of cognitive sociology, which studies cognitive biases as applied to social variables (most notably culture). For instance, he published an article comparing counterarguments to Darwinian evolutionary theory in the US and France (Revue Fran√ßaise de Sociologie, 3, 2007) and how they differ depending on the cultural context. He developed the notion of ‚Äòcognitive market‚Äô, which he defined as a market ‚Äòwhere cognitive products are traded such as assumptions, beliefs, knowledge, which can compete against one another, or exist in situations of monopoly or oligopoly.‚Äô He published works on the epistemology of social science, including the use of the concept of rationality, and the interactions of social science with cognitive science and neuroscience. Research topics His work covers a wide range of topics, including the mechanisms at play in entering a cult, how children stop believing in Father Christmas, risk perception and political and religious extremist thoughts. His aim is to understand and help formalize a theoretical framework on the formation of representations and beliefs. He is one of the first, in the early 2000s, to have warned against the potential negative effects of information market deregulation via widespread use of Internet. He summarized these processes in La d√©mocratie des cr√©dules, where he demonstrates how hoaxes and fake news are able to rapidly spread and form the basis to layered arguments such as conspiracy theories. In L‚Äôinqui√©tant principe de pr√©caution he exposed the reasons he and his co-author E. G√©hin call ‚Äòprecautionism‚Äô, i.e. the unconditional (and often ideologically driven) application of the precautionary principle. In La plan√®te des hommes - R√©enchanter le risque, he analyzes the theories underpinning governmental and administrative action and argues that basing entire policies on ideas such as Hans Jonas‚Äô responsibility principle can lead to unintended and sometimes potentially dangerous consequences.

Five of the six killed were yeshiva students aged 20‚Äì21. They were attacked with gunfire and grenades from the rooftops around a small alley. It was the most deadly attack on the Israeli occupied West Bank since the Six-Day War. Context The attack, unprecedented in the post-1967 period, was understood to mark a transition from \\"hit-and-run\\" attacks to attacks aiming to achieve mass casualties by the use of military tactics and careful planning. Attack The attack was carefully planned in military style. The terrorists had studied the route and timing of the return of worshipers to the Jewish residence in the former Hadassah medical clinic (Beit Hadassah) on Friday evenings, and attacked from both street and rooftop level as soon as the Jews appeared in the narrow passageway. Terrorist Adnan Jabar was posted on the roof of a building opposite the Hadassah medical clinic holding a Kalashnikov with which he \\"opened fire\\" as soon as the Jewish pedestrians came into view. Israeli guards at the former clinic immediately returned fire. Perpetrators admitted to having received instructions directly from Khalil al-Wazir. Israel sent a protest note to the United Nations, arguing that \\"this criminal incident illustrates once again the true character of the PLO and its violent aims\\".Y. Z. Blum, Israeli Ambassador of Israel to the UN, Letter to the Secretary General dated 4 May 1980. UN codes A/35/207 and S/13923. Legal proceedings =Investigation= An extensive cache of explosives and weapons was discovered, it included the guns used in the attack. =Arrests= In September 1980, four members of Al Fatah were arrested and charged with carrying out the attack. One of the four had trained in the USSR. two were arrested while trying to cross from Israel into Jordan. An additional six Arab Palestinians were taken into custody, charged with aiding the terrorists by providing lodging and transportation. =Trial and sentencing= All four terrorists were sentenced to life in prison, but were later released in prisoner exchanges. Victims *Tzvi Glatt, 20, American- Israeli yeshiva student at the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva in Jerusalem. A budding scholar, Glatt was the author of \\"Rise From the Dust\\". *Shmuel Mermelstein, 21, yeshiva student from Montreal who was studying at Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh. He was the only victim without Israeli citizenship. *Gershon Klein, 20, yeshiva student at the Nir Yeshiva in Kiryat Arba. *Hanan Krauthamer, 21, from Bnei Brak, French-Israeli yeshiva student at the Nir Yeshiva. *Yaakov Zimmerman, 20, from Bnei Brak, yeshiva student at the Nir Yeshiva. *Eli HaZeev, 32, decorated Vietnam War veteran who came to Israel during the Yom Kippur War and converted to Judaism. Glatt and Marmelstein were visiting friends at Kiryat Arba when the attack occurred. Four of the wounded were American citizens: Mordechai Shevat, 21, of The Bronx; Robert Brosovsky, 21; Simha Wollman, 21, of Brooklyn, and Lisa Sherman, 20, of Queens. Perpetrators All of the terrorists were members of Fatah. =Members of the ambush squad= *Yasser Hussein Mohammed Zedat (30), squad leader. From Hebron; fled to Jordan after firing a Katyusha rocket at Kiryat Arba in April 1977; trained in terrorist tactics in Lebanon. *Adnan Jabar (32), second in command.

Accomplices *Omar Haroub (30). Accused of providing weapons and transportation on the night of the ambush. A chemistry graduate of the University of Beirut working for a blood bank in East Jerusalem. Impact The attack prompted the government of Menachem Begin to refurbish the Hadassah medical clinic and to permit Jews to live in the Beit Hason and Beit Schneerson buildings adjacent to it. The Israeli community of Beit Hagai (House of Haggai) was established in 1982 by former classmates of boys murdered in this attack.

Life  Edith Elizabeth Downing was born in Cardiff in January 1857. She was one of four children of the coal merchant and shipping agent Edward Downing, having two sisters and a brother, Edward. Her sister Mary was also to become an artist, whilst sister Caroline Lowder Downing was to join the Women's Social and Political Union with Edith. After attending Cheltenham College, Edith spent most of her working life based in Chelsea. She died in October 1931 in Surrey.  Career  Bust by Edith Downing Edith Downing began her artistic training at the South Kensington School of Art, later attending the Slade School of Art between 1892-1893. She was primarily a sculptor producing busts and figures in bronze and marble but she also painted watercolours and made reliefs and decorative panels. Downing first had her work exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1891 and she continued to be a regular contributor here until the early 1900s. She also exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute, the Paris Salon and the Society of Women Artists and was a member of the South Wales Art Society between 1896 and 1900. Several examples of Downing's work are on display at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff including a life-size bronze figure entitled 'Avarice' on the south west staircase. An alabaster altarpiece she created as a memorial to Wilfrid Clive, who died at the age of 26 having been overcome by sulphurous volcanic fumes whilst on a visit to Dominica, can also be seen in St. Peter's Church, Wormbridge, Herefordshire. Downing also used her artistic talents to support her activities as a suffragette, both by working with her fellow artist Marion Wallace-Dunlop to organise a series of dramatic processions and by selling her work to raise funds for the movement. These included statuettes entitled 'A Sketch' and 'Peter Pan' in 1908 and statuettes of Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney in 1909.  Suffragette Activity  Edith Downing joined the Central Society for Women's Suffrage in 1903 and the London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1906. By 1908, however, she had become frustrated by the \\"futility of quiet work\\" and joined the Chelsea branch of the more radical Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) together with her sister Caroline Lowder Downing. In June 1910 Edith and Marion Wallace-Dunlop created a 'Prisoners Tableau' for the WSPU 'Prison to Citizenship' procession whilst in the following year the two collaborated on the 'Women's Coronation Procession'. This latter procession was led by Flora Drummond on horseback and included Annan Bryce dressed as Joan of Arc and 700 women and girls clothed in white to represent suffragette prisoners. In November 1911 Downing took part in several demonstrations including one in Parliament Square which led to clashes with police and another on the 23rd of the month when she broke a window of Somerset House and was sentenced to a week in jail. She was arrested again on 1 March 1912 for throwing a stone through the window of a fine art dealers in Regent Street whilst participating in a WSPU window breaking protest with a group of about 200 organised activists, including her sister Caroline, in the West End of London. On this occasion she was sent to Holloway Prison where she joined fellow suffragettes on hunger strike and was force fed. Downing was one of the activists who spoke about the police brutality and stated that some women were prepared to die for the right to vote, she was one of the 68 women who embroidered their signatures or initials on The Suffragette Handkerchief under the noses of the prison staff. Downing was released at the end of June. Downing had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.

In Guth‚Äôs model, the period of accelerated expansion (a.k.a. inflation) makes the universe homogeneous and flat but can never end. The problem with that model, later referred to as ‚Äúold inflation,‚Äù is that an energy barrier prevents the universe from escaping inflation, blocking the universe from reheating and forming the stars and galaxies observed today. In 1982, a solution to the graceful exit problem was found independently by Andrei Linde and the team of Andreas Albrecht and Paul J. Steinhardt. The new model, subsequently referred to as ‚Äúnew inflation,‚Äù replaced the energy barrier with an ‚Äúenergy plateau‚Äù so that inflation takes place for a period but stops once the plateau is traversed. The Albrecht-Steinhardt paper also revealed an important gravitational effect known as ‚ÄúHubble friction,‚Äù which helps sustain inflation for a sufficiently long period of time (referred to as the ‚Äúslow- roll‚Äù effect). In 1983, James Bardeen, Steinhardt and Michael S. Turner showed that Hubble friction is essential for generating a spectrum of density fluctuations at the end of inflation that could explain the origin of galaxies and the temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background. Most subsequent inflationary models solve the graceful exit problem using similar principles.

Tagore's story, first published in 1914, is considered to be a path-breaking feminist text. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali, as well as a number of BFJA Awards.  Plot  Tagore's story is written in epistolary form - the letter from the wife forms the entire text. The film uses the letter as a frame for the narrative. It tells the story of Mrinal (Madhabi Mukherjee), a young woman from a poor family, married into an aristocratic joint family of Calcutta. She is chosen as a bride because of her beauty. However, it is her intelligence that turns out to be the key factor in the story. Women in the family lead a life that is confined to the kitchen and the bedroom. Mrinal's sister-in-law (Smita Sinha) accepts the system unquestioningly. Mrinal is different; she takes an independent stance on several domestic matters, and secretly writes poetry. Her daughter dies soon after birth. Mrinal's life changes when Bindu (Rajeshwari Roychowdhury), her sister-in-law's sister, comes to stay. The family is not happy at this development. They treat Bindu like an unpaid servant, with Mrinal alone standing up for her. To get rid of the problem, the men force Bindu into an arranged marriage, and even her sister considers this to be the best solution. However, Bindu's husband (Nimu Bhowmick) turns out to be mentally unstable and violent. Once again, Bindu seeks shelter with her sister. Now, however, the situation has become untenable, and Bindu commits suicide. Meanwhile, Mrinal has managed to get permission to go on a pilgrimage to Puri with relatives. Through these tragic events, she has come to realise that women have no freedom in a patriarchal society. Standing on the seashore at Puri, she makes up her mind, and writes a letter to her husband declaring that she would never return to their house.

Apart from her and Santosh Dutta, who were well-known in Bengali cinema, the cast of the film included several prominent stage actors such as Rudraprasad Sengupta, who was with the theatre group Nandikar and would later become its leader, and Asim Chakraborty, who had set up Chaturmukh theatre group. =Shooting= Purnendu Patri not only wrote the screenplay for the film, but also handled the art direction. The film was shot on location in Dhurjati Dham, an iconic old building in North Calcutta (now declared a heritage building), which had earlier been used by Satyajit Ray for Jalsaghar. =Music= The choice of Ramkumar Chattopadhyay as Music Director was an unusual but appropriate one. Chatterjee had not composed music for films prior to Strir Patra, but was well known as a classical singer with a unique repertoire of puratani (old Bengali) songs.

Known for his research on liquid crystals, Madhusudhana is an elected fellow of Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to physical sciences in 1989.  Biography  University of Mysore Nelamangala Madhusudana was born on 9 May 1944 at Mysore, in the south Indian state of Karnataka, to N. Vedavyasachar and Indira Bai. After early schooling in Mysore, he earned a graduate degree in science in 1962, which he followed up with a master's degree in physics in 1964, both degrees from the University of Mysore. He started his career by joining Sarada Vilas College, Mysore, as a demonstrator and became a lecturer in 1965. The same year, he moved to the University of Mysore as a research fellow. While on service, in 1969, he enrolled for his doctoral studies at the university under the guidance of Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar and earned a PhD in 1971 for his thesis Structure of nematic liquid crystals. Subsequently, he joined Raman Research Institute as a scientist and served the institution for two and a half decades. During this period, he became an associate professor in 1977, a professor in 1986, and headed the Liquid Crystals Laboratory of the institute during 1999‚Äì2000. After serving as a dean of research from 2001, he superannuated from regular service in 2006, holding the position. Post- retirement, he continued his association with the institute as a senior scientist of the Indian National Science Academy until 2011, and has been serving as an emeritus scientist since that time. During his service at RRI, he had two sabbaticals abroad ‚Äì first as a visiting scientist at Laboratoire de physique des solides of the University of Paris-Saclay during 1983‚Äì84, and then as a visiting associate professor at Pascal Research Centre of the University of Bordeaux during 1984‚Äì85. He also served as a Jawaharlal Nehru chair professor at the School of Physics of the University of Hyderabad on a month-long assignment in December 2009. Madhusudana is married to Kauslya Rao and the couple has one son, Pramod. The family lives in Bengaluru in Karnataka.  Legacy  Schematic of alignment in the smectic phases. The smectic A phase (left) has molecules organized into layers. In the smectic C phase (right), the molecules are tilted inside the layers. Mudhusudana's research has been focusing on the physical studies of liquid crystals. He demonstrated for the first time the electromechanical coupling effects of cholesteric liquid crystals and the suppression induced by curvature in the Smectic-A phase of the crystals. He suggested an explanation for the anti- parallel correlations of near-neighbor molecules and apolar director of highly polar compounds as well as for the nematic to nematic and smectic-A to smectic-A reentrant phase transitions. He elucidated the phenomenon of smectic-A phase with tilted molecules caused by off-axis molecular dipoles and demonstrated the impact of flexoelectricity in nematic phase transitions. He validated the intermediate phases of anti-ferroelectric liquid crystals and the B6-B1-B2 sequence of homologous bent-core molecules by developing models of chiral axial next nearest neighbor xy and a frustrated packing model. He also developed a methodology for measuring twist elastic constant of nematics. These investigations assisted in a wider understanding of antiferroelectric correlations, electro hydrodynamical instabilities and molecular mechanism of liquid crystals. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the online article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 160 of them. Besides, he has contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations from other scientists. Mudhusudana assisted his mentor, S. Chandrasekhar, in founding the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at Raman Research Institute. His contributions were reported in the development of indigenous know-how for Bharat Electronics Limited for the manufacture of liquid crystal display panels. He is a former associate editor of Pramana, Journal of Physics and is associated with science journals such as Liquid Crystal Communications journal of International Liquid Crystal Society, Indian Journal of Physics of Springer and the Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Physics of the National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources as a member of their editorial boards. He is also a former editorial board member of \\"International Journal of Engineering Science\\" and \\"Liquid Crystals\\" journal. He served as the co-director of one of the seminars on soft condensed matter organized by International Centre for Theoretical Physics and chaired a session of the \\"Indian Statistical Physics Community Meeting\\" of 2014 where he delivered a keynote address. He also served as a member of the international scientific committee of the 1st Asian Conference on Liquid Crystals (ACLC2012) held in Yamanashi, Japan in 2012.

Though he claimed himself to be Shahi Imam (Royal Imam), according to a report of Ebela, he was not so as he did not lead any royal in prayer.  Appointment  Barkati is the second imam from his family, succeeding his father in 1989.  Controversies  In March 2010, Barkati was accused of formalising the marriage of a Muslim boy with a transgender girl. Though he admitted the fact, he said the matter was \\"politically motivated\\". Barkati also organised prayers for Osama bin Laden after he was killed by United States in March 2011. In December 2016, Barkati issued a fatwa against West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party chief Dilip Ghosh for allegedly giving hate speech against chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In the fatwa, he asked people to stone Ghosh and exile him from the state. In January 2017, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a fatwa from Barkati for demonetising 500 and 1000 rupees bank notes. He offered an amount of 25 lakh rupees to someone who would \\"cut off PM Narendra Modi's beard, shave his head and smear him with black ink\\". His activity drew criticism with ruling Trinamool Congress MLA Siddiqullah Chowdhury saying that it showed Barkati's immaturity. Jamaat-e-Islami West Bengal secretary Muhammad Nooruddin said that his comments would damage the reputation of Muslims. Former Bharatiya Janata Party state president Rahul Sinha said India was not a place for fatwas. Barkati said in May that he would beat Muslims who would join Bharatiya Janata Party or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He also said that Muslims who said \\"Jai Shree Ram\\" (Hindu slogan) were eunuchs. Barkati also warned of waging a jihad if India became a Hindu state. After the central government passed an order banning the use of red beacons, Barkati refused to remove the beacon from his car, citing that the imams were given right to use the beacon during the British Raj. He finally removed it after a meeting with Trinamool Congress MLA Bobby Hakim. Barkati has been accused by Bengali newspaper Ebela of trying to illegally occupy the mosque. He has also been criticised for using the mosque premises for press conferences where he gave political messages. He has also been accused of possessing inappropriate wealth.  Sacking  On 17 May 2017, Barkati was sacked from his post of Shahi Imam. Shahzada Anwar Ali Shah, the president of the trustee board, said that he was sacked because he insulted the religion and the country by making anti national statements.

Spence (464 F.2d. 772, 782 D.C. Cir. 1972) was a landmark federal case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that significantly reshaped malpractice law in the United States.Roberts, Sam \\"Jerry Canterbury, Whose Paralysis Led to Informed Consent Laws, Is Dead at 78,\\" New York Times, May 16, 2017.Meisel, Alan. ‚ÄúCanterbury v. Spence: The Inadvertent Landmark Case.‚Äù Health Law & Bioethics: Cases in Context.‚Äù It established the idea of \\"informed consent\\" to medical procedures.  Background  Until the 1960s, it was conventional medical doctrine to withhold significant information from patients, particularly potentially upsetting information.Langer, Emily, \\"Court ruling in his case established doctrine of informed medical consent\\", The Washington Post, May 21, 2017, p. C8. It was common practice not to tell a patient they were dying, and even to deny it.See, e.g., Editorial, \\"On telling dying patients the truth\\", Journal of Medical Ethics, 1982 (8): 115-116, treating the argument that the duty to \\"do no harm\\" can include not adding to the woes of a terminally ill patient, among other justifications. When health care providers began to move away from that practice, many still did not fully inform patients who were about to make decisions about future health care and particularly surgery. Instead, many practitioners revealed only information that another physician might provide, following a rule known as \\"the professional standard\\". Risks, in particular, were often glossed over or omitted entirely. Although the right to consent in medical situations had been recognized for decades, the notion of informed consent was new.  The Case  Jerry Watson Canterbury (1939-2017) was an F.B.I. clerk who suffered a ruptured disk in 1958. He was operated on by Dr. William T. Spence, a well-known Washington neurosurgeon, and as a result of the surgery, and a subsequent fall from his bed while hospitalized, he ended up paralyzed below the waist and incontinent. Canterbury sued for malpractice on the grounds of negligence.Murphy, Walter J Jr., Canterbury v. Spence‚Äîthe case and a few comments The Forum (Section of Insurance, Negligence and Compensation Law, American Bar Association) Vol. 11, No. 3 (Spring 1976), pp. 716-726 He was discharged from the hospital three and a half months later, his legs partly paralyzed. During the 1968 trial, the defense argued that since Canterbury lacked expert testimony, the case could not proceed. This lack of testimony was likely the result of a \\"conspiracy of silence\\" that, at the time, prevented doctors from testifying against one another. Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III of the DC Circuit Court allowed the case to go to a jury, deciding both that an expert was not necessary in such cases and that the standard for informed consent was what a reasonable patient would want to know in rendering a decision. At the second trial, Dr. Spence acknowledged that he had told Canterbury and his mother only that the surgery might result in ‚Äúweakness\\" without mentioning paralysis, and that he avoided a more specific warning so as not to deter the patient from pursuing the operation. Nevertheless, the jury ruled against Canterbury.  Impact  According to Dr. Jacob M. Appel, \\"[t]he major legal implication of the decision...was that it largely shifted our culture from a ‚Äòprofessional practice standard‚Äô to a ‚Äòreasonable person standard‚Äô in malpractice cases, undermined the tradition and practice of physicians not testifying against each other, and largely opened the floodgates to the far more litigious medicolegal culture we have today.\\" Monday, April 27, 2020  References  Category:1972 in United States case law Category:Health law in the United States Category:Medical malpractice Category:Medical lawsuits ","title":"Canterbury v.

It was first published in 1970 and is her most widely read novel. Abigail is an adventure story about a teenage girl who attends a Calvinist girls' school in eastern Hungary during World War II. In the Hungarian Big Read in 2005, it was voted the sixth most popular novel in Hungary. It was the third most popular Hungarian novel on the list. The novel has been translated into Czech, French, German, Italian, Latvian, Polish, and Romanian. An English translation by Len Rix was published in January 2020. Plot summary The main character of the novel is Georgina \\"Gina\\" Vitay, a spoiled girl from Budapest, the daughter of a general. In 1943, her father sends her away to the Matula Institute, a rural Protestant girls' boarding school, without an explanation. The closed Puritan world of Matula forces Gina, who is used to wealth and freedom, to give up many things in her life. She has to cut off the connection between herself and the outside world. The strict rules, the busy schedule, the unornamented, monotone environment are far from her previous easy life. After her classmates ostracize her and brand her as a traitor, she feels lonely and tries to escape. Her attempt fails as Mr K√∂nig finds her and takes her back to the school, but it makes her father tell her why she must stay there. General Vitay is the leader of the Resistance within the military, and he does not want his enemies to find his daughter. Learning this, the girl shows maturity as she voluntarily accepts her \\"captivity\\" and reconciles with the others. The Institute is not rigorous any more, as she becomes one of the twenty sisters and accepts Matula's traditions, which until then she found childish. The school's greatest legend has woven around the statue in the garden, which the girls name Abig√©l. The mysterious benefactor who helps everyone if they write Abig√©l a letter appears in Gina's life too. Moreover, Abig√©l not only solves adolescent problems but takes on serious social responsibilities, such as getting new documents for the students who have Jewish ancestry. Gina's father does not call her for months, but she calms down when her suitor from home, Feri Kuncz, finds her and wants to run away with her. The plan fails, but still the girl has to leave. The winds of war have arrived at the seemingly impregnable Matula. Helped by Mici Horn, an ex- pupil of Matula and a war widow, Gina escapes from the Institute. She gets a new identity and finds out that the teacher she hated and looked down on during the school year is actually her greatest helper and the saver of many lives. Adaptations The novel's success resulted in a TV series, produced in 1978. The novel was also adapted into a musical that premiered in March 2008.

Launched in August 2012, Lottie's motto \\"Be bold, be brave, BE YOU\\" reflects the company aim of providing a relatable and childlike doll that encourages kids to be kids. Lottie promotes STEM subjects for kids and was even the first doll in space when she travelled to the International Space Station alongside British European Space Agency Astronaut, Tim Peake, on the Principia Mission, in December 2015.  History  Arklu co- founders, Ian Harkin and Lucie Follett, based in London at the time, noticed a niche in the market, with parents concerned about the over-sexualization of dolls currently available in the market. They began 18-months of research, alongside British academics, resulting in Lottie; a doll based on the proportions of an average 9-year-old girl (with the exception of her head, which is larger to allow more hairstyling play). The research was gathered by leading British academics, Professor David McCarthy (Prof of Nutrition and Health - Institute for Health Research & Policy, London Metropolitan University) and Dr Margaret Ashwell OBE (formerly Science Director of the British Nutrition Foundation). Lottie is childlike and relatable; she doesn't wear jewellery, make-up or high heels ‚Äì opting for raincoats, striped tights, dresses and wellington boots. Lottie can stand on her own two feet. Lottie was launched in August 2012, and Finn joined the collection in 2014. 2017 will see the introduction of Mia, Sammi and Sophia. Arklu co-founder and Managing Director Ian Harkin decided to move from London to Letterkenny in County Donegal, close to Ian's hometown of Ballybofey in 2014. Donegal is commonly acknowledged as a blackspot for unemployment, and many young people are forced to move away to pursue careers. Having secured a grant from Enterprise Ireland's High Potential Start-Up Fund, Arklu were able to move and expand their business. Lucie Follett was Arklu's Creative Director with responsibility for all brand building, product development and product partnerships. = Google Adopt a Start-Up = Arklu was also named the winner of the \\"Google, girls award Adopt a Start-Up\\" programme in 2016. Eight finalists were chosen to present their company strategy to a panel of judges. Arklu was awarded ‚Ç¨10,000 AdWords Credit, $20,000 Cloud Credit, and is now eligible for the Google Cloud Platform for Start-Up program. The \\"Adopt a Start-Up\\" Programme was created to assist companies in developing their business strategies and accelerate the growth of high-potential Start-Ups in Ireland.  Products  Lottie and Finn are the main characters of the Arklu line. Lottie changes in appearance with different hair and skin tones. Finn was launched in 2014, and his clothes both fit Finn and Lottie, allowing boys and girls to interchange outfits. New friends of Lottie, Sammi and Mia, have recently been released One of the most successful competitions Arklu have organised was encouraging kids to design an outfit for Lottie ‚Äì resulting in the first ever commercial production of a crowd-sourced design. The winning design, Superhero Lottie, was produced based on the drawing by 6-year old, Lily, from Ohio, and was independently judged by the Brave Girls Alliance. = European Space Agency & Stargazer Lottie = Stargazer Lottie was designed by 6-year old Abigail from Canada. She came up with the idea for an astronomy- based doll due to her interest, and her wanting other kids to learn more about space. She emailed Arklu, explaining her idea, and in collaboration with the European Space Agency, and help from Dr Karen Masters (female astronomer at Portsmouth University), Stargazer Lottie was created. Stargazer Lottie was the first doll to ever make it into space ‚Äì voyaging alongside British astronaut Tim Peake. Peake even tweeted about Lottie while in space. Lottie spent 264 days aboard the International Space Station during the Principia Mission. Stargazer Lottie comes with a telescope, tripod, solar system collector cards, and an additional sheet on notable women in Astronomy. = TrowelBlazers & Fossil Hunter Lottie Partnership = Fossil Hunter Lottie was created in partnership with \\"TrowelBlazers\\". TrowelBlazers is a group of female archaeologists, geologists and palaeontologists, who aim to inspire and educate the next generation of trowel wielders by promoting STEM pursuits, past and present. Fossil Hunter Lottie comes with fossil hunting tools (magnifying glass, trowel and geology hammer), four ammonite fossils, collector cards on British fossil hunter/palaeontologist Mary Anning, and an additional sheet of notable women in palaeontology. = Penguin Random House Partnership = Arklu signed a book deal with Penguin Random House (PRH), to last a three-year contract. The books are an extension of the Lottie, Finn and Friends collection ‚Äì covering the adventures of the children over a range of topics including friendship, family and childhood. = WAGGGS & Brownie Lottie Partnership = Lottie Dolls signed a three-year deal with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The range is based on a Brownie Doll, and will also encompass Scouting activities and outfits. The line made its debut at the London Toy Fair in January 2017 and is expected to launch in July 2017. = Toy Like Me Partnership = Toy Like Me is an organisation celebrating disabilities, or as they call it \\"diff:abilities\\" and calling on international toy manufacturers around the world to represent these kids in the toy market. They collate information on where to buy toys, advise on how to makeover toys for kids, and their ongoing campaigns reflect their aim to make the toy box more reflective of every child. Arklu was quick to respond to the call, with 25% of Lottie dolls with glasses, and agreeing to make future ranges more disability representative. Their range now features a doll with a cochlear implant. Monthly 'Inspired by Real Kids' Competitions Following the success of previous collaborations with children, the Lottie website invites children to submit designs. The winning designs are occasionally turned into Lottie dolls and outfits which can be purchased through the website.  Awards  Lottie, Finn and friends have been well received within the toy community since their launch, having secured over 20 awards across multiple years and product ranges. Notably, they received the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Best Toy Award in 2012, 2013 and 2015, and were a runner-up for both Doll of the Year and Action Figure of the Year during the 2017 TOTY (Toy of the Year) Awards. As Arklu's cofounder and Creative Director, Lucie Follett was winner of the (UK) ToyNews 'Innovator of the Year' Award 2015 and shortlisted for the chiTag (USA) 'Toy Designer of the Year' TAGIE Award 2015. Follett exited the company in November 2016 and retains a small equity stake in Arklu.

The metal armor and the glass was used in the carpentry as the doors of streets and interiors were made in cedar. Wrought iron would decorate window openings and stair rails. The access to the different floors was done by means of two electric elevators and a staircase, also having another one for fires. In 1918, during the construction process, a seventh floor was added to the restaurant and club, specially built for it. This Lunch Club was organized by representatives, bankers, merchants and professionals in general of Havana and worked until 1928 when they decided to occupy the spaces for offices. In 1921 reforms were made on the second floor related to the closing of vain and the construction of a new vault, this time for books. A central court from the second floor, the corresponding portion at the ground floor was closed by a skylight of wired and leaded glass over the banking hall. left Its fa√ßade, framed by classical orders, is removed from the sidewalk so that its entrance becomes more accessible and distinguished. Voluminous columns give way to the stairway that led directly to the entrance of the bank, ranking it with respect to the rest of the facades. The building is a large block divided into three bodies, the first formed by the ground floor; the second, for the rest of the floors, and in the last, a large cornice as a finishing touch. The architect Pedro Mart√≠nez Incl√°n made the following observation referring to this type of buildings: \\"... in general almost all modern buildings, for shops and offices demonstrate a marked influence of New York architecture with its large number of floors, the sobriety of ornaments, the very long vertical lines of its fa√ßade, its large cornices and the monotonous distribution of its gaps, which due to climate needs are made in Cuba, are wider\\". The Royal Bank of Canada, at the facade level expresses different scales. The use of colossal columns from the basement to the cornice, the ornamentation concentrated on the first floor and the rest is treated as single monumentality showed, in addition to its architectural significance, the bank's hegemony in the finance sector of the city.

These GPUs use the Graphics Core Next (GCN) 5th generation architecture, codenamed Vega, and are manufactured on 14 nm FinFET technology, developed by Samsung Electronics and licensed to GlobalFoundries. The series consists of desktop graphics cards and APUs aimed at desktops, mobile devices, and embedded applications. The lineup was released on 14 August 2017. It included the RX Vega 56 and the RX Vega 64, priced at $399 and $499 respectively. These were followed by two mobile APUs, the Ryzen 2500U and Ryzen 2700U, in October 2017. February 2018 saw the release of two desktop APUs, the Ryzen 3 2200G and the Ryzen 5 2400G, and the Ryzen Embedded V1000 line of APUs. In September 2018 AMD announced several Vega APUs in their Athlon line of products. Later in January 2019, the Radeon VII was announced based on the 7nm FinFET node manufactured by TSMC.  History  The Vega microarchitecture is AMD's high- end graphics cards line, and is the successor to the R9 300 series enthusiast Fury products. Partial specifications of the architecture and Vega 10 GPU were announced with the Radeon Instinct MI25 in December 2016. AMD later teased details of the Vega architecture.  Announcement  Vega was originally announced at AMD's CES 2017 presentation on 5 January 2017, alongside the Zen line of CPUs.  New features  Vega targets increased instructions per clock, higher clock speeds, and support for HBM2. AMD's Vega features new memory hierarchy with high-bandwidth cache and its controller. Support for HBM2 featuring double the bandwidth-per-pin over previous generation HBM. HBM2 allows for higher capacities with less than half the footprint of GDDR5 memory. Vega architecture is optimized for streaming very large datasets and can work with a variety of memory types with up to 512TB of virtual address space. Primitive shader for improved geometry processing. Replaces vertex and geometry shaders in geometry processing pipelines with a more programmable single stage. The primitive shader stage is more efficient, introduces intelligent load balancing technologies and higher throughput. NCU: Next Compute Unit a Next-generation compute engine. The Vega GPU introduces the Next-Gen Compute Unit. Versatile architecture featuring flexible compute units that can natively process 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit operations in each clock cycle. And run at higher frequencies. Vega brings support for Rapid Packed Math, processing two half-precision (16-bit) in the same time as a single 32-bit floating-point operation. Up to 128 32-bit, 256 16-bit or 512 8-bit ops per clock are possible with the Vega architecture. Draw Stream Binning Rasterizer designed for higher performance and power efficiency. It allows for \\"fetch once, shade once\\" of pixels through the use of a smart on- chip bin cache and early culling of pixels invisible in a final scene. Vega cards can consume comparatively less power along with same or even better performance when the card is undervolted. An offset off 0.25V is proving really cool and efficient. Vega bumps Direct3D feature level support from 12_0 to 12_1. Vega's rasteriser brings hardware-acceleration support for Rasterizer Ordered Views and Conservative Rasterisation Tier 3.

Currently, Sri Lanka's quota in the IBERT is approximately 515.4 million dollars, thus allotting 5,846 votes or 0.25% of the total votes in the institution. Sri Lanka later became a member of the other institutions in the world bank such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on July 20, 1956, with a current quota of 7.491 million dollars, allotting 8,311 votes or 0.32% of the total votes; the International Development Association (IDA) on June 27, 1961, with a current share of 98,100 votes or 0.36% within the institution; the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on November 11, 1967; and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) on May 27, 1988, with a current quota of 4.78 million SDR ($5.64 million). Sri Lanka is currently in the India-led constituency for these organizations, representing the country as part of the South Asian block. Current strategy The World Bank initiated projects to help Sri Lanka transition from a lower-middle income country into an upper-middle income country with the aid of the World Bank's Country Partnership Framework (CPF) which is made up of the IDA, IFC, and MIGA. The CPF has claimed a prominent role in recommending Sri Lanka's development policy, focusing on macro-fiscal stability, private sector-led growth, export competitiveness, and global integration. The Bank itself has grouped Sri Lanka's development strategy into three priorities. The first priority is improving the country's fiscal stability and competitiveness through the creation of private sector jobs for the lower end of its population. The second priority focuses on creating economic and social opportunities for its citizens, such as reducing the concentration of poverty, increasing access to education, and boosting the size of its labor force. Finally, the third priority focuses on improving the country's green initiative. This includes projects that reduce the environmental impact of economic transformation, managing resources, and preventing natural disasters. These strategies have manifested themselves in 16 projects with the IDA and IBRD that focus on urban operations and education and an IFC investment of approximately $1 billion. The World Bank is alleged by TamilNet to have funded supposed \\"genocidal Sinhala colonisation of Tamil lands in Batticaloa\\". Recent projects Sri Lanka has approximately four million students, 215,000 teachers, and 10,000 schools. Education makes up about 1.9% of its GDP or 7.3% of its government's budget as of 2014. The IDA has worked with Sri Lanka's government to develop an initiative called the program for school improvement whose aim has been to improve students' access to schools and learning. The IDA has financed this education project with a $100 million contribution, making it Sri Lanka's fifth education project to date. As a result, student retention through grade 11 went up from 82% in 2011 to 85% in 2016. Sri Lanka began projects in order to increase the quality of higher education, through the aid of IDA. IDA helped finance Sri Lanka's education projects with a $51 million disbursement from 2003-2010. From this financing, Sri Lanka began the Higher Education for the 21st Century (HETC) project. Through this project, it was able to establish review boards of universities, provide grants, and partner university programs with industries. An additional project is the Sri Lanka Financial Sector Modernization Project which costs $75 million. Despite significant challenges, Sri Lanka's economic performance remained broadly satisfactory in the first half of 2017. The corrective policy measures taken in the monetary and fiscal fronts have led to gradual stabilization. The construction sector's rapid recovery supported by a strong rebound in investment was partially able to mitigate the impact of inclement weather conditions on the real sector. External buffers strengthened thanks to foreign exchange purchases and improved capital flows. Inflation has risen since the second half of 2016 due to drought and changes to the VAT Act. Authorities pursued the economic reform agenda presented in the government policy statements, albeit at a slower pace, owing to the difficulties faced in a complex political environment and institutional constraints on policy implementation. Parliament passed a new Inland Revenue Law in September 2017, which marks a key milestone towards sustainable revenue-led fiscal consolidation.

The film became the official Film in Residency at Facets Distribution for the entire month of November in 2016. It stars Marc Slanger, Jordan Lewis, Mark Baker and Conrad Brooks in his last performance. Sell coined the term Appalachiasploitation referring to the film's style.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5260314/ Plot John and Samantha Harris, newlyweds who've just suffered a miscarriage, seek to start their already crumbling marriage somewhere outside of New York City. John, an alcoholic suffering from PTSD, struggles to cope. Their drastic age difference causes more tension. Yet, when he is relocated by his Land Development firm to a small town deep within the Appalachian Mountains in order to oversea the development of a Casino, it seems like the perfect opportunity for the couple. Warned that there may be some anger and resentment from the townsfolk, the Newlyweds proceed into the heart of Appalachia with healthy optimism. It doesn't take long until things begin to feel sinister towards the couple. And soon, a slew of harrowing and terrifying events begin to take place within their new home. Soon, it becomes evident that not only are they not wanted, but they have found themselves wrapped up within a nightmarish tapestry of pure evil that lurks within the underbelly of small town America. Production The film was self-financed by director Courtney Fathom Sell and actor/co-producer Marc Slanger. Additional investors were brought on board near completion. Shot on location in Frostburg Maryland, New York City, Marion, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Mattapoisett Massachusetts, principal photography wrapped in late 2016. Mainly known for his DIY independent films, Don't Let the Devil in was Sell's first budgeted feature. The film mixes recognizable elements from popular giallo films as well as numerous exploitation films with Sell stating that he was inspired by films such as Race with the Devil, All the Colors of the Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore and Morbo. The style of the film has been compared to early works of Dario Argento. The film was made with a close knit group of friends and family, as lead actress Jordan Lewis was one of Sell's close friends long before the film began production and Cinematographer Brian Slanger is main actor Marc Slanger's brother. Additionally, Don't Let the Devil in was based on a short film Sell and Slanger made years earlier entitled House on the Edge of Hell which was shot on a Flip Cam for 27 dollars. Soundtrack In addition to writing and directing, Sell composed the entire soundtrack which has gained comparisons to the early music of John Carpenter. Sell has stated that he was extremely inspired by the music of Goblin and that he completed the entire score during the writing stages of production. Release The film saw a limited theatrical release in the late fall of 2016 and continued to screen theatrically until winter of 2016. The film was made the official Film in Residency by Facets Multi-Media during the entire month of November 2016. Don't Let the Devil in saw a nationwide VOD release on October 3, 2017. On September 18, 2017 the film was released on VHS as an exclusive collectors edition.

Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 2009, 19: 600‚Äì606 The loss of DNA effectively achieves two purposes. First, the eliminated copy restores the normal gene dosage in the diploid organism.Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91‚Äì98 Second, the changes in chromosomal genetic structure increase the divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes (similar chromosomes from inter-species hybrid) and promotes homologous chromosome pairing.Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518 Both are important in terms of adjusting to the induced genome shock.  Evolution of genes to ensure correct chromosome pairing  There have been rare events in which genes that ensure proper chromosome pairing have evolved shortly after polyploidization. One such gene, Ph1, exists in hexaploid wheat.Martinez-Perez, E,, P. Shaw and G. Moore The Ph1 locus is needed to ensure specific somatic and meiotic centromere association Nature 411: 204-207 These genes keep the two sets of genomes separately by either spatially separating them or giving them a unique chromatin identity to facilitate recognition from its homologous pair. This prevents the need of rapid gene loss to speed up homeologous chromosome diversification.  Drive for diploidization  ; Coordinate inter-genomic gene expression : Duplicated genes often result in increased dosage of gene products. Doubled dosages are sometimes lethal to the organism thus the two genome copies must coordinate in a structured fashion to maintain normal nuclear activity.Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91‚Äì98 Many mechanisms of diploidization promote this coordination. ; Maintain intra-genomic chromosome pairing at meiosis : Chromosome pairing during meiosis is a significant challenge for polyploids. Homoeologous chromosomes with similar genetic content may pair with each other resulting in trivalent or tetravalent interactions.Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 2009, 19: 600‚Äì606 The resolution of these structures results in chromosome breakage, rearrangement, and gamete infertility.

Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518 ; Reduce costs of maintaining large, duplicated genomes : Large genomes are costly to synthesize during replication and hard to maintain.Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518 The loss of duplicated genes during diploidization effectively reduces the overall size of the genome.  Revolutionary vs. evolutionary changes  Once a polyploid is made, either synthetically or naturally, the genome goes through a period of \\"genome shock\\". Genome shock can be defined as a stage in which the genome experiences massive reorganization and structural changes to deal with the external stress (X-ray damage, chromosome duplication, etc.) imposed upon the genome.McClintock, Barbara The significance of responses of the genome to challenge Science 1984, 226: 792‚Äì801 Such changes are termed revolutionary changes and occur early in the process of diploidization.Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518 Revolutionary changes ensure that the organism has a stable genome that can be passed to its progeny. At the end of this process, certain duplicated genes may be preserved thus allowing evolution to shape them into novel functions. This is commonly termed as neofunctionalization. The mechanism of retaining duplicated genes is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that dosage balance may play a key role in shaping the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91‚Äì98 Evolutionary changes refer to the long process of converting duplicated genes into diverse, functional gene derivatives.Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518  Mechanisms  There are many ways in which a polyploid organism can convert back to a diploid status. This is usually achieved by elimination of duplicated genes. The main goals of diploidization are: (1) To ensure proper gene dosage; and (2) to maintain stable cellular division processes. This process does not need to occur rapidly for all chromosomes in one or few steps. In recent polyploid events, segments of the genome may still remain in a tetraploid status. In other words, diploidization is a long ongoing process that is shaped by both intrinsic and evolutionary drives.Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday‚Äôs Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333‚Äì341. = Abnormal chromosome pairing = Normally, homologous chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes are present in the nucleus, homeologous chromosomes can also pair with homologous chromosomes resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents.Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 2009, 19: 600‚Äì606 The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the chromosomes and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few chromosomes. = Illegitimate recombination = When homeologous chromosomes pair up though bivalents or multivalents, illegitimate genetic crossovers may occur.Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 2009, 19: 600‚Äì606 Since the chromosomes may differ in genetic structure and content, segments of the chromosome may be shuffled around resulting in massive gene loss. Additionally, illegitimate recombinations may also result in dicentric chromosomes lead to chromosome breakage during anaphase.Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 2009, 19: 600‚Äì606 This further contributes to gene loss on duplicated chromosomes. = Relaxed selective pressure on duplicated genes = The duplicated copies of a gene are commonly non-essential to the plant‚Äôs ability to maintain normal growth and development. Therefore, one copy is generally free to mutate/be lost from the genome.Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat‚Äîa revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511‚Äì518Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday‚Äôs Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41. This contributes to gene loss through the massive chromosome reorganization events during genome shock. = Neofunctionalization = As mentioned earlier, duplicated genes are under relaxed selective pressure. Thus it may also be subject to neofunctionalization, the process in which a duplicated gene obtains a novel function.

Photoconductive polymers have been used in a wide variety of technical applications such as Xerography (electrophotography) and laser printing. Electrical conductivity is usually very small in organic compounds. Conductive polymers usually have large electrical conductivity. Photoconductive polymer is a smart material based on conductive polymer, and the electrical conductivity can be controlled by the amount of radiation. The basic parameters of photoconductivity are the quantum efficiency of carrier generation(\\\\Upsilon), the carrier mobility(\\\\mu), electric field(E), temperature(T), and concentration(C) of charge carriers. The intrinsic properties of photoconductive polymers are the quantum efficiency (\\\\Upsilon) and carrier mobility(\\\\mu), which will determine the photocurrent. Photocurrent will be effected by these four kinds of processes: charge-carrier generation, charge injection, charge trapping, charge carrier transport. Hundreds of photoconductive polymers have been disclosed in patents and literature. There are mainly two types of photoconductive polymer: negative photoconductive polymers and magnetic photoconductive polymers.  Definition  Photoconductivity is an optical and electrical phenomenon, which material's electrical conductivity increase by absorption of electromagnetic radiation (e.g. visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light). Photoconductive polymers can serve as good insulators when the electricity, free electrons and holes are absent. In general, the polymers usually satisfy these two features. 1\\\\. Photoconductive polymers can absorb light to excite electrons from ground state to excited state. The photoexcited electron will form a pair of charge carriers, it can be separated by electric field. 2\\\\. Photoconductive polymers must allow migration of either photoexcited electrons or holes, or both, through the polymer in the electric field towards the appropriate electrodes. Photoconductive polymers act merely as charge- transporting media, and it can be p-type or n-type, however most known photoconductive polymers are p-type (only transport holes). Photocurrents usually observed are very small in organic compounds. The mobilities Œº are typically 10‚àí12-10‚àí18 m2V‚àí1s‚àí1. And photocurrents are usually effected by charge-carrier generation, injection and transport. Photoconductive polymers have been developed into different types, there are two mainly types, one is negative photoconductivity, another one is magnetic photoconductivity. The photoconductive polymers have been greatly enriched the photoconductive material, and there are many applications (e.g. xerography, laser printers) = Negative = Some materials exhibit decrease in photoconductivity upon exposure to illumination. One prominent example is hydrogenated amorphous silicon in which a metastable reduction in photoconductivity is observable. Other materials that were reported to exhibit negative photoconductivity include molybdenum disulfide, graphene, and metal nanoparticles.  Factors influencing the photocurrent  When light is absorbed by a material, the number of free electrons and electron holes increases and raises its electrical conductivity. To cause excitation, the light that strikes to the materials must have enough energy to raise electrons across the band gap, or to excite the impurities within the band gap. And this process will involve four kinds of processes: charge-carrier generation, charge injection, charge trapping, charge carrier transport.  Charge-carrier generation  236x236px The charge-carrier generation can be affected in different aspects: photons absorbed, polymer itself, photoexcitation of photosensitive material. The mechanism for intrinsic photogeneration is as illustrated. As Onsager originally developed this theory: The encounter complex will formed by photoexcitation with migration of the exciton to an acceptor site. The photogeneration efficiency is determined by the competition between carrier separation and geminate recombination. The photogeneration efficiency was defined by using the dissociation of ion pairs in weak electrolytes, which can be expressed as a function of electric field, temperature and the separation distance of the bound hole-electron pair. The overall photogeneration efficiency \\\\phi (E) can be given by \\\\phi (E)=\\\\phi_0\\\\int p(r,\\\\Theta,E)g(r,\\\\Theta)d^3r d^3r is a volume element, \\\\phi is the primary quantum yield, p(r,\\\\Theta,E)is the probability that a hole-electron pair separated by a distance r at an angle \\\\Theta to the direction of electric field E, g(r,\\\\Theta) is the spatial distribution function between ions. Efficient injection of charge into the layer plays an important role in the operation with a photogeneration layer. Under quasi-steady state conditions, it can be written by the flowing equation: \\\\frac{dn}{dt}=\\\\phi I-\\\\gamma_r n^2-\\\\gamma_i n\\\\thickapprox0 \\\\phi I is the rate of the incident photons that are absorbed in the photogeneration, \\\\gamma_r n^2 is the rate of the density of free carriers in the generation layer reduced by recombination, \\\\gamma_i n is the injection rate. Assuming that the charges cross the interface will not return, the photoinjection efficiency \\\\Upsilon can be defined as \\\\Upsilon=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_i n}{I}=\\\\delta [(1+\\\\frac{2\\\\phi}{\\\\delta})^\\\\frac{1}{2}-1)] , when \\\\delta=\\\\gamma_i^2/2I\\\\gamma_r (i)For a large \\\\delta or low recombination rates, \\\\Upsilon=0 , in which case the photoinjection efficiency is determined by the generation efficiency. (ii)For a small \\\\delta or high recombination rates, \\\\Upsilon=(2\\\\delta\\\\phi)^\\\\frac{1}{2} and the photoinjection efficiency will depend on the injection rate, \\\\gamma_i.  Charge transport  Charge transport can be defined as the process that photogenerated charge in photoconductors be injected into the transport material. When charges injected, charges will migrate through the medium and then reach to the opposite electrode. In this process, electrons or holes or both, involves 'hopping', for example, a sequence of transfers of charges among localized sites. These localized sites are connected with individual functional groups or segments of the polymer chain. Generally, hole injection, or transfer of holes into the transporting media. This process can be regarded as an oxidation step with cation radicals generate. Meanwhile, electron injection is a reduction process. Based on the properties of charge transport, the photoconductive polymers usually satisfy one of the features: (1)Photoconductive polymers are œÉ-conjugated. (2)Photoconductive polymers have an extended œÄ-electron system in the backbone pendant to the chain. These features guarantee delocalization and stabilize the transport charge.  Charge trapping  Charge trapping is an important processes, in which migrating charges can be immobilized in trap sites. If the traps are 'shallow', they may be referred to as 'transportinteractive'. Hole trapping materials usually have lower oxidation potentials and work as host- transporting materials. Stronger electron acceptor have better ability to trap transport electron. Charges can be immobilized by redox-irreversible side- reactions due to the geminate recombination and recombination of carriers in the circuit. In this process, charged moiety can be illustrated by the scheme:(a)Charge immobilization due to a redox-irreversible side-reaction (a) The redox steps to achieve trap-free migration of a hole involving neutral groups M and charged groups M+ (b)Charge immobilization due to a redox- irreversible side-reaction (b) The intermittent species Mj+ can undergo two kinds of process: (i) The migration of electron from Mk will result in forming Mj coming from Mj+ (ii) Mj+ undergo a side-reaction leading to a charged species X+ that won't further exchange the charge with the neighboring group M.  Experimental techniques  = General introduction = There are some parameters in photoconductive polymers: quantum efficiency of photogeneration \\\\phi, the carrier mobility \\\\mu and the injection efficiency \\\\Upsilon. These parameters can not be got in steady-state measurements, \\\\phi and \\\\mu are very important parameters in the expression of photoconductivity, they are obtained from independent experiments. Transient techniques, time-of-flight (TOF) and xerographic discharge are conventional transient techniques which are used to determine the parameters of photoconductive polymers. And they all need to be done under non-injecting contacts. = Experimental determination of charge carrier mobility = The charges will be generated in the region, which closed to the electrode the incident photos are absorbed. In order to avoid the migrating charges as a current pulse, RC have a smaller value than {t_{Tr}}(RC<{t_{Tr}}, R: resistance, C: capacitance and {t_{Tr}}: transit time of the charges). The signal is a rectangle with an amplitude i_0 without excessive charge dispersion and can be expressed as below: i_0=\\\\frac{e\\\\phi N}{t_{Tr}}, where e is the electronic charge and N is the number of absorbed photos And the current will close to 0 when the charges reach to the electrode, so the carrier mobility can be expressed as below: \\\\mu=\\\\frac{L}{E t_{Tr}}, where L is the thickness of the film. In the xerographic technique, the corona-deposited charge plays the same role as the semitransparent electrode. The potential difference is monitored by a coupled probe. In the absence of charge trapping, the rate of potential decay has the form: \\\\frac{dV}{dt}\\\\boldsymbol{}\\\\in\\\\frac{I'\\\\phi}{C}, where C is capacitance and I' is the number of absorbed photons per unit area per unit time. By measuring the decay rate of the potential, \\\\mu and \\\\phi can be obtained, respectively.  Applications  The photoconductive polymer have been successfully applied in Xerography and laser printers. They used the layered organic photoconductive polymer with a polymeric charge-transport layer. The charge- transport layer is a solid solution compared with other printer that usually use liquid chemicals in printing process. The main advantages of organic photoconductive polymer are (i) near-IR sensitivity (ii) panchromaticity (iii)flexibility for application (iv) simple fabrication (v) low cost. Currently, the best organic photoconductive polymer are as sensitive as the inorganic devices based on selenium. There is some potential application in photovoltaic cells. The limit of this application is that photoconductive polymer don't have high conversion efficiency. Some possible applications are just reported by the literature but no commercial products. They are photothermoplastic imaging,Terrell, D.R. (1978) Photogr. Sci. Engng, 21, 66. holographic recording and optical switching devices. = Xerography = Xerography or electrophotography is a photocopying technique. Its fundamental principle was invented by Chester Carlson in 1938 and developed and commercialized by the Xerox Corporation, which is used for high-quality printing. To begin with, the technique was called electrophotography, then it was renamed to xerography. In traditional reproduction techniques, liquid chemicals are involved in printing process. Xerography use photoconductive polymer as the foundation material, which is solid chemicals. Carlson's innovation combined electrostatic printing with photography, unlike the electrostatic printing process invented by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in 1778. Carlson's original process requires several manual processing steps with flat plates. It was almost 18 years before a fully automated process was developed, the key breakthrough being use of a cylindrical drum coated with selenium instead of a flat plate. This resulted in the first commercial automatic copier(Xerox 914) in 1960. Before 1960, Carlson had proposed his idea to more than a dozen companies, but none was interested. Xerography is now used in most photocopying machines, laser and LED printers.\\"Photocopying processes\\". McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology vol. 13, p. 395, 10th edition, 2007 = Laser printers = Laser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process.Laser Printer - Definition of laser printer by Merriam-Webster\\". merriam-webster.com. It produces high-quality text and graphics by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a \\"drum\\" to get a charged image. The drum can selectively collect electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper. As digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. However, laser printing differs from analog photocopiers. Because the image is produced by direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor, which enables laser printing to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers. The first laser printer was invented by Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as the price fall, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous.

Background With Sasha's , birth, Xuxa's perception of the little ones' Brazilian music market was sharpened. There were almost no products and what was there was not well done. Watching her daughter dancing in front of the TV while watching one of the countless music video tapes she had bought on trips abroad, Xuxa was sure that this was what Brazil lacked: educational music. Not that the presenter had \\"uneducated\\" any child with her previous works; on the contrary, Xuxa always worried about leaving good messages in his work. The way to communicate is that it must be different, the way to reach the little ones and that's where the visual part comes in. Content Xuxa s√≥ para Baixinhos music videos, except Butterfly, were inspired by American videos (Barney) to Australians (The Wiggles). If we look for any of the tracks by the original name we will see that the design of the videos is the same: from the movements to the camera positioning and scenery. It was not time to take a risk, it was the first attack in this niche and wanting to change what was already accurate would be to jeopardize the success of the project, which for years already worked well outside Brazil.

Scaling vs. Decentralization.] Social Science Research Network. Cybersecurity, Privacy & Networks eJournal. Accessed 21 April 2019. It is related to the fact that records (known as blocks) in the bitcoin blockchain are limited in size and frequency. Bitcoin's blocks contain the transactions on the bitcoin network. The on-chain transaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network is limited by the average block creation time of 10 minutes and the block size limit of 1 megabyte. These jointly constrain the network's throughput. The transaction processing capacity maximum estimated using an average or median transaction size is between 3.3 and 7 transactions per second. There are various proposed and activated solutions to address this issue. Background The block size limit, in concert with the proof-of-work difficulty adjustment settings of bitcoin's consensus protocol, constitutes a bottleneck in bitcoin's transaction processing capacity. This can result in increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions that cannot be fit into a block. Various proposals have come forth on how to scale bitcoin, and a contentious debate has resulted. Business Insider in 2017 characterized this debate as an \\"ideological battle over bitcoin's future.\\" Forks Increasing the network's transaction processing limit requires making changes to the technical workings of bitcoin, in a process known as a fork. Forks can be grouped into two types: =Hard fork= Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of bitcoin increasing the maximum block size. Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited each supported an increase to the maximum block size. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a separate cryptocurrency from Bitcoin (BTC); and both trade at entirely independent valuations relative to each other, fiat currencies, and other assets. BitcoinSV (BSV) stands for Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, and is a Hard Fork of Bitcoin Cash, further increasing scalability. =Soft fork= Segregated Witness is an example of a soft fork. In case of a soft fork, all mining nodes meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software. Efficiency improvements Technical optimizations may decrease the amount of computing resources required to receive, process and record bitcoin transactions, allowing increased throughput without placing extra demand on the bitcoin network. These modifications can be to either the network, in which case a fork is required, or to individual node software (such as Bitcoin Core). * Schnorr signatures have been proposed as a scaling solution by long-time developer and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille. * Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) is a proposal by Johnson Lau which reduces the size of smart contracts (complex scripts), and increases their privacy. * A 2006 paper by Mihir Bellare enables signature aggregation in O(1) size, which means that it will not take more space to have multiple signers. Bellare-Neven reduces to Schnorr for a single key. Bellare-Neven has been implemented.https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/461 \\"Layer 2\\" systems A Lightning Network overview. The Lightning Network is a protocol that aims to improve bitcoin's scalability and speed without sacrificing trustless operation. The Lightning Network requires putting a funding transaction on the blockchain to open a payment channel. Once a channel is opened, connected participants are able to make rapid payments within the channel or may route payments by \\"hopping\\" between channels at intermediate nodes for little to no fee. In January 2018 Blockstream launched a payment processing system for web retailers called \\"Lightning Charge\\", noted that lightning was live on mainnet with 200 nodes operating as of 27 January 2018 and advised it should still be considered \\"in testing\\". On 15 March 2018, Lightning Labs released the beta version of its lnd Lightning Network implementation for bitcoin mainnet, and on 28 March 2018, ACINQ released a mainnet beta of its eclair implementation and desktop application. In January 2019 the online retailer Bitrefill announced that it receives more payments in Bitcoin via the lightning network than any of the altcoins they accept. Block size increases Transaction throughput is limited practically by a parameter known as the block size limit. Various increases to this limit, and proposals to remove it completely, have been proposed over bitcoin's history. =Proposed= * In 2015, BIP100 by Jeff Garzik and BIP101 by Gavin Andresen were introduced. * Bitcoin XT was proposed in 2015 to increase the transaction processing capacity of bitcoin by increasing the block size limit. * Bitcoin Classic was proposed in 2016 to increase the transaction processing capacity of bitcoin by increasing the block size limit. * \\"The Hong Kong Agreement\\" was a 2016 agreement of some miners and developers that contained a timetable that would see both the activation of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) proposal established in December 2015 by Bitcoin Core developers, and the development of a block size limit increased to 2 MB. However, both timelines were missed. * SegWit2x was a proposed hard fork of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The implementation of Segregated Witness in August 2017 was only the first half of the so-called \\"New York Agreement\\" by which those who wanted to increase effective block size by SegWit compromised with those who wanted to increase block size by a hard fork to a larger block size. The second half of SegWit2x involved a hard fork in November 2017 to increase the blocksize to 2 megabytes. On 8 November 2017 the developers of SegWit2x announced that the hard fork planned for around 16 November 2017 was canceled for the time being due to a lack of consensus. * Bitcoin Unlimited advocated for miner flexibility to increase the block size limit and is supported by mining pools ViaBTC, AntPool and investor Roger Ver. Bitcoin Unlimited's proposal is different from Bitcoin Core in that the block size parameter is not hard- coded, and rather the nodes and miners flag support for the size that they want, using an idea they refer to as 'emergent consensus.' Those behind Bitcoin Unlimited proposal argue that from an ideological standpoint the miners should decide about the scaling solution since they are the ones whose hardware secure the network.

Formally granted to the Jesuits, a representative of the Portuguese Crown was considered the highest authority in the city when present, as per Portuguese rights of Padroado. First contacts with the Portuguese Screen depicting the unloading of the black ship. The Portuguese carrack is depicted in great detail. The first Portuguese (and incidentally, Western) landfall on Japanese soil appears to have been in 1543, after a group of Portuguese merchants travelling aboard a trade junk towards China were blown off course to the island of Tanegashima. Thereafter, trade began between Portuguese Malacca, China and Japan, as the Portuguese took advantage of the Chinese trade embargo on Japan to act as middlemen between the two nations. In 1550, King John III of Portugal declared the Japanese trade a \\"crown monopoly\\", and henceforth, only ships authorized by Goa were allowed to make the journey. In 1557 the authorities of Canton (Guangzhou) leased Macau to the Portuguese to support this trade, in exchange for tribute in silver. The state of civil war in Japan was highly beneficial to the Portuguese, as several competing lords sought to attract the Portuguese \\"black ship\\" and its trade to their domains. Initially the Portuguese called either at Firando (Hirado) belonging to Matsura Takanobu, or Bungo belonging to ≈åtomo S≈çrin, but in 1562 shifted to Yokoseura when its lord, Omura Sumitada, offered to be the first lord to convert to Christianity, adopting the name Dom Bartolomeu. In 1564 he faced a rebellion instigated by Buddhist priests and Yokoseura was razed to the ground.Costa (1993) pg. 29 In 1571 Dom Bartolomeu, or Omura Sumitada, granted some land in the small fishing village of Nagasaki to the Jesuits, that was divided into six neighbourhoods, to receive exiled Christians from other territories and the Portuguese traders. The Jesuits constructed a chapel and a college under the name of St. Paul, like those of Goa and Malacca. By 1579 Nagasaki had 400 homes, with a few Portuguese casados (married men).Costa (1993) pg.40 =Lease= Fearful that Nagasaki might fall to his rival Takanobu, Omura Sumitada, or Dom Bartolomeu, decided to grant the city directly to the Jesuits in 1580.Costa (1993) pg.40 As appointed \\"Visitor of Missions in the Indies\\", Alessandro Valignano was responsible for concluding with Sumitada the terms of the lease, including all the legal details, being himself a jurist. The Jesuits would be responsible for electing a regedor to administer the city and pledge allegiance to Sumitada, who was still nominally considered the lord of the territory.Costa (1993) pg.41 By this bilateral agreement, Nagasaki was in a very similar situation as Macau, where the Portuguese had agreed to pay the authorities of Guangzhou a fee to in exchange for special privileges over the territory. The city The unloading of the black ship, right side of the screen shown above Unlike many Asian cities built on a grid inspired by the Chinese model, Nagasaki was built around a centre where the most important building were located, namely the church, the charity (the Miseric√≥rdia) and the town hall, though it did not have any fortifications.Costa (1993) pg.40 Between 1603 and 1613 Nagasaki would also have a painting school, guided by the Italian Giovanni Nicolo.C.R.

The city was described as having \\"an unusual amount of children\\" as its Christian inhabitants avoided infanticide, otherwise common in Japanese society.Lu√≠s Fr√≥is, Hist√≥ria do Jap√£o, volume IV pg.123. 1976 edition, Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa The houses were painted white, as in Portuguese fashion.

Whenever the ship was in port, its captain served as the highest authority in any matter pertaining the city. End of the grant In 1586, the lands of the Omura clan were overrun by forces of Shimazu Yoshihisa, greatly threatening the city. At the request of Otomo Sorin of Bungo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi intervened, and so Shimazu Yoshihisa was defeated the following year. Hideyoshi however, took the chance to announce the first anti-Christian edict, and ordered that Nagasaki be returned to Omura clan control, thus putting an end to foreign control of the city.Charles Boxer (1959): The Great Ship from Amacon, p.50 Nevertheless, it remained the main port of call for the Portuguese ships in the decades that followed.

Early life Hedden was born in 1828, in New York City, New York, to Josiah Hedden (who had studied law under Alexander Hamilton) and Elizabeth June Hedden. In 1855, he married Elizabeth Caroline Apgar. Career From 1859 to 1884, Hedden worked for the shipping firm of Wetmore, Cryer, and Co. He was also a director of the North River Bank and of the Niagara Insurance Company. Hedden was appointed Collector of the Port by Grover Cleveland on June 27, 1885. The appointment was made largely due to the influence of Hubert O. Thompson, the Commissioner of Public Works of the City of New York and local Democratic leader, as Hedden's son-in-law, Charles Campbell Worthington, was a contractor for the Department of Public Works. Other candidates for the post included J. Edward Simmons, president of the New York Stock Exchange, who was supported by Samuel Tilden, and J. J. O'Donohue, a member of Tammany Hall. Hedden ran into controversy when he removed George B. Bacon, a Republican appointee, from his post as chief weigher of the Brooklyn Customs House and replaced him with George H. Sterling, without administering a civil service exam, as this was not required by law. The decision was attacked by civil service reformers, who believed the appointment was politically motivated and that Sterling was incompetent, although Hedden defended his choice. Eventually, President Cleveland demanded a competitive examination and Sterling lost the post. On August 7, 1886, Hedden resigned his post and was replaced by Daniel Magone. In 1887, Hedden was named as the defendant in the case Nix v. Hedden, in which fruit importer John Nix sued Hedden to recover duties Nix believed were unnecessary. Nix wished to exempt his tomato imports from a vegetable tariff included in the Tariff of 1883, as tomatoes are botanically considered fruit. In 1893, the Supreme Court ruled against Nix, stating that tomatoes were generally considered vegetables and thus should be taxed as such.149 U.S. at 305.

B. Owens Pottery Company, informally known as Owens Pottery, was an American art pottery and tile company that flourished for a few years around the turn of the 20th century. History Owens Pottery was founded by J. B. Owens in Roseville, Ohio, in 1885. In 1891 it moved to Zanesville, where Owens built a new factory on a site with its own rail spur. It began producing art pottery in 1896, when it introduced the Utopian line with botanical decorations under a brown glaze. All told, it produced some four dozen different lines of art pottery, with types ranging from vases, bowls, and pitchers to umbrella stands and lamps. Popular lines included Utopian, Lightweight, Lotus, Henri Deux, and Matte Green. Especially distinctive lines include Red Flame (featuring slip decoration under a red glaze), Mission (depicting Spanish missions), and Coralene (featuring small bead decorations). The pottery won awards and was often compared to the work of rivals like Rookwood Pottery, Roseville Pottery, and Weller Pottery, all of which were also based in Ohio. Potters who were associated with Owens Pottery over the years include Albert Radford, W. A. Long (who founded Lonhuda), Frank Ferrell, Karl Langenbeck, John J. Herold, Herb Hugo, and John Lessell. A fire destroyed most of the Zanesville factory in 1902, but Owens rebuilt on the same site and took the opportunity to double in size to 11 kilns. Around the same time, Owens bought the New York‚Äìbased American Art-Ceramic Company. In 1905, Owens Pottery began making tiles, and this line quickly grew to dominate production, with the result that the Zanesville Tile Company was incorporated to handle this end of the business. Around 1907 Owens sold most of his stake in both companies, only to buy them back by 1909 after other investors pushed the tile business into receivership. Shortly thereafter, he set up a new company, J. B. Owens Floor & Wall Tile, with a new factory across the street from his former operations. For a few years the new company made both art pottery and tiles, but within a few years it stopped producing art pottery altogether. The company name was changed again, to the Empire Floor and Wall Tile Company. Owens also had stakes in other ceramic companies in Ohio and New Jersey, and he was awarded over 20 patents, most of them related to the design for a tunnel kiln. The Empire factory burned in 1928 and Owens effectively went out of business the following year, though his companies were involved in lawsuits for several more decades.

Such activation results in improved selectivity towards highly reactive thiol-containing molecules, namely cysteine residues in proteins. APN-based modification of proteins was reported to surpass several important drawbacks of existing strategies in bioconjugation, notably the presence of side reactions with other nucleophilic amino acid residues and the relative instability of the resulting bioconjugates in the blood stream. The latter drawback is especially important for the preparation of targeted therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates. Synthesis The synthesis of 3-arylpropiolonitriles has been the subject of several studies. The most elaborated and often used approach is based on MnO2-mediated free radical oxidation of the corresponding propargylic alcohols obtained using Sonogashira coupling of the corresponding iodo-derivative in the presence of ammonia (Figure 1). 475x475px Applications in biotechnology In bioconjugation (forming a stable covalent link between a biomolecule and a functional payloads, such as fluorescent dyes, cytotoxic agents, or tracers), linking of the payload was classically achieved using maleimide heterobifunctional reagents (for example, see SMCC). However, when administered into living organisms, maleimide-containing bioconjugates were found to be relatively unstable and lose the payload in the blood circulation due to reversibility of the addition reaction between maleimide moiety and cysteine residue of a protein (retro Michael addition). Due to increased stability of bioconjugates obtained with analogous APN-based payloads (a schematic reaction is shown in the Figure 2 below), their use is often preferable when high selectivity and biostability are especially important: namely for the preparation of antibody‚àídrug conjugates and other biologics. Standard procedure for APN protein labeling consists in incubation of a protein containing free cysteine residues with an APN-functionalized probe in PBS buffer at pH 7.5-9.0 at room temperature for 2‚Äì12 hours, followed by an optional step of purification of the resulting bioconjugate using size exclusion chromatography or ultrafiltration. 400x400px References Category:Biotechnology Category:Nitriles Category:Alkyne derivatives Category:Aromatic compounds ","title":"3-Arylpropiolonitriles"},{"id":"54069884","text":"The new cardiology, neurology and internal clinic building at the Faculty hospital in Nitra The Faculty Hospital in Nitra () is a hospital in the city of Nitra, in western Slovakia.

Etymology  The formation was first proposed and named after Soat√° by Villarroel et al. in 2001. The type locality is defined near Portugalete, Soat√°.Villarroel et al., 2001, p.80  Regional setting  The Soat√° Formation was deposited in a glacial lacustrine environment, in a narrow elongated deep paleolake The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, was formed late in the regional uplift of the Andean orogeny. It is estimated that the main stage of uplift happened during the Plio-Pleistocene. The Western and Central Ranges were submerged much earlier, leaving a corridor to the Caribbean in the Neogene. The compression in the Andean orogenic belt caused the formation of fold and thrust belts in the Eastern Ranges, where Cretaceous and Jurassic normal faults were inverted as thrust faults lifting up the Paleozoic (Floresta and Cuche Formations), Mesozoic and Paleogene strata. A hiatus existed on the Altiplano between the Late Eocene and Late Miocene, in several parts of the Altiplano continuing until the Pleistocene. During the glacials and interglacials of the Pleistocene (\\"ice ages\\"), several paleolakes formed on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, of which Lake Humboldt on the Bogot√° savanna was the most extensive (approximately ). Rivers were restricted during the drier glacial periods and the vegetation changed from p√°ramo to Andean forest between the glacials and stadials and interglacials and interstadials.Urrego et al., 2016, p.702  Description  gomphothere Haplomastodon waringi were found in the Soat√° Formation = Lithologies = The Soat√° Formation consists of whitish calcareous claystones and sandy siltstones with plagioclase, hematite, zircon, green and reddish biotite, hornblende and crystalline calcite in its upper, older terrace.

As of the 2016 census, the village population was 215. Name The village of Legan, situated in the townland of Smithfield, is also known as Lenamore () after the local watercourse the Lenamore Stream. Legan comes from 'Legan Bridge', a bridge which crosses the stream and which takes its name from the adjoining townland of Legan on the other side of the stream. The bridge spans the stream at the entrance to the village and has been a local feature since about 1775. The names therefore come from the proximity of the village to the bridge and the stream. The actual townland of Legan had an ancient enclosure called 'Legan Rock' which gives rise to the meaning of the name. Transport Legan is approximately 3 km from the N55 and 10 km from the N4 roads.

Background In 1814 the Swiss Confederation accepted Geneva's proposal to join the Confederation. At that time, it only covered a total of (about 44% of its modern size) and had only 14 of the 45 current municipalities. Additionally, Geneva city and its three neighbors, Vandoeuvres, Ch√™ne-Bougeries and Cologny were isolated from the remaining municipalities and from the rest of Switzerland. Only the isolated municipality of C√©ligny (which today is an exclave in the Canton of Vaud) was connected to the rest of the country. Before the canton could join Switzerland, it needed a land connection to the rest of the country and continuous borders. Tasked with gaining support from the Great Powers for Geneva joining Switzerland and gaining needed territory, the diplomat Charles Pictet de Rochemont was dispatched from Geneva to the Congress of Vienna and Paris. At the Congress of Vienna, Pictet de Rochemont was able to gain support for Geneva joining the country which it did in mid 1815. At the Second Paris Peace Talks, he was able to secure a strengthened acknowledgement of Swiss neutrality, a reparation of 3 million francs and part of the Pays de Gex along the northern shore of Lake Geneva. On 20 November 1815 the municipalities of Versoix, Collex-Bossy, Bellevue, Pregny-Chambesy, Le Grand-Saconnex, Meyrin and Vernier became part of the Canton of Geneva. These new communities expanded the canton by and 3,343 residents. The 1815 treaties indicated that the Kingdom of Sardinia should give Switzerland a strip of land along the south shore of Lake Geneva and lands around Mount Sal√®ve. However, the exact boundaries and a schedule were left up to the two nations. Additionally, beginning in 1792 the French revolutionary government had established tariffs on all goods, including food, going into the city which forced Geneva to accept annexation in 1798. For this reason the government wanted to gain additional farm land and establish trade treaties with their neighbors. Treaty of Turin In January 1816 Pictet de Rochemont met with Montiglio and Collegno in Turin to begin negotiating the exact borders. Pictet de Rochemont sought to connect the community of Jussy with the rest of the canton. Sardinia wanted to keep Mount Sal√®ve and the Sal√®ve road between Faucigny and Chablais, which would prevent linking with Jussy. They eventually compromised with Geneva receiving the lake shore as far east as Hermance and over to Th√¥nex, but giving the Sal√®ve area and road as well as the community of Saint-Julien- en-Genevois to Sardinia. Once these issues were settled, the treaty was nearly ready to sign. However, in early March the government of Geneva refused to sign the treaty over a pair of issues. The first dealt with the status, lodging and payments to the curia of the Catholic Church. The other was over the wording in Article VII, which dealt with the neutrality of the lands which Sardinia ceded to Switzerland. Both concerns were eventually addressed and on 16 March 1816 the treaty was signed. The treaty added a total of 24 new municipalities, and 12,700 new residents to the canton. The treaty established a customs free zone in what became the French district of Haute-Savoie, which included about of Sardinian land added to lands in the Arrondissement of Gex from 1815 for a total of about of free trade zones. Despite an attempt in 1919 by the French government to dissolve the free trade zones around Geneva, the International Court in The Hague ruled that these zones were still protected by the treaties. In 1998 these free trade zones imported about 47.3 million, while 2.3 million worth of goods were exported.

The 2016 general election saw Fine Gael lose seats, and its Labour Party coalition partners substantially diminished.

Elected to the position in 2017, Krasner campaigned on a platform to reform elements of the criminal justice system, including to reduce incarceration, and took office in January 2018. During his tenure, Krasner has sought to spearhead criminal justice reform by ending bail payments for low-level offenders, reducing supervision for parolees, and seeking more lenient sentences for certain crimes. Prior to his government service, Krasner had a 30-year career as a criminal defense and civil rights attorney and public defender. He aggressively pursued police misconduct. Early life and education Lawrence Krasner was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1961. His father, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, wrote crime fiction, and his mother was an evangelical Christian minister. His family moved to the Philadelphia area while he was still attending public school. He graduated from Conestoga High School in 1979. Krasner graduated from the University of Chicago in 1983.Class Notes: Larry Krasner, University of Chicago Magazine, Volume 91, Number 4, April 1999. He graduated from Stanford Law School, in 1987. Career After graduation and passing the bar, Krasner returned to Philadelphia to work for the Federal Public Defender‚Äôs Office. He opened his own law firm in 1993 and worked as a criminal defense lawyer in Philadelphia for 30 years, specializing in civil rights, and frequently representing protestors pro bono. Krasner's representation of Black Lives Matter and Occupy Philadelphia members led many to call him an \\"anti- establishment\\" candidate during his 2017 primary campaign for the Democratic nomination. He campaigned against existing policies that had resulted in disproportionately high numbers of minority males being jailed and proposed other reforms in criminal justice. Krasner was a featured speaker at the 2017 People's Summit. Philadelphia District Attorney = Election = Philadelphia district attorney R. Seth Williams announced in February 2017 that he would not run for reelection.Greg Salisbury, Philly DA Seth Williams won't run for re-election, City & State (February 10, 2017). Williams resigned from office and pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges in June 2017; his interim replacement, Kathleen Martin, chose not to run.Jon Hurdle, Philadelphia District Attorney Pleads Guilty to Bribery and Resigns, New York Times (June 29, 2017). Shortly before the candidacy announcement, John McNesby, president of Lodge 5 of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, derided Krasner's eventually successful run as \\"hilarious.\\" McNesby opposed Krasner's promise to refuse to prosecute defendants whose detainments were illegally performed so arresting officers could earn overtime pay as well as his history of suing police officers who perpetrated corruption and brutality.Abraham Gutman, The Two Big Reasons the Police Union Wants Larry Krasner to Lose, Philadelphia Magazine (November 3, 2017) Krasner received no major newspaper endorsements. Less than three weeks before the primary, a political action committee supporting Krasner's campaign received a $1.45 million contribution from billionaire George Soros. Krasner won the May 16th Democratic primary by more than 17%, defeating former city and federal prosecutor Joe Khan, former Philadelphia Managing Director Rich Negrin, former First Assistant District Attorney Tariq El-Shabazz, former prosecutor Michael Untermeyer, former prosecutor Jack O'Neill, and former Municipal Court Judge Teresa Carr Deni.Chris Brennan & Julia Terruso, Krasner declared winner of Democratic primary for DA in Philly, Philadelphia Inquirer (May 17, 2017).2017 PRIMARY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-DEM, Office of the Philadelphia City Commissioners. City officials reported voter turnout spiked nearly 50 percent compared to 2009, which was the last contested race for district attorney of Philadelphia. The primary was widely seen as a proxy election; the winner of the Democratic primary election is the presumptive victor of the general election since Philadelphia has almost seven times as many registered Democrats as registered Republicans. As expected, the November general election was not competitive, with Krasner getting almost three times as many votes as his Republican opponent, former assistant district attorney Beth Grossman.Chris Brennan & Aubrey Whelan, Larry Krasner wins race for Philly DA, Philadelphia Inquirer (November 7, 2017). =Tenure= In his first week in office, Krasner fired 31 prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office, including both junior and career supervisory staff. Up to one-third of the homicide prosecutors in the office were dismissed. Those fired represented nearly a 10% reduction in the number of Philadelphia assistant district attorneys.Chris Palmer, Julie Shaw & Mensah M. Dean, Krasner dismisses 31 from Philly DA's Office in dramatic first-week shakeup, Philadelphia Inquirer (January 5, 2018).Ryan Briggs & Max Marin, Leaked list shows Krasner firings targeted top staff, \\"Porngate\\" prosecutors, Philadelphia Weekly (January 5, 2017). In February 2018, Krasner announced that law enforcement would no longer pursue criminal charges against those caught with marijuana possession. That same month, Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop seeking cash bail for those accused of some misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. Krasner said that it was unfair to keep people in detention simply because they could not afford bail. He also announced that the DA's office had filed a lawsuit against a number of pharmaceutical companies for their role in the city's opioid epidemic. Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop charging sex workers who had fewer than three convictions. In March 2018, it was reported that Krasner's staffers were working on creating a sentence review unit‚Äìthe first of its kind in the country‚Äìto review past cases and sentences, and seek re-sentencing in cases when individuals were given unduly harsh punishments. That same month, Krasner instructed prosecutors to reduce sentence lengths to defendants making pleas, refuse to bring certain low-level charges, and publicly explain their reasoning for pursuing expensive incarcerations to taxpayers footing the bills. He said, > \\"Fiscal responsibility is a justice issue, and it is an urgent justice > issue. A dollar spent on incarceration should be worth it. Otherwise, that > dollar may be better spent on addiction treatment, on public education, on > policing and on other types of activity that make us all safer.\\" In 2018, some judges rejected the reduced sentences which Krasner's prosecutors had sought for juveniles who had previously been sentenced to life in prison. In June 2018, Krasner made an unprecedented request for a comprehensive list of police officers who had lied while on duty, used excessive force, racially profiled, or violated civil rights, an unprecedented move in order to spotlight dishonest police officers and check their future courtroom testimony. In 2019, Krasner filed a motion in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to declare capital punishment in Pennsylvania unconstitutional. He claimed the death penalty was illegal in the state because of the ban on cruel and unusual punishment in the Pennsylvania Constitution, citing the high turnover rates of convictions by appeals, the racially biased number of sentences given to black and Hispanic defendants, and the large number of convictions overturned due to ineffective counsel. Following the fatal shooting of Philadelphia police officer James O'Connor IV, Krasner faced criticism from William McSwain, a federal prosecutor appointed by Donald Trump. McSwain, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, blamed the shooting on a prosecutorial discretion decision by Krasner's office to drop drug charges against suspected killer Hassan Elliott. While on probation for a gun possession charge, Elliott was arrested again on January 29, 2019, for cocaine possession and was released on his own recognizance. Nearly a week later on February 6, Elliott took part in the fatal shooting of Tyrone Tyree. Krasner's office dropped drug charges after Elliott failed to appear in court, choosing to approve an arrest warrant for Tyree's murder instead. On March 13, as part of a SWAT unit carrying out an arrest warrant, O'Connor was fatally shot and Elliott was charged. Prosecutor spokeswoman Jane Roh responded to criticism by stating that the office believed murder to be a more serious crime than drug possession and charged Elliott accordingly. On the night of O'Connor's death, John McNesby ordered activist police to form a human chain at Temple University Hospital entrance to prevent Krasner from entering. In July 2020, Krasner's office charged Philadelphia SWAT officer Richard P. Nicoletti with simple assault, reckless endangerment, official oppression, and possession of an instrument of crime. Video footage taken during the George Floyd protests showed that Nicoletti pepper sprayed three kneeling protesters. He pulled down the mask of one woman before spraying her in the face, he sprayed another woman at point blank range, and sprayed a man numerous times in the face while he laid on the ground.

Arthur Joseph West (1863 in Bromsgrove; ‚Äì 2 November 1937 in Bexhill-on-Sea) was a British civil engineer. Under his leadership, the Labuan Coal Line and the North Borneo Railway from Beaufort to Weston and Melalap were built.  Personal life  West was born in 1863 in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, England, the son of a farmer. Little is known about his youth and early professional career, but he was recorded in a census as a teacher at the age of 17. On the recommendation of his friend William Clark Cowie,K. G. Tregonning. p. 56. he was appointed as Chief Railway Engineer on 7 July 1896 by the North Borneo Chartered Company with an annual salary of 4,800 Straits dollars. Although his previous experience was limited to the construction of the kilometre-long narrow Labuan Line, with which the coal mines of Labuan had been connected to the port of Victoria Town, his position was completely independent from any control of the Governor, being mainly directed by Cowie. West began his work on Bukau in 1896 as the first section for the North Borneo Railway. At the same time he had to construct both the line to the north of Beaufort and south towards Brunei Bay. The terminus of the line on Brunei Bay had been selected by Cowie but proved to be too shallow as it was a mangrove forest area. West called the station there \\"West Town\\", which later became Weston. West married Mary Louisa Dixon in 1895 at Newington, London; and had two children named Arthur Gilbert Dixon (b.1898) and Willie. His first son was born in Labuan and baptised there on 28 November 1897 by the Governor of Beaufort.British North Borneo Herald, 16 December 1897, p. 359.

Early life  Meraji is a native Californian and San Francisco State graduate. Meraji's family background includes Puerto Rican and Iranian roots. As a young girl, Meraji was bullied by classmates about her Iranian heritage. Meraji's mixed-race background has informed her approach to stories and journalism, noting in an interview with Latina Magazine that \\"never having really belonged, being on the margins while observing everything, that's made me a natural journalist ‚Äì not quite a part of something, always observing\\".  Career  Before starting at Code Switch, Meraji was a professional reporter and producer, working and freelancing for various radio organizations, including Southern California Public Radio, and Marketplace. At NPR she served as director of the midday show Day to Day and later served as a producer for NPR's flagship newsmagazine All Things Considered. In 2007, Meraji received an International Reporting Project Fellowship and traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, where she reported on youth culture. Meraji gained attention for her 2014 feature for Third Coast Festival titled \\"Audio Code Switching: Tackling Race on the Radio‚Äù, focusing on the seeming homogeneity of voices represented in public radio, a phenomenon sometimes known as \\"public radio voice\\", and the need for greater representation of diverse voices and stories. She also served as a judge for the festival in 2015. In 2014, Meraji was sent to report from Ferguson, Missouri during protests following the death of Michael Brown as a result of a police shooting. Meraji described an incident when part of her piece capturing an interview with a protester was cut from a radio program, leading to criticism from some listeners that she had failed to report on perspectives from all sides. \\"That made me want to do podcasts, for there to be more time to be nuanced conversations, to talk about the grey areas, to show that there are more than two sides to a story.‚Äù Starting in 2016, Meraji hosted NPR's Code Switch podcast with co-host Gene Demby. Meraji has stated that she hopes the podcast, which deals with race, culture and identity, will make \\"[these issues] more accessible to a broader audience\\". Meraji's work is part of an emerging development in news content and analysis that involves engaging younger, more diverse audiences, often by picking up on themes first advanced from social media platforms, blogs and pop culture. According to an interview with Meraji by WWD in July 2016, the podcast had over 1 million downloads within its first two months on air, with the co-host aiming to create an inclusive space for discussing topical issues such as the shooting of Philando Castile, the Black Lives Matter movement and the viewpoint of supporters of President Donald Trump during the 2016 election. In the wake of the George Floyd protests Code Switch ratings increased significantly, as Meraji and took on controversial topics such as \\"What is a Karen?\\" and \\"Our Homeland is Each Other\\". Meraji received journalism awards from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in 2015 and 2016, the latter for a piece she reported on about an inspirational scout leader for a troupe of at-risk boys . In 2017, a sample of topics she covered for Code Switch included refugee resettlement in Montana, the impact of school closings on children and how to celebrate a Persian New Year.

Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science in 2012 by mycologists Annarosa Bernicchia, Petr Vampola, and Antonio Prodi after it was confirmed that it was morphologically and genetically distinct from the similar North American species Fibroporia radiculosa. The specific epithet bohemia references Bohemia, where the type specimen was collected. Description Fruit bodies of Fibroporia bohemica grow as an irregular crust on their substrate. They are initially smooth and whitish to slightly pinkish, sometimes with sulphur-yellow colouration on the vertical surface. The tubes, which are formed later, are up to 6 mm long and yellow. The round to angular pores number 2‚Äì4 per millimetre. Numerous rhizomorphs surround the crust, and penetrate deep into the substrate; they are most abundant on old fruit bodies growing on very decayed wood. The odour of the fungus has been described as \\"strong and unpleasant\\". The spores of F. bohemica are hyaline, smooth, and ellipsoid to somewhat cylindrical in shape. They typically measure 5‚Äì5.5 by 2.8‚Äì3 Œºm. The fungus has a dimitic hyphal system, with thin-walled, richly branched generative hyphae with clamps at septa, measuring 2‚Äì4.5 Œºm in diameter. The skeletal hyphae, measuring 3‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter, are thick-walled, and unbranched or only moderately so. Habitat and distribution Found in central European coniferous forests, F. bohemica causes a brown rot on stumps of Norway spruce, or, more rarely, on Scots pine.

The festival was founded in 2005 by the Edmonton Jazz Festival Society, and focuses on making jazz music accessible to as many people as possible. To this end, the festival showcases many different sub- genres of jazz, played by international stars as well as emerging local musicians. While many genre-specific music festivals take a relaxed approach in how closely their performers align with the festival genre, the TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival is strict about their musicians being purely jazz performers. Notable acts of previous years include Dianne Reeves, Billy Childs, Donny McCaslin, Jacob Collier, Soil & ‚ÄúPimp‚Äù Sessions, Moon Hooch, Chris Botti, Herbie Hancock, Bobby McFarren, Esperanza Spalding, Tommy Banks and PJ Perry. In addition to traditional performances, many musicians also offer jazz workshops to teach local musicians more about the genre. The TD Edmonton International Festival does not have performances in one specific location, but is spread out in venues across the city. Regular venues include the Winspear Centre, the Yardbird Suite, Triffo Theatre, Varscona Theatre, Starlite Room, Old Strathcona Performing Arts Centre, and Bellamy‚Äôs Lounge at the Chateau Lacombe. Each venue showcases different kinds of performers. The traditional concert halls host big-name acts, while the smaller jazz clubs tend to host local and niche artists.  History  The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival began in 2005, when local musicians and business owners teamed up with the Edmonton Jazz Society (the organization that manages the Yardbird Suite) to produce the 60-event ‚ÄúYardbird Jazz Festival,‚Äù which sought to promote Edmonton‚Äôs vibrant jazz scene, as well as to offer young people the chance to learn from experienced musicians in a workshop setting. This festival was planned in a hurry, after it was revealed that the long- running \\"Jazz City\\" festival would be shutting down. Following this early prototype festival, the Edmonton Jazz Festival Society was formed in an effort to add some structure to the festival and avoid some of the financial and organizational pitfalls that Jazz City had faced. In 2006, the newly formed Edmonton Jazz Festival Society sought financial aid from the Edmonton Arts Council and the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, and local business to present the next instalment of the festival. That year's festival saw the formation of The Edmonton Jazz Orchestra, which is a collection of 18 local musicians who compose, arrange, and perform songs that are meant to draw on the history of jazz, as well as define what it means to be a jazz lover in the city of Edmonton. In 2007, the Yardbird Jazz Festival would adopt the name \\"Edmonton International Jazz Festival,\\" and in 2015, the name changed to its current form to reflect the new main sponsor of the festival, TD Bank.

Independence-X Aerospace or better known as IDXA is currently developing rocket launcher technology that it claims could reduce launch cost significantly. IDXA would be providing future commercial rocket launch services into LEO (Low Earth Orbit). The rocket launcher is known as the DNLV (Dedicated Nano Launch Vehicle) to be commercial ready by 2023, which was featured in NASA \\"Small Spacecraft Technology: State of the Art\\" December 2015 report. The DNLV is capable of providing dedicated launch services to small satellites and cubesat owners for insertion into their intended orbit and inclination. IDXA is looking at frequent launches from near equatorial launch site for at least twice a month for the first year (24 launches / year). DNLV is capable of delivering payloads of 200 kg to a 500 km Sun-synchronous orbit. IDXA was also an official team of the Google Lunar X Prize since 2008 until 2016, then later partnered with remaining team Synergy Moon from the USA. IDXA is currently developing a lunar lander probe named as SQUALL (Scientific Quest Autonomous Lunar Lander) which will aim to complete the goals of the Google Lunar X Prize, and to conduct scientific discovery of other rare minerals and search for water on the surface of the moon. Besides its Moon mission, a Mars mission in currently being planned for post the year 2020, where IDXA is developing a bio-mimetic flapping winged micro aerial vehicle (B-MAV) robotic dragonfly to scout the Martian Surface to assist NASA's future Mars rover from the rough rocky Martian terrain to perform ground exploration much easily by providing avoidable obstacle path. IDXA is also developing a reentry capsule in the pipeline for future commercial missions.  History  Independence-X Aerospace was founded in 2013 by Founder, CEO and CTO Izmir Yamin and based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Back then, the initiatives was parked under a Special Interest Group experimenting with different rocket technology at engineering model and lab scale, which led to the state of the art technology on its feeding system which can reduce the entire mass of existing feeding system for liquid propellant technology by half and less the power consumption. This discovery will later help to translate into better cost effective launch price for future customers. Having the added advantage of being an equatorial launcher, it makes DNLV the preferred future launch for small, pico and nano class satellites. Since 2003, 3 different engineering model had been designed, built and test flight which achieved remarkable success where it also won Gold Medals in Europe for its Innovativeness. The rocket motor and engines are as follows: ID-1 (Solid Propellant Rocket Motor, 2003), ID-2 (Upgraded version - Solid Propellant Rocket Motor, 2005), ID-3 (Liquid Propellant Rocket Engine, 2006).

In exchange for cash, the home owner shares in some percentage of the increase and sometimes also the decrease in value of the real estate property. When the home is sold, the home owner settles by returning to the investor some amount of the proceeds from the sale based on the change in value of the real estate asset. Alternatively, the contract may have a maturity period or may provide the homeowner the option to terminate the contract at their discretion. In this case, an appraisal may be necessary to deem the price change of the asset and therefore the return to the investor. A home ownership investment is an alternative to a mortgage. Unlike a mortgage, home ownership investments typically do not require any interest or principal payments throughout the life of the contract which can be up to 30 years. A home ownership investment is comparable to an equity investment in a company wherein the investor only acquires exposure to the change in value of the underlying asset allowing the seller of equity to raise funds by decreasing their risk exposure to the asset rather than increasing leverage. Details In a typical home ownership investment, a homeowner will receive 10% of the purchase value of the home in cash from an investor. In exchange, when the contract terminates, the investor will receive some percentage share in the increase or decrease of the value of the home, often between 35-50%, in addition to the initial investment. A home ownership investment can be originated at the time of purchase or on a currently owned home. If the investment in originated at the time of purchase, the purchase price is taken as a reference price for future return calculations. If the home is currently owned, an appraisal may be necessary to determine the original agreed upon price of the asset at origination. There are three ways in which the contract can terminate. If a sale occurs, the return to the investor is calculated based on the difference between the final sale price and the original agreed upon price multiplied by the percentage share. Alternatively, the contract may expire before a sale occurs. In this case an appraisal may need necessary to determine the final price of the home. Finally, a typical contract will provide the homeowner the option to terminate the contract before maturity at which point an appraisal may again be performed to determine the return of the home owed to the investor.

It is typically used in a Double Static Rook game; however, there is a variation for playing against a Ranging Rook opponent. The opening can be played by amateurs but is not used by professional players. Essentially, the opening tries to trade the major pieces to get them in hand in order to drop them within the opponent's camp. Since the Duck castle is defends broadly against major piece drops, this situation can favor the Duck player. Failing the piece exchange, the Duck opening typically aims for an edge attack to break through their opponent's camp. Against Static Rook 1\\\\. P-26 P-84, 2. P-25 P-85. Double Wing opening.

Early life and education Dickson was born in the United Kingdom. As a child he was taken to see the film Cannonball Run, and immediately became fascinated with super cars. He went on to pursue his passion and eventually graduated with an engineering degree from the University of Wales. Career Upon graduating he worked in various engineering positions for automotive companies including BMW, Isuzu and Ford, eventually being recruited to work as an engine designer by Westport Innovations in Vancouver. Dickson became known for pushing the limits by constantly trying to break speed limits he set for himself. In early 2000 he competed in the Race the Base Event in Cold Lake Alberta. There he went 326 km/h (202.5 mph) in his Lamborghini Aventador. This led to nearly avoiding a crash as his car spun out of control. At this point Dickson realized he needed a more efficient braking system than the hydraulic brakes that came standard in most super-cars. Being an engineer by trade he started to examine the braking systems of other fast moving vehicles such as trucks and trains. These vehicles relied on an air brake system that was more efficient for it did not require fluid to be retained and allowed the storage of potential energy. He utilized the design as an auxiliary brake to be applied when speeds greater than 100 km/h are reached. =Firgelli Automations= Seeing a potential to fulfill an industry demand for enhanced safety, Dickson founded the company Attivo Design in order to market his auxiliary air brake. The technology used for Attivo was from his other company He Founded in 2004 and is the sole owner and shareholder of. Based around technology he invented, Firgelli Automations manufactures Home Automations and media hardware. =Area 27 and Cannonball Run= Dickson's love of the film Cannonball Run inspired him to team up with Bill Dorosso and the Canadian F1 legend Jacques Villeneuve to create Canada's first and only full sized racetrack, Area-27. The track derived its name from Jacques' racing number. Dickson's group negotiated with the Osoyoos Indian Band for a lease on the land the 4.9 km track would be built on. GPS guided earth movers traced the layout of the track, and 12,139 feet of concrete was used on the track and its barriers. A special blend of asphalt was made to withstand the heat of the region. Dickson invested in the track to inspire like-minded drivers to race their track cars. The heightened popularity of the track allowed it to evolve from a simple race track to a full sized racing community that even featured a racing school, Academy-27, with such notable instructors as Canadian Motorsport Hall of Famer Richard Spenard. Dickson also created a number of races that send drivers throughout Canadian countryside for the sheer joy of driving, including co-founding the Canadian Bullrun Rally, a seven-day tour of the Rocky Mountains for luxury car owners. He also co-founded the annual Diamond Rally, an invite-only charity rally of 200 supercars, the largest Supercar rally in North America, sponsored by Hublot Vancouver one of Dickson's other ventures. The rally raises money for dozens of charities and runs from Vancouver to Whistler and the Okanagan via the Sea- to-Sky Highway. Venture capitalist Dickson has provided the guidance and financial backing for numerous businesses, including helping De Beers Diamond expand into Canada through the opening of their first jewelry store. He is an angel investor, who believes in a clean-tech future and only works with companies that are environmentally friendly and believe in a zero-emission future. He has backed Etalim, Inc and other companies that create technology Dickson believes will have a practical application in the future. Personal life Dickson is an avid car collector, and has owned hundreds of automobiles in his lifetime. The first brand new car he ever purchased was a custom Lamborghini Aventador Roadster. In 2011, The Vancouver Sun profiled Dickson and his $1,000,000 garage renovation complete with 120 spotlights, a full-size bar, and a lifelike fiberglass model of Michael Schumacher's F1 Ferrari.

Distribution Nysson spinosus occurs widely in the Palearctic from Great Britain and Scandinavia east to the Pacific coast of Russia and Japan. Biology Nysson spinosus mirrors its hosts' habitat, especially that of Argogorytes mystaceus and to a lesser extent of Argogorytes fargei, in that it prefers sunny places, especially the edges of deciduous woodland. The hosts are species of woodland glades with rank vegetation. In Britain it flies between May and July. The eggs are laid in the burrows of A. mystaceus and A. fargei which the female detects by scent. The egg hatches before the host's egg and the larvae consumes the host's egg first and then the stored prey. In Europe this species is also known to occasionally use wasps of the genus Gorytes as hosts, although this has not been recorded in Great Britain. The adults have been recorded nectaring on Apiaceae, Lotus corniculatus, Euphorbia amygdaloides, Knautia arvensis, Succisa pratensis and Jasione montana. It is thought that N. spinosus may be a host of hyperparasitic species of sarcophagid flies of the subfamily Miltogramminae and possibly some species of Ichneumon. In Europe it is also known to occasionally use wasps of the genus Gorytes as hosts mounted specimen References Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Crabronidae Category:Insects described in 1771 ","title":"Nysson spinosus"},{"id":"54071115","text":"Karl Ratzer, 2010 Karl Alfred Ratzer (born July 4, 1950, Vienna) is an Austrian jazz guitarist.

It was published by D.C. Heath and Company, in Lexington, MA, USA. The Quill software was designed and developed in 1982-84 by a team led by Bertram Bruce and Andee Rubin. Its purpose was to help in the creation of functional learning environments that involved extensive writing and reading. It had many features that addressed one or more of six pedagogical goals: Encourage writing for peers; develop writing skill in the context of meaningful communication with real audiences; encourage feedback from others; provide motivation to read the writing of others; facilitate revision; and help with the mechanics of writing. Reviews The complete system, including the software, the Quill Teacher's Guide, and other support materials, was validated by the Joint Dissemination Review Panel of the U.S Department of Education in March 1984. The software had positive reviews in Computers, Reading and Language Arts, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Popular Computing, Harvard University Gazette, Electronic Learning, Teaching and Computers, Informatica Oggi, English Journal, Early Years/K-8, Computer Update, Classroom Computer Learning, The Computing Teacher, Language Arts, Today's Education, and many other publications. Hardware Quill ran on Apple II+ and Apple IIe computers with 64K bytes of memory and required two floppy disk drives, a monochrome monitor, an 80-character, upper and lower case card, and a printer. Software components Quill comprised four interrelated programs. Writer‚Äôs Assistant was a general word processor that could be used independently. However, within Quill it was not invoked by name but accessed indirectly by functions in PLANNER, LIBRARY, or MAILBAG, such as ‚Äúseeing‚Äù someone else‚Äôs text in the LIBRARY. Students decided which program to use according to their purpose for writing. PLANNER was a tool that helped students organize ideas for writing, then share their newly created organizing tools. LIBRARY was a writing environment in which students could make their writing accessible to others by storing it with the full authors‚Äô names, the full title, and keywords indicating topic, genre, or other characteristics of the piece. The keywords represented an early use of hashtags. MAILBAG was an in-class email system in which students could send messages to other students, the teacher, small groups, or a bulletin board. Those messages could be forwarded to other classrooms using a variety of networking tools available at the time.

He is best known for sailing alongside Thomas Tew to join Henry Every‚Äôs pirate fleet which captured and looted the fabulously rich Mughal ship Gunsway.  History  In 1694 a number of Newport pirate vessels prepared to set sail with Tew, among them Joseph Bankes‚Äô barque Portsmouth Adventure. Bankes (or Banks) transferred his commission to Joseph Faro, who captained the 90-ton 6-gun Portsmouth Adventure with a crew of 60. Among his crew was future pirate captain Dirk Chivers. After nearly a year on voyage, in 1695 Tew, Faro, and three other captains (William Mayes, Richard Want, and Thomas Wake) joined up with Every and his ship Fancy and waited for the Mughal's treasure-laden convoy. Most of the convoy escaped, but the Gunsway and her escort Fateh Mohammed were straggling behind and after a protracted fight was overtaken and brutally looted by Every and his crew. Tew had been killed during the battle while Want and Wake's slower ships were left behind. Only Faro and Mayes arrived in time to help Every, but Every denied Faro and his crew a full share of the vast riches, claiming they had never joined in the fighting. Afterward, Faro took the Portsmouth Adventure into the Persian Gulf, and then back to Madagascar, where Faro's ship was wrecked on Mayotte. Every rescued Faro and some of his crew en route to the Bahamas; some of Faro's crew joined Every, and a few even made it back to Newport, while Chivers and others remained behind to be later rescued by Robert Glover in the Resolution. Faro later captained the sloop Sea Flower which transported Every back to Ireland when the latter chose to retire.

The trials were based in Paris and lead by researchers Alain Fischer and Marina Cavazzana-Calvo. Whilst the experiment initially seemed successful, many of the children began showing symptoms of various cancer-like diseases as a result of the gene manipulation. The experiment, and others like it, were subsequently shut down.  Trials  The experimental trials took place at the Necker Hospital in Paris, France in 2002. The lead researchers tasked with running the experiment were Dr. Alain Fischer and Dr. Marina Cavazzana-Calvo, who were both employed by the hospital. The researchers were investigating treatments for Severe Combined Immune Deficiency, or SCID, a disease that had been linked to the X-chromosome. SCID has the effect of preventing the formation of several key immune system factors that aid in the body's ability to fight of infectious diseases. The goal of the gene therapy was to utilize and activate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the hopes of combating the progression of the immune deficiency. The methodology of the experiment involved using retroviral vectors to stimulate the HSCs, which had been implicated in potential treatment for several communicable and non- communicable diseases. SCID was rare in its prevalence and involved a complex mechanism that involved harmful lymphocytic differentiation. The test subjects for this experiment were 11 children of various ages who presented with SCID and were admitted into Necker Hospital. Initially, after the therapy was administered to the children, some showed signs of improved conditions. One child, a three year old, became the face of the experiment's success, as the symptoms of his once life-threatening disease began to diminish. Indeed, this was a breakthrough in the application capabilities of gene therapy in treating various morbidities. However, in the months following the application of the gene therapy, several of the 11 children began to show signs of new disease symptoms that were seemingly a direct result of their participation in the experimental trial. 2 of the children, including the three-year-old boy, began showing signs of various cancer-like diseases. The most prevalent of these \\"vector-triggered\\" cancers seemed to present with the same symptoms of leukemia, the abnormal proliferation of leukocytes in the bone marrow and other organs. These symptoms were characterized as \\"leukemia-like lymphocyte proliferation\\" seemingly activated by the retroviral vectors used during the duration of the experiment. While the majority of the children involved in the trial did not show these symptoms, the presentation of this leukemia-like cancer in the 2 subjects was a cause for concern and reported by Dr. Fischer and Dr. Cavazzana-Calvo.  Post-trial and legacy  Following the reporting of the 2 subjects with leukemia-like cancer, several steps were taken to reduce the likelihood of further unintended consequences. The experimental trial itself was immediately suspended and inquiries were made into how the cancer was activated and where responsibility for the trials would fall. Experimental trials with similar designs in neighboring European countries were allowed to continue, though they were cognizant of the negative results seen in France. In the United States, all experimental procedures that mimicked the methodology utilized in the French Trials were indefinitely suspended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Although the presentation of the disease was only seen in the French trials, the FDA stated that suspending the US trials was a \\"precautionary measure\\" to ensure that the results seen in France would not be replicated in the US. Beyond the US, the United Kingdom also voiced its concern for the French results and stated that similar trials in the UK would ensure safeguards against those harmful side-effects. Although the trial caused very harmful side-effects in some of its subjects and was shut down as a result, for the most part it was successful in helping to suppress the symptoms of the immune deficiency in a majority of the kids involved. The relative success of this trial lead to subsequent retroviral vector retrials, experimenting with different dose levels and precautions against the development of the cancer, within France itself. Though some more subjects showed signs of the cancer, the majority of the subjects showed improvement in their conditions stemming from the experiment. The mix-bag results of the French trial helped spark a worldwide debate about the efficacy of retroviral vector gene therapy, and gene therapy as a whole. More specifically, the trial led to the discussion as to whether or not the known risks of gene therapy, such as the possibility of subsequent cancer development, and the potential benefits of gene manipulation exist in a way that would justify the continued use of these trials to correct life- threatening illnesses.

Towhey became known for his sense of humor on Twitter when he tweeted \\"Finished May issue of Toronto Life, now plan to spend rest of night just hanging out, being evil\\" after reading a Toronto Life cover story that contained an unflattering portrait of him. Later, shortly after being fired on May 23, 2013 he retweeted a photo from a Toronto Sun photographer of him in his car leaving city hall, saying \\"Very happy now that I remembered to wash my car yesterday.\\" His chocolate macaroon recipe was featured in the Toronto Star a few months later.  Career  He left the military in 1996. He was a spokesperson for Canada Trust before starting his own crisis communication firm in 1998. His clients included the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, McCain Foods, the Government of Canada, Ontario, and the United Nations. After returning to Canada from two years consulting in Afghanistan and Pakistan for the UN and World Bank Group, Towhey was hired by Toronto City Councillor Rob Ford to help on his mayoral campaign. When Ford was elected in October 2010, Towhey was appointed his Director of Strategy & Policy, a role in which he was widely referred to by city councillors as the mayor‚Äôs \\"Rasputin.\\" In August 2012, he was promoted to Chief of Staff until he was fired by Ford on May 23, 2013 for reportedly telling Ford to go to rehab for his drug addiction. When CFRB cancelled Ford‚Äôs Sunday afternoon radio program in November 2013, they hired Towhey as his permanent replacement in that time slot. When Postmedia appointed Towhey as Editor-in-Chief of Sun News, Canadaland questioned his appointed due to his lack of journalism experience. Mark Bonokoski, a veteran Sun writer, noted that Towhey complained his criticsm of Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. He left the position in 2020, after almost a year, but will continue as a columnist for the chain.

Tolstedt is a retired American banking executive and former head of the community banking division at Wells Fargo, from which she retired in 2016 before the company's account fraud scandal came to light. In 2017, Wells Fargo retroactively fired Tolstedt for cause. Early life Tolstedt grew up in Kimball, Nebraska, where she says she first became interested in banking from following her father, a baker, to the local bank after work. She graduated from the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. Career Toldstedt worked at Wells Fargo for 27 years. She was formerly on Fortunes Most Powerful Women list, and in 2015, she was ranked #27 on this list and as the most powerful female banker in the United States. Under Tolstedt's supervision, her unit's employees opened over 2 million mostly unauthorized accounts for their customers. Her retirement was initially announced in July 2016 and scheduled for the end of the year, but she later chose to retire in September instead, after the account scandal became known to the public. In April 2017, Wells Fargo's board of directors released a report on the account fraud scandal accusing Tolstedt of downplaying problems at Wells Fargo's banks. The same report recommended that the bank take back $47.3 million in stock options Tolstedt had received, in addition to $19 million they had already taken back from her. The report mentioned Tolstedt's name 142 times, whereas former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was named only 81 times. Additionally, the report primarily blamed Tolstedt for the company's misconduct in the scandal, while Stumpf was mainly blamed for not firing Tolstedt sooner. The report stated that Stumpf was hesitant to criticize Tolstedt, and that he once called her \\"the best banker in America\\". Tolstedt's law firm, Williams & Connolly, responded to the report by saying that they \\"strongly disagree\\" with its findings. In response to the report, Wells Fargo retroactively fired Tolstedt for cause and revoked $47.3 million that they had previously paid her. This brought the total amount of money she had given up to $67 million, or about 54% of her $125 million pay package she initially received when she retired. As of early January, 2020, multiple former Wells Fargo executives are facing possible criminal charges and could be indicted in early 2020.https://www.mpamag.com/news/former-wells-fargo-execs-under-criminal- investigation--report-195791.aspx On January 23, 2020, OCC regulators announced an additional $25-million fine against Tolstedt for her role during the fraud, an amount they state could rise higher. https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/01/23/former-wells-fargo- ceo-hit-with-175-million-fine-barred-from-banking-industry/ While others involved in the scandal have given up clearing their charges, Tolstedt continues to fight against her own.

It is known for the successful project of the preservation of the griffon vulture.  Location  The reserve is located in the southwestern Serbia, in the municipalities of Nova Varo≈° (approximately 2/3) and Sjenica (1/3) in the Zlatibor District. The protected area is elongated and comprises the valley of the Uvac river, including the Uvac Gorge.  Geography  Geographically, the Uvac valley is part of the Stari Vlah-Ra≈°ka highland. It is surrounded by the mountains of Zlatar on the west, Murtenica and ƒåemernica on the north, Javor on the east and Jadovnik on the south. The lowest point in the reserve is and the highest . Central morphological section is actually a canyon-like valley of the river, including the valleys of its tributaries. The river cut its bed deep into the limestone rocks and formed a narrowed gorge- canyon valleys with high and steep limestone cliffs. An average deep of the valley is between and with the deepest section being . The Uvac gorge is especially known for its \\"pinched\\" meanders, or meanders which are cut in the canyon-like fashion. Relative height of the meanders reaches some near the village of Gornje Lopi≈æe. Photos of the meanders are often used in the promotional touristic publications from Serbia. There are 12 arranged lookouts in the gorge. The most popular three are Veliki Kr≈° (\\"Great Karst\\"), Veliki Vrh (\\"Great Peak\\") and Molitva (\\"Prayer\\"). The best known panoramic images of the gorge were made from these three points. The terrain is karst in nature, with numerous karstic features: karst plains, uvalas, sinkholes, caves, pits and rock shelters. Caves are numerous and vary in size, from cavelets to one of the largest cave systems in Serbia. So far, of the U≈°ak Cave system has been explored, which, as of 2017, makes it the third longest cave in Serbia, after the Lazar's Cave and Cerje Cave. The system consists of two caves, U≈°ak and Ledena (Ice cave), which are connected by the Bezdan pit (The Abyss). Other caves in the reserve include Tubiƒáa, Durulja and Ba≈ædarska caves. They are all rich in speleothems: stalactites, stalagmitess, drapes and frostwork. It is estimated that the U≈°ak system is 250 million years old, but is still being geologically active. Waters of the Uvac river are used for three hydroelectric power stations within the reserve, each one with an artificial lake: Bistrica with Radoinja Lake (1960), Kokin Brod with Zlatar Lake (1962) and Sjenica with Sjenica Lake (1979).  Wildlife  = Plants = There are 219 plant species in the reserve. Of them, 3 are of international importance, 3 are listed in the Red list, 25 are placed under the controlled regime of picking and trading and 50 are believed to have medicinal properties. = Animals = In the Uvac river and its tributaries within the reserve, there are 24 species of fish. Clean water in rivers and reservoirs are natural spawning locations for huchen, brown trout (borth faria and lacustris morphs), brook trout, zander, Mediterranean barbel, common nase and European chub. Mammalian fauna includes wolves, bears, wild boars, foxes, hares, badgers and European pine martens, some of which are declared rare and endangered in Serbia. = Birds = Uvac meanders The main attraction in the reserve is the avifauna, with 172 bird species. The most important inhabitant of Uvac is the griffon vulture, one of two remaining vulture species which nests in Serbia. Large bird, with a wingspan of up to , it has a unique place in the ecosystem's food chain as it feeds solely on carcasses, providing the \\"natural recycling\\". In the years after the World War II, the species was on the brink of extinction. In order to save the birds, an area of the Uvac gorge was protected in 1971, but still, number of birds reduced to only 7 in the 1970s and 10 in 1990. At that moment, it appeared that the species will go extinct as it already disappeared from eastern Serbia, Romania, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Situation began to improve when in 1994 the Manastirina feeding ground was established. By 2017, the number of griffon vultures grew to 110 nesting couples and almost 500 birds altogether. That is the largest colony of griffon vultures in the Balkans and one of the largest in Europe, with probably only colony in Spain being larger. The griffon vultures from Uvac roam all over the Europe and Middle East. Birds tagged in Uvac have been spotted in 18 countries, ranging from Spain on the west to Yemen, on the southeast. Seven birds have been detected in away Israel which later returned to Uvac. For example, a female named Sara, which hatched in Uvac in 2011, was caught and satellite-tagged in Israel in 2012. After reaching sexual maturity, she returned to Serbia in 2017. Tracking devices showed that some birds were flying high up to . One male flew north to Poland and got injured there. Polish ambassador transported it back to the Uvac by plane, it was healed and named Uro≈° the Weak, after the last Serbian emperor. He became a touristic attraction. Another celebrity resident was a female named Dobrila. She hatched in 2018 in the Orlovica locality and on her maiden long-distance voyage that same year, she flew to the Turkish-Syrian border where she was found completely exhausted. In the spring of 2019, a special flight was arranged for her and she was transported back to Uvac by the plane. In December 2020 she was found dead in the reserve, stuck between the four entangled hornbeam canopies. As the population is thriving, there are less and less suitable locations for the nesting in the reserve. In 2009, a project for reintroduction of the griffon vultures to the Stara Planina was prepared. The birds used to live in this area of Eastern Serbia, on the border with Bulgaria, but went extinct in the late 1940s. Due to the financial difficulties, the project was put on hiatus, though not scrapped. The reintroduction program continued in 2017 within the scope of a wider European program. Among other things, the feeders will be placed along the vultures' migratory route, but the state bureaucracy continued to hamper the project so by 2020 the reintroduction remained on paper only. An island in the Uvac gorge The camera, which is installed at the feeding ground, recorded the showing of two other vulture species which were extinct from these areas: cinereous vulture and Egyptian vulture. The administration of the reserve, in association with the \\"Sini≈°a Stankoviƒá Institute for Biological Research\\" and the \\"Institute for nature conservation of Serbia\\", wishes to implement the reintroduction project of another vulture species which went extinct in the region, the bearded vulture. Other birds in the protected area include many species of hawks, owls and, especially, eagles: white-tailed eagle, golden eagle, common buzzard and short-toed snake eagle. Uvac is also one of the rare nesting areas of goosander in Serbia and location of the largest recorded population of this bird in the Balkans. In 2017 the environmentalists warned that excessive tourism endangers the griffon vultures. The touristic guides often divert from the boat touristic routes, bring the tourists closer to the nests and even scare the birds so that they would fly and tourists can photograph them. In 2016/17, of the nests along the boat route, 12 were abandoned, 6 collapsed and from 2 the chicks fell out. Still, the birds got accustomed to the visitors. When tourists visit the lookouts, birds began to fly above, as they are expecting food. The chicks are so well fed, that instead of weighing , some weigh up to and fall into the lakes. The rangers pick them up and return to the nests, until they lose some weight and learn to fly. In the summer season of 2017 there were 12,000 visitors. By the late 2018 there were almost 150 nesting couples of various vultures, and 600 individual birds. Tracking shows that, on average, one vulture flies for some daily, in the circling patterns. The massive terrace-like bolder which birds use to take off, is called the \\"Castle of griffons\\". Birds continued to spread and, by 2020, trackers were placed on 327 individual birds, which have been spotted on 4,000 locations in 22 countries. Seven birds have been tracked via satellites. Griffin vulture has its place in cultural, mythological and folk beliefs. People believed that the bird is clairvoyant and that it could live over 500 years. It was described as the go-between for gods, people and underworld, and a just bird which never kills for the fun of it, but only takes what is his. The vulture was believed to be able to predict storms and was not to be harmed or the family of bird's killer will invoke the wrath of gods. Some folklorists believe that Serbian eagle, represented on the coat of arms of Serbia, was patterned after the griffin vulture. However, like in the case several other European coats of arms, eastern imperial eagle was the more probable source. Unlike griffin vultures, there was no attempt at human preservation of eastern imperial eagle population, which by 2018 and full abundance of vultures, was reduced in Serbia to only one nesting couple.  Protection  The Uvac region was declared a protected area in 1971. Today it covers an area of . In 2008, it was voted one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Serbia. In October 2018 the water level in the lake plunged for some in 20 days, but the level was generally going down for two months. The boats left on shore would get stranded for over of dry land over night. The water was used by the Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), a state-owned electric utility power company, for enlarged electricity production. In this period, the total length of the lake was shortened from to . The EPS claimed that this is normal and that it will not harm the wildlife. This coincided with the emptying of other accumulations in protected areas in other parts of Serbia (Lake Vlasina, Lake Zavoj). This prompted suspicions that the forcing of the electricity production is part of some scheme, in the case of Uvac, with the companies from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EPS refuted these claims, too, saying that in previous periods, and especially in 2000 and 2012, the water level was much lower than today. Still, the company didn't disclose why are they emptying the lake.

It details the circumstances leading to his 1967 arrest for the poisoning deaths of his seven children in Arcadia, Florida, his twenty-one years spent in prison, his miraculous release in 1989 upon the discovery of hidden evidence, and the twenty-five years he spent following his release attempting to obtain compensation from the State of Florida. It features exclusive interviews with Barry Scheck, Don Horn, Peter Gallagher, Geraldine Thompson, Tim Edman, and James Joseph Richardson. The film is directed and produced by Ty Flowers, who worked with his father, Charles Flowers, a journalist who helped free James through his work on the case in the 1980s. It was acquired by Indie Rights and released on digital platforms in January 2018 Synopsis On October 25, 1967, the seven Richardson children, ranging in age from two to eight, consumed food poisoned with parathion in Arcadia, Florida. The night before, Annie Mae Richardson, James' wife, had prepared a lunch of beans, rice, and grits for the children. The meal was placed in a locked refrigerator overnight. In the morning the Richardsons left to work at the orange groves 16 miles away. A neighbor, Betsy Reece, was delegated to take care of the children while their parents were at work. James was tried and convicted of the murder on May 27, 1968 and sentenced to death. In 1988 Reese, suffering from Alzheimer's disease and in a nursing home in Arcadia, had reportedly confessed to the murders more than 100 times, but her confessions were not taken seriously because of her condition. Also, the last surviving witness to Richardson‚Äôs alleged jail-cell confession recanted his testimony to state legislators, saying that he had been offered a lighter sentence in return for the testimony. James was released from prison on October 25, 1989 after a new hearing was held. James fought the State of Florida in court for compensation until a new bill was passed to award him $1.2 million in 2014. Awards *2015: Full Bloom Film Festival, Official Selection.

In July 2017 some of the resort areas were damaged by wildfires.  Geography  Loon Lake in the Bonaparte Plateau (there are eight other Loon Lakes in B.C.) is located in a steep valley between Bonaparte Plateau to the north and west and the Arrowstone hills to the south and east on the larger Thompson Plateau. The north side consists mainly of Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine mixed with lesser amounts of poplar, alder and common mountain juniper. The south side of Loon lake is composed mainly of Engelmann spruce and Douglas fir. The entire length of the west shore has been developed with resorts, permanent homes and summer residences. There are approximately 50 cabins as well on the east shore accessible only by water, with no power or phone connections. Some of the cabins were damaged or destroyed by a forest fire in July 2017. There is a ranch on the north east end and a First Nations reserve to the southwest (Bonaparte no 4). There are approximately 200 permanent residents year round with the population swelling to over 1000 in peak holiday periods. Many families have owned summer homes on Loon Lake for three or four generations. Local government is provided by the Thompson Nicola Regional District, local policing is from Clinton and the closest hospital is at Ashcroft. Travelers can reach Loon Lake off of Highway 97 about 20 km north of Cache Creek and travelling through the Bonaparte valley and Loon Creek valley to arrive at Loon Lake 18 km in from Highway turnoff. Loon Lake is a long, narrow, deep and clear lake. The shoal area extends out into the lake for about 5 meters (16.4 ft.) and then drops off quickly. The shoal area contains sedge and bulrushes. Dense stands of coniferous forest mixed with small stands of deciduous growth with some rock outcroppings comprise the immediate shoreline surrounding the south shore of the lake. Facilities The services at the lake include eight resorts with stores, boat rentals, gas and propane, RV parking and camping. A few resorts offer wireless Internet connection. There is a public boat launch at the east end of the lake. The oldest still operating resort is the Evergreen Resort at the west end of the lake established in the mid 1930s, followed soon after in 1938 by the establishment of Loon Lake Resort by Ed and Pearl Dougherty and the White Moose by N. Fowler. Several resorts established in the early years are no longer in business. Loon Lake is also the base location for trips up into Hihium Lake. = Fishing = Loon Lake supports rainbow trout fishery up to 1.5 kg. Many freshwater shrimp, dragon flies, nymphs, chironomids and may flies make this a good fly-fishing lake, however, trolling with flatfish and spinning lures are the most popular methods used on the lake.

At the age of eleven, she wrote an article for the Atlanta Constitution, and at the age of fifteen, she became a regular correspondent of that journal. In 1887, she began publishing The Acanthus, a juvenile paper issued in the South. Barnes published novels from 1887 (Some lowly lives and the heights they reached) until at least 1927 (A knight of Carolina). Early years Annie Maria Barnes was born in Columbia, South Carolina, May 28, 1857. She was a daughter of James Daniel and Henrietta Jackson Neville Barnes. Her mother, a Neville, traced her descent in a direct line from the Earl of Warwick. Her family was left at the close of the American Civil War, like most Southerners, without means. Barnes was educated in the public schools of Atlanta, Georgia. She came from a family of editors, and naturally turned to literature. When 11 years of age, she wrote an article for the Atlanta Constitution, which was published and favorably noticed by the editor, and at 15, she became a regular correspondent of that journal. Career A Lass of Dorchester (1904) Before reaching middle age, Barnes had gained recognition in southern juvenile literature. Many of Barnes' earlier works appeared in the Sundayschool Visitor (juvenile periodical; Methodist Episcopal Church, South, Nashville, Tennessee). Barnes served as junior editor for the Woman's Board of Missions, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, having charge of its juvenile paper and of all its quarterly supplies of literature. She was a frequent contributor to leading journals, including Godey's Lady's Book. She served as the editor of Young Christian Worker and the Little Worker (Methodist Episcopal Church periodicals). In 1887, she began publishing a juvenile paper called The Acanthus (juvenile periodical; Atlanta; 1877‚Äì84), which was one of two juvenile papers published in the South at the time. While in literary character, it was a success, financially, like so many other southern publications, it was a failure. Barnes' first book was Some Lowly Lives (Nashville, 1885); and it was followed by The Life of David Livingston (Nashville, Brigham and Smith; 1887), and Scenes in Pioneer Methodism (Nashville, Brigham and Smith; 1889). Later, she wrote The Children of the Kalahari, a child's story of Africa, which was very successful in the U.S. and in England. Two books were published in 1892, The House of Grass and Atlanta Ferryman: A Story of the Chattahoochee. Among her numerous stories which proved to be quite popular, were: Gospel Among the Slaves, The Ferry Maid of the Chattahoochee (Philadelphia, Penn Publishing Company), \\"ow Achon-hoah Found the Light (Richmond, Presbyterian Committee of Publication), Matouchon, The Outstretched Hand, Carmio, Little Burden-Sharers, Chonite, Marti, The King's Gift, The Red Miriok, The Little Lady of the Fort, Little Betty Blew, Mistress Moppet, A Lass of Dorchester (Boston, Lee and Shepard), Isilda, Tatong, The Laurel Token, and several others. Some of her works were written using the pen name, \\"Cousin Annie\\". Book reviews Izilda (Presbyterian Committee of Publication, Richmond, Virginia) was reviewed by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who stated that it is a story for girls, the scene of which is laid in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the centre of a flourishing Protestant mission. The customs and manners of the residents are placed on a background of the Romish religion. Set brightly against it is the happy Christian life of two Brazilian girls, who, by the simplicity of a life in Christ, win souls under the leadership of the American missionary. This book was especially adapted to young women's missionary societies. Woman's Foreign Missionary Society also reviewed Tatono, The Little Slave: A Story of Korea (Presbyterian Publication Committee, Richmond) stating, \\"The plot is good, the incidents well worked in, and the customs and manners of Korea so thoroughly a part of the story and the missionary element so entirely necessary to it, that the least interested in missions will read every paragraph for the story's sake, while the most interested will seize with eagerness so charming an opportunity to interest the uninterested in the Hermit Nation. The author betrays her southern breeding by occasional provincialisms. Nevertheless, this is the best Korean story we have ever seen.\\" Personal life Barnes resided in Summerville, South Carolina.

All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference. Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials. Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in- depth within the memo. United States Department of Justice attorneys and Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents commonly make use of memoranda of conversation. A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions. Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the fraud unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, \\"the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events.\\" History Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Brent Scowcroft, who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of Gerald R. Ford, kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation. He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the United States National Security Council. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum contains over 1,000 such memorandum of conversation documents relating to the Presidency of Richard Nixon and Presidency of Gerald Ford, mainly related to national security of the United States.

Possible side effects in children are: dysrhythmia, nausea, vomiting, a slower-than-normal heart rate and anorexia. Children may demonstrate side effects if they are breastfed. Digoxin is also absorbed by the infant in utero. Geriatric considerations Kidney function gradually decreases as someone ages. The elderly are also likely to be underweight. In addition, these older people tend to be dehydrated and be taking other medications. These factors increase the likelihood of developing side effects of digoxin and digoxin toxicity. Often lowering the dose is considered by the prescriber. Toxicity The side effects related to toxicity are used to assess the therapeutic range in a person. In toxicity, the usual supportive measures are provided. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalaemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab). Digoxin is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis with enough effectiveness to treat toxicity. Side effects due to other drug interactions Side effects can become more pronounced due to the drug interactions between digoxin and the following: Thiazide and loop diuretics, piperacillin, ticarcillin, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, and excessive laxative use. Amiodarone, some benzodiazepines, cyclosporine, diphenoxylate, indomethacin, itraconazole, propafenone, quinidine, quinine, spironolactone, and verapamil may lead to toxic levels and increased incidence of side effects. Digoxin plasma concentrations may increase while on antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine. Patients taking digoxin should avoid taking hawthorn.Tankenow, Roberta; Tamer, Helen R.; Streetman, Daniel S.; Smith, Scott G.; Welton, Janice L.; Annesley, Thomas; Aaronson, Keith D.; Bleske, Barry E. Interaction Study between Digoxin and a Preparation of Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha), J Clin Pharmacol 2003;43:637-642, accessed May 17, 2017. Side effects due to dietary supplements Side effects can become pronounced due to the interactions of digoxin and these substances: licorice, aloe, and St. John's wort. Visual disturbances An unusual side effect of digoxin is a disturbance of color vision (mostly yellow and green) called xanthopsia. Vincent van Gogh's \\"Yellow Period\\" may have somehow been influenced by concurrent digitalis therapy. Other oculotoxic effects of digoxin include generalized blurry vision, as well as seeing a \\"halo\\" around each point of light. The latter effect can also be seen in van Gogh's 1889 painting The Starry Night. Evidence of van Gogh's digoxin use is supported by multiple self-portraits that include the foxglove plant, from which digoxin is obtained.

Early life  Turcot was born on 5 October 1943 in Kenora. He was the eldest of 11 children.  Early involvement at uOttawa  Fluent in English and French, he came to the University of Ottawa to study civil law. His first notable post within the SUUO was when he became Publications Commissioner in April 1964. As Publications Commissioner, he also created a commission with the goal of creating a charter for both the student papers.La Rotonde. Points saillants du programme de Jock Turcot. Published 11 March 1965  Presidency of the SUUO  = Campbell Crisis = In the 1960s, the relationship between the student government and the university was marked by a battle for autonomy on the part of the student government. The university often interfered in the SUUO's affairs and threatened several times to expel student leaders for their activism, while the faculty associations repeatedly threatened to separate from the SUUO and the SUUO struggled financially. In late 1964, those tensions climaxed when SUUO President Robert Campbell attacked the university, accusing it of ignoring students and wasting their time, and stating that the SUUO would do whatever it took to gain independence. The SUUO's Grand Council, however, used that letter as a pretext to impeach Campbell, at which point the rest of the SUUO exec resigned in solidarity with Campbell. In the special election that followed, Turcot quickly emerged as the compromise candidate, seeing as he had not been particularly involved with any of the political factions on campus.Duclos, Jocelyn-Robert. Jock Turcot √©lu president de l‚ÄôAG√âUO? La Rotonde. Published 14 January 1965 On 17 January 1965, he was elected President of the SUUO for the remainder of the 1964-65 year. = Presidency = On becoming President, he soon released a long-term plan for the SUUO, based on a Students' Charter, a study of the SUUO structure, a new SUUO Constitution, incorporation of the SUUO and the construction of a student centre for campus. He also quickly undertook consultations and meetings with all of the faculty associations on campus and began a practice of holding weekly press conferences to update students on SUUO affairs. In March 1965, he was re-elected as President for the 1965‚Äì1966 term. In November 1965, the SUUO led a march of over 800 students on Parliament Hill to demonstrate in favour of free tuition. As President, he also helped organise SUUO participation in the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, highlighted the situation of international students on campus for the first time, lobbied for the introduction of a reading week in the winter semester, and oversaw the creation of a charter for the SUUO Student Court.The Story of Jock Turcot.

One of his goals was to negotiate membership of the SUUO, given the SUUO's bilingual nature and the high proportion of francophone students at the University of Ottawa. He came back from the meeting concerned about the future of the UGEQ, saying that the union was too dogmatic and had chosen to be a union for Qu√©becois and not for French-Canadian students.Turcot, Jock. Carnet d'un voyage d√©concertant. La Rotonde. Published 4 December 1964 Turcot was also a supporter of Canadian federalism, which ran contrary to rising Qu√©bec nationalism. At the September 1965 annual conference of the Canadian Union of Students held at Bishop's University, Turcot took a leading role in proposing new policy, and was consequently offered the position of CUS President. He declined the post, stating that he wanted to concentrate on SUUO affairs.La Rotonde. Turcot refuse la pr√©sidence de l‚ÄôUCE.

He had stayed on campus for the Christmas Eve supper for international students, and was only planning to have a short break, so that he could finish the new SUUO Constitution before the end of the Christmas holidays. The university held a remembrance ceremony for him on 11 January in the Church du Sacr√©-Coeur on campus, and cancelled all classes during the ceremony to encourage students to attend.La Rotonde.

The building opened in 1973, and was named after Turcot.http://maps.uottawa.ca/university- centrehttps://www.uottawa.ca/archives/sites/www.uottawa.ca.archives/files/jock_turcot_eng.pdf His brother, Mark Turcot, was SFUO President when the student centre was opened. The work he did on the structures of the SUUO had a major impact on the workings of the SUUO for decades, and the SUUO was incorporated a few years after his death (at which point it switched its name back to the SFUO). His advocacy at the national level of the Canadian student movement also had an impact for decades, as he was one of the first to gain recognition for wider social justice activism in the student movement, and the Turcot Declaration on the Canadian Student was a landmark document. The SFUO, however, failed to maintain a presence within the Qu√©bec student movement, which continued to build its own identity away from the student movement in the rest of Canada. Jock Turcot did, however, face some criticism during his term as President. Notably, he was accused multiple times of being too close to the university administration and of having a weak and too conservative policy on incorporation.Duhamel, Luc. AG√âUM ou AG√âUO.

It concerns a postapocalyptic world overrun by biotechnology.\\"Borne by Jeff VanderMeer review ‚Äì after the biotech apocalypse\\" by Neel Mukherjee, The Guardian, June 15, 2017. Plot In the ruins of a nameless city of the future, ruled by a giant grizzly called Mord, a woman named Rachel lives as a scavenger, collecting genetically engineered organisms and experiments created by the biotech firm the Company. Hidden in Mord's fur, she finds a sea anemone-like creature that she calls Borne.Jeff Vandermeer's new dystopian novel 'Borne' is lyrical and harrowing; Elizabeth Hand reviews  Background  VanderMeer had for a long time considered writing about growing up in the South Pacific, where he lived as a child. One day the image of a sea anemone came to him, along with a hand which he knew belonged to Rachel, that reached out to grab the anemone from the fur of a giant bear. From that image, the rest of the city assembled itself. Mord was influenced by Richard Adams's Shardik, and his never explained ability to fly was inspired by a character in Angela Carter's Nights at the Circus.For Florida author Jeff VanderMeer, giant flying bears are all in a day's work  Reception  The novel was highly praised, with The Guardian saying \\"VanderMeer‚Äôs recent work has been Ovidian in its underpinnings, exploring the radical transformation of life forms and the seams between them.\\" Publisher's Weekly said the novel reads \\"like a dispatch from a world lodged somewhere between science fiction, myth, and a video game\\" and that with Borne Vandermeer has transformed weird fiction into \\"weird literature.\\"\\"Starred review of Borne by Jeff VanderMeer,\\" Publisher's Weekly, February 06, 2017.

Alt URL The Trump administration has said the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (PEIC) would review claims of voter fraud, improper registration, and voter suppression. Critics and civil rights groups have argued that such claims are unfounded and that the intent of the order is to enable the suppression of voting rights. The order was subsequently revoked by Executive Order 13820 (titled \\"Termination of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity\\"), which was signed by President Trump on January 3, 2018. Background During his campaign for President, Donald Trump made numerous claims of large-scale voter fraud occurring in the United States which have been criticized as lacking evidence by commentators including FactCheck.org. In the run-up to the election, Trump also asked his supporters to volunteer as \\"poll watchers\\" on Election Day, leading to fears from some of voter intimidation. On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election electoral college vote 304 to 227, although his opponent, Hillary Clinton, had received 2.9 million more votes. After his victory, Trump claimed on Twitter that \\"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\\" In an interview with Dan Muir just after his inauguration he repeated his belief that registration issues could total millions, referring to a Pew Report, and the intent to do an investigation. A few days later he vowed in Twitter to open an inquiry. ‚ÄúI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!‚Äù. It was mentioned after his inauguration in January 2017 that this would be by Executive Order. Membership The Vice President shall chair the Commission, which shall be composed of not more than 15 additional members. The President shall appoint the additional members, who shall include individuals with knowledge and experience in elections, election management, election fraud detection, and voter integrity efforts, and any other individuals with knowledge or experience that the President determines to be of value to the Commission. The Vice President may select a Vice Chair of the Commission from among the members appointed by the President. Provisions :(a) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the General Services Administration shall provide the Commission with such administrative services, funds, facilities, staff, equipment, and other support services as may be necessary to carry out its mission on a reimbursable basis. :(b) Relevant executive departments and agencies shall endeavor to cooperate with the Commission. :(c) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (5 U.S.C. App.) (the \\"Act\\"), may apply to the Commission, any functions of the President under that Act, except for those in section 6 of the Act, shall be performed by the Administrator of General Services. :(d) Members of the Commission shall serve without any additional compensation for their work on the Commission, but shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701‚Äì5707). :(e) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: ::(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or ::(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. :(f) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. :(g) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Reactions H.R. 3029 titled Combating the President‚Äôs Voter Suppression Commission Act was introduced by Representative Marc Veasey (D) Texas 33rd congressional district on June 22, 2017. It would prevent Federal funds from being used to carry out Executive Order 13799. H.R. 3214 titled Anti-Voter Suppression Act was introduced by Representative Cedric Richmond (D) Louisiana's 2nd congressional district on July 12, 2017. It would nullify the effect of the Executive order that establishes the committee. The legislative initiatives are in early stages and are estimated by GovTrack at less than one percent chance of success.

It is the first example of an active Vice President creating such a type of political action committee while serving in office. Fox News noted Pence's action came only one day after reporting on the Comey memos led to the appointment of a special counsel in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Politico reported on the unusual nature of a Vice President forming their own PAC, when they normally rely on their political party. NBC News said it was the first time a Vice President took such an action. TheStreet.com called it \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"awkwardly-timed\\". Nine News observed the PAC was registered \\"amid the chaos\\" of the Trump administration. Bloomberg News and Nine News pointed out that both Joe Biden and Dick Cheney did not take such an action while serving as Vice President. Salon noted this type of PAC was used by both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as a tactic to launch their bids for President. Vanity Fair reported the action taken by Pence was an attempt to take control of his potential future during growing political talk of efforts to impeach Donald Trump. History On May 17, 2017, Robert Mueller was appointed by the United States Department of Justice as special prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On the same day, Great America Committee was registered with the Federal Election Commission. The PAC began with staffing from Pence associates Nick Ayers and Marty Obst. The PAC was formed with the intention of assisting the political campaigns of Republican members of the Congress in their election and re- election efforts. Money raised by the political action committee would be utilized to fund costs of travel for Mike Pence aboard Air Force Two when he makes politically oriented trips in the United States. Funds from the Great America Committee would potentially be available to Pence if he wished to use them in his legal defense regarding the Russian interference in the Russia investigation. Analysis Politico noted it was unusual for a Vice President to start a political action committee in this manner during their tenure as Vice President, and instead they normally fuse their fundraising activities with the Republican National Committee. NBC News reported it was the first instance of a political action committee of this nature being formed during an active Vice President's tenure in their office. Fox News reported the political action committee was created \\"amid White House turmoil\\" and \\"after the so-called 'Comey memo' ricocheted through Washington and effectively resulted in the naming of a special counsel to probe what President Trump once called 'this Russia thing'\\". TheStreet.com called it an \\"unprecedented and awkwardly-timed political action committee\\". Nine News reported the political action committee formation steps were taken \\"amid the chaos of the Trump administration\\". Bloomberg News and Nine News pointed out that both Joe Biden and Dick Cheney did not take such an action while serving as Vice President. Salon noted these types of political action committees were utilized in the prior election season as a stepping off point to start a presidential campaign, and cited the campaigns of both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as recent examples. Vanity Fair reported that‚Äîamid growing talk of efforts to impeach Donald Trump‚ÄîPence \\"seemingly tried to take control of his political future [...] when he filed paperwork with the F.E.C. to launch his own PAC, the Great America Committee\\".

Hitting .379 on the season, he was nonetheless better known for his defensive capabilities on the field and as a legitimate base stealing threat on the basepaths. Oftentimes, Carlisle hit second in the line-up, in front of teammates Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard. His struggles in 1938, however, after posting just a .139 batting average (BA), precipitated the loss of Carlisle's starting role to Sammy Bankhead in 1939. A year later, Carlisle was reinserted as a starter, batting .278. With the Grays, he won the 1943 Negro World Series but went 0-for-9 during the series. Carlisle spent the remainder of his baseball career as a utility man before retiring in 1946. Carlisle died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1972; he was 62 years old.

He left five volumes of diaries chronicling the California Gold Rush and its aftermath, from 1853-1959. His records are stored at the Plumas County Museum in Quincy, California Life James Haun was born near Haun's Mill near Lexington in Scott County, Kentucky to John Haun and Katherine Winter. He had four younger brothers, and at least one sister. The family business was milling. In 1831, Haun married Martha Hurst of Georgetown, and the couple had one son, John, born in 1834. They were active in the local Baptist church, and had many friends. Financially, the family was moderately successful, with a home and business. In 1853, Haun set out for the gold mines of California in company with his seventeen-year-old son John and his younger brother Dave, with the goal of earning enough to purchase agricultural property at home. He prospected on Willow Creek near Nelson Point on the Middle Fork of the Feather River as a member of several different mining companies. Although he never struck it rich, his claims paid well. In November 1855, he was joined by his wife and her young niece Lizzie, and in 1856 purchased the 160 acre American Ranch in Quincy, which the family operated as a farm and hotel until its sale in 1876.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants lack a rosette and have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a green and white, striped flower with reddish-brown markings and forms colonies, sometimes of thousands of plants. Description Pterostylis hamiltonii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of bluish-green leaves, each leaf 5‚Äì14 mm long and 5‚Äì12 mm wide. Flowering plants usually have a single flower 25‚Äì30 mm long and 12‚Äì15 mm wide borne on a spike 50‚Äì150 mm high with four to six stem leaves 20‚Äì40 mm long and 2‚Äì8 mm wide. The flowers are white with green or reddish-brown stripes and markings. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a thread-like tip 1‚Äì3 mm long. The lateral sepals are erect and held closely against the galea. They have thread-like ends 20-25 long and between their bases there is a broad, flat sinus with a central notch. The labellum is 15‚Äì20 mm long, about 3 mm wide, dark red and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from late May to early August. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis hamiltonii was first formally described in 1810 by William Henry Nicholls and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected near Boyup Brook. The specific epithet (hamiltonii) honours Alex. G. Hamilton, (1852-1941) \\"a veteran in the field of botanical research\\". Distribution and habitat The red-veined shell orchid is found between Toodyay and the Stirling Range where it usually grows in thickets of Allocasuarina huegeliana on or near granite outcrops in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Conservation Pterostylis grandiflora is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Unlike Crisis, New Moral World was largely sold rather than given away, and therefore had a smaller circulation. The newsagents who sold it typically also sold the Chartist Northern Star.

It was the cover story of the June 2017 issue of The Atlantic. It was Tizon's final published story and was printed after his death in March 2017. He died on the day that The Atlantics editorial staff decided the article would be featured on the magazine's front cover, before they could tell him of their decision.\\"Alex Tizon's posthumous Atlantic cover story is about his family's secret slave\\", by Eder Campuzano, at The Oregonian; published May 16, 2017; retrieved May 16, 2017 The story went viral on the Internet and generated extensive debate, receiving both praise and criticism. Background The work recounts the life story of a Filipino woman, Eudocia Tomas Pulido, known in the family as \\"Lola\\" (grandmother in Tagalog),lola in Tagalog Dictionary. who lived with the author's family for 56 years, for most of that time essentially as a slave, and who helped raise three generations of the author's family. Pulido was a distant relation of the Tizon family, from a poorer branch of the clan. In the 1940s, she had been tricked into servitude by the author's grandfather, a military office during the Commonwealth Era, and then at the age of 18 was \\"given\\" to the author's then 12-year-old mother as a personal slave. Pulido came to the United States in 1964 on a special passport linked to the author's father, who was a diplomat. However, her travel papers expired in 1969, and she was ineligible for the permanent-resident status that the author's family received, making her an illegal immigrant in the U.S for the next two decades. She eventually received amnesty as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and she became a U.S. citizen in October 1998. The Tizon family went through a tumultuous time as they moved from the Philippines to Los Angeles, to Seattle, and finally to Oregon. The author's father quit his consular post, turning into a gambler and womanizer, eventually leaving the family. His mother worked long hours while studying medicine and eventually remarried, with Pulido suffering continuous abuse and neglect from the author's parents, besides receiving no salary or remuneration for her services. Nonetheless, Pulido steadfastly carried out her matriarchal duties, essentially serving as a surrogate mother to the Tizon children. Eventually, the author and his siblings stood up for Pulido to their mother. Once an adult with a family of his own, Alex Tizon brought Pulido, then aged 75, to live in his home, and he paid for her to visit her home village in the Philippines when she was 83. She died on November 7, 2011, at the age of 86 and Tizon later repatriated her ashes to her birthplace of Mayantoc, Tarlac. Reception My Family's Slave, Tizon's story published by The Atlantic, went viral and sparked significant debate in both the United States and the Philippines. The Atlantic acknowledged these mixed reactions to the story. Filipinos generally praised Tizon, while many Western commentators criticized him. The Filipino magazine Scout argued that 'a lot of the international outrage is coming from a place where they don't fully understand the culture the story is set in'. The American magazine Slate also noted the 'wide-sweeping judgment coming from people who have no context nor familiarity with Filipino culture, history, or economics'.Galang, M. Evelina (May 21, 2017). What the Conversation Around Alex Tizon's Atlantic Essay Is Missing. Slate. Slate further wrote that, as the Philippines is a developing country, \\"the wide disparity between those with and without money makes the culture of servitude a viable option for many born into poverty, especially in the provinces.\\" The article was lauded as \\"an honest, haunting tale\\" by the Chicago Tribune, but it also received criticism. Author Randy Ribay questioned the moral high ground of those who criticized Tizon through mobile devices that were built with the use of child labor, and he added that \\"asking why [Tizon] wasn't better at doing what was right every step of the way isn't the most fruitful line of discussion. We are all complicit in a number of evils. We all perpetuate oppression throughout our daily lives.\\"Ribay, Randy (June 6, 2017). What the Backlash to 'My Family's Slave' Obscured. The Atlantic. The Washington Post wrote that many Filipinos expressed that \\"while they don't condone indentured servitude, Pulido's life was a much too common scenario ingrained in Filipino culture and one that must be confronted and openly discussed.\\" The Washington Post further noted that the article \\"drew wide praise, with readers commending Tizon's honesty, and some saying it was among the most powerful magazine pieces published in recent memory. But it also spurred intense criticism from some readers who felt it humanized a 'slave owner' and others who described Tizon as being 'complicit in the systemic oppression of Filipino househelp'.\\" References External links * \\"My Family's Slave\\" at The Atlantic Category:2017 essays Category:2017 short stories Category:American essays Category:The Atlantic (magazine) articles Category:Filipino-American culture Category:Labor in the Philippines Category:Works about slavery ","title":"My Family's Slave"},{"id":"54072785","text":"CAFE is a media venture developed in partnership between former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and Some Spider Studios.

YouTube channel and artistry  Richie Giese began his YouTube channel, Social Repose, in April 2011, where he uploaded his original music. He later began posting vlogs, cover songs, comedy sketches and other content. As time progressed, he began posting barbershop- style a cappella covers as well as loop covers and more humorous music content, while still continuing to upload his original music. His other musical content includes videos of him performing songs in other genres, making songs from other YouTubers' Tweets and singing while inhaling helium. Social Repose also uploads reaction videos, which he titles \\"Goth reacts\\", and surreal artistic videos. His YouTube channel currently has over 1 million subscribers. Social Repose performing live When performing, he wears a distinct outfit that includes mechanical wings, face paint and a headdress that resembles a native American war bonnet. He progressively adds new components to his outfit, which he tends to get custom-made. He claims that the outfit is meant to be memorable and garner attention to his music. He likes to describe his style as \\"alternative\\".  Musical career  Prior to 2015, Social Repose made emo electronic and synth-pop music which he released independently through Youtube and Bandcamp. He began his musical career in 2011 making synth-pop music. He made his first song, \\"Helium House\\", while still in film school. The accompanying video is the first upload on his YouTube channel. The song was included on his first album, Paradise. He regards this portion of his career as \\"cringey\\". In 2013, Social Repose started making EDM songs. Reckless Closure was his first EDM album. He released an EP titled Crazy Manic Love, which includes a song of the same name. Social Repose's debut album, Yalta, was released in 2015. This featured a completely new style, and was a \\"transitional record\\" for him. It is considered alternative or indie, and has been compared to the sounds of Owl City and Panic! at the Disco. Yalta has been described as a \\"a well crafted declaration of inner strength and self confidence and individuality\\". Social Repose has collaborated with musician BryanStars on an a capella cover of Bring Me the Horizon's \\"Follow You\\". Social Repose released a song called \\"Filthy Pride\\" in 2016 as a single before it was included on his EP, Empress. He wrote the rest of the EP around this song, because he felt like its theme needed to be expanded on. He intended Empress to have the same dark, atmospheric sound as Yalta. He released a music video for his song \\"Villain\\", which served as the second track on the EP.''' Social Repose embarked on the Empress Tour, spanning the southern and mid-west United States. Hotel Books and the Funeral Portrait served as support. The tour then went overseas to the United Kingdom and Europe, with One-Eyed Doll. In 2018, Social Repose's cover of \\"You Should See Me in a Crown\\" was featured on Glamour magazine's YouTube channel, where it was watched by Billie Eilish. She complimented him on his talent and described the video as \\"impressive\\". Social Repose's album Calamity was released on March 26, 2020.

Biography Dick Asher became widely known to the general public through Frederic Dannen's 1990 book Hit Men: Power Brokers And Fast Money Inside The Music Business, which chronicled Asher's music industry career, particularly focussing on his tenure as Deputy President of Columbia Records between 1979 and 1983, his corporate and personal battles with controversial label president Walter Yetnikoff, and Asher's attempts in the early 1980s to expose and defeat the growing influence of a cabal of independent record promotion agents known as \\"The Network\\". A former U.S. Marine, Asher began his working life as a business lawyer. His music industry career began in the mid-1960s when he was appointed as Vice President of Business Affairs for the CBS (now Sony Music) group of record labels, which included the Columbia and Epic Records labels. One of his first major duties at CBS was a 1966 meeting with Bob Dylan in Woodstock, NY, shortly after Dylan's legendary motorcycle accident, to negotiate the renewal of Dylan's Columbia recording contract. Asher rapidly gained a reputation for his honesty, integrity, loyalty, thoroughness and able business administration. In 1970 he was appointed Vice President of Capitol Reocrds' east coast division, but the move was not a successful one for Asher (Dannen described it as \\"a disaster\\") and in 1971 Asher gratefully accepted Columbia president Clive Davis's offer to return to CBS.Dannen, 1991, p. 78 In 1972 he was sent to London to take over Columbia's loss-making UK division, which he soon returned to profit, and he was subsequently promoted to become the head of CBS' entire overseas recording operation. In 1979 the music industry experienced a major and rapid downturn in sales, and the CBS labels suffering a serious drop in profits. To deal with this crisis, then CBS Chief Operating Officer John Backe created the new position of Deputy President of Columbia Records and appointed Asher to the role, where he implemented a stringent but effective (although very unpopular) round of cost-cutting, during which he was obliged to retrench hundreds of CBS staff. One area of expenditure that soon became a matter of particular concern to Asher was the large and rising cost of payments to independent promotion agents, and Asher calculated that this little-known facet of the company's operation was by then costing CBS alone around $10 million annually. For most of their history, music publishers and record labels had long used \\"song pluggers\\", freelance promotions agents who were hired on a casual basis to promote and sell new sheet music - and later, new record releases - to department and music stores, and radio station program directors. For many years this had been a relatively low-cost operation, but through the late 1960s and early 1970s, the combination of increasing competition between record labels, the enormous increase in the volume of new records, and the development of the restrictive Top 40 radio programming format meant that by the mid-1970s record labels were finding it increasingly difficult to get new releases placed into radio station playlists by their house marketing staff, and the American labels began to rely more and more heavily on a small group of powerful and influential independent promoters. As he investigated Columbia's expenditures during 1979, Asher quickly realised that the cost of paying these \\"indies\\" (independent promotion agents) had skyrocketed - when he took over the CBS UK operation in 1972, an \\"indie\\" might only charge around $100 per week, but by 1980 it was estimated that the major labels were paying $100,000-$200,000 or more per record to hire these agents to promote their products to radio, and it was calculated that, industry-wide, the practice was by then costing at least $50 million annually. He also discovered that a group of the top independent American agents had organised themselves into a loose association known as \\"The Network\\", and that this group now had a virtual stranglehold over this crucial area of record company promotions. In late 1979 Asher decided to test the power of The Network by deliberately not paying their agents to promote the new Pink Floyd single \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" to radio stations in Los Angeles. The results dramatically validated his concerns - despite the fact that the group was the talk of the town at the time, performing sell-out concerts and garnering rave reviews, not one of the major L.A. radio stations would add the single to their playlist - but once the company resumed payments, the single quickly entered the Top 40, and in February 1980 its parent LP The Wall went to #1 on the Billboard album chart, where it remained for the next four months. For several reasons Asher was determined to stop the practice of paying these \\"indies\\", but his crusade was strongly opposed by his boss, Columbia's volatile President, Walter Yetnikoff, who personally disliked Asher and disagreed with many of his this business decisions. Yetnikoff strenuously defended the use of the \\"indies\\" as being essential to the company's business. Asher however was now greatly concerned about the wider ramifications of this practice - he realised that \\"The Network\\" was, in effect, an industry-wide extortion racket whose real power lay in its ability to prevent records from getting to radio, and he also suspected that its leaders may have had links to organised crime. Asher feared that this could precipitate another major scandal, on the scale of 1950s payola debacle, which destroyed the career of top DJ Alan Freed. Asher knew that there were instances of apparent fraud, in which the Network agents were charging large sums for the placement of records that in fact were never even played on radio, and that the use of \\"indies\\" could be construed as bribery. He also feared that these practices could have disastrous consequences for his company, because if it was found that the CBS labels had been involved in any criminal activity, the Federal Communications Commission had the power to suspend or even revoke the all-important broadcast licences held by Columbia's parent, CBS Inc. which operated the CBS television and radio networks. In 1981, with concern across the industry growing, and after negotiations between the major labels, CBS and Warner Communications agreed to a joint boycott on payments to The Network, but it fizzled out after only a few weeks, and the labels soon returned to paying the Network. Asher later found that one of his own labels, Epic, had been evading the boycott almost from the beginning, by hiding payments to The Network as \\"tour promotions\\" and other costs. By early 1983 Asher's financial efforts at CBS were reaping rewards, and the company posted its biggest quarterly profit since the late '70s, but in mid-April he was called to a meeting with Yetnikoff, who told him that CBS Music's new CEO Thomas Wyman \\"had problems\\" with him. Shocked and puzzled, Asher began to question Yetnikoff about the claim, but at this point the obviously uncomfortable Yetnikoff abruptly got up, left the room and (as Asher soon discovered) he immediately went home. Yetnikoff then deliberately avoided Asher for days. Asher eventually contacted Wyman and arranged a meeting, where Wyman told him that it was in fact Yetnikoff who \\"had problems\\" with Asher. Asher then searched the building trying to find Yetnikoff to discuss and hopefully resolve the issue, but he later found out that Yetnikoff had been deliberately hiding in another executive's office so that Asher could not find him. The following Friday Asher came to work to discover that his regularly scheduled weekly staff meeting had been cancelled, and that he had been ordered to come to Yetnikoff's office. There Asher was confronted by Yetnikoff and Wyman, who presented and demanded that Asher sign a one-line press statement announcing that he had left CBS. A stunned Asher refused to sign, despite repeated demands by Yetnikoff and Wyman, and he then insisted on seeing his lawyer. Asher realised he was being fired, but after consulting his lawyer, he realised that it would be pointless to fight the company and he acquiesced to his dismissal. Asher then spent almost a year \\"in the wilderness\\", during which time he found it almost impossible to find work, and was shunned by former colleagues, but in 1984, in a surprise move, he was brought in to act as a senior consultant on the proposed merger between the Warner and Polygram music groups. Ultimately Federal Trade Commission refused to approve the merger, but Asher had by then been appointed as a senior VIce- President at Warner Communications, and in October 1985 he was headhunted to become the new President and Chief Executive of Polygram Records Inc.

Its waters reach the Hudson River via Schoharie Creek and the Mohawk River. Since it drains into the Schoharie upstream of Schoharie Reservoir, it is part of the New York City water supply system. From the source to Maplecrest, Batavia Kill drains the northern slopes of the Blackhead Mountains, which include Thomas Cole Mountain, Black Dome, and Blackhead Mountain, the fourth-, third-, and fifth-highest peaks in the Catskills, respectively. The Batavia Kill's watershed accounts for 7.9 percent of the Schoharie Creek's watershed, and about 30 percent of the Schoharie Reservoir's watershed. Course Batavia Kill begins on the north-northeast slopes of Blackhead Mountain and starts travelling northwest as it gains an unnamed tributary draining northeast slopes of Black Dome. The kill continues northwest and gains an unnamed tributary draining the southwest slopes of Acra Point. It slowly curves southwest as it descends the Black Dome Valley and enters the hamlet of Maplecrest, where it curves back to the northwest. The creek then passes through Hensonville, passes under New York State Route 296 as it curves to the west, and begins to parallel New York State Route 23. It then enters the hamlet of Windham, where it receives Mitchell Hollow Brook from the north. It continues paralleling New York State Route 23 as it enters the town of Ashland. It soon enters the hamlet of Ashland, where it receives Sutton Hollow Brook from the north. The kill continues westward and soon receives Lewis Creek from the north. The kill then enters the town of Prattsville and soon flows over Red Falls by the hamlet of the same name. Batavia Kill then curves to the southwest, crosses under New York State Route 23A, then converges with Schoharie Creek southeast of the hamlet of Prattsville. Watershed The Batavia Kill's watershed, flows through the towns of Windham, Ashland and Prattsville to its confluence with the Schoharie Creek, near the hamlet of Prattsville. From Big Hollow where the kill originates, it drops from about to at the mouth, a drop of about . The watershed is also asymmetrical, with the main Batavia Kill located on the south side of the watershed. The majority of the drainage area is north of the kill. The watershed is approximately and varies from wide. Water withdrawn from the kill is approximately per year, which includes water taken from ground and surface water sources. About 55 percent of water withdrawn is by Ski Windham. Residential wells withdraw about 12 percent of the water withdrawals. Ski Windham can only take a maximum of 3,142 gallons per minute from the kill, which is regulated through a NYSDEC permit. Within the watershed, the predominant land cover is undeveloped forested area, at 80 percent. Mixed grass and shrubs is the second most common land cover, with just over 1 percent being impervious surfaces and agricultural uses. This has not always been the case in the past, as most of the watershed was stripped of its trees during the 1700 and 1800s. As the watershed reverts to forests, total rainfall runoff and flashiness is decreasing. The National Wetlands Inventory maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated 1.9 percent, or , of the watershed as wetlands. Geology While the Catskills originated during the Devonian period, around 375 million years ago, as a former river delta uplifted and became a dissected plateau, the Batavia Kill's valley was formed during the recent effects of the Wisconsin glaciation, which ended about 12,000 years ago. The most recent geological impact on the kill was the recent Wisconsin Glaciation, which occurred around 16,000 years ago. The Wisconsin ice sheet was divided into three major lobes of southward moving ice. The easternmost lobe of the ice sheet, known as the Labrador lobe, was the one that last influenced the Batavia Kill watershed. Geological evidence within the area show that the Batavia Kill watershed was influenced by ice from four or more different directions. The glaciers moved through the Batavia Kill Valley almost to the Schoharie Creek, with ice also pushing into the upper Batavia Kill watershed. Also at this time, the Grand Gorge glacier was advancing up the Schoharie Valley and some of this ice pushed up the Batavia Kill valley, almost colliding with it. As the glaciers retreated, the Schoharie Valley was blocked by stalled ice near Grand Gorge, which developed a large lake. Parts of the lake extended deep into the Batavia Kill watershed. Present day evidence shows that this ancient lake extended as far as Big Hollow. As the glaciers retreated, they left layers of fine clay and silt. These same clay deposits effects water quality to this day, as the stream slowly erodes into these layers. In the kill's watershed the bedrock exposed mostly in the higher elevations, with soils and other deposits covering the bedrock in the lower elevations. Most of the bedrock in the Batavia Kill watershed is fractured, which benefits groundwater retention and recharge. Roughly 91 percent of the soils covering the bedrock within the Batavia Kill watershed have mostly moderate to very poor permeability. As a result, the watershed is very sensitive to the effects of rainfall due to little precipitation infiltrating into the ground. The type of soils in the watershed are very prone to erosion, which contributes to excess sediment to enter into the stream system. Hydrology =Discharge= The Batavia Kill's watershed receives an average of precipitation annually. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains one stream gauge along Batavia Kill in operation since 1997. The station is located in Red Falls, upstream from the mouth, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, as Hurricane Irene passed through the area, and a minimum discharge of per second on September 8, 2007 and September 26, 2010. There was formerly a stream gauge located in Maplecrest that was in operation from October 1997 to June 2009. In late August 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding and devastation in the eastern New York. peaked at this location at 44,200 cfs. FEMA Flood Insurance Study predicts the 100-year flood by the Red Falls stream gauge to be per second, and the 500-year flood to be per second, therefore flows during Irene surpassed the projected 500-year level. Bank erosion and flood-related damages to buildings occurred in Maplecrest. A barn was destroyed in Maplecrest and the creek channel between Maplecrest and Hensonville changed and pushed multiple houses off of their foundations. Multiple farmers' crops were destroyed where it overflowed its bank. =Water quality= Sediment load from Batavia Kill, along with West Kill and East Kill, have been the principal contributors of sediment and turbidity in the Schoharie Reservoir. Due to this, the kill was selected by NYCDEP to have stream channel reconstruction performed in certain areas and to implement a stream management plan. In the kill are populations of Japanese knotweed, which has shallow route structures. The Japanese knotwood out competes plants with stronger roots, which also contribute to streambank erosion. DEC rates the water quality of the Batavia Kill in three different sections. The upper section from the source to Maplecrest and the lower section from Windham to the mouth is rated as Class C, suitable for fishing and non-contact human recreation. The section from Maplecrest to Windham is rated as Class A, suitable for use as drinking water. The agency also adds a \\"(TS)\\" to the upper and sections of the middle, indicating that the stream's waters are ideal for trout spawning. DEC adds a \\"(T)\\" to the lower and sections of the middle, which means its suitable for trout populations. The kill's waters are pure enough to be part of the New York City water supply system; after draining into the Schoharie they are impounded at Schoharie Reservoir downstream, where they can be delivered through the Shandaken Tunnel to Esopus Creek at Shandaken. From there they go to Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 10 percent of the city's water, and then, via the Catskill Aqueduct, to customers, without requiring filtration. =Flood control= Serious flooding occurred from Hurricane Connie in 1955 and Hurricane Donna in 1960 along the kill, which caused severe damage. After the 1960 flood, Greene County created the Greene County Soil & Water Conservation District, to allow access to federal flood protection funds. Then in July 1965, the USDA Soil Conservation Service, now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, published a watershed protection plan. The plan proposed that four flood control structures be built in the watershed. The first was constructed in 1967 and is located on Mitchell Hollow Creek upstream from the mouth. Another was built in 1970 and is located on the Lake Heloise outlet, approximately one mile north of its confluence with the Batavia. The CD Lane Park Dam was constructed in 1974 and is located approximately upstream of Hensonville. Each dam is made of an earth embankment, a low level outlet pipe, and an emergency grass spillway. All emergency spillways were active during Tropical Storm Irene. In 1999, a section of the creek on the Maier Farm was reconstructed. Before the project the banks of the kill were eroding about per year. Also in 1999, a section of the creek behind the Brandywine restaurant in Ashland was restored, both just before Tropical Storm Floyd effected the watershed. Then in 2002, a section of the creek above C.D. Lane Park was restored. These projectes included adding rock structures and planting native vegetation on the streambanks and floodplains to reduce erosion. Also leaves and branches from the vegetation cools the water by providing shade, which improves the habitat for wildlife. The areas of greatest concern for flooding were the reach of the stream around the hamlets of Maplecrest, Hensonville, and Windham. Also the section between Hensonville and Maplecrest was high risk. Conservation and management The first water quality protection program was the Watershed Agricultural Program (WAP), which was created by the NYCDEP in 1990. Originally it proposed that as much as 75 percent of the active farmland would be eliminated. This caused the New York State Soil & Water Conservation to educate the city on the benefits of farming. As a result, farmers improved management activities to improve water quality, rather than going out of production. Then in 1994, the Watershed Forestry Program (WFP) was established based on the success of the WAP. Since 1997, the WFP has worked along with the US Forest Service, Catskill Forest Association, SUNY-ESF and other agencies. The WFP has gained city, state and federal funds for programs to improve water quality. The WFP also provides resources for logger training and certification. Also the GCSWCD assisted the WFP in 2000, and the two agencies purchased a temporary bridge, which is available on a loan basis for logging operations at no cost. In January 1997, the execution of the NYC Watershed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between different levels of government, non-profit organizations, and local entities provided the groundwork for a watershed protection program. The MOA included updates to watershed rules and regulations, an extensive land acquisition program, and development of programs to help local communities and landowners with water quality protection projects. The MOA also included resources to build the economic status of communities along the kill. The Catskill Watershed Corporation (CWC) was then formed, which carries out programs of the MOA. The CWC gives out grants to residents and communities in the watershed to help pay for storm water system replacements, sand and salt storage facility improvements, and wastewater treatment system improvements.

Known as the visible head of the Rahma Mission in Spain and a number of Latin American countries, stands out among the ufologists for having summoned the international press to sightings scheduled in advance in more than ten occasions. As a self proclaimed contactee, he has published 20 books in Spanish and one in English about this subject so far (July 2017). In his works about UFOlogy he promotes a systematic method of physical and mental preparation for contact, as well as protocols for documenting, validating and confirming contact experiences.  Life  Paz Wells was born in Lima, Peru, in December 12 1955 to Rose Marie Wells Vienrich and Carlos Paz Garc√≠a, an astronomer and scientific adviser of the Peruvian Air Force, as well as researcher interested in the UFO phenomena. From the age of twelve he became interested in UFOs because of his proximity to the Peruvian Institute of Interplanetary Relations (IPRI), founded and presided over by his father. He coursed primary and secondary studies with the Marist Brothers, culminating his studies in the first place in the Order of Merits. Sixto Paz, 19 at that time, invites the Spanish journalist J. J. Benitez to a programmed sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Chilca desert on September 7, 1974. He then pursued university studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, in the faculty of History. He is married to Marina Torres since 1987 and have two daughters: Yearim and Tanis.  Career  On January 22, 1974 he attended a conference titled \\"Telepathy as a transmission of distance thought\\", given by a physician member of the Theosophical Society. That night, after a deep relaxation exercise, Paz Wells received with his mother and sister, a message through automatic writing. The message supposedly was from a being named Oxalc from Ganymede, with the intention of establishing communication with some earthlings. Sixto repeated the group experience, and they all were summoned to a sighting scheduled on February 7, 1974 at 9 pm in the Chilca desert, where according to the attendants appeared a very bright lens-shaped aircraft with windows. Sixto Paz was interested in communicating with aliens astrally, in dreams or telepathically, and not only physically with their ships, which was the traditional approach of IPRI ufologists. Similar experiences were happening until August 1974, when the agency Efe spread the news that involved the Paz Wells family: Following the note from Efe, journalist J. J. Ben√≠tez was sent from Spain to learn about the unusual experience of Paz Wells teenagers. Ben√≠tez did not get involved with Ufology out of his curiosity, but rather found the UFO phenomenon meeting the Rama Mission. Sixto invites him to the scheduled sighting of an unidentified flying object, along with his brother Charlie and seven other people at the Chilca desert on September 7, 1974. Benitez saw, as had been announced in advance, two UFOs. = Rahma Mission = Group listening to Sixto Paz Wells during a field trip on Chilca desert, Peru on March 30, 2009 Originally called the RAMA Mission, it was named after the goal they shared: RA (Sun) MA (Earth), a contact program that seeks to transform the human being into a star, into a Sun on Earth. It was the organization of groups of sympathizers of the method promoted by Paz Wells to contact those who he called \\"Extraterrestrial Guides\\". Through IPRI Paz Wells contacted the \\"International Society of Divine Realization\\" where he learned yoga, relaxation, meditation and deep concentration techniques, which he would later encourage among the Rahma groups to facilitate contact. Since the Chilca event of September 1974, together with his brother Charlie and close friends from IPRI, he began work with groups of enthusiasts in Peru, which were growing and ended adopting the name RAMA Mission. It was officially dissolved as an organization by its founder in 1990, although there are groups that are still working independently. It came to have a presence in several countries of Latin America and Spain, where it was reviewed as one of the eleven sects or groups that have the extraterrestrials as core of their doctrines. = International Forums = Sixto Paz describes himself as a messenger of peace and hope, rather than a messenger of other worlds. He has appeared in international forums such as the United Nations and in universities such as Columbia University and John F. Kennedy University. In other countries, the University of Montreal, the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and the National Autonomous University of Mexico have also had him as a lecturer. = Visited countries = Sixto Paz Wells showing petroglyphs during a field trip to Paititi, Peru, August 2007 Paz Wells travels around the world giving lectures about his take on the UFO phenomena. He has visited Europe, Africa, Oceania and America such as Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and United States, being most noted his visit to Washington DC in May 2015. In more than ten opportunities he has summoned members of the international press to witness, record and photograph the sightings of lights and objects in the sky, which the author claims are directed or manned by extraterrestrial beings who maintain telepathic contact with him and other members of his contact groups. Among these experiences are one of August 1997 on the Valpara√≠so beach north of Lima, March 3, 2009 in the Chilca desert, in 2014 also in Chilca, and 2014 in Teotihuacan, Mexico.  Critics  As a self proclaimed contactee, Paz Wells has faced skepticism, even from the so called serious ufologists. On March 31, 1994 Paz Wells was invited to the Spanish television program \\"La hora de la verdad\\", in which he underwent a polygraph test. He has been criticized for not passing the test on the question \\"Have you truly traveled in a spacecraft to another planet?\\", which is one of the main arguments the author uses to back up his claims. However, Paz Wells did pass all other questions such as \\"Have you ever been under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug?\\", \\"Have you received money from any spy service?\\", \\"Have you invented all these stories For exclusively lucrative purposes? \\", \\"Without having to do with this matter, have you ever lied to get out of a hurry?\\" which he argues in his defense as proof of character. He also says that he failed the question \\"Have you really traveled in a spacecraft to another planet?\\" because he claims to have visited Ganymede, which is not a proper planet but a moon of Jupiter, an imprecision that made him stumble. The Rahma Mission of which Paz Wells was the visible head until its dissolution in 1990 has been described by psychologists and philosophers as a UFO religion and a neo-religious group whose beliefs are very similar to those of Theosophy and nineteenth century's Occultism, while using the techniques from Spiritism. In 1976, his brother Charlie settled in Brazil and formed contact groups there with a different orientation than Sixto was giving to the RAMA Mission, claiming that it was becoming \\"a movement plagued of interpretation errors, struggles for leadership and unclear economic purposes.\\"  Published books  He has written more than 20 books since 1985, published in Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Italy, Germany, and the United States. Some of them have been translated into English, German, Italian and Portuguese. ;In English * The Invitation (2002) ;In Spanish Most of his work has been published in Spanish: * Los Gu√≠as Extraterrestres (1985) * Contacto Interdimensional (April 1993) * El Umbral Secreto (June 1995) * Los Guardianes y Vigilantes de Mundos (1997) * Una Puerta Hacia Las Estrellas (1999) * Una Ins√≥lita Invitaci√≥n (April 2001) * La Antiprofec√≠a (January 2002) * Tanis y La Esfera Dorada (October 2004) * Tanis y El M√°gico Cuzco (October 2005) * Antolog√≠a del Contacto Extraterrestre, 33 A√±os Despu√©s (2007) * Extraterrestre, Abriendo Los Ojos a Otra Realidad (May 2008) * El Instructor del Nuevo Tiempo (2009) * El Parto Planetario (2010) * 2012 Contacto con Otras Realidades (2012) * La Muerte como Metamorfosis (December 2013) * 2012 La Cuenta Regresiva (2013) * Gu√≠a Pr√°ctica para Tener un Contacto (October 2014) * Relatos de Otra Realidad (October 2015) * Sixto Paz Wells y Los Visitantes Estelares (August 2015) ;Novels * El santuario de la tierra (2017 Kolima books)  See also  * J.

Rol√≥n's work has been shown at museums and galleries internationally, including the Bass Museum of Art, Miami, Marta Herford Museum, Germany, Museo de Arte de Ponce, Puerto Rico and the 2007 Venice Biennale.  Early life, education and career  Carlos Rol√≥n was born and raised in Chicago, where he still lives and works. Rol√≥n attended Columbia College Chicago in 1989, with a concentration in painting and drawing. His early career was heavily influenced by early New York City street, hip hop, disco and punk culture of the 1980s. He abandoned creating work as a street artist for abstract paintings in his early twenties. His travels to Europe in the early 1990s eventually led the artist to Paris's underground music and fashion worlds at artist space H√¥pital √©ph√©m√®re (fr). A project for the now defunct French record label Yellow Productions brought the artist to Japan, where in 2003 he was introduced to Masami Shiraishi. The owner and director of Scai the Bathhouse, a contemporary art gallery known for introducing Japan's avant-garde artists to the world as well as for helping artists from abroad to establish a presence in Japan, he offered Rol√≥n a solo exhibition, which sold out before the opening. In 2005, the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis held a solo exhibition of Rolon's work, curated by Shannon Fitzgerald and Paul Ha, titled \\"Punk Funk.\\" His most significant exhibition in the US up to that point, the show included several new works created for the show, including a 14 by 42 foot site-specific installation. The exhibition was accompanied by a full color publication with audio. Rol√≥n was initially represented by Chicago gallerist Monique Meloche from 2001-2010 and his paintings appeared at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and Chicago Cultural Center during that time. A significant advance in Rol√≥n's career came in 2007 when Jeffrey Deitch, owner of Deitch Projects, took note of his work at the 52nd Venice Biennale and offered him a solo exhibition and began representing him. Rol√≥n has since had solo shows in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Puerto Rico.  Work  For the Ukrainian Pavilion at the 2007 Venice Biennale, where Rol√≥n was one of four non-Ukrainian artists invited to take part, the artist transformed an 18-foot speedboat into a multimedia installation and sculpture called \\"Dnipro.\\" Following the success of Dnipro, Rol√≥n continued to work with skilled fabricators to develop a fleet of customized vehicle and bicycle sculptures that drew on Kustom Kulture. Beginning in 2011, Rol√≥n started exploring nail art with intricate custom nail designs, exhibitions, events, and a book. In September 2011 in New York City, Rol√≥n held a popup nail salon called \\"Get Nailed\\" at the New Museum, where visitors were invited to have elaborate designs painted on their nails by New York nail artists. This ran alongside an exhibition titled \\"Imperial Nail Salon\\" at Salon 94 Freemans nearby. To coincide with the exhibitions, Rol√≥n published the book \\"Nailed: The History of Nail Culture,\\" a geographically- organized extraordinary nail art and nail salon environments. In February 2012, Rol√≥n continued to elaborate the nail art theme with a site-specific installation called \\"Imperial Nail Salon\\" at The Standard Hotel in Miami as part of Art Basel Miami Beach. The installation and interactive event, in which actress Tilda Swinton participated, was a recreation of the living room in the artist's childhood home where his mother operated a private nail salon. In 2013, a new version of \\"Imperial Nail Salon (My parents' living room)\\" was installed as part of the Homebodies exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. While the exhibitions on nail art were inspired by his mother's home nail salon, Rol√≥n's subsequent work was inspired by his father's love of boxing. In 2014, Rol√≥n released the book Boxed: A Visual History and the Art of Boxing, a survey of art related to the sport, which the artist describes as an homage to his father. This coincided with a two-part exhibition titled \\"Born, Carlos Rol√≥n, 1970\\" on view simultaneously in early 2014 at Paul Kasmin Gallery and Salon 94 in New York City. The exhibition was a based on a recreation of his family's basement where Rol√≥n's father and his friends watched boxing matches. The show traveled to Art Cologne in Germany in April 2014 under the name \\"Trophy Room\\". Rolon's current studio practice, as noted by Dick Goody, director of the Oakland University Art Gallery and curator of the Oakland University Art Collection explains..... \\"Rol√≥n operates as his own protagonist and is the author and conductor of various trajectories that result in art objects and environments that allow us to enter (and be welcomed) into his world. A quantum of his practice is deeply informed by a postcolonial vantage point, his sense of and relationship with the Afro- Caribbean diaspora, and a distinctive autobiography ... Rol√≥n's promiscuous use of art history, personal connections and intimate histories, along with the materials and textures from periods of influence (often from the artist's own life). He is committed to re-imagining and aligning ideas and cultures to a level of timeless luxury available to everyone ... Rol√≥n's multidisciplinary art is, by its nature, figurative and specific ... He modifies objects, at times showy rococo platforms of taste, via an extreme longing made manifest in his enthusiasm for childhood recollections, remembrances of (faux) luxury and a frank, unironic affectionate retelling of what it was like, for him, growing up.\\" Additionally, noted by artist and professor Theaster Gates, Jr.: \\"Carlos brings us to attention and focus ‚Äì a lightning rod to the true art in this cruel world. Channeling ordinary materials into intricate constructions, he seeks hope and abundance in overlooked cultures, in the carts, the nail salons, in the everyday hustle.\\"  Exhibitions  Rol√≥n has held the following solo exhibitions: * \\"Punk Funk,\\" Contemporary Art Museum, St. Louis (2005) * \\"Beautiful Otherness,\\" Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico (2006) * \\"Just Kidding,\\" Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, UK (2006) * Bass Museum of Art, Miami (2009) * La Pelanda - Centro di produzione culturale, Rome (2012) * \\"Victory,\\" The Dallas Contemporary, Dallas (2013) * \\"Now and Then,\\" Rockford Art Museum, Illinois (2015) * \\"Commonwealth,\\" Oakland University Art Gallery, Michigan (2016) * \\"Vintage Voyages and Atomic Memories,\\" Mike Kelley's Mobile Homestead, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, Michigan (2016) * \\"I Tell You This Sincerely,\\" Chicago Cultural Center, Illinois (2016) * \\"Tropicalizia,\\" Museo de Arte de Ponce, San Juan, Puerto Rico (2016) * \\"50 Grand,\\" Tube Factory artspace, Indianapolis, Indiana (2017) His work has also been exhibited in group shows at: * MARTa Herford Museum, Germany (2014) * Za√ßheta National Gallery of Art, Warsaw, Poland (2013) * Museo del Barrio, New York and Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno (CAAM), Canary Islands (2011) * Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2002, 2013) * Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (2010) * 52nd Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy (2007) * Museum Het Domein, Sittard, The Netherlands (2007) * Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY (2007) * Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, UK (2006)  Awards and residencies  Rol√≥n received the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award for Painting and Sculpture in 2006 and was awarded an artist residency in New Orleans in 2017.

This organism gets its common name from the two sets of anterolateral teeth on the front edge of its carapace, each consisting of nine teeth. The carapace can reach up to 3.75 inches in width. Immature individuals can be distinguished from adults by the width of the third and sixth abdominal segments, length of marginal abdominal hair, sparse layer of hair on the swimmerets, and the presence of a structure known as a \\"lock mechanism\\" on males. After individuals reach approximately 6.5 mm in carapace width, sexual dimorphism is apparent due to the different size and shape of abdominal segments. C. novemdentatus is the largest member of the family Xanthidae found in California.  Distribution and habitat  C. novemdentatus can be found in the eastern Pacific Ocean, from Monterey, CA to Baja California, but is most abundant in the southernmost portions of coastal southern California. C. novemdentatus lives in rocky intertidal and subtidal habitats to a depth of 240 m. Younger crabs are typically found in higher regions of the intertidal than adults.  Ecology  = Diet = C. novemdentatus has been observed cracking open and feeding upon purple sea urchins. It is also known to eat other crab species. = Defense = When threatened, C. novemdentatus may freeze in place. It is thought that this is an attempt to remain undetected.

Russell (born June 13, 1933) was an American engineer and businessman. He was one of the early pioneers of microwave technology, specializing in ultrabroadband microwave directional couplers. Due to his contributions in shaping the microwave industry with innovation and invention, Thomas J. Russell was officially named a Microwave Legend in 2006.Microwaves & RF - Microwave Legends Biography Thomas J. Russell grew up in Rock Rapids, Iowa, where he attended Iowa State University and studied Electrical Engineering. He then moved to the University of Missouri to begin post-graduate studies in Electrical Engineering and a second master's degree in Mathematics. After graduation, he joined Douglas Aircraft Company in Santa Monica and then moved on to Bendix Aviation in Kansas City and joined Alfred Electronics in Palo Alto in 1966, before starting his own company nine years later. In 1975 Russell founded KRYTAR,Krytar - Broadband & Microwave Components & Equipment - About Us a privately owned company that specializes in the manufacture of ultra broadband microwave components and test equipment for space, military and commercial usage. Russell developed one of the first computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools specifically for the design of microwave couplers. This software was used for the design and development of several of the company's early patented product lines. While running KRYTAR, Russell was also responsible for seven patents related to microwave technology. Russell‚Äôs first patent was filed in 1966.US Patent 3423702 During his career he filed 8 separate patents, spanning four decades, all related to directional couplers and similar technologies. In 1979 he received a patent based upon the idea of increasing the directivity of a coupler by building the central couplers in a unique configuration for a TEM mode strip-line directional coupler. By making the end portion immediately adjacent and in between the diverging conductors facing the coupling portion, thus increasing the directivity of TEM mode strip-line directional couplers which decreases cost.US Patent 4139827 Over the course of his career, Russell also contributed to a number of industry journals, such as the IEEE Microwave Journal, where he published ideas on microwave power dividersSAO/NASA ADS Physics Abstract Service and his patented matched-line directional dividers (MLDD),IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques amongst other topics.

Clinical pharmaceutical scientists are a type of clinician scientist, analogous to physician-scientists.  Terminology  The term clinical pharmaceutical scientist is distinct from the term pharmaceutical scientist, in that a clinical pharmaceutical scientist is a practicing clinical pharmacist involved in science relating to the discovery and/or development of pharmaceuticals, the development of new knowledge improving the use of pharmaceuticals in clinical practice, or any other subfield of pharmaceutical science (e.g. pharmacoeconomics, pharmacokinetics, outcomes research), while a pharmaceutical scientist need not also be a clinician (pharmacist). Thus, all clinical pharmaceutical scientists are pharmaceutical scientists, but not all pharmaceutical scientists are clinical pharmaceutical scientists. Clinical pharmaceutical scientists are both practicing pharmacists and clinical pharmacologists.  History  = Modern conceptualization = Most sources attribute the origination of the term \\"clinical pharmaceutical scientist\\" to the 1973‚Äì1975 Millis Study Commission on Pharmacy (often referred to simply as the \\"Millis Commission\\"). The Millis Commission was so-named after Dr. John (Jack) S. Millis, the commission's chairman. The Millis Commission was tasked with examining the place of pharmacists in the American healthcare system, the state of professional pharmacy education at the time, and the prevalence of prescription drug misuse. The Millis Commission recommended \\"training skilled pharmacy practitioners in research to increase the number and variety of clinical pharmacists,\\" who were \\"equally skilled and trained in a science and in pharmacy practice\\", but did not go as far as to explicitly define the term \\"clinical pharmaceutical scientist\\" or its educational requirements. Since the Millis Commission, multiple sources have conceptualized clinical pharmaceutical scientists. The 2003 edition of the Encyclopedia of Clinical Pharmacy defines the clinical pharmaceutical scientist as the following: > A clinical pharmaceutical scientist is an independent investigator with > education and training in pharmacotherapeutics who utilizes contemporary > research approaches to generate new knowledge relevant to drug behavior in > humans, to therapeutic interventions, and/or to patient outcomes. = Notable clinical pharmaceutical scientists = The history of pharmacy contains numerous individuals that dabbled in both clinical pharmacy practice and pharmaceutical science. Many major scientific discoveries in pharmacology were by pharmacists, acting as clinical pharmaceutical scientists (although not necessarily recognized by that term). For example, Friedrich Sert√ºrner was a German pharmacist who discovered and isolated the opiate morphine from opium in 1805. The American Pharmacy (1852‚Äì2002): A Collection of Historical Essays contains a comprehensive history of American pharmacy from the late modern period to the contemporary era. In his essay The Pharmaceutical Sciences in America, 1852‚Äì1902, John Parascandola writes: > Unlike Europe, the United States has never produced practicing pharmacist- > scientists of the caliber of Carl Scheele or Joseph Pierre Pelletier, who > made important discoveries in the laboratories associated with their > pharmacies. It should be noted, however, that the sciences were becoming > increasingly specialized by the second half of the 19th century, and the > tradition of the apothecary-scientist was on the wane even in Europe by this > time.  Education and training  =Requirements= A clinical pharmaceutical scientist must have education in both clinical pharmacy and research. Broadly, the clinical pharmaceutical scientist's clinical knowledge is centered around expertise pertaining to pharmacotherapy, with less emphasis on diagnostic skills and nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g. surgery). Clinical pharmaceutical scientists must possess expertise in the pharmaceutical sciences and in the management of drug therapy problems. To achieve this expertise, clinical pharmaceutical scientists typically pursue education after their professional pharmacy degrees (in the United States, a PharmD is generally a prerequisite). This can involve a 2‚Äì3 year postdoctoral fellowship or pursuing graduate degrees (e.g. MS, PhD). Postdoctoral programs tend to emphasize a specific area of pharmaceutical science for the scientist to specialize in, such as pharmacoepidemiology or pharmacogenetics. Postdoctoral residency training is generally recommended, though is not a prerequisite, for most fellowship programs. Some programs offer combined PharmD-PhD training. While praised as convenient, time saving, and for growing clinical pharmaceutical science, there has also been concern that the intense requirements of graduate research may take precedence over the clinical curriculum and internship/clerkship opportunities of PharmD training. As one candidate wrote in Pharmacy Times, the duration of combined PharmD-PhD programs can vary, usually lasting 7‚Äì8 years in total. According to Robert Powell, PharmD, of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (a division of the FDA), pharmacists may serve as principal investigators (PI's) on clinical trials for investigational new drug applications in the United States, provided that they meet the same requirements that every other PI must meet. =Comparison= There are multiple postdoctoral pathways to entering a career as a clinical pharmaceutical scientist. The pathways tend to vary by the time required and the depth of training, with programs of longer duration providing more extensive training. The shortest program is a graduate certificate in clinical pharmaceutical research, which tend to last one year. These programs provide graduates with the ability to conduct clinical research, though not necessarily design it as principal investigators. Due to the short duration of these programs, there is less time to develop independent research skills. Master's degree programs in clinical pharmaceutical research typically last 2‚Äì3 years, placing more emphasis on designing clinical trials. Fellowship training can also last 2‚Äì3 years, though the training is thought to place more emphasis on independence. Because fellowship training can occur in non- academic environments, fellowships can also prepare individuals to begin careers in the pharmaceutical industry or with federal regulators. Fellowships do not have a didactic curriculum, and can involve additional clinical responsibilities. The longest program is a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in clinical pharmaceutical research, which can last 4‚Äì5 years. The goals of PhD programs are the same as fellowship training, though the added time provides an even greater depth in a research area of interest, in addition to supplemental didactic curriculum. PhD programs generally do not mandate any clinical responsibilities, though the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy piloted the addition of a clinical component for their PhD clinical pharmaceutical scientist program.  Careers  =Industry= Within the pharmaceutical industry, clinical pharmaceutical scientists can pursue careers as \\"clinical research officers,\\" also known as \\"project managers.\\" In these roles, clinical pharmaceutical scientists are intimately involved with designing, conducting, and consulting on clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies. Postdoctoral pharmacy fellowships with pharmaceutical industry sponsors are traditional gateways for pharmacists to enter the industry. Careers for clinical pharmaceutical scientists within the pharmaceutical industry often involve less clinical work, and are more business and/or research intensive. Clinical pharmaceutical scientists work in the areas of drug discovery, drug formulation optimization and pharmacokinetics, pharmacoeconomics, labeling and regulatory compliance, and post-marketing research. =Academia= Clinical pharmaceutical scientists working in academia must have expertise in what the American Pharmacists Association calls the \\"three legs\\" of academia: scholarship (research), teaching, and service (clinical practice and professional development activities). Clinical pharmaceutical scientists have expertise in both research and clinical pharmacy, which is conducive to a career that demands those skills. The Commission on the Future of Graduate Education in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, appointed in 1996 by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), has recommended that more American pharmacy schools develop combined PharmD/PhD programs to train clinical pharmaceutical scientists. The AACP Educating Clinical Scientists Task Force has recommended that clinical practice be combined with teaching assistantship for first-year students in clinical pharmaceutical science programs. This would effectively prepare them for all three domains of academia identified by the American Pharmacists Association above. =Government= In the United States, clinical pharmaceutical scientists can work as researchers for governmental agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Health. =Private sector= Clinical pharmaceutical scientists working in the community setting face unique challenges. The private sector is focused on individual profitability, rather than performing academic research and disseminating knowledge for the profession itself. This applies to both (non- academic affiliated) hospital and community/retail pharmacy practice, where time and funding constraints limit opportunities for individual research.  Research scope  The research scope of clinical pharmaceutical scientists can be broken into the fields of preclinical, clinical, outcomes, and translational research, with translation research representing the middle ground between preclinical and clinical research. Subjects of interest to clinical pharmaceutical scientists in their respective field may involve the following: ;Preclinical research *Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics/pharmacogenomics *Drug delivery *Drug development (de novo drug development, as well as repurposing drugs for novel indications) *Pharmacology, including research aimed at elucidating mechanisms of action *Assay development ;Clinical research *Clinical research projects, including serving as principal investigators *Researching nuances in clinical practice ;Translational research *\\"Translating\\" research, from \\"bench to bedside\\" ;Outcomes research *Pharmacoeconomics *Public health outcomes *Health policy research *Pharmacy practice research  Duties  The duties of clinical pharmaceutical scientists can be broadly divided into two categories: scientific and clinical duties: ;Scientific duties *Grant writing *Research ethics *Independent research *Dissemination of knowledge ;Clinical duties *Interdisciplinary practice *Clinical pharmacy practice  References  Sources  * *  External links  *American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy list of graduate degree programs in the pharmaceutical sciences Category:Health care occupations ","title":"Clinical pharmaceutical scientist"},{"id":"54073248","text":"Bowman Creek flows into Schoharie Creek by Burtonsville, New York .

Ellis ran for the Chair of the California Democratic Party in 2017, losing to party insider Eric Bauman.  Early life and education  Ellis was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee and attended nine schools during her childhood as her father moved regularly in his career as a military officer. She attended schools in six different US states and two countries before she graduated from Antilles High School at Fort Buchanan near San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ellis attended Jacksonville University and earned a bachelor's degree in English. She then attended Law school at John F. Kennedy University and earned a juris doctorate.

Although Ellis supported Clinton in the Democratic primaries and in the 2016 general election, she has been welcomed by Bernie supporters as \\"leading an insurgency against the party establishment.\\"  Honors  Ellis was the Women‚Äôs History Month Honoree by the San Francisco Commission and Department on the Status of Women in 2011 and 2015.

Background  Andrea Dew Steele is Emerge America's founder and was their first president, resigning in May 2019. Steele co-founded the original affiliate, Emerge California, which was formed in 2002. After initial success, Emerge was expanded to a national organization known as Emerge America by Steele in 2005. Emerge America added affiliates in 6 states in its first year and by the 2016 presidential election, it had affiliates in 23 states. The organization's strategy is to have affiliates in all 50 states by 2020. Steele says the initial aim is for women to achieve 30% representation for women in government, noting evidence suggests this level passes a critical mass to effectively enact institutional change. Emerge America has had 4,000 graduates, of which more 690 have been elected and are currently serving a political office, as of October 2018. Hillary Clinton has praised the group as an organization helping to elect Democrats since the 2016 election by using coaching on public speaking, fundraising, networking, and ethical leadership. A‚Äôshanti Gholar, the Political Director, said enrollment has increased across the board since the 2016 presidential election, and some classes have seen attendance almost double. Overall, Emerge has seen an 87% increase in the number of applications since the 2016 election.

It then followed Panther to its source and continued on over the ridge to Summit Lake. The trail then followed Charlotte Creek from the lake and ended at the Susquehanna River. Hydrology =Water quality= In 2005, a biological assessment of the creek was performed in Breakabeen by State Route 30. Results of the tests showed non-impacted conditions, which are consistent with a previous test conducted in 2000 at this site. DEC rates the water quality of the stream as Class C, suitable for fishing and non-contact human recreation. The agency also adds a \\"(TS)\\", indicating that the stream's waters are ideal for trout spawning. =Flood control= The bridge over the creek on West Fulton Road (County Route 4) is prone to debris jams and overflowing during flood events. This is due to the undersized span and the height above the creek. There is a low spot on West Fulton Road slightly east of the bridge, that during a 25-year and higher flood, would overtop the right bank of the creek and flow over the low spot in the road.

President Donald Trump announced on July 28, 2019, that he intended to nominate Republican congressman John Ratcliffe to replace Dan Coats as Director of National Intelligence (DNI), but withdrew Ratcliffe from consideration five days later. After Trump's announcement, it was not immediately clear if he would retain Gordon, as acting DNI during Ratcliffe's confirmation process, or if she would be retained in the agency upon Ratcliffe's confirmation.

Pumpur joined the Red Army in 1918 and became a mechanic and driver in its fledgling air service due to his civilian mechanical and driving experience. After the end of the Russian Civil War he became one of the first to graduate from newly established flight schools and served as a fighter pilot during the interwar period, rising to command a fighter brigade in the mid-1930s. Between 1936 and 1937, he commanded the Soviet aviation group assisting the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War, claiming five victories. For his actions, Pumpur was made a Hero of the Soviet Union, and promoted to the rank of Komkor, skipping one grade, upon his return to the Soviet Union. He was arrested in the Purge of the Red Army in 1941 on 31 May 1941 and executed the following year.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Pumpur was born on 25 April 1900 in PlƒÅtere Parish in Kreis Riga, Russian Empire to a peasant family. He graduated from the parish school and helped his father in working for their more prosperous neighbors, then studied at a vocational school for two years. Using the knowledge he gained, Pumpur became an apprentice mechanic and an assistant chauffeur before joining the Red Army in May 1918. Due to his work as a mechanic and with cars, he was sent to the 4th Fighter Aviation Detachment in Moscow, serving as an assistant chauffeur. In October, Pumpur was transferred to the 2nd Pskov Fighter Aviation Detachment in Samara, again serving in the same position. Pumpur served only briefly with the 2nd Detachment, transferring back to the 4th Detachment in November, which he remained with until June 1921. With the 4th Detachment, he became an aircraft mechanic, fighting on the Eastern, Southeastern, Southern, and Western Fronts of the Russian Civil War. In 1919, Pumpur became a member of the Communist Party.  Interwar period  After the Civil War ended, Pumpur remained in the army, serving as an aircraft mechanic with the Commandant's Headquarters of the Central Aerodrome in Moscow from July to December 1921. After constantly interacting with pilots, listening to their conversations and stories, he requested to receive flight training. Pumpur received initial training at the Yegoryevsk Military-Theoretical School for Pilots between January 1922 and March 1923. In April, he began flight training at the 2nd Military School of Pilots at Borisoglebsk, graduating with the first class of cadets on 26 October. Among his ten classmates was future aviation pioneer Valery Chkalov. From November to May 1924 Pumpur continued to master flying techniques at the 1st Military School of Pilots in Moscow, and studied at the Higher Military Aviation School of Gunners and Bombardiers in Serpukhov from May to July. After graduation, in August 1924, Pumpur was assigned to the 2nd Fighter Aviation Squadron in Moscow, where he served as a junior pilot and then a senior pilot, mastering all types of aircraft flown by the unit. In July 1925, the squadron was involved in the suppression of a Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary-backed revolt near the Illinsky Station of the Moscow‚ÄìKursk Railway, using its planes to conduct reconnaissance. In October of that year Pumpur became a flight leader, and in December 1926 the 2nd Squadron was renamed the 7th Separate Fighter Aviation Squadron. He led a separate detachment of the squadron from February 1927. In 1929, Pumpur graduated from advanced courses for Air Force commanders at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy. He took command of the 17th Aviation Squadron in September 1930, simultaneously serving as its commissar from February 1931, and was subsequently transferred to command the 31st Fighter Aviation Squadron. From June 1934, he was commander and commissar of the 403rd Fighter Aviation Brigade. On 4 December 1935, after the Red Army created personal military ranks, Pumpur was made a Kombrig. In February 1936, Pumpur became a student at the operational faculty of the Zhukovsky Academy. From October 1936 to May 1937, he served as a Soviet advisor to the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War, under the pseudonym \\"Colonel Julio\\". After arriving in Spain, the initial group of Soviet pilots, which also included Yevgeny Erlykin, Ivan Kopets, and Anton Kovalevsky in addition to Pumpur, flew their first sorties on the obsolete Spanish Republican Nieuport 52s. Pumpur led a fighter group of Soviet pilots in the defense of Madrid, flying 250 hours and downing five enemy aircraft. For his actions he received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 4 July 1937, and upon his return Pumpur was promoted directly to Komkor from Kombrig, skipping the rank of Komdiv. In October, he became commander of the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District, but was soon transferred to lead the Air Forces of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (VVS OKDVA) in November. Pumpur spent several months at the disposal of the chief of the Air Force, and in December 1938 became head of the flight testing station at Aircraft Plant No. 1, later becoming head of the Air Force's Combat Training Directorate. During the Winter War, he led a group of instructors for combat training. From 1940, Pumpur again commanded the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District.  Downfall  Just before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941, Pumpur's downfall began. The inspection commission of the Air Force discovered a large number of significant issues in the aviation units of the Moscow Military District, and Pumpur, the district air force commander, was blamed for them. Among the issues were a lack of combat training and inactivity in organizing airfield construction. For \\"disrupting combat readiness,\\" a 10 May resolution of the Politburo relieved him of command and deprived him of his rank and awards. Pumpur was arrested on 31 May and on 13 February 1942 was sentenced to death, charged with participating in a \\"military conspiracy\\" and \\"wrecking\\". He was shot on 23 February of that year, and rehabilitated on 25 June 1955.

The episode aired on May 15, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.  Plot  At the restaurant where the Salamancas settle accounts with their dealers, Nacho collects weekly payments while Hector observes from the table behind him. Domingo's payment is short, and he promises to make it up the following week. Nacho acquiesces, but Hector prompts him to administer a beating to Domingo as a warning not to be short again. That night Nacho is working in his father's upholstery shop and becomes distracted while thinking about the incident with Domingo, which causes him to accidentally injure himself with a sewing machine. Kim makes her closing argument before the New Mexico Bar Association, and points out that Jimmy has positively contributed to society through his elder law practice and his care of his sick brother. Rebecca tries to see Chuck at his house, but he won't answer the door. The bar association suspends Jimmy's law license for a year, but doesn't permanently disbar him. While Jimmy and Kim celebrate at Wexler-McGill, Rebecca drops by and asks Jimmy to help her get Chuck to let her into his house. Jimmy refuses and when Rebecca says that Jimmy lied to her about wanting her to help Chuck, he says he told the truth about Chuck's health. Rebecca says Jimmy should help because Chuck is his brother and Jimmy says \\"Not anymore, he's not.\\" Rebecca angrily says Chuck was right about Jimmy using her to embarrass Chuck and leaves after bitterly telling Jimmy and Kim to \\"enjoy your champagne\\". Jimmy is unmoved, but Kim appears upset. Mike accompanies Stacey to a church support group, where she talks about how she and Kaylee are dealing with Matt's death. Outside, Stacey tells Mike that she has volunteered him to help build a playground, recounting a story Matt told her about helping Mike pour concrete for his garage. Chuck reluctantly lets Howard into his house. Howard says Chuck should consider Jimmy's suspension a victory and tries to dissuade him from continuing to hound Jimmy, and Chuck seemingly agrees. After Howard leaves, Chuck removes a battery from under his space blanket and he forces himself to continue holding it in an apparent effort to overcome his EHS symptoms. Jimmy and Francesca call his clients to inform them of his one-year \\"sabbatical\\". Realizing he's wasting money if the TV ads for his law firm, for which he's pre-paid, air as scheduled, Jimmy rushes to contact a local TV station to pull his ads off the air. The early cancellation will cost him $4,000 and he needs to find a way to use the remaining long-term time slots he reserved so that he won't incur additional penalties. Jimmy approaches the owners of a carpet store, pitching to shoot a commercial for their business on a cheap budget and broadcast it for free. The owners briefly consider the offer, but balk when Jimmy explains that he has to shoot the commercial right away. When Jimmy informs Joey's film crew of the news, the make-up artist suggests he shoot a commercial for himself, pitching his ability to produce ads for other businesses. Struck with inspiration, Jimmy and the crew drive to the TV station and shoot an impromptu ad in front of nearby antennas and satellite dishes. At the Los Pollos Hermanos farm, a truck arrives to drop off restaurant supplies, after which Victor and Tyrus recover several concealed bricks of cocaine. They lay them out so Nacho and Arturo can choose the Salamancas' portion, but Nacho expects six instead of the agreed-upon five. Victor pulls a gun, but Nacho explains that Hector expects six, so Tyrus calls Gus Fring, who tells Tyrus to give Nacho the sixth kilo. Gus is revealed to be inspecting an industrial laundry facility that is for sale. After walking through the site, he gets into a car driven by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle and tells her that \\"it could work\\". Continuing his effort to defeat the symptoms of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Chuck wears a space blanket as he struggles to walk through downtown Albuquerque. He uses a pay phone to contact his therapist, Dr. Cruz, but is told the doctor is unavailable and he should leave a message. Nacho tells Hector about his encounter with Tyrus and Victor. Hector tells Nacho he plans to use Nacho's father's upholstery shop as a new front business so that the Salamancas won't have to rely on Gus to do their smuggling. Nacho asks Hector to reconsider, telling Hector that his father is a simple man who wants to run an honest business. Hector is outraged to learn that Tuco knifed another inmate leading to Tuco being locked up in a solitary cell, which prompts a coughing fit. He spills some of his prescription capsules before leaving, and after he picks them up Nacho notices that one was inadvertently left behind, which he stands over to hide and later recovers in secret. Jimmy explains to Kim a new business plan for making use of the remaining time he still has reserved on the local TV stations‚Äîa \\"commercial for commercials\\". He intends to offer his services as producer and spokesman in ads for local businesses and shows Kim a videotape of the ad, in which he wears a disguise and uses the name \\"Saul Goodman\\". Kim is taken aback and notes that \\"Saul\\" has \\"a lot of energy\\", to which Jimmy responds that it's \\"just a name\\".  Production  The episode was directed by Keith Gordon and written by Ann Cherkis, who previously wrote the season 2 episode \\"Rebecca\\". Laura Fraser briefly reprises her Breaking Bad role as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, Gus's business associate. In a Q&A; with AMC, Fraser distinguished the Better Call Saul version of Lydia from that of Breaking Bads remarking, \\"She hasn't started unraveling. She feels really secure and confident in her place in the world, and she even experiences moments of happiness and contentment. She's ambitious and enjoying her profession. She still has this air of irritability that betrays her genuine comfort levels, but she hasn't yet started to fray.\\"  Reception  = Ratings = Upon airing, this episode was watched by 1.72 million American viewers and received an 18‚Äì49 rating of 0.6 dipping one tenth from a 0.7 in the previous week.

He fought for the Imperial Russian Army during World War I before going over to the Bolsheviks during the subsequent civil war. He was made a Kombrig (brigade commander) in 1935 and a Komkor (corps commander) in 1937. During Operation Barbarossa, he defended the city of Odessa against the forces of Nazi Germany and Romania. He was a recipient of the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Kutuzov and the Order of Suvorov. Early life and education He was one of seven children of Pavel Stepanovych Sofronov and Pelageya Ivanovna, who were illiterate. In his memoirs, he recalled that they had all lived in a single room, his mother sleeping on a wooden bed, his father on a chest of drawers, someone else on the stove, and the others on the floor. His father and his brother Andrew worked on the railway; the family had a cow, ‚Äúsome small domestic animals,‚Äù and a small potato patch. Sofronov graduated from rural primary school. In 1904, his father was transferred to the Tarusskaya station of the Moscow-Kursk railway, and the family moved there. In 1906 Sofronov graduated from a small railway school in Serpukhov. In his youth he worked as a railway clerk, a maintenance worker, and then, beginning in 1912, an accountant in the Serpukhov municipal government. He began to be active in Marxist circles in 1910, and in 1912 joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), the Bolshevik faction of which later became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1915, he graduated from the Third Moscow School of Ensigns. In 1918-20, he took two courses at the Military Academy of the Red Army, and after taking refresher courses there in 1924 was officially designated a graduate of the Academy. He took further courses there in 1935. Military career =World War I= In the autumn of 1914, he was drafted into the Russian Imperial Army, being placed first in the Moscow Reserve Regiment and then in the 56th Infantry Reserve Battalion. Beginning in February 1915 he fought on the Western front as part of the 2nd Siberian Rifle Regiment of the 1st Siberian Army Corps. After an interval of study, as noted above, at the Third Moscow School of Ensigns, which he attended from July to November 1915, he returned to active duty in early 1916. After serving as a junior officer in the 458th Suzhansky Infantry Regiment in the 6th Army on the Romanian front, he was made a platoon commander in the regiment‚Äôs training team. While in service, he sustained an injury and held the rank of ensign. =Revolution and Civil War= While on the Romanian front, Sofronov was an active participant in the revolutionary events of 1917, leading a Red Guard detachment to Odessa and taking part in the Bolshevik uprising in that city on January 15-18, 1918. It was as a result of that uprising that Soviet power was established in Odessa. In January and February 1918, he was a member of the leadership of the 6th Army, participating in hostilities against Romanian troops in Bessarabia. In March 1918, he went to Moscow where he was active in the 4th Congress of Soviets. Beginning in April 1918, he served in the Red Army on the North-Ural- Siberian Front, acting, in turn, as head of the operations department at the Army‚Äôs headquarters on that front, head of the garrison at Yekaterinburg, and head of the operations department at the 3rd Army headquarters. He was among those who put down the rebellion in the Czechoslovak Corps and participated in the execution of the Russian Royal Family. While pursuing further studies, beginning in 1918, at the Academy of the General Staff of the Red Army, he served as deputy chairman of the party bureau at the academy. In April 1919, after completing one course at the Academy, he returned to the Eastern Front, where he fought against the troops of Admiral A. V. Kolchak. He served in turn as chief of staff of the Vyatka fortified area, as its commandant, then as commander of the 256th Rifle Regiment. He distinguished himself during the capture of the city of Glazov and the crossing of the Kama River. In August 1919, he was transferred to the 7th Army, where he was chief of staff of the 2nd Rifle Brigade of the 2nd Rifle Division, then commander of that brigade. He participated in the defense of Petrograd under the command of General Nikolai Yudenich. In late 1919, he returned to the Academy for further education. Beginning in the summer of 1920, he worked at the headquarters of the 1st Revolutionary Labor Army (Urals), then served in turn as deputy military commissar in Yekaterinburg, as commander of the CHON special brigade, and as chairman of the Army‚Äôs committee for combating desertion. Beginning in January 1921, he served as Assistant Chief of Staff of the Donetsk Labor Army and participated in hostilities against the Makhnovists and various gangs in the Donbas. =Interwar period= During the years between the wars, Sofronov served in a number of military roles. In autumn 1921 he was named the commandant of the Arkhangelsk fortified area, provincial military commissar of Arkhangelsk, and commander of the 52nd Separate Rifle Brigade. In July 1922 he became commander, and in December 1922 became military commissar, of the 17th Rifle Division, serving first in Ryazan and then in Nizhny Novgorod. He then served in turn as commander and military commissar of varus rifle corps, as Assistant Commander of the Volga Military District (1932-35), and as commander of the troops and a member of the military council of the Ural Military District (1937-38). Beginning in July 1938 he was at the disposal of the Office of the Command and the Command Staff of the Red Army; later he became chief of the Directorate of the Higher Military Educational Institutions of the Red Army and first deputy commander of the Baltic Special Military District. On June 6, 1940, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. =World War II= When World War II began, most of the soldiers in the Baltic Special Military District were transformed into the North-Western Front under Sofronov‚Äôs command. On July 26, 1941, he took command of the Separate Coastal Army of the Southern Front, and led the stubborn Defense of Odessa. In early October 1941, Sofronov had a severe myocardial infarction after receiving news of the death of his only son in battle. On October 5 he was taken to hospital in Sevastopol, and then to Kislovodsk. His health problems would prevent him to return to a position as battlefield commander for the rest of the War. Beginning in April 1942, he was Assistant Commander of the Western Front. He was hospitalized again from May to September 1944, then spent the rest of the war as Assistant Commander of the 3rd Byelorussian Front, although his health was poor. =After the war= From 1945-46 he was Deputy Commander of the Baranovichi Military District; from May to October 1946 he was senior lecturer at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy, and thereafter served as head of the Department of the Airborne Forces at that institution. In 1953, he went into the reserves, and during his later years lived in Moscow. He is buried at the Donskoy Cemetery in Moscow.‚ÄúThe Great Patriotic War.‚Äù Dictionary of Military Biography (–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å), 2003.Military Encyclopedia (–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è), 2003; Volume 7, p. 592.The Command Organization of the Red Army in the Years 1940-1941 (–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–Ω—ã–π –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–π —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏ –≤ 1940‚Äî1941), 2005.Sofronov G.P.

The works of other playwrights such as Livius Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius are now lost except for a few lines quoted in other authors. 20 plays of Plautus survive complete, and 6 of Terence. Various metres are used in the plays. As far as is known, the iambic senarii were spoken without music; trochaic septenarii (and also iambic septenarii and trochaic and iambic octonarii)Fortson (2008), p. 22. were chanted or recited (or possibly sung) to the sound of a pair of pipes known as (the equivalent of the Greek aulos), played by a (\\"piper\\"); and other metres were sung, possibly in an operatic style, to the same . In Plautus about 37% of lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii,A.S. Gratwick (1982), in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, vol. 2 part 1, pages 85-86. but in Terence more than half of the verses are senarii. Plautus's plays therefore had a greater amount of musical accompaniment than Terence's. Another difference between the playwrights was that polymetric songs (using metres other than iambic and trochaic) are frequent in Plautus (about 14% of the plays), but hardly used at all by Terence. The different metres lend themselves to different moods: calm, energetic, comic, mocking, high-flown, grandiose, humorous, and so on. Certain metres are also associated with different kinds of characters; for example, old men frequently use the iambic senarius, while the iambic septenarius is often used in scenes when a prostitute is on the stage. The metres A publicly available database by Timothy J. Moore at the Washington University in St. Louis (see External links below) usefully identifies the metre of every line of the two poets (based on the work of Cesare Questa and Wallace Lindsay) and detailed statistics for the use of the various metres. From this database it is apparent that by far the commonest metres are the following two: *Iambic senarii (ia6): 11,170 lines :: x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  *Trochaic septenarii (tr7): 10,019 lines :: ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The following iambic and trochaic lines are less common: *Iambic septenarii (ia7): 1,718 lines :: x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  *Iambic octonarii (ia8): 1,267 lines :: x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  *Trochaic octonarii (tr8): 211 lines :: ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚Äì  The following are found only in Plautus: *Anapaestic septenarii (an7): 216 lines :: u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  *Anapaestic octonarii (an8): 212 lines :: u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  *Anapaestic quaternarii (an4): (at least) 135 lines :: u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  The following are used for songs, and are found mainly in Plautus: *Bacchiac quaternarii (ba4): 375 lines :: x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  *Cretic quaternarii (cr4): 259 lines :: ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  In the above schemata, the symbol \\"‚Äì\\" represents a long element or longum, \\"u\\" a short element or breve, and \\"x\\" an anceps, an element that can be either long or short. Note that the schemata above are the basic patterns, and do not take into account the variations which may occur, for example the substitution of two short syllables for a long one, or vice versa. These are explained in greater detail below. Together, the metres listed above account for all but about 1% of the 27,228 lines of the two poets. These metres are used in different proportions by the two playwrights. In Plautus, 47% of the lines are iambic, 43% trochaic, and 10% in other metres (mostly anapaestic, bacchiac, and cretic). In Terence, 75% of the lines are iambic, 24% trochaic, and only 1% in other metres (bacchiac and cretic). In Plautus, 37% of the lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii, but in Terence 56%. More than 4% of Plautus's lines are anapaestic, but this metre is not used at all in Terence. The trochaic septenarius is much commoner in Plautus (41%) than in Terence (22%). The trochaic octonarius is slightly more frequent in Terence (1.5%) than in Plautus (0.6%). A change of metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or entrance of a character, and thus frames a scene.Moore in Terentius Poeta, p. 95.Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 491. At other times it indicates a change of pace, such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle.Amphitruo 219ff. In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the Heauton Timorumenos, Eunuchus, and Phormio, one of the two young men is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics.Moore in Terentius Poeta, p. 96. Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene. About 15% of Plautus's plays on average consists of polymetric cantica (songs in a mixture of metres).Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 487-8. In these, the most common metres are the bacchius (x ‚Äì ‚Äì ) and cretic (‚Äì x ‚Äì), together with anapaests (u u ‚Äì), but sometimes with other metres mixed in. One play (Miles) has no polymetric cantica, but Casina has four. Because of metrical ambiguities, the analysis of the metres of cantica can be disputed. The ABC metrical pattern It has been noted that in both playwrights, but especially in Plautus, the use of different metres tends to form a pattern, which Moore refers to as the \\"ABC succession\\".Moore, Music, pp. 237-42, 253-8, 305-8, 367-71. Often a play can be divided into sections, which follow the pattern: A = iambic senarii, B = other metres, C = trochaic septenarii. In Plautus's Menaechmi, for example, the first four sections follow the ABC scheme, and only the 5th is different; thus the whole scheme is ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ACBCBC. In his Pseudolus, in the same way, the ABC pattern is used four times, followed by a final scene of 91 lines in other metres, making ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, B. However, not all plays follow this scheme. For example, in Terence's Adelphoe, the pattern is ABCBAB, ABC, BCACB, AC, ABABC. In general it appears that Terence changes mode more frequently than Plautus.Moore, Music, p. 255. Four of Plautus's plays (Cistellaria, Stichus, Epidicus, and Persa) open directly with music, omitting the customary expository speech in unaccompanied iambic senarii.Moore, Music, pp. 243-5. The B-sections of the plays tend to be songs in which the characters express their mood or character, or sing of love. The C-sections (in trochaic septenarii) tend to be associated with advancement of the plot. \\"The beginning of the first long series of trochaic septenarii usually marks a moment at which, after exposition and presentation of character, the plot begins to proceed in earnest.\\" (Moore)Moore, Music, p. 249. When a playwright moves directly from A to C, it often marks urgency or an especially significant moment in the plot.Moore, Music p. 255. Prosody of Plautus and Terence = (iambic shortening)= The prosody and grammar of Plautus and Terence differ slightly from that of later poets such as Virgil and Ovid, and they tend to follow the rhythms of spoken Latin rather than literary rules. One such difference is the phenomenon of or \\"iambic shortening\\", in which an iambic rhythm (u ‚Äì) can change to a pyrrhic (u u). (The literal meaning of is \\"a short syllable which shortens (a following long one)\\".)Article \\"Brevis Brevians\\", Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd edition. Two conditions are necessary for to take place: (a) the long syllable must be unstressed and (b) it must not coincide with a long element in the metre. For example, \\"at my house\\", in its normal pronunciation where p√∫d is accented, will be scanned (u ‚Äì ‚Äì) as expected, but \\"at my house\\" (with emphasis on mƒì) is scanned (u u ‚Äì). In some examples, a stressed syllable immediately follows the iamb: , , , ; in others, the stressed syllable is further away: , , , . As a rule, is commonly found when a long element is resolved into two short ones;de Melo (2007). it is also common in the double short element in an anapaest (u u ‚Äì), as in Less frequently, it is found in the second and third syllables of the sequence u u u ‚Äì, as in or . It cannot be found when the long syllable of the iamb coincides with a long element of the metre, as in (u u ‚Äì) (anapaests) or in (uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì) (iambics). It has been speculated that a condition for is that the first syllable of the sequence u ‚Äì should not have full stress, but that rather, in a phrase such as , the first word must become de-stressed before the can take place.A. M. Devine , Laurence D. Stephens (1980). Review Article: Latin Prosody and Meter: Brevis Brevians. Classical Philology, 75, No. 2, pp. 142-157; p. 157. Although iambic shortening is common in iambo- trochaic metres and anapaests, it is almost never found in cretics or bacchiacs.Moore, Music, pp. 191, 197. =Elision= Elision (the removal or partial removal of a final vowel when the next word starts with a vowel or h) is \\"far more frequent and various in Plautus and Terence than in other Latin verse-writers\\".Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 48. For example, the trochaic septenarii lines which follow: : :Plautus, Amphitruo 263-4. are pronounced approximately as: : :: : ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : uu u uu ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"Aha! there he is about to come here; I will go to meet him, :nor shall I ever allow this man to come here near to this house today.\\" Note that a final syllable ending in -m (such as in or ) will also be elided. Long open monosyllables such as are sometimes totally elided, and sometimes merely shortened.Gratwick, Menaechmi p. 50.Barsby (1999), p. 299. How exactly an elision was pronounced is unknown. It is possible that a short vowel was completely omitted. When a long vowel was involved, however, it is probable that an element of it could still be heard,See discussion in W. Sidney Allen, Vox Latina, 2nd ed. (1978) pp. 78-82. for example in the following line, where complete omission might cause ambiguity:Plautus, Amphitruo 278. : : ‚Äì u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"You are giving an excellent service excellently for the most Excellent; and you will be rewarded well for your gift.\\" Sometimes in Plautus (but not in Terence)Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 54. there can be a hiatus (i.e. no elision) between vowels at the break between the two halves of a verse, that is after the fifth element of a senarius or the 8th element of a septenarius. There can also be brevis in long≈ç at this point. But frequently at the break there is no hiatus but an elision. Elision can also take place when there is a change of speaker in the middle of a line. =Prodelision= Prodelision (the removal of the first vowel of est or es) is also common, for example for and for . =Synizesis= Quite commonly in Plautus the two adjacent vowels in words such as were merged into one syllable by a process known as synizesis. However, if it suited the metre, they could also be kept separate. =Other metrical points= Vowels which later became shortened before -t, -l, or -r retained their length in Plautus, e.g. , etc.Lindsay, Captivi, p. 15. The word was still pronounced .W. de Melo, Amphitryon (etc.), (Loeb Classical Library), introduction, p. lxxxvi. Plautus also made use of alternative forms, such as , when it suited his metre.Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 49. In words ending in -us, such as , the -s could be omitted. Words of the rhythm  u u u x , such as or , appear usually to have been stressed on the first syllable in both poets.Lindsay Captivi p. 367. A mute plus liquid consonant (e.g. tr in ) did not make the previous syllable long in Plautus or Terence. Some words ending in -e, such as could be pronounced before a consonant. The pronoun \\"this man\\", which was later pronounced ,W. Sidney Allen Vox Latina, pp. 64-77. was still pronounced with a single c in Plautus. The combinations and can be pronounced with a short vowel in the first syllable, i.e. either  u u ‚Äì  or  ‚Äì u ‚Äì .Barsby (1999), p. 297. =Verse ictus and accent= There is some controversy among scholars over whether Greek and Latin verse had a regular \\"beat\\" () like modern western music.Denniston, J.D., Article \\"Metre, Greek\\", Oxford Classical Dictionary 2nd ed. p. 680.See also Sturtevant (1929); Beare (1953). On one side, supporting the idea of ictus, are scholars such as W. Sidney Allen,Allen, W.S. Vox Graeca, 2nd ed. (1974) p. 120, 3rd ed. (1987) p. 132. Lionel Pearson,Pearson, Lionel (1990). Aristoxenus: Elementa rhythmica. The fragment of Book II and the additional evidence for Aristoxenean rhythmic theory (Oxford), p. xxxiii. and from an earlier generation E.H. Sturtevant and Wallace Lindsay.Lindsay, Captivi, pp. 861ff. Sturtevant writes: \\"It is scarcely possible any longer to doubt that accent was an important feature of early dramatic verse; the quantitative nature of the measures was carefully preserved, but at the same time accent was constantly taken into account.\\"Sturtevant (1919), p. 244. However, many scholars, such as Paul Maas, Cesare Questa, and Wolfgang de Melo argue that there was no beat or \\"ictus\\"; in their view, rhythm is \\"simply the regulated sequence of short and long syllables\\". Similarly, Benjamin Fortson writes: \\"The theory that there was a verse-ictus, never universally accepted, has by now been thoroughly discredited.\\"Fortson, B. in James Clackson \\"A Companion to the Latin Language\\". Wiley-Blackwell (2011); Fortson (2008), pp. 30-33. Gratwick, in his edition of the Menaechmi, takes an intermediate position, rejecting \\"both the Anglo-German view that the lines are isochronous with a regular metrical beat attached to every longum, and the Franco-Italian view that there is no ictus at all in such verses\\".Groton (1995). One fact which is generally agreed on is that in iambic and trochaic metres, there was usually a fairly strong agreement between where the ictus is assumed to be and the accent of the words. Thus in iambics a word-accent is generally heard on the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th elements of the line: :Plautus Aulularia 1 : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"In case anyone is wondering who I am, let me explain briefly.\\" Whereas in trochaics, the accent is usually heard on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements: :Plautus Amphitruo 459. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"It's happening to me alive what no one will ever do to me when I am dead!\\" Thus even though both lines begin with a series of long syllables, it is immediately obvious on reading them that the first is iambic and second trochaic. Those who argue that there is no ictus say that, given that there is generally a word-break (caesura) after the 5th element of the iambic senarius, the word accents tend to fall naturally on the second and fourth elements rather than on the anceps elements.Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 481. In the final metron, there is often a clash between ictus and accent. Gratwick's view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially at the beginning and end of the line, to avoid monotony. Another question is whether, if there was a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. Not all scholars agree with this, however; Pearson, in his edition of Aristoxenus's treatise on rhythm, argues that it was possible or likely that in an iambic line the length of the syllables was adjusted to make the bars of equal length.Pearson (1990), pp. xli‚Äìxlvi. Another point of interest is whether, if there was a beat, there was one beat per foot or one every metron (group of two feet); and if it was one per metron, on which of the two long elements was it heard? As far as Ancient Greek poetry was concerned, \\"Ancient discussions of the trochaic tetrameter and similar metres repeatedly refer to one per metron\\" (Moore).Moore, Timothy J., Music in Roman Comedy, p. 162. Whether this also applied to Latin, where for example Horace describes the senarius as having six beats per line (),Horace, Ars Poƒìtica 253. is unclear. Should the following trochaic septenarius be read with eight beats, for example? : Or is it better to read it with four beats, as follows? : tƒ´biae, cymbala, and tympanum (mosaic from Pompeii) After examining the evidence Moore comes to the conclusion that in Roman comedy, the pipe-player () \\"provided some emphasis to all strong elements, maintaining the sense of feet, but that the \\"beats\\" on the odd-numbered feet were stronger.\\" Similarly Gratwick, although marking all the ictus-syllabus with sublinear dots, recommends that the 1st, 3rd, and 5th ictus-positions be given a stronger sound when reading a line, unless occupied by a definitely unstressed syllable, in which case the natural word-stress should be preferred.Gratwick Menaechmi, pp. 61-2 Various illustrations from the time of the Roman empire show a wearing a sort of clapper, called a scabellum, on one foot. One such mosaic, showing a accompanying a dancer, is illustrated in Moore's book Music in Roman Comedy.Moore, T.J. Music in Roman Comedy, p. 160; the page is available on the Internet. Cicero mentions the word in connection with a mime performance.Cicero, pro Caelio 65. However, there is no evidence that such a clapper was used to accompany Roman comedies. Gratwick in his edition of the Menaechmi edition, and Barsby in his edition of Terence's Eunuchus, mark the position of the strong element in each foot in the iambo-trochaic metres. It is argued that this can help the reader with syllable division, the recognition of elisions, and division into feet.Barsby, Eunuchus, p. 293. An example is the following iambic septenarius (Terence Phormio 820), where the three elisions (), the (), and the pronunciation of as one syllable by synizesis make the rhythm of the line difficult for the untrained reader unless the ictus is marked: : : ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  :\\"I am happy, however my own situation may be, that things have turned out for my brother as he wishes.\\" But though such markings may help with scansion and the rhythm with which the line should be read, these days it is not generally thought that the accent was heard on those syllables if there was a clash between the ictus and the natural accent of the word.Sonnenschein (1929); Fortson (2012). Where the word accent is at odds with the ictus, it is more natural to follow the accent (just as is the case when reading Virgil).Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 62; Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 481. Occasionally, however, an apparent clash between ictus and accent may indicate the actual pronunciation; for example, it is believed that the phrase \\"my darling\\" was pronounced with the accent on -tƒÅs. Similarly, \\"o wretched me!\\" appears to have been pronounced with the accent on -r≈ç.Lindsay Captivi p. 366. Iambic metres =Iambic senarius= Used for the prologues of plays and for the more serious speeches, the iambic senarius (ia6) is the most common metre in Roman comedyMoore, Music in Roman Comedy, p. 175. and is the only metre which was unaccompanied by music. It is more common in Terence than in Plautus. The Latin line is based on the Greek iambic trimeter, which goes as follows (in the notation used here, ‚Äì is a long syllable, u a short one, and x an anceps, that is, either long or short): : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The Latin equivalent of this is slightly different and has anceps syllables in place of the first and second shorts: : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  However, the various anceps syllables in the line are not equal. Those in the 3rd and 7th positions are long (or double short) in about 60% of lines; those in 1st and 5th positions are long in 80% of lines; and the one in the 9th position is long in 90% of lines.Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 44. Therefore, what was a short syllable in Greek (i.e. positions 3 and 5) is more often than not long in Latin, but less likely to be long than what was an anceps in the Greek line. As well as  ‚Äì ‚Äì  and  u ‚Äì , the group  x ‚Äì  can be replaced by a dactyl  ‚Äì uu  or by an anapaest  uu ‚Äì , except in the last two positions in the line. In the scansions below, a double short syllable replacing a long one is marked \\"uu\\". As a rule, in iambics, the dactyl is much more common than the anapaest, and the reverse is true in trochaics; that is to say, it is much more common for a longum syllable to be replaced by two short syllables than for an anceps to be replaced.Moore, Music, p. 220. The final element of the line is always a single syllable, either long or brevis in longo. In most (but not all) iambic senarius lines there is a word-break or caesura after the fifth element, corresponding to the dieresis in the centre of the trochaic septenarius. However, as can be seen from the examples below, there is usually no break in the sense at this point. The main effect of this break is that the fourth element of the line usually coincides with the word-accent. The iambic senarius is often used for exposition and explaining a situation, for example in the prologue of almost every play, such as Plautus's Amphitruo:Plautus, Amphitruo 97-101. : : : : :  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"This city is Thebes. In that house lives :Amphitruo, born in Argos from an Argive father, :with whom Alcmena is married, daughter of Electer (Electryon). :This Amphitruo is now in command of the legions, :for the Theban people are having a war with the Teleboans.\\" The iambic senarius is also used for dialogue, especially when old men are speaking (6235 out of 7659 lines spoken by old men, that is more than 80% of their dialogue, are in this metre).Moore, Meters of Roman Comedy database. An example is the following extract from Terence's Andria (35-39) spoken by the old man Simo to his freedman Sosia: : : : : :  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì   u uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"After I bought you, how from childhood onwards :your servitude with me was always just and mild, :you know. From a slave I made you to be my freedman, :because you used to serve me generously. :I paid the highest price which I had for you.\\" Meyer's law Very frequently in a senarius, there will be a caesura (word-break) after the 5th element. Because Latin words are accented on the penultimate syllable if this is long, this will automatically put a stress on the 4th element. Occasionally, however, a non-monosyllabic word with unstressed final syllable will end a metron, like in the line below. If so, by a rule called \\"Meyer's Law\\",Gratwick Menaechmi, p. 56. the preceding anceps will usually be a short syllable. The effect of this rule is that the 3rd element of the metron is usually either stressed or long, but not both. In this way the basic  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  rhythm of the Ancient Greek iambic trimeter remains clear: :Terence, Andria 76. : ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"But after a lover approached promising money...\\" Sometimes, however, it seems that the poet will deliberately break Meyer's Law in the second metron to express a strong emotion, as in the word \\"very greatly\\" in the following line, where the strong stress as well as the unexpected length on the normally weak 3rd position serve to emphasise the word:Gratwick in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, vol 2 part 1, pp 91. :Terence, Hecyra 490; translation by Gratwick. : u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"I love and praise and oh, so badly miss her!\\" It is common for violations of Meyer's law in the second metron to be followed by a four-syllable word (like above)Gratwick in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, vol. 2 part 1, pp. 90-91. or a monosyllable plus three-syllable (such as sƒ´ dƒ´ÃÅxerit);Traill (2009); Fortson, p. 68. so that even though there is a clash between ictus and accent in the second metron, coincidence is restored in the third.cf. Fortson, p. 71. Similarly in the line quoted below, the long word , with its coincidence of ictus and accent, filling the third metron, makes up for the fact that the word-accent of clashes with the ictus: :Plautus Amphitruo 100. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"that Amphitruo is now in command of the legions\\" When Meyer's law is violated in the first metron, the following element is usually a monosyllable, maintaining the usual caesura:Fortson p. 54. :Plautus Bacchides 224. : uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"Let him come whenever he wants, so I don't have to wait.\\" Luchs' law Another law affecting the iambic senarius is \\"Luchs' Law\\", sometimes known as \\"Bentley-Luchs' Law\\". This states that when an unstressed word-end coincides with the second element of the last metron, as with below, the first element should normally be long (or double short), not short:For exceptions see Fortson (2008), pp. 37ff. :Plautus Amphitruo 28. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"born from a human mother and a human father\\" It is argued that the rationale behind this law is that an iambic word at the beginning of the third metron might give the false impression that the line had come to an end. The rule inevitably means that the word-accent will be heard on the first element of the metron (i.e. contrary to the presumed ictus); but apparently in the last metron rhythmical considerations were more important than stress. This law does not apply to the first metron of a line,Gratwick in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, vol. 2, part 1, p. 90. so in the following line, the word pƒÉter, which breaks the rule, is acceptable: :Plautus Amphitruo 131. : u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"At the moment Father is inside spending his time as he wishes.\\" The situation rarely arises in the second metron, because most lines have a caesura (word-break) after the fifth element. Locus Jacobsohnianus When there is a word-break between the second and third metron of a senarius there is sometimes a hiatus (lack of elision) at this point. This is known as a locus Jacobsohnianus, for example:Laidlaw (1936).Traill (2009). :  Plautus Miles 45. : uu ‚Äì u uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :PYR. By the god Pollux, you have a good memory! ART. It's the dinners which prompt it! Sometimes there is even a brevis in longo (short syllable standing for a long one), as if it were the end of a line, even when there is no break in sense: :  Plautus, Miles 27. : ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u x  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :PYR. What, its arm? ART. I meant to say thigh. A locus Jacobsohnianus is also sometimes found in trochaic septenarii five elements before the end of the line. Usually, just as with a real line end, the element immediately preceding the locus Jacobsohnianus is short.Fortson, pp. 76-8. =Iambic septenarius= : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  The character of this metre is different from the iambic senarius or trochaic septenarius. In Plautus there almost always a break (diaeresis) in the middle of the line. Unless the diaeresis (central break) is omitted, then by Meyer's law there is always a short syllable in the penultimate place before the break. At the end of the line there is always a stress on the penultimate element. Although not so frequent as the senarius, the iambic septenarius (ia7) is also reasonably common in Roman comedy. Certain characters and plays use this metre more than others; in Plautus' Pseudolus, for example, there are only ten lines of iambic septenarius, occurring in sections of one or two lines; but in Rudens there are 204 lines, in Miles Gloriosus 211, and in Asinaria 322. In Amphitruo this metre does not occur at all. The iambic septenarius is sometimes known as the \\"laughing metre\\".J.F. Mountford, article \\"Metre, Latin\\", The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd edition, p. 684. A typical use is the light-hearted banter of the two cunning slaves, Leonida and Libanus, in Plautus's Aulularia, when ribbing each other. Here Leonida speaks:Plautus, Asinaria, 556-565 : : : : : : : :  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ia7  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì   uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì   uu uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  :\\"By Pollux, you could not praise your own virtues :as well as I could, all those things which at home or in war you've done wrong! :Indeed, by Pollux, there are a lot of things that can be mentioned to your credit: :when you defrauded those who trusted you, when you were unfaithful to your master, :when you deliberately perjured yourself with invented words, :when you made holes in walls, when you were caught stealing, :and all the times you pleaded your case when hanging in front of eight :burly bold men, sturdy whippers!\\" In Terence this metre is often used by love-struck young men, as in the following exchange (Heautontimorumenos 679-89) between the young man Clinia and the cunning slave, Syrus: : : : : : : : : : : :  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ia7  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u uu u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì   uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì ‚Äì   u ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  :CLI.

How could I not? I was there with you. :CLI. Have you ever heard anything turn out so well for anyone? SYR. No, no one! :CLI. And so may the gods love me, I am now delighted not so much for my own sake :as for hers, whom I know to be worthy of any honour. :SYR. I am sure you‚Äôre right. But now, Clinia, listen to me in turn; :for we must do something about your friend‚Äôs situation too to make sure it is secure. In Plautus, there is usually a clean break between the two halves of the line, and this is often true of Terence too. However, sometimes Terence smooths over the break with an elision, or even omits the break altogether.Moore, Music, p. 184. =Iambic octonarius=  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì   x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The iambic octonarius has two kinds, one with a break in the middle of the line, as the first pattern above. But often, instead of a mid-line break, there is a caesura or word-break 7 elements before the end of the line, so that apart from the extra syllable at the beginning, this kind somewhat resembles a trochaic septenarius. When the break is in the middle of the line, there may be brevis in longo (a short syllable standing for a long element) at that point, as in the word ingerƒï in the first of the two lines below: : :Plautus, Pseudolus, 157-8; cf Moore, Music, p. 313.  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia8  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"You who have the jar, bring in some water; make sure the pot is full for the cook; :you with the axe I'm putting in charge of the wood-cutting province.\\" Often the iambic octonarius and the trochaic septenarius are mixed in the same passage, although the trochaic septenarius, being shorter, is a faster metre and is often associated with onward movement of the plot.Moore, Music, pp. 355-363. The iambic octonarius is used more often by Terence (885 lines) than by Plautus (382 lines). In Terence's Eunuchus, this metre is particularly associated with one of the two brothers, Chaerea, who has 88 lines in this metre. The following passage from Terence's Adelphoe (\\"The Brothers\\") is sung by another of two brothers, Ctesipho, as he enters the stage:Terence, Adelphoe 254ff. : : : : : :  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu uu ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia8  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì   uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"From any man, when there's a need, you would be glad to receive a favour, :but in truth what is really nice is if someone does one who ought to do it. :O brother, brother, how can I praise you enough? One thing I know for sure, :I shall never be able to speak highly enough of your virtue. :And so I think I have this one thing above all more than anyone else, :that no man has a brother more endowed with the highest qualities!\\" The iambic octonarius apparently was often used in Roman tragedy for messenger speeches,Moore, Music, p. 183 and in Plautus it is often used by slave messengers, as in this account of the aftermath of a battle in Plautus's Amphitruo (256-261) sung by the slave Sosia. In this style the lines run smoothly on, without any central dieresis: : : : : : :  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia8  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u uu  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"The next day into our camp from the city the chiefs came to us weeping; :with veiled hands they begged us to forgive their wrong-doing, :and they surrendered themselves, and all divine and human things, the city and their children :all for jurisdiction and judgment to the Theban people. :Afterwards on account of his courage my master Amphitruo was given a gold cup, :with which King Pterela used to drink. This is what I shall tell the mistress.\\" Trochaic metres =Trochaic septenarius= : ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The second most common metre in Roman comedy in terms of lines (or the commonest, in terms of the number of words) is the trochaic septenarius (tr7). Like the other long iambic and trochaic lines, it is believed to have been chanted to the music of the tibiae (double pipes). There is usually a diaeresis in the centre of the line, and there may sometimes also be a hiatus (lack of elision) or brevis in longo (a short syllable made long by position) at this point. Trochaic lines generally start with a word which is stressed on the first syllable, making it clear that the line has a trochaic not an iambic rhythm. According to an ancient metrical theory, the Greek version of this metre (trochaic tetrameter catalectic) was composed of an iambic trimeter with a cretic foot (‚Äì u ‚Äì) added at the beginning. This seems to be true of the Latin trochaic septenarius too: the word break (dieresis or caesura) is in the same place seven elements before the end of the line, and Meyer's law and the locus Jacobsohnianus apply in the same way to both lines.Fontaine & Scafuro (eds), p. 486. In the following passage the god Mercury, disguised as the slave Sosia, is preventing the real Sosia from entering his own house: : : : : : : : :  uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì uu ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   uu u uu u  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :MER. This man isn't sane! SOS. The fault that you are preaching about me is yours! :What, dammit, aren't I Amphitruo's slave Sosia? :Didn't our ship come here last night from the Persian port, :which brought me? Didn't my master send me here? :Am I not now standing in front of our house? Isn't there a lantern in my hand? :Am I not talking? Am I not awake? Didn't this man just punch me with his fists? :He did, by Hercules! Since my wretched jaw is still aching! :So what am I waiting for? Why don't I just go into our house? In the centre of the trochaic septenarius line (corresponding to the caesura in the iambic senarius) there is usually a word-break, and in Plautus (though not in Terence) there is sometimes a hiatus (lack of elision) at this point, as in the second line below: : :  Plautus, Menaechmi, 858-59  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :I'll do what you order; I'll get a two-bladed axe and I'll hack off :this old man's meat as far as his bones and chop his guts to pieces. However, there is frequently an elision at this point, and just as in the Greek equivalent of this metre, (the trochaic tetrameter catalectic), some lines have no word- break at the centre point, for example the first and third below:Plautus Amphitruo 267-9. : : : : uu ‚Äì ‚Äì u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : uu u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì u  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :It is fitting that I should have actions and character similar to this man's, :and so I ought to be wicked, cunning, very astute, :and drive him from the doors with his own weapon, malice! The same tendencies which apply to the alternating anceps syllables in an iambic senarius also apply in a similar way to a trochaic septenarius, namely that those elements that are always short in Greek (the 1st, 3rd, and 5th anceps syllables) are long in about 60% of lines; while those which are anceps in Greek (namely the 2nd, 4th and 6th anceps in the trochaic septenarius) are long in about 80% to 90% of lines. Meyer's Law and Luchs' Law also operate in the same places, counting from the end of the line backwards, as in the senarius. =Trochaic octonarius= : ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì x  ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚Äì  Much less frequent is the trochaic octonarius (tr8), which is found in both poets. It is mostly very sporadically used with just a line or two here or there in the midst of other metres. The following four-line stretch comes from Plautus' Pseudolus (161-164), where a pimp is giving instructions to three slave-girls: : : : : : uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì u  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  :\\"You, I'm instructing that the house should be sparkling clean. You've been told what to do; hurry up, go inside. :You, be couch-strewer. You, clean the silver and also set it out. :When I come back from the forum, make sure I find everything ready, :and that everything is turned, sprinkled, dusted, strewn, washed, and polished!\\" In the above quotation there is a contrast between the anapaestic first two lines, where the double short syllables suggest bustle and hurry, and the last two lines, where the repeated trochaic rhythm emphasises how everything has got to be when it is ready. Sometimes both in this metre and in the trochaic septenarius the verses split into four equal parts (the so-called \\"square\\" verse), as in the last line above.Gratwick Menaechmi, p. 42. In Terence lines of trochaic octonarii (interspersed with trochaic septenarii) tend to occur in clusters at moments of great emotional intensity, such as at Hecyra 516-34.Moore, Music, pp. 179-80. A common pattern in both poets, but especially in Terence, is for trochaic octonarii to be followed first by one or two lines of trochaic septenarii, then by one or more iambic octonarii. This tr8-tr7-ia8 pattern occurs 48 times in Terence, and 6 times in Plautus.Moore, Music, p. 211. Mixed iambo-trochaic lines In the examples seen so far the same metre is used for several lines at a time; but a glance at Moore's database shows that iambic and trochaic lines are often mixed together, as in the passage below from Terence's Phormio (485-492), which Moore discusses in an article.Moore (2012b), pp. 221-3. In these lines the young man Phaedria pleads with the slave-owner Dorio for more time to raise the money to buy his girlfriend; Phaedria's cousin Antipho and the slave Geta secretly listen in on the conversation. Here the iambic octonarius and iambic senarius are used when Dorio is denying Phaedria's request. When he seems willing to listen and the plot seems to be moving forward, the trochaic septenarius is used. The aside by the eavesdropping Antipho and his slave Geta (between dashes below) is in the distinctive iambic septenarius. It is possible that in the line with ia6 the music stopped altogether for a few moments: : : : :  : : : :  ‚Äì u ‚Äì   ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia8  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  tr7  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  tr7  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  tr7  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia6  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì uu uu  u uu ‚Äì  ia7  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ia8 :PH.

Don't you believe me yet? DO. You're raving! PH. But if I give a pledge? DO. Nonsense! Anapaestic metres Anapaestic metres are used frequently by Plautus (about 4.5% of all his lines), but are not found in Terence. They are based on the foot  u u ‚Äì ; two feet make a metron or \\"dipody\\". The frequent substitution of dactyls (‚Äì u u) or spondees (‚Äì ‚Äì) for anapaests (u u ‚Äì), and the frequent use of brevis breviƒÅns and synizesis are typical of anapaestic metres. Anapaestic lines are usually based on the dimeter or quaternarius, that is a length of two metra, or four feet. According to the ancient grammarian Marius Victorinus, it is characteristic of anapaestic poetry that there is usually a word-break at the end of every metron or dipody; in Seneca's plays this is always the case.Danckaert, p. 2, p. 40. In Plautus it is mostly true, but there are exceptions.Danckaert, p. 26. In Greek anapaestic poetry it is generally assumed that the verse-ictus was heard on the second half of the foot. However, in Plautus, except in the second half of the anapaestic septenarius, the word-stress generally comes on the first half of each foot. For those scholars who believe there was no ictus in ancient poetry, this presents no problem; the fact that each metron usually ends with a word-break automatically means that the stress will be heard on the early part of the feet. But for those that support the idea of ictus, it does present a problem. As LindsayLindsay, Captivi, 76-78. puts it, \\"It seems difficult to believe that the same poet, who in other metres so successfully reconciles accent with ictus, should tolerate lines like: :Trin. 239: blandiloquentulus, harpag≈è, mendƒÅx, :Bacch. 1088: stultƒ´, stolidƒ´, fatuƒ´, fungƒ´, bardƒ´, blennƒ´, bucc≈çnƒìs, :Pers. 753: hostibus victƒ´s, cƒ´vibus salvƒ´s, etc.\\" Other Roman writers who wrote anapaests, such as Seneca and Boethius, also regularly placed the word-accent on the beginning of each foot.Examples in Danckaert (2013). Whether Roman poets wrote anapaests without regard for ictus, or whether the Roman anapaest differed from the Greek in that the ictus came on the beginning of each foot, as in the trochaic metre, is unclear. For this reason, the ictus has not been marked in the samples below. Some half lines (such as  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ) are identical in the trochaic and the anapaestic metres; and the tendency to form \\"square\\" verses is another point in common with the trochaic metre. =Anapaestic septenarius= This metre is used only by Plautus. It is a catalectic metre in which the last foot is shortened to a single long element. The basic scheme is theoretically: : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  The anapaestic foot  u u ‚Äì  is frequently replaced by a spondee  ‚Äì ‚Äì  or a dactyl  ‚Äì u u . In the first half of the line, as in the anapaestic octonarius, the word-accent generally comes on the beginning of each foot. However, in the second half the stress tends to swing the other way, with the accent on the second half of each foot. Apart from a long stretch of 82 lines in Miles Gloriosus, this metre is usually used sparingly, often with just a line or two mixed with other anapaestic metres. Frequently those who speak in this metre are old men or women. Here is a passage from the Bacchides (1160‚Äì65) where two old men, Nicobulus and Philoxenus, are talking: : : : () : : : : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u u u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  :NIC. \\"But what's the problem? Even though I myself think I already know full well what it is, :all the same I'm keen to hear it from you. PHIL. D'you see this girl? NIC. I do. PHIL. She's not a bad woman. :NIC. By Pollux, she is a bad one, and you're worthless! PHIL. In short, I'm in love. NIC. You're in love? PHIL. I am indeed. :NIC. You disgusting man, how dare you become a lover at your age! PHIL. Why not? :NIC. Because it's a scandal! PHIL. What need for words? I'm not angry with my son, :and it's not fair that you should be angry with yours. If they're in love, they are doing wisely.\\" Concerning the longest passage of anapaestic septenarii (Miles Gloriosus 1011-93), Moore notes the close resemblance between the metre in this passage and trochaic septenarii.Moore, Music p. 202. The German classicist Marcus Deufert notes that the style of writing in these lines is different from the usual anapaests, in that it is more regular and there are more long syllables. He draws the conclusion that the lines from Miles Gloriosus were recited in the same way as trochaic septenarii, while other anapaestic passages (which usually contain an admixture of other metres) were sung.Fontaine & Scafuro (eds), p. 487. =Anapaestic octonarius= : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  Again, substitution of dactyl  ‚Äì u u  or spondee  ‚Äì ‚Äì  for anapaest  u u ‚Äì  is very common. As in a trochaic line, the word-accent comes regularly on the first syllable of each foot, and unlike in the septenarius, this is true of both halves of the line. In the following extract from Plautus's Pseudolus (133-7), the pimp Ballio summons his slaves outside to give them instructions to prepare the house for his birthday: : : : : : : ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : uu uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : uu uu ‚Äì uu  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  :\\"Come out, come on, come out, you lazy ones, worthless to own and a waste of money to buy, :To none of whom does it ever come into their mind to do the right thing; :and whom, unless I try this example (uses whip), it's impossible to get any work from them. :I've never seen any men more like donkeys, their ribs are so calloused with blows! :If you hit them you do yourself more harm than them, they're such whip-wearers-out by nature!\\" After these five lines of anapaests, Ballio reverts to a mixture of trochaic and iambic lines for the rest of his speech. The ictus marks above are placed in accordance with the word-accents, rather than on the second half of each foot as is sometimes done. =Anapaestic systems= Anapaestic metra are often used in a long series or \\"system\\" where the division into lines is not always clear and may sometimes differ in different manuscript copies.Lindsay, Captivi, p. 62. Usually, however, the metra come in pairs, and in Plautus there is usually a word break at the end of the pair, but not always in the middle. An example is the following from the Bacchides, where the old man Philobulus comes on stage and sings as follows (the first two lines are anapaestic septenarii):Plautus Bacchides 1087ff : : : : : : : : : : : : : ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  :Of all that there are anywhere, ever have been, and ever will be in future :stupid people, idiots, nitwits, blockheads, fools, nincompoops and dolts, :I alone surpass them all by a long way :in stupidity and uneducated behaviour. :I'm done for! I'm ashamed! At my age :to have been twice made a fool of so unworthily! :The more I think about it, the more I'm furious :about the confusion my son has caused! :I'm lost! I'm torn up by the root, :I'm tortured in every possible way! :Every evil is catching up with me, :I've died by every kind of death! Since the short lines above come in couplets, some editors such as Lindsay (Oxford Classical Text) write them as single long lines of octonarii or septenarii. Bacchiac and cretic metres The bacchiac (x ‚Äì ‚Äì) and cretic (‚Äì x ‚Äì) metres (together with anapaests) are used in polymetric cantica (songs).Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 488. They are mostly found in Plautus and are rare in Terence, who has only 4 lines of bacchiacs (Andria 481-84) and 15 of cretics (Andria 625-38, Adelphi 610-17).Moore in Terentius Poeta, p. 93-95. According to Eduard Fraenkel these two metres are \\"incomparably suited to the Latin language\\".Fraenkel, E. Plautine Elements in Plautus, p. 233. They differ from anapaests in that popular pronunciations such as brevis breviƒÅns and synizesis are avoided. A law called Spengel and Meyer's law (similar to Meyer's law in the iambic senarius) applies to bacchiacs and cretics, namely that a polysyllabic word may not end on the 5th or 11th element of a bacchiac or on the 3rd or 9th element of a cretic unless the preceding anceps is short. To put it more simply, the elements marked x in bold in the patterns below cannot be both long and stressed: : x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  (bacchiac) : ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  (cretic) In bacchiacs the word-accent quite often comes after the short syllable (: u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì), rather than before it, as it tends to with cretics (: ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì); some editors, therefore, mark these elements as an ictus. =Bacchiac quaternarius= : x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  The bacchiac quaternarius (ba4) is the commonest bacchiac metre. The usual form of the foot is  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  or  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì , but variations such as  u ‚Äì uu  and  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  are also found. Sometimes other similar metres are mixed in. There is generally no word break (diaeresis) in the middle of the line. The bacchiac is used both for humorous songs and for tragic. In the following passage from the Bacchides the prostitute Bacchis and her sister mock the two old men Philoxenus and Nicobulus who have knocked on their door, calling them \\"sheep\\":Plautus, Bacchides, 1130-1141 : : : : : : : : : : : : : u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì uu  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  :SISTER. By Castor, I think they're perfectly harmless. :PHIL. (aside) We deserve this, since we have come here! :BACCHIS. Let them be driven inside. SIS. I don't know what use that would be, :since they have neither milk nor wool. Let them stand outside. :They've paid all they were worth. All their fruit :has already fallen from them. Don't you see how, they're straggling :and walking about freely :on their own? No, I think they're silent because of their age; :they don't even bleat, even though they're away from the rest of the flock! :They seem stupid and not bad! :SIS. Let's go back inside, sister. ‚Äì NIC. Wait right there, :both of you! These sheep want you! The tenth and twelfth lines above illustrate the \\"syncopated\\" bacchiac rhythm, where one syllable is omitted from the foot. When this happens, there is generally a word-break after the syncopated foot.Fontaine & Scafuro, p. 488 note. =Bacchiac senarius= Bacchiac rhythms can also be used for serious, contemplative songs, such as Alcumena's lament on the sudden departure of her husband in Plautus's Amphitruo 633ff, which begins: : : : : : u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì (u) uu ‚Äì  ba4 + reiz : uu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  :Is it not the case that the amount of pleasure in life and in leading our existence is small :in comparison to what is disagreeable? So it has been allotted in each person's life. :So it has pleased the gods, that sadness should follow pleasure as her companion; :On the contrary, that more unpleasantness and evil should immediately follow, if anything nice happens. In the above quotation there is always a word-break at the end of each metron, so that there is usually a word-stress on the penultimate element of each metron. This particular metre (the bacchiac senarius) is very rare, occurring only in this passage. Note that the words in aetƒÅt(e) hominum are analysed by Questa as a colon reizianum, rather than a bacchiac with a hiatus after aetate. =Cretic quaternarius= : ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The cretic metre consists of feet usually of the form  ‚Äì x ‚Äì , although occasionally  uu u ‚Äì  or  ‚Äì u uu  can be found. Occasionally, as in lines 5 and 6 of the extract below, feet of other metres are mixed in, such as trochaic. In the quaternarius, there is usually a diaeresis (break) in the middle of the line, although elision may also be found at this point. The cretic metre seems to have a more epic or tragic quality than the bacchiac. In the following passage, after a long description of preparations for a battle in stately iambic octonarii, the slave Sosia suddenly breaks into cretic quaternarii to describe the excitement of the battle itself (Amphitruo 219-247). The cretic passage begins as follows (note that the fourth and fifth lines contain trochaic elements): : : : : (tr7) : (cr2+tr2) : : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : uu ‚Äì ‚Äì u  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  uu ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  (tr7) : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  (cr2 + tr2) : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  A line with both resolutions (uu u ‚Äì and ‚Äì u uu) is Amphitruo 235: : : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u uu  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"Finally, as we wanted, our army is winning.\\" The same metre was also used in Roman tragedies, as in the following quotation from Ennius's Andromacha, cited more than once by Cicero:Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 3.44 : : : : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"What protection am I to seek or request? What help :may I depend on now in my exile or flight? :I am deprived of citadel and city. Who am I to approach? To whom may have recourse?\\"Translation from E. Fraenkel, Plautine Elements in Plautus, p. 232. The above tragic aria was presumably sung at a slow tempo. At other times, however, the cretic metre indicates a faster tempo than the iambics it follows, as with the battle description above, or the scene discussed by Moore (p. 332) from Plautus's Pseudolus 920ff, where Pseudolus tries to get Simia to speed up his walking, by changing from iambics to cretics: : : ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :P. Walk quickly therefore. S. No, I want to go at a leisurely pace! Two lines later Simio changes the metre back into iambics to slow the pace: : : ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :S. Why are you hurrying? Slowly, don't be afraid! =Thymelicus= Sometimes a cretic dimeter is followed by a rhythm  ‚Äì u u u ‚Äì , known as a thymelicus, almost always to \\"comic effect\\",Moore Music, p. 209. as with the following line from Plautus's Mostellaria:Plautus, Mostellaria 693; cf. 696, 702, 706. : : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u u ‚Äì  :Now she wants me to go to bed with her ‚Äì no way! Other metres The following metres used mainly by Plautus may also be mentioned. =Colon reizianum= The colon reizianum, named after the 18th-century classicist Friedrich Reiz // (1733‚Äì90) of Leipzig University, is a short piece of iambic metre of the following form: : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚Äì  The first anceps is almost always long; any of the first four elements (especially the first and third) can be replaced by two short syllables. Sometimes the colon reizianum is used on its own (e.g. Casina 721-28), but more often as the second half of a line in another metre, especially the versus reizianus (see below).Moore, Music, pp. 203-5. =Versus reizianus= The versus reizianus (reiz) consists of an iambic quaternarius followed by a colon reizianum.Moore, Music, p. 204. But the iambic dimeter is unusual in that it often begins with a double short syllable, which gives it a certain vigour: : _uu_ ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚Äì  Usually the versus reizianus is used singly or as a couplet in the midst of other metres, but there is one long stretch of 32 lines in Aulularia (415-446) entirely in this metre. In the following extract, the miserly old man Euclio has just chased the hired cook Congrio out of his house: :EVC. Redi. qu√≥ fug√≠s nunc? t√©nƒï, ten√©. / CON. Quid, st√≥lide, cl√°mas? :EVC.

The thing itself is witness! :I've been so beaten by your sticks that I'm softer than a poofter! =Wilamowitzianus= The wilamowitzianus (wil), named after the German classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, is a short line of the following shape, ending in a choriamb (note that the two anceps syllables are never both short): : ‚Äì x x ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  It is used in about 51 lines of Plautus and 5 of Terence, as in the following exchange from Bacchides between the two young men Pistoclerus and Mnesilochus:Plautus Bacchides, 625-8. :PIS. Mnesiloche, quid fit? MN. Perii! :PIS. Di melius faciant. MN. Perii! :PIS. Non tacƒïs, insipiens? MN. Taceam? :PIS. Sanu(s) satis non es. MN. Perii! :multa mala m(i) in pectore nunc / acr(ia) atqu(e) acerb(a) eveniunt. :criminin m(e) habuisse fidem? / immerito tib(i) ƒ≠ratu(s) fui. : ‚Äì uu u ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì uu ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì uu ‚Äì  :PIS. Mnesilochus, what's the matter? MN. I'm done for! :PIS. May the gods make it better. MN I'm done for! :PIS. Won't you be quiet, you fool? MN. Be quiet? :PIS. You're not right in the head. MN. I'm done for! :There are so many harsh and bitter evils now arising in my heart! :That I could have trusted that accusation! I was angry with you for no reason! Sometimes a wilamowitzianus is followed by a colon (part line) in cretic metre, as the following exchange between the fisherman Gripus and the slave Trachalio in Plautus's Rudens:Plautus Rudens 951-2; cf. Moore, Music, p. 206. :GRI. si fidem modo das mihi te / non for(e) infidum :TRA. do fidem tibi, fidus ero / quisquis es.

In 2015 Viennafair The New Contemporary moved to a new location. It changed its name to Viennacontemporary and took place in Marx Halle, Vienna). Dmitriy Aksenov's idea to develop society using cultural instruments was the basis of his conception of RDI Group's cultural centres. Projects based on the participatory planning approach are being implemented in each of the residential estate projects being built by RDI, developing cultural programmes and urban communities for the territories. Thanks to the work of RDI Creative a \\"third place\\" with high-quality content is being created for the residents, who are provided with opportunities in the field of culture irrespective of location or income. They can each share the cultural achievements and at the same time learn from the cultural experience of the other communities. For example, in April 2015 the New-Molokovo (Moscow region) residential estate cultural centre was opened, as were the Out-Of-Town Quarter and the Southern Vidnoe residential estate cultural centres in March 2016 and June 2016 respectively. In April 2013 Dmitriy Aksenov was awarded with the prestigious Personal Contribution annual award of The Art Newspaper Russia for developing the Viennacontemporary arts fair VIENNAFAIR.

He served as a curator at, and later the director of, the Romano-Germanic Central Museum. His 1973 work Sp√§tr√∂mische Gardehelme laid bare the relationship between the late Roman ridge helmets and the later Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon crested helmets. Early life and education Hans Klumbach was born on 26 April 1904 in Wolfach, in the German district of Ortenaukreis. He grew up in Stuttgart, where he attended the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium. From 1922 until 1927, when he obtained a Ph.D. under the supervision of Carl Watzinger, Klumbach studied at the University of T√ºbingen and Heidelberg University. After leaving school Klumbach embarked on a travel scholarship awarded by the German Archaeological Institute, after which he worked as a scientific assistant for the institute in Rome and Athens. Klumbach served in the military from 1940 to 1947 including during World War II, for part of which time he was imprisoned. Career The Berkasovo I helmet, one of the late Roman ridge helmets surveyed by Klumbach In 1950 Klumbach became a curator at the Romano-Germanic Central Museum in Mainz, and in 1954 he became its director; in 1952 he was also made an honorary professor for Roman-Germanic Archaeology at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Klumbach was considered an expert on Roman helmets. In 1957 he published the fragments of one such helmet discovered in Faurndau and supervised their conservation, and subsequently he did the same for helmets unearthed in Bad Cannstatt, Welzheim, and Aalen. Sp√§tr√∂mische Gardehelme, his resulting 1973 work, surveyed the newly restored group of late Roman ridge helmets from the fourth and fifth century AD, fitting them into a typology between the helmets of the early Roman Empire and the early medieval Spangenhelme.

The south transept is little changed from the original form. The five-light east window is of the 14th century. In the 15th century the upper part of the tower was built, and the clerestory was added. A lady chapel, with a parapet, was built on the south side of the chancel about 1500. More recently, the porch for the south doorway, designed by Charles Lynam, was built in 1893. The north vestry, designed by Horsley, Huber and Associates of Stafford, was built in the 1990.

The building, built in 1971, sits on close to an acre of Bayfront property with 150 feet of waterfront. The OKO Group plans to build a 47-story luxury condo building on the site. In October 2016, it was announced that Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture would design the condo tower, the firm's first project in Miami. In July 2016, the firm announced a residential development of a 649-foot, 57-story tower, Missoni Baia, located at 700 Northeast 26th Terrace.

Running in a north-south direction, it forms part of the longer B4087 which runs from the A445 in Leamington to the B4086 in Wellesbourne. The road is the central shopping hub of the town, and upon it sit many of the town‚Äôs high street stores, as well as some of the best examples of Regency architecture, for which the town is known. It is often erroneously called \\"The Parade\\", and spoken of as such, but all maps and resources such as the Royal Mail's postcode database simply have \\"Parade\\". History The upper section of Parade Until the first part of the 19th century Leamington Priors, as the town was then known, was a small village, of equal size with the nearby village of Lillington. The southern part of what is now Parade was part of Lillington Lane which connected the two settlements. Between 1808 and 1860 Leamington developed rapidly northwards away from its village origins meaning Lillington Lane was extended to the length of the current Parade and named \\"Lower Union Parade\\", \\"Upper Union Parade\\" and \\"Lansdowne Place\\" in sections from south to north. In 1860 the street took on its current name. The name Parade itself came partly from the fact that so many of the facilities that made Leamington as a spa town famous lined the street. The Royal Pump Rooms were opened in 1814, the Regent Hotel in 1818 and the Jephson Gardens in 1834. Most of the fashionable housing in the town was found north of the river as well as the main library and the theatre. Later Victorian buildings of note include an obelisk/drinking fountain dedicated to local politician and philanthropist Henry Bright (1880)Nicholson, Jean et al: The Obelisks of Warwickshire, page 45. Brewin Books, 2013 and the large Town Hall with tower (1884). In 1988 the towns main shopping precinct, the Royal Priors Shopping Centre, opened. For a short period of time there was a second precinct, the Regency Arcade, but this is now closed and has been converted into a shop and hotel. Misconceptions Many visitors would assume that the continuation of Parade on the south side of the River Leam is part of the same street. However it is named Bath Street and was never part of it. Also, although many people would term Parade the town's high street, High Street itself is the major road of the original village, found south of and parallel to the river. Today it is still a major through road for traffic and part of the A425.

Due to some of the astounding properties inherent to quantum computation, notably entanglement and parallelism, it is anticipated that QIP technologies will offer capabilities and performances that are, as yet, unrivaled by their traditional equivalents. These improvements could be in terms of computing speed, guaranteed security, and minimal storage requirements, etc. Background Vlasov's work in 1997 focused on the use of a quantum system to recognize orthogonal images. This was followed by efforts using quantum algorithms to search specific patterns in binary images and detect the posture of certain targets. Notably, more optics-based interpretation for quantum imaging were initially experimentally demonstrated in and formalized in after seven years. In 2003, Venegas-Andraca and Bose presented Qubit Lattice, the first published general model for storing, processing and retrieving images using quantum systems . Later on, in 2005, Lattorre proposed another kind of representation, called the Real Ket, whose purpose was to encode quantum images as a basis for further applications in QIMP. Furthermore, in 2010 Venegas-Andraca and Ball presented a method for storing and retrieving binary geometrical shapes in quantum mechanical systems in which it is shown that maximally entangled qubits can be used to reconstruct images without using any additional information . Technically, these pioneering efforts with the subsequent studies related to them can be classified into three main groups: #Quantum-assisted digital image processing (QDIP): These applications aim at improving digital or classical image processing tasks and applications. #Optics-based quantum imaging (OQI) #Classically-inspired quantum image processing (QIP) A survey of quantum image representation has been published in . Furthermore, the recently published book Quantum Image Processing provides a comprehensive introduction to quantum image processing, which focuses on extending conventional image processing tasks to the quantum computing frameworks. It summarizes the available quantum image representations and their operations, reviews the possible quantum image applications and their implementation, and discusses the open questions and future development trends. Quantum image manipulations A lot of the effort in QIMP has been focused on designing algorithms to manipulate the position and color information encoded using the Ô¨Çexible representation of quantum images (FRQI) and its many variants. For instance, FRQI-based fast geometric transformations including (two-point) swapping, flip, (orthogonal) rotations and restricted geometric transformations to constrain these operations to a specified area of an image were initially proposed. Recently, NEQR-based quantum image translation to map the position of each picture element in an input image into a new position in an output image and quantum image scaling to resize a quantum image were discussed. While FRQI-based general form of color transformations were first proposed by means of the single qubit gates such as X, Z, and H gates. Later, MCQI-based channel of interest (CoI) operator to entail shifting the grayscale value of the preselected color channel and the channel swapping (CS) operator to swap the grayscale values between two channels were fully discussed in. To illustrate the feasibility and capability of QIMP algorithms and application, researchers always prefer to simulate the digital image processing tasks on the basis of the QIRs that we already have. By using the basic quantum gates and the aforementioned operations, so far, researchers have contributed to quantum image feature extraction, quantum image segmentation, quantum image morphology, quantum image comparison, quantum image filtering, quantum image classification, quantum image stabilization, among others. In particular, QIMP-based security technologies have attracted extensive interest of researchers as presented in the ensuing discussions. Similarly, these advancements have led to many applications in the areas of watermarking, encryption, and steganography etc., which form the core security technologies highlighted in this area. In general, the work pursued by the researchers in this area are focused on expanding the applicability of QIMP to realize more classical-like digital image processing algorithms; propose technologies to physically realize the QIMP hardware; or simply to note the likely challenges that could impede the realization of some QIMP protocols. Quantum image transform By encoding and processing the image information in quantum- mechanical systems, a framework of quantum image processing is presented, where a pure quantum state encodes the image information: to encode the pixel values in the probability amplitudes and the pixel positions in the computational basis states. Given an image F=(F_{i,j})_{M \\\\times L}, where F_{i,j} represents the pixel value at position (i,j) with i = 1,\\\\dots,M and j = 1,\\\\dots,L, a vector \\\\vec{f} with ML elements can be formed by letting the first M elements of \\\\vec{f} be the first column of F, the next M elements the second column, etc. A large class of image operations is linear, e.g., unitary transformations, convolutions, and linear filtering. In the quantum computing, the linear transformation can be represented as g\\\\rangle =\\\\hat{U} f\\\\rangle with the input image state f\\\\rangle and the output image state g\\\\rangle . A unitary transformation can be implemented as a unitary evolution. Some basic and commonly used image transforms (e.g., the Fourier, Hadamard, and Haar wavelet transforms) can be expressed in the form G=PFQ, with the resulting image G and a row (column) transform matrix P (Q). The corresponding unitary operator \\\\hat{U} can then be written as \\\\hat{U}={Q}^T \\\\otimes {P}. Several commonly used two-dimensional image transforms, such as the Haar wavelet, Fourier, and Hadamard transforms, are experimentally demonstrated on a quantum computer, with exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. In addition, a novel highly efficient quantum algorithm is proposed and experimentally implemented for detecting the boundary between different regions of a picture: It requires only one single-qubit gate in the processing stage, independent of the size of the picture.

The local authority banned public gatherings and imposed a 24h curfew in Sur on the 11 December 2015, and the Turkish Army deployed about 200 troops of the Special Forces Command to conduct house-to-house searches. The conflict resulted in most residents abandoning their homes. Abandoned houses in various neighborhoods of Sur district were occupied by militants, and clashes between the PKK and Turkish Army and Special Forces continued until early 2016. Amnesty International has estimated that 300,000 people were displaced by the conflict, and branded the government's response 'collective punishment'. International Crisis Group has estimated that around 1,700 people have been killed in the resulting conflict and estimates the number of displaced people at 350,000. Human Rights Watch criticized the Turkish government for 'blocking access for independent investigations into alleged mass abuses against civilians across southeast Turkey'. Many houses were destroyed and registered historic buildings were seriously damaged. In March 2016, the government launched a project for the restoration of all the damaged historic structures and the rebuilding of destroyed houses in accordance of their original style. However, the project was criticized by the Turkish Union of Architects and Engineers Chambers, who claimed that the project would take ‚Äúa defense-centered approach‚Äù, which would require the destruction of some historic structures.

Meaning  The phrase is used to describe accusations of women either mentioning their gender to gain an advantage in discussions or implying or accusing other people of sexism in order to garner support. It has been viewed as a last resort tactic for people in discussions with Miranda Devine stating: \\"Playing the gender card is the pathetic last refuge of incompetents and everyone in the real world knows it.\\" However, it has also been argued that making the accusation of someone playing the woman card is a way to belittle genuine concerns and the credibility of the person who it is aimed at.  Politics  Accusations of the woman card often occur in politics and elections. In 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard made a speech in the Australian Parliament accusing Opposition leader Tony Abbott of misogyny. Gillards speech received international attention and was widely praised, including, reportedly, by a number of foreign political leaders including Fran√ßois Hollande, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Some local commentators (predominantly conservative), however, accused Gillard of playing the gender card. In the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primaries former President of the United States Bill Clinton was viewed to have played the gender card in order to garner support for his wife Hillary and likewise accused Barack Obama of using the race card against them. During the 2016 United States Presidential Election campaign, Republican Party nominee Donald Trump accused his rival, the Democratic Party's Hillary Clinton of playing the Woman Card stating she was \\"constantly playing the woman card. It's the only way she may get elected.\\" Clinton responded stating \\"if fighting for women's healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.\\" Afterwards, Clinton's campaign started to issue plastic cards which said \\"Woman Card\\" based on the Metrocard from New York City, to donors who gave at least $5 to her campaign. The plan was viewed as a marketing success and a backfire from Trump as it earned Clinton $2.4 million. During the 2017 French Presidential Election, Front National candidate Marine Le Pen was viewed as using her gender to soften views of the Front National as well as through modernisation of the party's image. Le Pen's candidacy was also cited as an example where feminists who claim they vote for candidates because they are female, refused to do so.

She is the founder of Virtuous Women Community International and is the co-founder of Faith World Ministries and Bible College. Apphia Manjoro was popularly known as Mother General because of her motherly role in the lives of many people.  Early life  Apphia Clara Manjoro was born in Gutu, a district (rural) in Masvingo (south west) in Zimbabwe. She was trained to work hard and do many different kinds of tasks, even those which are generally assigned to men. She could do tasks like cutting trees, milk cows, and even operate farming machinery. She grew up as a Catholic and she desired to become a nun and serve the Lord. She had a heart to help people and decided to enroll into a convent to become a nun after her secondary school. She was however discouraged from the idea of becoming a nun for the sake of her parents, since her brother was also into ministry. She took up teaching as a career instead.  Calling  While Apphia was working as a teacher, in 1969, she became seriously ill and was partly paralyzed. Although their family was Catholic, they tried everything for her to get cured, even traditional means, but none of those worked. Her older sister had been in Harare and knew of a pastor whom God was using to perform miracles, even to heal the sick. Apphia's sister took her to the pastor in Harare where she was prayed for and got instant healing. The pastor who prayed for Apphia had an assistant who served him, whose name is Bartholomew Manjoro. Bartholomew was present and also assisting in prayer when Apphia got her healing. Apphia became a born again Christian after her miraculous healing and she was filled with the Holy Ghost. Apphia often said sickness is not from God, but \\"the sickness was a hook\\" which God used to bring her close to her purpose and calling.  Early ministry  Apphia started serving God in the Pentecostal church where she got healed. She ministered through singing and worship and she also preached in public places and in buses. Apphia traveled across borders in Africa preaching the gospel and she also held crusades locally and served God under the ministry where she was healed.  Marriage  Apphia still had traces of a celibate attitude even though she was no longer a part of the Catholic church. She had no interest in boys or relationships because she wanted to pursue God, according to a scripture she quoted in Matthew 6:33. In 1974, an evangelist(by then) Bartholomew Manjoro, (that pastor's assistant) approached the church elders and expressed his interest in Apphia. This happened at a time when Apphia was out of the country, preaching the gospel, but because of the intensity of Bartholomew's request the church elders were forced to summon Apphia to urgently come back home. Apphia says that she thought someone had died or something terrible had happened, but upon arrival, she was a bit relieved when she discovered that it was not terrible news. Apphia says she was not exactly for the idea of a relationship or marriage but through the help and counseling of her mentor and leaders, she gave room for the evangelist to say his heart out and as time went on, the two fell in love and got married in the same year. Bartholomew Manjoro says that the day Apphia came when she was sick, the Lord told him that she was his wife but he doubted considering the condition she was in. Bishop Dr. Bartholomew Manjoro forgot about the message from God but later as he was praying for a marriage partner who could support him in his ministry, his heart leaned towards Apphia who was outstandingly ministering to the Lord. Bishop Dr. Manjoro and his wife have traveled places, ministering the word of God across nations and continents.  Family  Prophetess Dr. A. C. Manjoro was married to Bishop Dr. Bartholomew Manjoro and they have been blessed with 3 children, 2 sons and 1 daughter, all of whom are pastors. Pastor Dr. Batholomew (Jr) Manjoro is a pastor, prophet and leader of New Dimension Faith World Ministries which covers regions in the UK and Europe. Reverend Dr. Faithful Mutibvu is a pastor, reverend, worship leader and preacher of the gospel. She has a positive influence on women and youth. Pastor Dr. Eloi Manjoro is a pastor, recording artiste, music producer, worship leader, technical engineer at Faith World Ministries, Harare.  Ministry and Works  Prophetess A. C. Manjoro graduated from Christ for the Nations College (USA) in 1984. She continued to minister as a songwriter, preacher, singer, and teacher of the Word. Rumour has it that Prophetess A. C. Manjoro and her husband have caused many broken marriages to be mended. Their gift of counseling and healing broken lives have caused testimonies to emerge even from other ministries. Pastors from other ministries have referred their followers to go to Pastor Manjoro and his wife with certain issues especially where deliverance or healing is needed or issues relating to marriage dysfunctions. Apphia Manjoro is the founder of Virtuous Women Community International and Clapphia Rescue Center. She is also the co-founder of Faith World Ministries and Bible College.  Music  Prophetess Dr. A. C. Manjoro was a musician, composer, vocalist, instrumentalist and worship leader. She composed songs before Faith World Ministries and most of her compositions are commonly sung widely across denominations. She also composed many songs which are a part of the Faith World Ministries worship foundation. Rev. Apphia Manjoro recorded an album titled The Joy which is available for sell through the Faith World Ministries website. Apphia led worship at the Cathedral of Faith until the time of her death.  Faith World Ministries and Bible College  Faith World Ministries is a Holy Ghost centered church founded by Bishop Dr. Bartholomew Manjoro and his wife, the late Prophetess Dr. A. C. Manjoro. The church was started in 1993 and the bible college was opened in January 1995. The church is one of the biggest Pentecostal churches in Zimbabwe which covers all provinces in Zimbabwe, and extends to other countries like Zambia, Ghana, DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada.  Virtuous Women Community International  The Virtuous Women Community International is a community of God fearing women with a mandate to make a difference in their homes, community and in the world. This organisation seeks to empower women to have an impact in the world. The Virtuous Women Community believes that the power to change the world is in the woman, as she is the one who raises the children and takes care of the husband and all house-hold concerns, according to Proverbs 31. The organization therefore seeks to empower women to bring up children who will change the world and stand for and defend a morally upright character.  Virtuous High School  Virtuous High School is an educational institution being build by the Virtuous Women Community. The building of this school was initiated by Apphia Manjoro and was set to open in 2017 but work is still in progress at this facility. The opening date is yet to be known although progress is being made. The Virtuous High School is being built to provide high-quality education to children, especially the less privileged.  Claaphia Rescue Center  Claaphia Rescue Center is a shelter established to take care of young children, particularly those who were abused, forsaken or impregnated and abandoned. This rescue center provides accommodation, food, and all basic commodities. Additionally, prayer, counseling and comfort is provided by well seasoned counselors and pastors. The shelter caters for impregnated minors from the time they are pregnant to even after the delivery of the baby. The Clapphia Rescue Center assists young children with education, and training to equip them to be responsible and effective in life and to be able to take care of their families and communities.  Death  Reverend Apphia Manjoro died on the 12th of April 2016 after a short illness. Upon death she was acknowledged by the media and many local organizations as an exemplary leader whose life was well lived. She is considered a heroine of faith.

Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. Construction LST-911 was laid down on 28 February 1944, at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard; launched on 12 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Christine Muir; and commissioned on 14 May 1944, with Lieutenant Earl H. Clark, USN, in command. Service history Underway the next day, LST-911 sailed to Little Creek, Virginia., arriving there on 23 May, to commence two weeks of shakedown exercises. With those evolutions complete on 4 June, the LST received five days of shipyard availability at Norfolk. After loading of dry stores, she proceeded to New York City, and moored at Pier 80 on 12 June. Embarking five LCT sections and 31 LCT crewmen soon thereafter, the tank landing ship got underway for the Panama Canal Zone on 25 June. =Transfer to the Pacific= Following stops at Guant√°namo Bay and Coco Solo, the LST transited the Panama Canal on 9 July. Proceeding west, she made fueling stops at Bora Bora and Noum√©a before anchoring in Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, on 23 August, to unload stores and equipment. After refueling and loading of cargo for , the tank landing ship sailed to Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, and finished transferring supplies to the destroyer tender on 7 September. =New Guinea Operations= Shifting to Maffin Bay, New Guinea, on 13 September, LST-911 loaded of US Army cargo (mostly vehicles) and sailed to Morotai, beaching there and unloading supplies without incident on 19 September. The tank landing ship made a second supply run 26 September to 1 October, unloading of bulk cargo in Pitoe Bay before returning to Humboldt Bay. =Leyte operations= After loading of Army supplies on 14 October, LST-911 sailed to the Philippines to take part in the Sixth Army's landings there and disembarked her passengers and unloaded cargo at Cataison Point, Leyte, without incident on 22 October. During her second supply run, 6‚Äì12 November, as she was returning through San Pedro Bay, five Japanese planes attacked the anchorage. LST-911s guns joined the fusillade that shot down two of the attackers, splashing one not off the starboard bow. On 28 November, a doctor and nine corpsmen reported on board, instantly transforming LST-911 into a casualty evacuation ship. Underway for Leyte on 29 November, as part of a reinforcement convoy, the LST's crew witnessed a series of Japanese aircraft attacks on the convoy on 5 December, including the torpedoing of freighter Antoine Saugraine. After unloading supplies the next day, the LST withdrew from the beach and anchored in San Pedro Bay. Three days later, she embarked 149 men and vehicles from the Australian No.3 Airfield Construction Squadron and sailed for Mindoro on 12 December. Although the convoy came under repeated attacks by Japanese planes, the tank landing ship received no damage and disembarked her passengers and unloaded her equipment on 15 December. While on a second run from Leyte, LST-911s convoy came under attack off Mindoro by a dozen kamikazes, which damaged her sister ships and as well as destroyer ; another kamikaze crashed freighter Juan de Fuca off Panay. After unloading her cargo on 22 December, the LST then evacuated 47 Army casualties and 13 survivors of LST-460 and transported them to Leyte, anchoring in San Pedro Bay on 24 December. =Luzon operations= After loading an LCVP and 500 tons of cargo, LST-911 proceeded for Lingayen Gulf on 4 January 1945.

The next morning a plane flew straight over the LST in the morning darkness, dropping two bombs that fell astern, shaking the ship but doing no damage. Finally, on 11 January, the LST finished unloading supplies and equipment and returned to Leyte with three casualties embarked. Intermittent air attacks kept the crew at battle stations over the next two days.

Early life Romapada was the youngest son of Yadava king Vidarbha. Vidarbha had many sons but his friend King Dharmaratha of Anga was heirless. Thus, Dharmaratha adopted Romapada. When Dharmaratha grew old, he made Romapada as the ruler of Anga.  Meeting with Rishyasringa  After Dharmaratha retired to the forest, Romapada became the King of Anga. He married Vershini who was the elder sister of Kausalya (mother of Rama). Kausalya's husband - King Dasharatha of Ayodhya was Romapada's childhood friend. Romapada and Vershini did not have any issue; Dasharatha promised them his first child. A daughter Shanta was born to Dasharatha and Kausalya. Shanta was then adopted by childless Romapada. Once a Brahmin named Shuvateertha came to Romapada to ask for help but the king called him back in the evening. When he visited in the evening, the king was busy talking with Shanta and ignored Shuvateertha. The Brahmin returned disappointed. The rain-god and king of hevaen, Indra was enraged with the behaviour of the king. Thus, Anga received little rain during monsoons. Severe drought occurred in the kingdom of Anga and on discussing with the known saints, king came to know that the prevalent situation could be bypassed only if sage Rishyashringa, the son of Vibhandak will visit his country and bless it with the power of his meditation and austerity. The king thought of various means to bring the sage to his country and he suddenly got the idea that the seer, who had grown aloof from the world and the material pleasure, who don't even know of women could be lured by the charm and beauty of a women only.Thus; he sent beautiful courtesans dressed in attractive clothings and decorated with pleasant smell in order to lure the seer.After all, a courtesan named vaishali was successful in bringing him to the Anga, where he was given grand welcome.The courtesans tempt Rishyasringa - Ramayana, Bala Kanda . The king had earlier adopted the daughter of his friend Dasharatha called Shanta, who was elder sister of Rama born out of Kausalya.After the seer performed the sacrifice he was given opportunity to choose bride for him from among the daughters of all the known officers, ministers and subordinate rulers present there.The young seer chose Shanta, the adopted daughter of Romapada. Hence, she was married to him and the sage was given position of a prince in the Anga Kingdom. In the Mahabharata, Adhiratha, the chief charioteer of King Dhritrashtra and adoptive-father of Karna, is said to be Rompada's descendant.

The hotel is inspired by the Parisian brothels from the Belle √âpoque period. Maison Souquet is decorated by the French designer Jacques Garcia. History Between 1871 and 1880, the building hosted a school for girls, named l'√âcole Paulin. In 1905, Mme. Souquet created a discrete maison close (brothel), perfectly echoing the Parisian customs and aesthetics of the Belle √âpoque period. From 1907 onwards, Maison Souquet became a regular hotel. In 2013, Maisons Particulieres Collection acquired the building and started a two-year renovation period in order to create a 5-star hotel. At its opening in 2015, Maison Souquet joined the \\"Small Luxury Hotel of the World\\" Collection. Interior design thumb To create a special atmosphere at the hotel, Jacques Garcia drew his inspiration from the Parisian brothels of the Belle √âpoque period. All of the decorative elements were from the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. =Lounges= The Maison Souquet consists of a succession of salons, reflecting the original configuration of the houses of pleasure. Today we can see the Le Salon des Mille et Une Nuits (Salon of the 1001 nights), the Salon des Petits Bonheurs and the Jardin d'Hiver (The winter garden).. Le Salon des Mille et Une Nuits Formerly, the first lounge was known as a \\"chat room\\" or \\"social room\\". It was reserved for men. Politicians, bankers, captains of industry and artists gathered there in a private club format to talk about world affairs and business.. Purchased in 2013 from a renowned Belgian antique dealer, the 1001-night show is a unique piece. This salon was originally in a private mansion in the heart of Brussels. This as a special order made by a wealthy Belgian aristocrat to reproduce in his mansion a setting worthy of the greatest Moorish palaces of the 19th century. This decoration was completed in 1895. It consists of precious enamel, polychrome wood with gold highlights, and adorned with Cordoba leather. This required meticulous work to be adapted to the demanding specification of Maison Souquet. Le Salon des Petits Bonheurs thumb This second lounge was once used as a \\"presentation room\\". Courtesans and guests met before going to one of the rooms of the house. Today renamed Salon des Petits Bonheurs, it consists of a hidden bar where refined dishes and precious spirits are found, a library, board games, a monumental fireplace and woodwork inherited from the late nineteenth century. Le Jardin d'Hiver thumb This last salon was formerly called the \\"salon after\\". It previously served as an \\"After Lounge\\" where men could extend their evening around a last drink. Le Salon d'Eau thumb Reserved exclusively for guests who request the key, the secret spa is decorated with a celestial ceiling whose gold stars shimmer across a cobalt blue sky. The stars sparkle above a 9 metre long swimming pool which is adjacent to a steam bath and a body treatment room. =Rooms= thumb Maison Souquet is composed of 20 rooms including six suites and two apartments with unique decorations. Decorations are inspired by several styles including those of Napoleon III, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Empire and French 18th century. Each room is named after a famous courtesan, among them are La Castiglione, La Paiva, Liane de Pougy and La Belle Otero. The rooms are embellished with different fabrics, silk and embroidery. Sponsorship At its opening, Maison Souquet partnered Mus√©e d'Orsay for its exhibition entitled \\"Splendeurs et mis√®res. Images of prostitution, 1850-1910\\". The collaboration included the publication of a book entitled Splendeurs & mis√®res by Editions Flammarion.

In October 2014, it was reported that Leung Chun-ying, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, had signed an agreement in 2011 with UGL Limited, an Australian engineering firm, in relation to its takeover of DTZ Holdings, a UK-listed real estate services company in which Leung was the director of the company. In agreement, UGL undertook to pay Leung ¬£4 million (HK$50 million) in two instalments in 2012 and 2013 respectively, subject to specific conditions. As these payments concurred with the term of office of Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive between 2012 and 2017, it has aroused concerns of the public in respect of the nature of payment, potential conflict of interests, relevant systems of declaration of interests and taxation implications. The UGL case was under investigation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) for an unusual four-year long period from 2014 to 2018. In July 2016, Rebecca Li Bo- lan, the acting head of the Operations Department of ICAC resigned after the cessation of the acting appointment in which such unusual change raised public concern. It was speculated it might be related to the UGL case as Li was reportedly its principal investigator. In November 2016, a select committee to inquire into the UGL incident was set up in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo). In May 2017, it was revealed that Holden Chow, vice-chairman of the select committee, had privately discussed with the Chief Executive about the UGL case in which Leung \\"made suggestions about the scope\\" of the investigation. It raised public concern over Leung's interference into the investigation. Background DTZ Holdings was a real estate services company listed in the United Kingdom with a history of more than 200 years before its closure. It had ventured into Asia since 1999, partnering with Asian firms including CY Lung & Co, a surveying company set up by Leung Chun-ying in Hong Kong. Leung was appointed as a board member of DTZ in December 2006 and chairman of DTZ Asia Pacific in February 2007. DTZ was severely hit by the 2008 global financial crisis which resulted in a cumulative loss of ¬£106.7 million (HK$1.3 billion) before tax during 2009‚Äì2011. As the major shareholder, Saint George Participations (SGP) refused to inject more liquidity into the company. As DTZ found it difficult to service the total secured debt of ¬£110 million (HK$1.4 billion) owed to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), its lead creditor, the latter engaged Ernst and Young (EY) to provide strategic advice on the options available to RBS in regard to DTZ's debt on 17 October 2011. As a result, DTZ commenced a fast-track sale two days later to minimise its debt loss. ON 8 November 2011, UGL Limited, an Australian engineering firm was chosen as the \\"preferred bidder\\" in the rescue takeover of DTZ as voted by the DTZ directors. Shortly after that, Leung stepped down from the board of DTZ on 24 November before he declared his candidacy for the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election on 27 November 2011. Prior to that, Leung resigned from the Executive Council of Hong Kong (ExCo) on 3 October 2011. Agreement On 2 November 2011, UGL issued an agreement letter to Leung, setting out the following terms of agreement in relation to UGL's takeover of DTZ: # Cash bonus earlier committed by DTZ: UGL undertook to pay Leung Chun-ying the outstanding bonus of ¬£1.5 million (HK$18.7 million) which DTZ agreed to pay for the period from 1 May 2010 through to the completion of the sale of DTZ; # Formal terms of payment of ¬£4 million: UGL would pay Leung Chun-ying a total of ¬£4 million (HK$50 million) over a two- year period in 2012 and 2013, provided that Leung ## provides assistance in promoting UGL and DTZ as reasonably required by UGL, including but not limited to acting as a referee and adviser from time to time; ## supports the acquisition of DTZ by UGL; ## retains the senior management team of DTZ until end-2013; ## does not make any statements criticising the takeover; and ## undertakes non-compete, non-poach arrangements in the following 24 months after the acquisition of DTZ by UGL; and # Sale options of DTZ Japan Ltd: For the stake of DTZ Japan Ltd still held by Leung Chun-ying, UGL offered an immediate sale option to buy his shares at ¬£200,000 (HK$2.5 million) plus 30% of the net profit of DTZ Japan Ltd after taxation for the three financial years during 2012-2013 if Leung chose to sell at a later date, UGL offered a put option to buy his stake within seven years from the completion of UGL's acquisition of DTZ, at a price equivalent to 30% times seven of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of DTZ Japan Ltd, where EBITDA is the average of three financial years before he activates the put option, subject to a minimum payment of ¬£200,000 (HK$2.5 million). On the same day, Leung Chun-ying signed the agreement, but inserted a handwritten note \\"provided that such assistance does not create an conflict of interest\\" next to the clause (2)(1). At the same time, DTZ received a rival bid from another company, China's state-owned Tianjin Innovation Financial Investment Company which had made a bid that valued DTZ at ¬£100 million more than the bid by UGL, but that this more valuable bid was rejected by the DTZ board, which included Leung, and not released to shareholders. It was reported that EY and RBS thought the execution time was too long to address the imminent liquidity crisis, the directors decided to choose UGL as \\"it provided the most likely opportunity of delivering the best outcome for creditors\\". On 4 December 2011, UGL completed its acquisition of DTZ through the pre-pack sale mechanism, at a cost of ¬£77.5 million (HK$967.2 million). On 25 March 2012, Leung Chun-ying was elected as the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. He was sworn in on 1 July for a five-year period up to 30 June 2017. According to the terms of the agreement between Leung and UGL, Leung should have received ¬£2 million (HK$25 million) each in 2012 and 2013 respectively from UGL, but there has not been any publicly available information on the details of these payments to date. Disclosure and reporting On 8 October 2014, Fairfax Media, an Australian media agency, published for the first time a detailed report on the above agreement between Leung Chun-ying and UGL on The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. This had aroused intense public discussion in Hong Kong during the city- wide pro-democracy protests often dubbed as the \\"Umbrella Revolution\\". The members of the public raised question over the UGL agreement on the nature of payment, potential conflict of interests, relevant systems of declaration of interests; and taxation implications. The clause of Leung agreeing to \\"[act] as a referee and adviser from time to time\\" raised to concerns on whether Leung agreed to provide future services to UGL, as for the Chief Executive, it was illegal to accept any paid advisory for a commercial entity. Even though Leung had a handwritten clause in the contract stating that he would perform the required duty \\"provided that it does not create any conflict of interest\\", legislator Albert Ho of the Democratic Party said it was not enough for Leung as the Chief Executive was already paid for such duty. Ho questioned whether Leung had declared such interest to the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal as required by Article 47(2) of the Basic Law. Leung Chun-ying issued a statement on the same day, highlighting that the ¬£4 million (HK$50 million) payments arose from his \\"resignation from DTZ, not any future service to be provided by him\\". Moreover, as he had already resigned from the ExCo well before his conclusion of agreement with UGL on the one hand, and the agreement took place before his election as the Chief Executive on the other, \\"there is no requirement under our current systems of declaration\\" to declare the payments. While the Neo Democrats, a pro-democracy party, lodged a complaint about the issue with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 9 October 2014, the Secretary for Justice had delegated responsibility to Director of Public Prosecutions to handle the case. The Chief Executive's Office responded to the inquiries about Leung's tax implications by claiming that he \\"was not required to pay salaries tax for the related payments\\" on the advice of his accountant. John Garnaut, an Australian journalist who was one of the writers of the original report said that his team received the original documents on 5 October from an anonymous source. He also said that they had been \\"threatened\\" with legal action by Leung's lawyers before they published the report. In response to such accusation, the Chief Executive's Office said Leung decided to pursue a potential case as the allegations of a \\"bribe\\" provided by the report were \\"very serious\\". Both EY and the chairman of the then DTZ Tim Melville-Ross were reportedly not aware of the agreement between Leung and UGL in 2011. In reply to a press enquiry, EY commented that \\"it was natural\\" for UGL to enter into a non-poaching arrangement to secure key personnel, and added that \\"any such arrangements made were between UGL and the employees\\". Likewise, RBS was reportedly unaware of the agreement. That said, there was a conflicting press report claiming the otherwise afterwards. UGL issued a press release on 9 October 2014 to counter the allegation of \\"secret payment\\" to Leung. It said that the agreements were \\"common confidential commercial arrangements when a business is being acquired\\" and they were \\"standard businesses practice for non-compete and non-poach agreements\\". David Webb, who was the deputy chairman of the Takeovers and Mergers Panel of the Securities and Futures Commission and editor of Webb-Site.com, commented on the matter, saying that EY should have been informed about the agreement between Leung and UGL so it could \\"consider whether an excessive amount of the value of the business was being shifted from the company to its director and management\\". As Leung failed to disclose the side-deal, Webb said Leung might have \\"obtained an advantage without his principal‚Äôs consent, against Section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance ().\\" Legislative Council inquires On 17 October 2014 at the House Committee meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo), three members put forward a proposal for the House Committee Chairman to move a motion under the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance () in Council to seek the Council's authorisation for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the alleged receipt of secret payments of Leung from UGL and related issues. After deliberations, the proposal was voted down by the pro-Beijing camp as 22 members voted for and 38 members voted against the proposal. Similar proposals were tabled on several occasions on 31 October, 5 November and 20 November but all motions were defeated by the pro-Beijing camp. At the House Committee meeting on 17 October 2014, pro-democrats considered that the UGL payments Leung Chun-ying were \\"illicit kickbacks\\", in return for his support of UGL's acquisition of DTZ. UGL's payment to Leung was alleged to have negative implications on the purchase price of DTZ, which were \\"grossly unfair to the small shareholders of DTZ\\". As Leung had agreed to provide such assistance, this also prompted a concern whether he had engaged in a \\"part-time job\\" during his office as the Chief Executive. However, pro-Beijing camp considered that the agreement between Leung and UGL was just a \\"common commercial arrangement\\" for protecting the acquirer's interests in mergers and acquisitions. Some members were of the view that the UGL payment was a \\"golden handshake\\" package for \\"non-compete, non-poach\\" requirements, although a member pointed out that payments under non-compete, non-poach arrangements were usually stated in the main merger and acquisition contract for endorsement by the board of directors of both buyer and seller sides, rather than in a private agreement. At the council meeting of 29 October 2014, a member commented that the UGL payments were made after Leung had taken office of the Chief Executive, leading to conflict of interests of the Chief Executive. However, some members noted that UGL had not requested Leung to undertake any task whatsoever on its behalf after the agreement, nor had Leung offered to perform any such task. However, other members argued that refraining from taking any actions could also constitute a form of assistance to UGL. By making reference to the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap. 201), forbearing to do an act after accepting advantages is itself a kind of service. In response to the members questioning the requirements of declaration of interests of the Chief Executive pursuant to Article 47(2) of the Basic Law, \\"[t]he Chief Executive, on assuming office, shall declare his or her assets to the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam elaborated that the term \\"assets\\" was not specifically defined under the Basic Law and the contents of relevant declaration were confidential. More specifically on the UGL payments, Lam pointed out that \\"the agreed payment arose from Leung's resignation from DTZ, not any future service to be provided by him\\". Thus Leung was not required to declare the resignation agreement. In terms of timing, both his resignation from DTZ and conclusion of the agreement with UGL took place before he was elected as the Chief Executive, and at the material time, he had already resigned from ExCo. Coupled with the fact that he had not provided any service to UGL after signing the resignation agreement, Leung was not required to make declaration of the UGL payments. According to the government, Leung had made the tax payment for the cash bonus of ¬£1.5 million (HK$18.7 million), but not the formal terms of payment of ¬£4 million (HK$50 million). At the council meeting of 20 November 2014, a member raised a question that the UGL payments involved services to be provided in Hong Kong and thus should have taxation implications, as according to section 8 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance () (IRO), salaries tax is chargeable if the income of an individual from any office or employment or any pension arising in or derived from Hong Kong, while the profits arising from the sale of capital assets are excluded from profits tax. At the council meeting of 2 November 2016, the petition presented by Kenneth Leung of the Professional Commons co-signed with Andrew Wan of the Democratic Party to establish a select committee to inquire into the UGL incident. However, it was not authorised by the council to exercise the powers under section 9(1) of the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (Cap. 382).http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1294279-20161102.htm In November 2017, Paul Tse Wai-chun, the head of the Legco select committee said that Leung Chun-ying is dodging the investigation as he refused to attend meetings, provide necessary documents and when he does provide documents, it is unsatisfactory.http://www.ejinsight.com/20171109-cy-leung-refuses-to- cooperate-with-probe-into-ugl-saga/ Rebecca Li resignation On 7 July 2016, Rebecca Li Bo-lan, the acting head of the Operations Department of ICAC since 18 July 2015, resigned after the cessation of the acting appointment in which such unusual change raised public concern. It was speculated in some media reports that cessation of acting appointment might be related to the controversy surrounding the UGL Incident, as Li was reportedly the principal investigator over the UGL case in ICAC. Leung Chun-ying said he had no hand in Li's demotion. ICAC Commissioner Simon Peh, who was nominated by Leung Chun- ying, insisted he alone made the personal judgment that Rebecca was not up to the job. In late July, Ricky Yau Shu-chun, who replaced Li as the acting head of the Operations Department, reportedly requested to terminate his contract with the ICAC in a few weeks after Li's resignation, and he would proceed on final leave on 1 August. Chief Forensic Accountant Tang Shuk-nei was also reported to be leaving the agency after her contract ends in mid August. Anson Chan, the former Chief Secretary for Administration and convener of think tank Hong Kong 2020, expressed concern over the unusual shakeup and urged Simon Peh to publicly explain in detail. In a surprise turn of events, Ricky Yau withdrew his request to terminate his contract only about three hours after his departure was made public. Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho said there was little progress in the UGL case because neither the Chief Executive Office nor the Executive Council had responded to requests for information made by the ICAC close to a year ago. The UGL case has now been investigated by the ICAC for almost three years without any conclusion. Leung Chun-ying's legal letter to Apple Daily In September 2016, Leung Chun-ying issued a legal letter to Apple Daily, a local pro-democracy newspaper, over an editorial it published on 8 September in relations to the UGL allegations. It wrote in the letter that the newspaper's \\"malicious\\" allegations of bribery and \\"vicious intention\\" harm his chances of re-election. The editorial in question called on newly elected legislators to invoke the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance to pursue Leung over the controversial payment of HK$50 million he received from UGL. \\"The usage of the false corruption allegation to prevent Mr C.Y. Leung from exercising his constitutional right to stand for the re-election ... if he chooses to, demonstrates the very serious kind of malicious and injurious motive,\\" the letter wrote. The letter also objected to the paper‚Äôs ‚Äúdisdainful‚Äù use of nicknames for Leung such as \\"689\\", \\"Wolf Ying\\" and \\"Liar Ying\\" in a campaign against his leadership, in which \\"689\\" refers to the number of votes Leung received from the 1,200-strong Election Committee in 2012. It was the second time Leung had threatened legal action against a local media outlet. In 2013, Leung issued legal letters to the Hong Kong Economic Journal and columnist Joseph Lian Yi-zheng over an article linking him to triad gangsters. Apple Daily chief editor Chan Pui-man dismissed Leung‚Äôs complaint that the editorial could make him un-electable as \\"ridiculous and laughable\\". The Hong Kong Journalists Association expressed \\"shock and regret\\" over Leung‚Äôs legal action, saying he was causing public concern over freedom of speech. Report on DTZ Japan In January 2017, a media report by Hong Kong Citizen News showed that the ownership of DTZ Japan Ltd had changed by end 2015, after UGL sold the entire business of DTZ to a consortium in November 2014. According to the report, DTZ UK Bidco Limited, a subsidiary of the consortium, held 100% stake of DTZ Japan Ltd as at 31 December 2015, although the exact date of stake transaction was not known. This suggested that Leung Chun-ying might have exercised the put option in the sale of his stake in DTZ Japan Ltd during the period 2012‚Äì2015, in accordance with the clause in the agreement between Leung and UGL. At this juncture, there are no official statements from Leung, the consortium and UGL to respond to the media report. Leung Chun-ying suing Kenneth Leung In March 2017, Leung Chun-ying sued member of the Legislative Council Kenneth Leung for defamation over remarks about the UGL payment, claiming the latter had no basis to allege at a press briefing that overseas tax authorities were investigating the Chief Executive in relation to the HK$50 million payment from UGL. This was the first time a Hong Kong Chief Executive had sued a legislator for defamation. The writ also said it was defamatory for Kenneth Leung to claim the \\"central authorities would be very embarrassed if anything should happen to\\" Leung Chun-ying if he was elevated to vice-chairman of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in which he assumed the office soon after. Kenneth Leung said the lawsuit would not stop him from continuing with the Legislative Council investigation into the payment controversy in which he was a member of the select committee. According to the website of London-based law firm Clifford Chance, for which the legislator works, Kenneth Leung specialises in corporate and international tax planning and is named as one of the Global Top 250 tax advisers in the Tax Directors Handbook. Holden Chow controversy On 15 May 2017, Holden Chow, member of the Legislative Council of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and vice-chairman of the Legislative Council select committee to inquiry over the UGL incident was reportedly privately discussed with Leung Chun-ying about the UGL case in which Leung \\"made suggestions about the scope\\" of the investigation through a word document Chow presented in the committee. All 47 changes in the document were traced to the user name ‚ÄúCEO-CE‚Äù on 21 April. Lam Cheuk-ting, Kenneth Leung and Andrew Wan, three pro-democrat members of the select committee met the press over Holden Chow controversy. The pro-democrats demanded that Chow resign from the select committee and from the Legislative Council as he had lost credibility. They warned that the legislature‚Äôs independence was under threat, as Democratic Party legislator Andrew Wan saying the case reflected \\"the executive branch‚Äôs unprecedented meddling with a LegCo probe\\". Other Democrat legislators Hui Chi-fung and Kwong Chun-yu went a step further to lodge a complaint with the ICAC, alleging misconduct in public office. Chow apologised for his \\"lack of political sensitivity\\" in not informing the select committee of Leung's \\"personal input\\", but he insisted there was nothing wrong in discussing the matter with Leung in private. Leung Chun-ying insisted he had the right to express his opinions regarding the matter and called for an inquiry to find out who leaked the confidential document revealing his input in the matter during a closed-door meeting. He also accused Kenneth Leung, member of the select committee whom he was suing for allegedly defaming him over the UGL controversy, of being prejudiced against him. He demanded Kenneth Leung to withdraw from the investigation for holding conflicting interests. After days of media reporting, Holden Chow resigned from the select committee on 19 May, \\"in hope of calming the political storm\\", while continuing denying there was any wrongdoing. On 20 May, Leung fired at Kenneth Leung on his official blog, asking him 18 questions regarding the tax implications Kenneth Leung accused Leung Chun-ying for. He requested Kenneth Leung to explain which tax did he claim the tax authorities were investigating the Chief Executive on. Leung Chun-ying questioned if Kenneth Leung wanted to be the \\"screenwriter, director and actor in presenting the message that the chief executive is under investigation\\". He also that \\"is an example of how Hong Kong‚Äôs politics have deteriorated extremely ... We must, both through civil and criminal procedures, stop [people] using our law enforcement agencies as a tool for attacking government officials.\\" It was the seventh time in a week Leung Chun-ying made a statement regarding to his UGL incident. On the same day, the 28 pro-democrat legislators filed an impeachment motion against Leung for trying to intervene with the select committee investigation. After nine-hour debate, the motion to impeach Leung Chun-ying was defeated with 34 pro-Beijing legislators voted against it. Wolf-Hunting Action In April 2018, the Democratic Party launched a crowdfunding campaign titled \\"Wolf-Hunting Action\\" (wolf is Leung Chun-ying's nickname) aimed to raise at least HK$2 million in 90 days to support an investigation in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Australia. The fund would be used for legal and accounting services, professional advisory services, liaison with overseas stakeholders, and gathering of evidence. The campaign was initiated by Lam Cheuk-ting, Andrew Wan, Kwong Chun-yu and Senia Ng after they received two sets of legal advice from Queen‚Äôs Counsel Paul Harris and another from a team of Hong Kong lawyers which showed that Leung may have committed two offences including section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. By the evening on that day, 285 Hongkongers had donated more than HK$106,000. In a legal statement issued on the same day, Leung slammed Lam‚Äôs remarks as \\"fundamentally and factually wrong\\", and stated he reserved the right to any future legal action. On 8 September 2018, Leung Chun-ying declared that Britain‚Äôs National Crime Agency (NCA) had decided to halt its investigation of the UGL case. Lam Cheuk-ting later confirmed the news and disclosed the email from NCA‚Äôs Prosperity Director Donald Toon. Lam said he was disappointed with the NCA's decision and disappointed and would demand an explanation for its rationale. ICAC dropping the case On 12 December 2018, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) announced it would not take any \\"further investigative action\\" against Leung Chun-ying, ending the four-year marathon probe. The Department of Justice also issued a statement claiming there was \\"insufficient evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction\\" against Leung for any criminal offence. Many critics, including former Director of Public Prosecutions Grenville Cross, said he found it \\"very surprising\\" that no independent legal advice was sought on Leung‚Äôs case and urged the Secretary for Justice to explain. \\"For many years, this has been the invariable practice whenever a senior government official has been suspected of a criminal offence,\\" Cross said. The Democratic Party also considered asking for a judicial review of the Department of Justice‚Äôs decision. Hundreds of protesters demonstrated against the government's decision on 23 December. Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, who was under fire and demanded a more detailed explanation kept silence for two weeks until Cheng returned from her leave on 26 December. She labelled the accusations of her being evasive as \\"spurious\\". She also argued the issues were being \\"politicised\\". She rejected the need to give further explanations on the Leung case, including of whether she was personally involved in the decision not to prosecute Leung, and also rejected the Bar Association's call to delegate prosecution decisions to the top prosecutor.

Biography Born in Uffholtz, Haut-Rhin (Alsace), Claussmann was a pupil of organist Eug√®ne Gigout at the √âcole Niedermeyer de Paris, where he obtained first prizes in piano and organ, before winning the Grand Prix of the Ministry of Fine Arts in 1872. The following year, he settled in Clermont- Ferrand, where he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral. The new Merklin organ was inaugurated in 1877 by Edmond Lemaigre, the first holder. Claussmann succeeded him in 1888 until his death in 1926. A virtuoso interpreter, he chose to pursue his entire career in the Puy-de-D√¥me area, while a Parisian position would have been readily accessible to him. He also founded the Conservatory of Clermont-Ferrand in 1909, directing it until his death. Although he wrote many works for piano ‚Äì he was an excellent pianist ‚Äì as well as chamber music and vocal music, it is to the organ that he reserved the essential and most characteristic of his production, with about 350 compositions, fully in the post-Romantic music that he celebrated with brilliance but yet with sensitivity. He fulfilled his duties as organist of the cathedral, and assumed the function of director of the Conservatory, but he also performed well-known piano concertos with the orchestra of the city, which he occasionally directed. The Alsatian origin of Claussmann makes his music a very successful synthesis of French and German schools, in which one certainly can identify C√©sar Franck, whose influence is certain, and Robert Schumann, but which possesses an indisputable personality of his own. His work, together with those of other composers such as Marie-Joseph Erb from Strasbourg, √âmile Bourdon in Monaco, Edouard Commette in Lyon, canon Fauchard in Laval, to name but a few, contributed to forge, in a way, the missing link between a recognised and celebrated Parisian organ music and the more discreet but undeniable contribution of the provincial masters to the elaboration of a language that contributed to the reputation of the French organ school. Works A total of 544 pieces have been identified: 350 organ pieces, 113 piano pieces, 62 songs (or m√©lodies), 22 violin or cello pieces. Henry Lemoine was his principal publisher from 1904 to 1924. Most of his organ works are still available.

Failing to do so would result in an offence and can be convicted by a summary trial before a Magistrate with imprisonment period not exceeding one year and/or a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand. Functions The functions of the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka are; *Registering engineering practitioners under the categories of; **Chartered Engineer (CEng) - Chartered Engineer of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) **Associate Engineer (AEng) - Four year Full-time degree in Engineering recognized by IESL or an Associate Member of IESL **Affiliate Engineer (AflEng) - Three year full-time degree in Engineering recognized by IESL **Incorporated Engineer (IEng) - Incorporated Engineer of the Institution of Incorporated Engineers, Sri Lanka (IIESL) **Engineering Diplomate (EngDip) - Diploma in Engineering from a recognized University or Technical or Technological Institute recognized by IIESL **Engineering Technician (EngTec) - National Vocational Qualification Level IV of Engineering Technology or equivalent qualification recognized by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission or one year full-time academic course in Engineering Technology and has gained one year industrial experience in the relevant field or a holder of a Diploma or Certificate in Technology by a University or a Technical or Technological Institute of the Government of Sri Lanka *Determine the remuneration payable to the staff of the council *Make representations to the Government and relevant bodies on matters relating the engineering profession in Sri Lanka. Council members Council is headed by a Chairmen appointed by the subject minister from among the members of the council which is made up of; * Ex-officio members **Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya or representative of the rank of Professor **Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa or representative of the rank of Professor **Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna or representative of the rank of Professor **Director General of Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission or representative * Appointed members ** Seven Chartered Engineers nominated by the IESL. ** Four members nominated by the IIESL. ** Two Chartered Engineers nominated by the Sri Lanka Engineering Service. Criticism The Engineering Council has been criticized on its susceptibility to government influence and domination by the IESL with majority of the council are its members. It is criticized for allowing only the IESL and IIESL to submit its members for registration as engineering practitioners. Thereby allowing both institutions with IESL ability to control registration of engineering practitioners. IESL has been criticized in the past for restricting registration of Chartered Engineers having suspended the mature candidate route for non graduate engineers. The Engineering Council Act No 4 of 2017 will prevent many foreign qualified engineers from continuing their practice. Engineering graduates from newly established engineering faculties and private universities are not recognized and are not allowed to practice. However graduate diploma holders of the IESL owned IESL College of Engineering can practice as Associate Engineer as they are entitled to Associate Membership of IESL.Proposed ‚ÄòEngineering Council Bill‚Äô inimical to profession - FSP See also  *Engineering Council  References  External links Category:2017 establishments in Sri Lanka Category:Engineering societies based in Sri Lanka Category:Organizations established in 2017 Category:Professional certification in engineering ","title":"Engineering Council, Sri Lanka"},{"id":"54075718","text":"The Hinckford Hundred was one of the 19 historic Hundreds of Essex, covering an area of approximately 110566(taken from \\"Essex\\".

The platform's target audience is buy-to-let and bridging loan borrowers with a near perfect credit score, that are having difficulties with raising finance from traditional lenders due to a one off adverse credit event in the last five years. It was the first residential property-backed Innovative Finance ISA made available to UK savers. History LandlordInvest was founded in 2014. The platform was officially launched in December 2016 when it received authorisation by the FCA. In early 2017 LandlordInvest received an ISA manager approval from HMRC, ahead of similar platforms such as Funding Circle, Zopa, and Ratesetter, becoming one of a few companies to offer tax-free returns to peer-to-peer investors. In May 2017 the platform launched a secondary market which allows investors to sell off their property loan parts. Property Wire Awards listed LandlordInvest as one of three crowdfunding platforms of the year 2017, alongside The House Crowd and Homegrown. In July 2017 LandlordInvest received an undisclosed sum of seed funding from Alan Gabbay, director O&H; Properties which currently has a ¬£1bn property portfolio in London. Later in the same month the platform passed the ¬£1m lending milestone and amassed 700 investors since it launched in December 2016. By the end of July 2017 LandlordInvest completed its largest loan to date, a ¬£740,741 bridging loan, bringing its cumulative lending to ¬£2m. LandlordInvest published its loan book for the first time on 5 December 2017, marking its one-year anniversary. As of June 2018, the P2P platform has lent more than ¬£5m across 25 bridging and buy-to-let loans. In November 2019 LandlordInvest passed the ¬£8m lending milestone, where investors funded ¬£8.7m of loans with ¬£6.7m of repaid capital. Filip Karadaghi, chief executive of LandlordInvest, was listed as one of the 50 most influential people in the UK's P2P sector. Business Model LandlordInvest is an online marketplace which matches landlords looking for financing with investors. The platform provides secured borrowing to landlords seeking between ¬£30,000 and ¬£750,000. The minimum investment amount is ¬£100 and the platform's bridging loans carry a maximum term of 18 months, while the buy-to-let loans have terms of up to five years. Investors lend money to eligible borrowers and receive money from the interest charged on loans, while LandlordInvest covers the costs of running the platform by charging borrowers an arrangement fee on each funded loan and by deducting a servicing fee from monthly interest payments to investors. =Returns= The platform is holding out the prospect of returns of up to 12% per annum. In its first year of operation, LandlordInvest facilitated more than ¬£2.7m of lending through its platform, with an average loan amount of ¬£210,535, an average LTV of 63.7%, and an average annual gross return to investors of 11.1%. =Secondary market= In March 2018 the platform's secondary market reached ¬£1m of sales, with a total of 1,393 loan sales completed and an average transaction value of ¬£730. As of November 2019, there has been ¬£2.3m of secondary market sales on the platform. =IFISA= LandlordInvest was the first P2P lender to offer a property-backed IFISA. LandlordInvest reached over ¬£2m in subscriptions for its Innovative Finance ISA after having raised ¬£1.65m in subscriptions in the 2017-18 tax year, an increase of 292.5% compared to the ¬£419,835 of subscriptions made in the previous tax year.

The brooch ends with small hollow cone gold beads in four rows. A special preparation technique is noteworthy at the brooch's cylindrical two large hollow beads, which are created using applied arts enormous granule designs and beaded divisors.’Ä’°’µ’°÷Å÷Ñ ’¢÷Ä’∏’∂’¶’• ’§’°÷Ä’´÷Å, ‘±’¨’¢’∏’¥-’Ø’°’ø’°’¨’∏’£, ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂’´ ’∫’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂, 2016, 160 ’ß’ª: A Glance from the Bronze Age.

The song was written as the ending credits song for the film of the same name. The song was released as a single on March 10, 2017, and is notable as being the last solo release from Cornell prior to his death on May 18, 2017.http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/18/entertainment/chris-cornell-led-zeppelin- in-my-time-of-dying-trnd/index.html Background The song was first written by Chris Cornell after being approached by movie producer Eric Esrailian to write a song for his movie, The Promise. Cornell agreed, as the film's topic‚Äîthe Armenian Genocide‚Äîresonated with him. While he was not personally Armenian, his wife was Greek, and her family line had been affected by the genocide. He initially had reservations, being surprised that Serj Tankian of System of a Down was not asked to write the song, as Tankian was working on the movie itself, and had been quite outspoken about the genocide in the past, though with introspection and discussions with the production staff, he came to the understanding that he was a good combination of being neither too close, nor too far removed from the subject. Initial sessions for the song were difficult, with Cornell working a week on a completely different arrangement for the song before scrapping it and starting over.http://collider.com/chris-cornell-interview-the-promise/ After starting over, the creation of the final version came together much faster, with Cornell no longer trying to force things on how the songs should sound. The song was released as a charity single on March 10, 2017, to help benefit the International Rescue Committee. It received a lyric video on the same date. On April 19, 2017, he performed the song live with Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and a string quartet on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Themes and composition The song features Cornell on vocals, and an orchestrated instrumentation by Paul Buckmaster, a composer known for his past collaborations with Elton John and The Rolling Stones. The final version was recorded with a twenty four piece orchestra. The song was noted by Rolling Stone as a departure from the sound Cornell was known for with his work in grunge band Soundgarden. Spin described the track as \\"sounding a lot more like modern-day Peter Gabriel than Soundgarden and Audioslave.\\" Cornell explained that the change in sound was an effort to fit the themes of movie, stating: The song is described as having gentle, acoustic verses leading into a powerful chorus containing a \\"lush orchestral\\" sound. The song's only live performance implemented a grand piano part as well.http://www.gigwise.com/news/109781/chris-cornell-the-promise-live-tour- tv-show-singer-jimmy-fallon Reception Consequence of Sound praised the song for being \\"equal parts grace and poignancy\\" and specifically noting that Cornell's vocals did well in evoking the painful situations conveyed in the movie. While Radio.com referred to the song as an orchestral tearjerker, Spin was overall less positive, stating that the song was \\"skillfully put together: tuneful and majestic\\" but that \\"it feels a little too overwrought to embrace wholeheartedly.\\"http://www.spin.com/2017/03/chris-cornell-the-promise-stream/ Spin later commented on the song's live performance as well, referring to it as slightly \\"sappy\\", though conceding that the message, and its proceeds going to charity, were commendable. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Rock Performance category for 2018, and for an International Press Academy Satellite Award for Best Original Song.

He has completed a methodology and several computer programs that are used throughout the world by analysts, researchers, and data producers. An important use is official production of series adjusted for seasonality and (perhaps) other undesirable effects such as noise, outliers, or missing observations. Maravall has received several awards and distinctions and retired in December 2014 from the Bank of Spain.  Biography  After a childhood in Paris, Maravall returned to Madrid and finished secondary school at the Colegio Estudio, completed a doctorate in agricultural engineering at the Technical University of Madrid, and worked for several years at the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture. With a Fulbright-Ford fellowship he moved to the US and completed a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. In 1975, he moved to Washington, D.C. to work as staff economist in the Research Division of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In 1979, he returned to Madrid as a senior economist in the Research Department of the Bank of Spain, and in 1989 he moved to Italy as Full Professor in the Department of Economics of the European University Institute in Florence. In 1996, he returned to the Bank of Spain as Chief Economist and Head of the Time Series Analysis Unit. Maravall has been on the editorial board of many professional journals (the lengthiest periods for the Journal of Business and Economic Statistic and the Journal of Econometrics), on the Program and Scientific Committees of many international meetings and conferences, and has taught courses in more than 30 countries to participants from more than 60 countries. He has been Special Advisor to the European Central Bank and of Eurostat, and a member of the Board of Directors of the former Institute for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences of Madrid and of the High Advisory Council for R & D of the Generalitat Valenciana.  Research  Maravall‚Äôs research has centered on time series analysis and modeling and their application to economic series. His main contribution (an important part of it coauthored with Victor G√≥mez) has been the development of a model-based procedure to jointly solve several statistical time series problems that affect analysis and interpretation of economic time series. The standard (default) procedure performs, first, automatic identification and forecasting of regression-ARIMA models (that includes adjusting for outliers and calendar effects) in the possible presence of missing observations.G√ìMEZ, V. and MARAVALL, A. (1994), \\"Estimation, Prediction and Interpolation for Nonstationary Series with the Kalman Filter\\", Journal of the American Statistical Association 89, 611-624. Then, the model is decomposed into models for the unobserved components (such as seasonal, trend, transitory, and cyclical components) and, from these models, filters are derived to estimate and forecast the components.BURMAN, J.P. (1980), \\"Seasonal Adjustment by Signal Extraction\\", Journal of the Royal Statistical Society A, 143, 321-337.HILLMER, S.C. and TIAO, G.C.

(1995), \\"Unobserved Components in Economic Time Series\\", in Pesaran, H. and Wickens, M. (eds.), The Handbook of Applied Econometrics, chap. 1, 12-72. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. The model-based structure provides the joint distribution of the estimators, from which parametric tests and inferences (such as the standard errors of all estimators and forecasts) are derived.G√ìMEZ, V. and MARAVALL, A. (2001b), \\"Seasonal Adjustment and Signal Extraction in Economic Time Series\\", Ch.8 in Pe√±a D., Tiao G.C. and Tsay, R.S. (eds.) A Course in Time Series Analysis, New York: J.

(eds.), A Course in Time Series Analysis, New York: J. Wiley and Sons. Relevant features of the procedure are, first, that‚Äîfor a given series‚Äîall estimators are derived from the same (well- defined) model and hence will be internally consistent. Second, the automatic performance can be efficient and reliably applied to very large sets of time series.MARAVALL, A., L√ìPEZ, R., and P√âREZ, D., (2016) ‚ÄúReg-ARIMA Model Identification: Empirical Evidence‚Äù, special Issue on Frontiers of Statistics and Forecasting, Statistica Sinica, 26, 1365-1388.MARAVALL, A., LOPEZ, R., and P√âREZ, D., (2015), ‚ÄúReliability of the Automatic Identification of ARIMA Models in Program TRAMO‚Äù, in Beran, J., Feng, Y., and Hebbel, H.

The research has been published in academic journals (with some reprinted in books of readings), in the Springer-Verlag monograph series Lecture Notes in Statistics and Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, in the Bank of Spain monograph series, and in many book chapters.Many of the papers and additional documents are available at the Bank of Spain web site and in RESEARCH GATE and GOOGLE.  Software Development and Seasonal Adjustment  With the collaboration of V√≠ctor G√≥mez (1987‚Äì1999) and Gianluca Caporello (1990‚Äì2015), the research was incorporated into several computer programs: TRAMO (‚ÄúTime series Regression with ARIMA noise, Missing values, and Outliers‚Äù), SEATS (‚ÄúSignal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series‚Äù), and TSW (‚ÄúTramo and Seats for Windows‚Äù). An extension of TRAMO, TERROR (‚ÄúTRAMO for errors‚Äù), contains an application to data editing (it detects possible errors in incoming data, in large time-series data sets). The programs are extensively used throughout the world in a variety of applications. An important one is official production of seasonally adjusted data, and their use has been recommended by working groups at many institutions.Some examples (available in GOOGLE) are: UNECE (2011), ‚ÄúPractical Guide to Seasonal Adjustment‚Äù, United Nations, New York and Geneva, ECE/CES/15; EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (2000), ‚ÄúTask Force on Seasonal Adjustment: Final Report‚Äù, European Central Bank, Frankfurt.

It is intended to improve the availability of information to patients considering private healthcare service, making the information comparable with that which is already available for the National Health Service. The order specifies 11 performance measures which are to be collected. In May 2017 it published data about 149 common procedures at more than 200 hospitals showing the number of patient admissions, the average length of stay for each procedure, and the Friends and Family Test scores. This is said to cover over 80% of privately funded healthcare in the UK. It is planned to publish more detailed data than the Care Quality Commission. Since 2017 the Care Quality Commission has used information supplied by the network as part of its regulation of the independent sector. Its annual report for 2016-17 contained information for 285 hospitals providing private healthcare services, but 230 hospitals had not submitted sufficient data to appear on the network's website. These included 151 that had not submitted live data at all, most of which were NHS hospitals, in respect of their private activity. In June 2018 it was announced that the network would be developing an Acute Data Alignment Programme with NHS Digital to integrate the data it collects on about 750,000 privately funded hospital episodes each year into NHS systems and standards. In December 2019 it published information on health outcomes for patients who had privately-funded care in the UK, covering the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019, for 282 independent hospitals and NHS Private Patient Units.

Description and history The Calvin Day House is located in Hartford's Asylum Hill neighborhood, north of downtown, at the southwest corner of Myrtle and Spring Streets. It is a two-story brick building, roughly rectangular in shape, with a low-pitch hip roof topped by an octagonal cupola. The roof has an extended eave with paired decorative brackets, and is pierced by gabled wall dormers. The main facade faces east toward Spring Street, and is three bays wide. The ground floor outer bays have tall projecting bays, topped with bracketed roofs. In the center is the main entrance, sheltered by a porch with Corinthian columns supporting a simple entablature. On the Myrtle Street facade is a secondary entrance, above which on the second floor is a projecting oriel window. A mid-20th century wing extends to the rear; it has sympathetic styling. The interior has retained much of its original styling, despite conversion to non-residential use. The house was built in 1852 for J. Seymour Brown, a bookbinder, who sold it in 1855 to Calvin Day. Day was a prominent local businessman, whose roles included president of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, and of the Wadsworth Atheneum. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1857‚Äì58 and was active in the affairs of the Republican Party in Connecticut. The house passed to his daughter, whose heirs sold it in 1921 to a local women's shelter. Spring Street runs roughly north-south along a bluff that now overlooks Interstate 84, with Hartford's Union Station just beyond. In Calvin Day's time, the street was lined with similar high quality houses. All the others have since been torn down, either early in the 20th century to be replaced by apartment blocks, or later during urban renewal. Similar houses still survive on other streets in the Asylum Hill area.
