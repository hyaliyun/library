Shelley drew from his family history and wrote a play based on it in 1914 called The Family Tree. Shelley took inspiration from the genealogical craze that was sweeping Philadelphia and other major cities in order to write the satirical work.\\"The Merry Hunt For Ancestors\\". The Philadelphia Press Magazine; March 17, 1918, p. 9. Prior to The Family Tree Shelley co-wrote a popular musical called The Beauty Doctor in 1904.

Along with the Cathedral of St. Francis de Sales in Houma it is the seat of the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux. It is also the oldest parish in the diocese. The church building and rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Saint Joseph's Co-Cathedral and Rectory on March 5, 1986 as part of the \\"Thibodaux Multiple Resource Area\\" with 21 photos and 16 maps. (See also scanned text.). History The 1849 church damaged by the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane St. Joseph Parish first began to organize in 1813 and was founded as a mission to Assumption Church in Plattenville in 1817. Two years later a small wooden church building was constructed near the current church cemetery. The Rev. Antoine Potini was assigned as St. Joseph's first pastor. It is the oldest Catholic parish in the diocese and many of the other churches were founded from it and served by its priest. The Rev. Charles Menard had a brick church built in 1849 and it was destroyed by a fire in 1916. The relics of Saint Valerie survived the fire and are in the current church in a glass sarcophagus. The present church was begun in 1920 during the pastorate of Msgr. Alexander Barbier. It was completed three years later in the Renaissance Revival style. The first Mass was celebrated on January 25, 1923. The ornamental marble and plaster work was added in 1931 and the final paint scheme was done in 1954. Two of the parish's that were created from St. Joseph include St. Genevieve Parish, that was established in 1959, and St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in 1970. On March 2, 1977 Pope Paul VI established the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux. St. Francis de Sales Church in Houma became the cathedral of the new diocese and St. Joseph Church in Thibodaux became the co-cathedral. St. Joseph Life Center was built in 1985 to house the parish's administrative offices and community center. A major restoration of the co-cathedral church was completed in 2005. Architecture The exterior of St. Joseph Co-Cathedral is composed of pressed brick with stone trim. Two twin towers flank the main fa√ßade, which features a rose window. The roof is covered in terra cotta tile. The main feature in the interior is the 34 foot (10.4 m) high Baldachin in the apse. Symbols of the Four Evangelists are carved into its upper edge. The same symbols are found on the columns in the church. On the dome above are found the symbols of the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life, a snake, an apple, and peacocks symbolizing the triumph and glory of the risen Christ. The coat of arms for Pope Pius XI and Archbishop John Shaw of New Orleans are also found there. The stained glass windows portray the life of Christ and the seven Sacraments. A crest appears on all the columns with an emblem of faith, hope, charity and the Ship of Life. They are above a cast of grapes and wheat, which symbolizes the Eucharist.

Retrieved 2015-08-08. Schumann cited Jean Paul's style of humour as source of inspiration, although there are no direct programmatic links to Jean Paul's oeuvre found in the piece. Structure The Humoreske consists of seven sections (not originally indicated as such by the composer except for the last one, \\"\\"), to be played attacca after each other. Although the piece is nominally written in B-flat major, most of the piece is set in B-flat major's relative minor key, G minor. The musical texture and emotional tone, though, varies widely and differs greatly between the sections: # \\"\\" (Simple) (B major, , M. M. = 80) #:\\"\\" (Very fast and light) (B major, 2/4, M. M. = 138) #:\\"\\" (Even faster) (G minor) #:\\"\\", (First tempo, as in the beginning) (B major, ) # \\"\\" (Hastily) (G minor, 2/4, M. M. = 126) #:\\"\\" (Gradually more lively and stronger) (D minor) #:\\"\\" (As previously) Adagio # \\"\\" (Simple and delicate) (G minor, , M. M. = 100) #:\\"Intermezzo\\" (B major, 2/4, M. M. = 100) # \\"\\" (Heartfelt) (B major, , M. M. = 116) #:\\"\\" (Quicker) (Tempo I) # \\"\\" (Very lively) (G-minor/B major, 2/4, M.

M. = 112 ) Allegro A typical performance is about 27 minutes long. It is less popular with audiences than with pianists, and Robert Cummings wrote that some musicologists view it as an ill-judged attempt by Schumann to ‚Äútake his formula in Kreisleriana a step further.‚Äù However, it has been championed by critics such as Judith Chernaik and John C. Tibbetts (who consider Humoreske among Schumann's greatest pieces) as well as Anthony Tommasini, who referred to it as one of Schumann‚Äôs ‚Äúmost astonishing, and most overlooked, piano works‚Äù.

The Bouchot is a river in the French region of Grand Est which flows in the Vosges department. It is a right tributary of the Moselotte, and thus a sub-tributary of the Rhine via the Moselotte and the Moselle. It is long.  Geography  The Bouchot rises in the Massif des Vosges, on a flank of the T√™te de Grouvelin, a peak located within the commune of G√©rardmer in the Bas-Rupts section. The Bouchot is thus also known as the ruisseau des Hauts-Rupts from its source to its confluence with the ruisseau des Bas-Rupts. It flows through Rochesson, follows Gerbamont, then flows into Sapois where the ruisseau de Menaurupt joins its right bank. After flowing through Vagney, it joins the right bank of the Moselotte. At Gerbamont, it cascades at the Saut du Bouchot, a waterfall that is high.  Hydrology  The hydrological discharge of the Bouchot, measured at its confluence with the Moselle, is for a watershed of . The runoff curve number in the watershed is , which is very high, a characteristic shared with other rivers in the Vosges region. It is more than three times higher than the average for France including all basins, and also larger by a wide margin than the French basin of the Moselle, which is at Hauconcourt downstream of Metz Banque Hydro - Station A7930610 - The Moselle at Hauconcourt ).

Along with St. Joseph Co-Cathedral in Thibodaux it is the seat of the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux. History St. Francis de Sales Parish was founded around 1847 by the Rev. Z√©phyrin L√©v√™que. Mass was initially celebrated in the Terrebonne Parish courthouse. The first church building was completed in 1848 and construction on the present church was begun in 1936 under the direction of the Rev. August Vandebilt. While the first St. Francis de Sales church was built in the Romanesque style in 1848, The current building was built as the parish Church of St. Francis de Sales in 1938 as the original structure was damaged by a Hurricane in the 1920s. The current building was made possible by the generosity of the Rev. August Vandebilt. The Sisters of the Marianites of the Holy Cross arrived at the parish church in 1870 to begin the first Catholic School in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. The sisters lived in a convent that was built for them on the church grounds. During the first 20 years of the Sister's stay in Houma they taught at the predecessor to St. Francis School, the Houma Academy, which was located on Point Street, and only instructed girls. It wasn't until 1890 that the Sisters founded a school for the boys. The two storied wooden school was situated on the same ground that the present day Youth Center/Gymnasuim and Rectory stands. The current school which houses grades k-7 and is co-ed was built to replace both schools and was completed in 1951 at a cost of over $600,000. The previous Houma Academy began to operate as a boys high school until the completion of Houma Central Catholic High School in 1965. The School was renamed in 1966 to Vandebilt Catholic High School to honor the late Fr. August Vandebilt's commitment to Catholic Education in the area. The Sister's long history at the Cathedral parish and school sadly came to a close in 2011 as the last religious sister, Sr. Immaculata Paisant, Superintendent of Catholic Schools for the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux retired from her position and returned to the motherhouse in New Orleans, LA. While their presence has faded their legacy and dedication will forever mold the schools identity. The current church plant includes the main church building, the youth center and gymnasium, the convent, the school, the rectory and the historic cemetery, St. Francis de Sales Cemetery #1. There is a second cemetery located on Main Street that is under the care of the cathedral parish by the name of St. Francis de Sales Cemetery #2 The currently unoccupied convent is undergoing renovation by the Diocesan office of Vocations to serve as a Vocations resource center. The Cathedral Parish hosts a variety of ministries including a local chapter of the Knights of Columbus, a fraternal organization for Catholic men.

Coverage included news, politics, arts, and culture reporting in print and online formats. The publication is owned by Stephens Media Group but was formerly owned by Wick Communications. Its primary competitors were Las Vegas Weekly (founded in 1998) and Vegas Seven (founded in 2010). Publication ceased on January 30, 2014. Its editor, Scott Dickensheets, took the position in February 2011 after then-Editor Steve Sebelius returned to the Las Vegas Review-Journal as a political columnist. Former managing editors include Larry Lane, Bill Hughes, Geoff Schumacher, Hugh Jackson, Matthew O'Brien and Steve Sebelius. Former writers include Sarah Jane Woodall, Chad Plummer, Launce Rake, Pj Perez, Heidi Walters, Amy Kingsley, Chip Mosher, George Knapp, Mike Prevatt, Cathy Scott and Quentin Bufogle. Syndicated columns included Savage Love and Free Will Astrology by Rob Brezsny. O'Brien expanded a feature article for CityLife about killer TJ Weber, who hid in the storm tunnels until his arrest, into the book Beneath the Neon. In September 2006, CityLife earned more awards than the other weekly newspapers in the state in the Nevada Press Association's annual Better Newspapers Contest, which competed against 40 weekly NPA member publications.  History  An older version of the CityLife banner. The precursor to CityLife was a publication called the Las Vegas New Times. Started in September 1992, Las Vegas New Times was quickly sold to Wick Communications. On August 1, 1996, the name was changed to Las Vegas CityLife to avoid legal conflicts with another publication, the Phoenix New Times. Rod Smith published the paper from August 1998 to January 2002. Over the course of the newspaper's history, two large Las Vegas casino corporations, the MGM and Station Casinos, pulled their advertising because of news stories about their properties and managers which the businesses felt were condemnatory. Rod Smith, the publisher at the time, called the actions of the MGM, in particular, \\"petty private censorship.\\" In March 2004, Portland-based designer Kat Topaz redesigned the CityLife logo and layout to give the publication an updated feel. The current design is the work of Maureen Adamo. The offices of CityLife were currently housed alongside the Las Vegas Review-Journal building, at 1111 W. Bonanza Road, Las Vegas, NV, 89106. Formerly, the paper was located on Pama Lane in Green Valley, Henderson, and before that, on Wynn Road near Chinatown, Las Vegas. In 2009, CityLife was accepted for membership in the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, an organization of alternative weekly newspapers in the United States and Canada. The newspaper had applied unsuccessfully for membership in 2007. In 2010, the newspaper won a first-place award from AAN in the \\"format buster\\" category for a report on disparate redevelopment spending between downtown Las Vegas and the heavily minority West Las Vegas area. Staffers recognized for the award were Amy Kingsley, Maureen Adamo and videographer Justin Yurkanin. In Jan., 2014, the paper ceased production, and shut down its website a year later.  Recurring features  Recurring features in CityLife included: *\\"CityLife Picks,\\" top event listings for the week *\\"Best of the Valley,\\" a yearly listing of readers' top choices for favorite restaurants and other venues in various categories *\\"On The Scene,\\" a short feature about a top clubbing or event pick for the week *\\"Fear and Lounging,\\" a weekly music performance pick *\\"Dining Out,\\" a weekly restaurant pick *\\"Socrates in Sodom,\\" opinion piece written by an experienced Clark County educator  Publication information  Las Vegas CityLife was free to the public and went to press every Wednesday for publication and distribution citywide on Thursdays. As of September 2011, circulation was 70,000 copies per week at more than 2,200 sites, including University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Barnes & Noble, Terrible Herbst, and 7-11.

United States, 226 F. 145 (4th Cir., 1915), is a United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, case in which a Syrian immigrant, George Dow, appealed two lower court decisions denying his application for naturalization as a United States citizen. Following the lower court decisions in Ex Parte Dow (1914) and In re Dow (1914), Dow v. United States resulted in the Circuit Court's affirmation of the petitioner's right to naturalize based, in the words of Circuit Judge Woods, on ‚Äúthe generally received opinion . . . that the inhabitants of a portion of Asia, including Syria, [are] to be classed as white persons‚Äù.Dow v. United States. Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit. 14 Sept. 1915. Nexis Lexis Academic. Web. 28 Sept. 2011. George Dow's gauntlet through the American legal system, and the language with which his petition for citizenship was dealt, illustrate the degree to which legal bodies struggled to classify new groups of immigrants in a racial schema which would ultimately determine these immigrants‚Äô right to become American citizens. Race-based immigration law before Dow v. United States Racial limitations to American immigration originated with the Naturalization Act of 1790, which defined eligibility for citizenship as confined to ‚Äúany alien, being a free white person who shall have resided within the limits . . . of the United States for a term of two years‚Äù. While the abolition of slavery resulted in a codicil to this policy in 1870, granting people ‚Äúof African nativity or African descent‚Äù the right to naturalize, a series of prohibitive laws including the Page Law of 1875, the Asian Exclusion Act of 1882, and the Alien Contract Labor Law of 1885 further restricted immigration from Asia based on race and class ideology. The Asian Exclusion Act, as noted by Erika Lee, is remarkable for ‚Äúestablish[ing] Chinese‚Äîcategorized by their race, class, and gender relations as the ultimate category of undesirable immigrants‚Äîas the models by which to measure the desirability (and ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù) of other immigrant groups\\". It is precisely this metric of ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù which would be contested in dozens of court cases asserting the right of immigrants who did not fit neatly into a black/white racial schema to naturalize. =Naturalization cases prior to Dow v. United States= Several naturalization cases prior to Dow v. United States were decided based on what historian Ian Haney Lopez called the applicants‚Äô ‚Äúracial prerequisites‚Äù. Within these cases, judicial opinion as to how to appropriately measure a petitioner's ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù was split between justices using ‚Äú‚ÄôCommon knowledge‚Äô rationales, appeal[ing] to popular, widely held conceptions of races and racial divisions‚Äù, and ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù rationales, which ‚Äújustified racial divisions by reference to the naturalistic studies of humankind‚Äù. Both rationales were used to exclude applicants for naturalization in the case of In re Ah Yup 1878, as well as in the United States Supreme Court case Ozawa v. United States. =Syrian immigration cases prior to Dow v. United States= In the case of Syrian immigration, the ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of applicants had been affirmed in In re Najour (1909), In re Mudarri (1910), In re Ellis (1910), and Ex Parte Shahid. In the case of In re Najour, the petitioner's application for citizenship was granted based on a \\"scientific evidence\\" rationale. In his opinion on the case, District Judge Newman argued that the term ‚Äúfree white persons,‚Äù ‚Äú refers to race, rather than to color, and fair or dark complexion should not be allowed to control, provided the person seeking naturalization comes within the classification of the white or Caucasian race‚Äù.In Re Najour. Circuit Court, N.D. Georgia. 1 Dec. 1909. Lexis Nexis Academic. Web. 28 Sept. 2011 Conversely, both Ex Parte Shahid and Ex Parte Dow were decided using ‚Äúcommon knowledge‚Äù rhetoric. In Ex Parte Shahid District Judge Henry Smith, although ultimately denying Shahid's application based on the petitioner's illiteracy, also alluded to racial ineligibility, writing with regard to the naturalization act of 1790, ‚Äúit is safest to follow the reasonable construction of the statute . . . and understand it as restricting the words \\"free white persons\\" to mean persons as then understood to be of European habitancy or descent‚Äù.Ex Parte Shahid. District Court, E.D. South Carolina. 24 June 1913. Lexis Nexis Academic. Web. 28 Sept. 2011., p. 9-10 Ex Parte Dow Ex Parte Dow was decided on February 18, 1914, in District Court, E.D. South Carolina. The same presiding District Judge who had ruled a year earlier in Ex Parte Shahid denied Dow's application for citizenship based on a rejection of the ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù that Syrians are Caucasian. In his opinion on the case, District Judge Smith states with regard to the association of ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù with Caucasian, ‚Äúit is based upon a construction which would exclude some people generally known and termed as white, and include those who have been always considered as not forming a part of the white race‚Äù.Ex Parte Dow. District Court, E.D. South Carolina. 18 Feb. 1914. Nexis Lexis Academic. Web. 28 Sept. 2011. While the Judge admits that, unlike in the case of Ex Parte Shahid, the applicant had, ‚Äúperformed all the necessary formalities and would apparently from his intelligence and degree of information of a general character be entitled to naturalization‚Äù, he ultimately rejects Dow's petition for naturalization based on the fact that, ‚Äúthe applicant is not that particular free white person to whom the act of Congress has donated the privilege of citizenship in this country with its accompanying duties and responsibilities‚Äù. In re Dow Following the ruling in Ex Parte Dow, members of Charleston, South Carolina‚Äôs Syrian population organized fundraising and awareness campaigns to raise support for a judicial appeal. The resulting case, In re Dow, was decided on April 15, 1914 and followed the same ideological conflict between ‚Äúscientific‚Äù and ‚Äúcommon‚Äù knowledge‚Äù of race. Arguments on behalf of the applicant focused on a contemporary understanding of anthropology and race which posited that Syrians are members of a ‚ÄúSemitic nation,‚Äù and are therefore entitled to inclusion as members of the ‚Äú‚ÄôCaucasian‚Äô or white race‚Äù.In Re Dow. District Court, E.D. South Carolina. 15 Apr. 1914. Lexis Nexis Academic. Web. 28 Sept. 2011. District Judge Henry Smith again demurred from this line of reasoning based on the assumption that, ‚Äú‚ÄôWhite persons,‚Äù . . . to the average citizen of the United States in 1790, would have meant Europeans . . .‚Äù. Using this ‚Äúcommon knowledge‚Äù conceptualization of race, District Judge Henry Smith once again rejected George Dow's application for citizenship. Dow v. United States In re Dow was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, and decided on September 14, 1915, as Dow v. United States. As in the two earlier cases in which application for citizenship was denied, the presiding judge in Dow v. United States accepted that, by the standards of the Naturalization Act of 1790, people of non-European descent would have been considered non-white and thus unable to naturalize as citizens of the United States. However, by merit of the fact that the standard of ‚Äúfree white persons‚Äù had been renewed in an 1875 immigration law, the presiding judge argued that contemporary understandings of racial definition could be admitted in cases focused on the ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of the applicant. Citing scientific evidence and congressional intent, the presiding judge argued that, ‚ÄúAt the date of the new acts and amendments . . . it seems to be true beyond question that the generally received opinion was that the inhabitants of a portion of Asia, including Syria, were to be classed as white persons,‚Äù thereby overturning the lower court's decision to deny George Dow's application for U.S. citizenship.

Its commanding general was Luigi Sibille. In September 1940, the 1st Libyan Division participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt. On September 13 the entire 1st Libyan Division, including a regiment of Libyan paratroopers attacked Sollum on the Egyptian northern coast, held by platoons of Coldstream Guards. The British laid mines in the area and quickly withdrew to Marsa Matruh after suffering 50 casualties. In December the British started a counter-offensive. The Arabs and paratroopers of 1st Libyan Division fought hard on the December 10, 1940, amid a howling sandstorm, until on December 11 the division began to disintegrate with heavy losses. The division had dug in at Maktila near Sidi Barrani and was forced to surrender after heavy fighting during Operation Compass.Walker, Ian W. (2003).

It sits on the boundary between the former parishes of Llanfihangel Penbedw and Castellan Chapelry (part of Penrydd parish). Lying one mile to the north of Crymych, Blaenffos has an average elevation of , lying on the western slopes of Y Frenni which at is the most easterly peak in the Preseli Hills. The village straddles the A478 former drovers' road which runs from Cardigan in Ceredigion south to Tenby, is surrounded by farmland, and is in the heart of Welsh-speaking Pembrokeshire with a rich history and associated folklore. Origin of name According to Thomas Morgan (1912), Blaenffos takes its name \\"from a farmhouse so called, signifying the head of the ditch\\" (Welsh: blaen ff√¥s). A farm bearing this name still exists to the west of the village. History, tradition and folklore Local evidence indicates that the area that is now Blaenffos would have been farmed at least as far back as the Bronze Age over 3,000 years ago, and possibly earlier. Bronze Age barrows are still visible on nearby Frenni Fawr. Richard Fenton, who visited Frenni Fawr in the early 19th century to excavate the barrows recorded the tradition of a treasure-chest hidden on the hill, guarded by a horrible spectre. It was said that the spectre would rise and protect the treasure if any attempt was made to remove it. View of Frenni Fawr from Clover Hill The Roman Empire reached West Wales in about 70 AD, though no Roman archaeology is known to exist in the village. Pembrokeshire Local Action Network for Enterprise and Development (PLANED) quotes: In the Mabinogi tale \\"Breuddwyd Macsen\\" (The Dream of Maxen), the Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus is said to have made camp on the Frenni Fawr. The hill was apparently known locally as Cadair Macsen until relatively recent times. PLANED also quotes the myth that: The Tylwyth Teg or Fairy Folk were believed to frequent the Frenni Fawr in the past. There is a local tale of a shepherd boy who was taken by them to their own country, where he was allowed to stay providing that he did not drink from a particular well. Curiosity eventually got the better of him and upon drinking the water he found himself back on the slopes of the Frenni Fawr. Christianity grew in the area from about the 5th century. The boundary between the former parishes of Llanfihangel Penbedw and Castellan Chapelry (part of Penrydd) runs through the old centre of the village at the bottom of the hill. From the 17th century, land began to be enclosed and road networks, including the Tenby-Cardigan turnpike running through the village, were improved in the 18th century. Livestock on the road outside Rh√¥s Inn, c.1900 The road running through Blaenffos formed part of a drovers' road moving local and Irish livestock as far away as England, a practice driven by demand for centuries. To service this industry it is rumoured that there were at one time five public houses in the village but by 1900 only three remained: The Rh√¥s Inn (run in 1911 by Benjamin James, a grocer and dealer), New House and New Inn. New House was closed in 1914 under the Defence of the Realm Act, with compensation of ¬£400 paid and New Inn existed at least until 1918; these three pubs subsequently became private dwellings. Hafod, an early cottage As well as the Baptist Chapel (see below) two post-mediaeval buildings in Blaenffos were noted by the 2008 Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales \\\\- Hafod, a two- roomed stone cottage standing by the main road and Rafel, a substantial house with a (modern) plaque stating \\"1784\\". Rafel was listed Grade II by Cadw in 1987. Another Grade II listed building is Llain-ddu, an early 19th century single-storey cottage to the east of the village. Blaenffos was recorded on an early 20th-century Ordnance Survey map as Blaen-ff√¥s but was inhabited at least as early as 1785 when the Baptist Chapel was built. At least 10 properties are marked on the Ordnance Survey's first series of maps (1805), one building being annotated Blaenyffoes-isa (English: Lower Blaenffos) in approximately the position of what was later called New House, though Blaenffos is not named as a village. Distinctive among the almost exclusively Welsh names in the village is Clover Hill where the main road climbs southwards out of the village. The name existed as early as the 1850s but the origin of this English name is unknown. It may refer to a quarry (cloddfa); there were small examples in the vicinity. It does not appear on the first Ordnance Survey of 1805. In 1889 the \\"compact and valuable\\" Clover Hill Farm, comprising house, shop, outbuildings and 13 acres, 3 roods, 19 poles of land (5.6 hectares) was sold at auction for ¬£515. Blaenffos was relatively remote even towards the end of the 19th century: resident Dan Evans froze to death after losing his way in the snow trying to get home after dark in January 1887. The Whitland and Cardigan Railway, nicknamed Cardi Bach (Little Cardi), passed through the village between the stations at Crymych and Boncath; this part of the line was laid in 1886. In February 1886 the press reported that Mr Samuel, Railway Cashier at Boncath, had given the children of Blaenffos School (see Education, below) a magic lantern entertainment. Boncath railway station did not open until September that year. The line was closed in 1963 and the track lifted by the end of 1964. The remains of the cuttings can still be seen, but there was no halt at Blaenffos. People of Blaenffos did not escape the First World War; a regional newspaper carried an advertisement and photograph placed by a mother appealing for news of her son who was missing while serving with the Welsh Regiment. He had died six months earlier at the Battle of Gaza and his name appears with those of other local servicemen on the Crymych War Memorial. There was a Blaenffos branch of the Cardigan and District temperance movement; the Pembrokeshire Records Office holds the singing festival minute book of 1925-1969 (document reference number HDX/1729). A temperance meeting on Y Frenni in 1875 was attended by an estimated 2,000 people. With the conversion of civil parishes to communities in 1974, Blaenffos became part of the community of Boncath. The village saw a building boom in the 21st century from the old centre southwards along the main road on Clover Hill. Worship alt=Gravestones in grassed-over graveyard with white-painted chapel in the background Blaenffos Baptist Chapel (Capel y Bedyddwyr Blaenffos) in the ancient chapelry of Castellan in Penrhydd (variously spelled Penrith/Penrieth/Pen-Rydd/Penrhudd) parish in the Hundred of Kilgerran was originally built in 1765 or 1785. The noted preacher Christmas Evans recorded that 20 people had been baptised in 1791. The chapel was renovated/rebuilt in 1807. In 1831 a petition for the abolition of slavery was presented to the House of Lords signed by ministers and members of the congregation of the chapel in common with hundreds of other nonconformist bodies throughout Great Britain, helping to pave the way to the Abolition of Slavery Act two years later. Baptismal pool In 1851 The Religious Census listed the minister as James David Thomas. The present chapel dates from 1855. In 1917 the Reverend Aaron Morgan celebrated 25 years as pastor of the chapel. The chapel was Grade II listed by Cadw (ID:15382) in 1995 and was completely renovated in 2005, retaining the original outdoor baptismal pool. Education alt=Grey stone chapel-style building with white window surrounds Bwrdd Ysgol Blaenffos (English: Blaenffos Board School) opened in March 1879, an event attended by several hundred people. Before this, the school had been held in the vestry of the Baptist Chapel. The first headteacher was Mr W Hughes (tenure 1879-1913). After local education authorities were established under the Education Act 1902 the school became a county primary. In 1935 Waldo Williams taught at the school for a week while the head teacher was away. The school closed in 2004 and the 28 pupils transferred to Ysgol y Frenni Community Primary School in Crymych. The buildings were converted to domestic dwellings in 2012/13. Lon Vaughan, a former pupil, has produced a bilingual book on the 125-year history of the school from the school's original records. Notable people James Arthur Davies OBE (1923-2007), ex-RAF and educationalist, lived in Blaenffos as a child. Professor David Evans (1888-1968), academic and author, was born in Blaenffos and spent World War I in Ruhleben. William Roberts (1862-1912), local composer noted for Bryngogarth, is buried in the cemetery. Claire Jones, former harpist to the Prince of Wales, grew up locally and was married in Blaenffos in 2012. Paul Davies AM, (born 1969), Member of the Welsh Assembly, lives in Blaenffos. Today Blaenffos in January 2013 The village has a general store, the village's only retail premises, which stands by the building that was the Rh√¥s Inn. There are various small businesses, including holiday lets, located in and around the village. Blaenffos is surrounded by farmland supporting sheep- and cattle-rearing. Housing is a mixture of older brick or stone dwellings and newer timber-framed houses and bungalows. The Cardigan to Carmarthen 230 bus service runs through the village. Blaenffos retains a strong Welsh identity with 64 per cent of the population being able to speak Welsh, compared with 19 per cent of the population of Wales as a whole. 68 per cent of Blaenffos's population were born in Wales, with 29 per cent having been born in England. 68 per cent of residents claimed some Welsh identity according to the 2011 census. Administratively, Blaenffos falls within Llanfihangel Ward of Boncath Community.

Since the withdrawal of the Royal Navy, the Royal Ceylon Navy took over dockyard. It became the home base of the RCyN fleet and today it is home to the Eastern Naval Command and the Naval and Maritime Academy of the Sri Lanka Navy.Defence Secretary rewards winners of Year Five Scholarship History Navy House official residence of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, located in SLN Dockyard Trincomalee which is a natural deep-water harbour that has attracted seafarers like Marco Polo, Ptolemy and traders from China and East Asia since ancient times. Trinco, as it is commonly called, has been a sea port since the days of the ancient Sri Lankan Kings. The earliest known reference to the port of Gokanna is found in the Mahavamsa stating that in the 5th century BC, when King Vijaya who having failed to convince his brother to come to Sri Lanka as his successor, got down his youngest son Panduvasdeva, who landed at Gokanna and was subsequently enthroned at Upatissagama. King Parakramabahu I used Gokanna (Trincomalee) as his eastern port, to launch a successful invasion of Burma in the 12th century. During the colonial expansion into the Indian Ocean, Trincomalee was occupied by the Portuguese, Dutch, French and finally by the British who used the natural harbour extensively. The Portuguese built a fort to control the area and the Dutch expanded and built another to protect the harbour. The largest of these is Fort Fredrick built in 1624 by the Portuguese and exchanged hands until the British took over it in 1795. The smaller Fort Ostenburg was built on top of Ostenburg ridge at the entrance to the inner harbour of Trincomalee. The British used Trincomalee has an anchorage for Royal Navy ships in the Indian Ocean. With switch to steam powered ships from the age of sailing, the Royal Navy established a coaling station in Trincomalee as part of their large network of support bases throughout the empire. This was the begin of a permanent Royal Navy shore establishment in Trinco. With the beginning of the 20th century size of the Royal Naval Dockyard of Trincomalee grew as the facilities were increased during and after World War I. A large tank farm was built close to the dockyard store fuel oil of any size fleet, along with dry docks and maintenance facilities to support any ship of the Royal Navy. Due to the increase in personnel on shore and from visiting ships the Royal Naval Hospital Trincomalee was established within the yard. In 1920, the British began deploying coastal artillery on the Ostenburg ridge, which was within the dockyard to protect the entrance to the Trincomalee harbor which had now become a major Royal Navy base in the far east. Mounted on the ridge was a battery of three BL 6 inch Mk VII naval guns manned by the personal of Coastal Regiments of the Royal Artillery. At same time the first purpose built military airfield was built across the harbor, near the China Bay. The Royal Air Force station of RAF China Bay was soon operational to provide air defense to Trincomalee. With the out set of World War II, Trincomalee's defences were boosted the installation of two BL 9.2 inch Mk IX‚ÄìX guns and anti aircraft batteries manned by the Royal Artillery and the Ceylon Garrison Artillery. With the fall of Singapore, Trincomalee dockyard home port for the newly formed Eastern Fleet under the command of Admiral Sir James Somerville. Although he found good facilities, the inadequate air defenses prompted Somerville to move the fleet to a secret base in Addu Atoll. With Chuichi Nagumo's Indian Ocean raid in April 1942 these fears were born out. Following the Easter Sunday Raid on Colombo on 9 April, the Japanese attacked the dockyard at Trincomalee. , HMAS Vampire and the Flower-class corvette were sunk. HMS Hermes was undergoing repairs in Trincomalee harbour in April 1942. As a result of the advance warning of the impending attack by the Japanese, Hermes left Trincomalee, minus the 12 Fairey Swordfish Mk Is of 814 Naval Air Squadron, disembarked. A Japanese reconnaissance plane spotted Hermes off Batticaloa, and 70 Japanese bombers attacked the defenceless Hermes forty times. The carrier sank with the loss of 307 sailors. The RAF lost at least eight Hurricanes and the FAA one Fairey Fulmar. The Japanese lost five bombers and six fighters, one in a suicide attack on the Trincomalee fuel tanks. Seven hundred people lost their lives in the attack on Trincomalee. According to eye witness Michael Tomlinson (author of The Most Dangerous Moment and RAF Station Intelligence Officer at Ratmalana and later at China Bay in Trincomalee), one Japanese flyer deliberately crashed his plane into one of the giant fuel tanks just north of China Bay aerodrome. The Eastern Fleet return to Trincomalee in late 1942. Operation Diplomat, a training exercise, took place in late March, 1944. The objective was for the fleet to rendezvous with a group of tankers (escorted by HNLMS Tromp) and practice refuelling at sea procedures. They then rendezvoused with United States Navy Task Force 58.5, the and three destroyers, and returned to Trincomalee on 31 March. The U.S. task force had been detached to the Indian Ocean to bolster local air defences and also to impart necessary procedures to FAA aircrew, which was done over two or three days' intensive activity at sea. Sources for the dates of return to Trincomalee and the joint US/UK training differ. In 1944, a wireless station HMS Highflyer was established in Trincomalee. The Royal Navy presence in Ceylon came to an end in 1956, when Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike requested the removal of all British service personnel from the island. The dockyard was taken over by the Royal Ceylon Navy and became the home port for its newly established fleet. During Black July and Sri Lankan civil war, many sailors from this base rioted and destroyed property around the base.

Synopsis Based in a small town in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster is a story packed with intrigue betrayal and ambition between a beautiful Raani (Mahi Gill), her Raja husband (Jimmy Sheirgill) and an ambitious young man Babloo (Randeep Hooda). The Raja and his Raani live in their ancestral royal house trying to maintain the status and structure their ancestors had left behind. But due to the changing times, some extreme financial conditions and the long- gone habit of a royal having a mistress, Raja tries hard to maintain his status and financial conditions. His rival political party, belonging to Gainda Singh (Vipin Sharma), is on a constant mission to eliminate the Raja and his allies, to get a hold of the administration, which has been with this royal family for decades. Eventually, he is left with just one ally, Kanahiya (Deepraj Rana), who is Saheb's most trusted and dangerous servant.

Description Nymph Pholidoptera griseoaptera can reach a body length of 11 to 21 mm (males) and 15 to 20 mm (females), much smaller than the similar Pholidoptera aptera. The sickle-shaped and upward curved ovipositor of the females is 8 to 10 millimeters long, while the males have two short cerci. The basic coloration of the body is gray to dark brown, rarely reddish-brown or yellow-brown. The sides of the pronotum have white edges, while the underbelly is yellow. The antennae and the hind legs are quite long. This species is almost wingless. The rounded wings of the males are brown with light brown to ocher-colored edges and are about five millimeters in length, about as long as the pronotum. The females are wingless or have half-round, gray-brown forewings, but they are only one to two millimeters long. Long- winged forms do not occur. Behavior The adults are omnivorous, feeding primarily on small insects such as aphids and caterpillars, but eat also plants such as bramble (Rubus species), dandelion (Taraxacum species) and nettles (Urtica species). The stridulation is a brief and penetrating sound, repeatedly irregularly night and day. The females lay their eggs in the soil, in dead branches, in bark crevices and rotting wood. The eggs need high humidity. The larvae require two years for their full development, with seven larval stages. They feed exclusively on vegetables. Nymphs appear at the end of April of the third year, while the first adults appear in June. Distribution This species can be found in Europe from northern Spain and Ireland up to Crimea, Caucasus and the Near East. It is fairly common in Great Britain. Habitat The dark bush-cricket colonizes a variety of habitats, but avoids sandy soils and are accordingly rare in sandy areas. It is mainly present in forest edges or clearings, but can be found also in wasteland, parks and gardens, at an elevation of about above sea level.

Biography =Business and political career= McKenzie was born and reared on a farm in Macon County, Georgia. Following graduation from high school, he owned and operated a general store. In 1902 McKenzie moved to the Florida Panhandle and became joint owner of a naval stores business with 75 employees. McKenzie was the first in the area to use the innovative and less wasteful ‚Äúturpentine cup‚Äù method for collecting pine tree resin.Notes of an interview with Anne McKenzie Morton, c. 1956, Bob Jones University Archives; Eileen Cvitkovich, Bay County (Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2000), 21, 70. On the advantage of the turpentine cup extraction method, see Shield Magazine, 5 (November 1907), 332-33. In 1904 McKenzie purchased waterfront property on St. Andrews Bay and cooperated with other businessmen in developing the town that they called Panama City with the aspiration that it become a port of entry for goods arriving via the planned Panama Canal.Marlene Womack, The Bay Country of Northwest Florida (privately printed, 1998), 127-28. After Panama City was incorporated in 1909, McKenzie was elected the first mayor. He also served two terms (1909-1913) as a representative from Washington County in the Florida House of Representatives. In 1913, McKenzie succeeded in his efforts to have Panama City named the seat of Bay County, which he had also helped to create. During World War II, McKenzie served as Chairman of the Bay County Chapter of the Red Cross (1941-44) and as a member of the Selective Service Board (1940-47).

The bunker was built between 1937 and 1939 in the area of the so-called Stalag () as a signal Intelligence centre. The code name for the bunker was Amt 500, i.e., (Postal) Office 500. The structure consisted of a two-lane longitudinal building with measurements of 117m √ó 22m with an associated three-storey annex measuring 57m √ó 40m. After several project changes, a third entrance was added in 1938.

The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, The Evidence, The Truth, p. 79. Midday 20 April the OKH evacuated to Eiche near Potsdam and OKW to Krampnitz, and the Russians arrived in the afternoon, finding the site empty apart from four German soldiers. Cold War era The two Maybach bunkers were largely destroyed by the Soviet Armed Forces in late 1946, according to the stipulations of the four-power agreement on the occupation of Germany and an Allied Control Council order, although some buildings survived, including the almost entirely intact separate communications bunker Zeppelin. The Zeppelin bunker later formed part of the Soviet Cold war era installations in W√ºnsdorf under the name Ranet. Further bunker installations were subsequently added to house the central command and communications functions of the Soviet Army in the GDR. The area was demilitarised in 1994 when the last Russian troops left Germany. Present day remains, exhibition and pop culture references The ruins of the above-ground bunker entrance houses remain. The area can be accessed by guided tours, and a museum in the W√ºnsdorf Book Town houses exhibits on the military history of the town and the bunker complexes.

King Menelik II did not allow the sale of lands belonging to Ethiopia to Italians (Eritrea) and probably allowed France (Djibouti) to solidify his centralized power and have external trading partners. Most of the Italians moved to Ethiopia after the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936. Italian Ethiopia was made of Harrar, Galla-Sidamo, Amhara and Scioa Governorates in summer 1936 and became a part of the Italian colony Italian East Africa, with capital Addis AbebaItalian Addis Abeba and with Victor Emmanuel III proclaiming himself Emperor of Ethiopia. History The 1880s were marked by the so-called \\"Scramble for Africa\\" and the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85. When the Italians began to vie with the British and French for influence in the area. Asseb, a port near the southern entrance of the Red Sea, was bought by in March 1870 from the local Afar sultan, vassal to the Ethiopian Emperor, by an Italian company, which by 1890 led to the Italian colony of Eritrea being established. From then on, the Kingdom of Italy had traded and set up large tracts of farm land up to the borders with Ethiopia. As the Italian colonists moved further inland from the agreed upon borders of Eritrea which had been agreed upon in the Treaty of Wuchale, Emperor Menelik II saw this as an invasion of his country, whereas the Italian King Umberto of Italy referred to Article 17 of the treaty to justify Italian claims to the land. Conflicts between the two countries resulted in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, whereby the Ethiopians defeated Italy and remained independent, under the rule of Menelik II. At the time, Italy had only been unified for less than a few decades, and support for the war was minimal, especially among Southern Italians who were forcibly conscripted. Anti-war riots and demonstrations broke out across Italy and in the city of Pavia the population came out to blockade the railroad to prevent Italian troops from leaving for Ethiopia. Many Italian prisoners of war were treated very well, and many given over to noble families for work on their estates, while others with specialized skills were used in the construction of the newly formed capital of Addis Ababa, such as St George's Cathedral. Italy and Ethiopia signed a provisional treaty of peace on 26 October 1896. Shortly after the Fascist government under Benito Mussolini forcibly came to power, he began a campaign to expand the African colonial possessions of Italy in the 1930s. In October 1935, Mussolini launched the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and invaded Ethiopia. Emperor Haile Selassie went exile to avert the genocide in the hands of Italians in war and appeal to the society of the nations the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on 2 May 1936 and the Fascists entered the city on 5 May, after several bloody battles which included the Fascist army's use of mustard gas in battle against the Geneva Protocol of 1929 (of which Italy was a signatory). Victory was announced on 9 May 1936 and Mussolini declared the creation of the \\"Italian Empire\\". The Italians merged Eritrea, Italian Somalia, and newly occupation Ethiopia into Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, A.O.I.). Among the war crimes committed under the orders of Mussolini was the robbing of one of the so-called Axum Obelisks\\"To Rome and back: The return of an obelisk\\", Lena Blosat, 2005(properly termed a 'stele' or, in the local Afro-Asiatic languages, hawelt/hawelti as its form is not topped by a pyramid). The Italian King Victor Emmanuel III added Emperor of Ethiopia to his titles, a title not welcomed by the many nations that were part of the society of the nations. Detailed map of Italian Ethiopia in 1936 (click to enlarge) From 1936 to the start of World War II Mussolini controlled much of Ethiopia, but a guerrilla war raged in areas of Ethiopia still controlled by resistance ethiopian linked to Haile Selassie (who was exiled in Great Britain) and the royal family remaining in Ethiopia, including the efforts of Ras Imru Haile Selassie who was captured on December 19, 1936 and taken to prison on the Island of Ponza until freed after the Armistice of Cassibile During Italian occupation According to official statistics of the Italian government, in October 1939 the Italian Ethiopians were 35,441, of whom 30,232 male (85.3%) and 5,209 female (14.7%), most of them living in urban areas.Italian emigration to Ethiopia in the 1930s (in Italian) Only 3,200 Italian farmers moved to colonize farm areas, mainly because of the danger of Ethiopian guerrilla (still controlling nearly 1/4 of Ethiopia highlands as of 1940). Ethiopia (divided between the administrative provinces of Scioa, Oromo, Sidamo, Harar, and Amara) was part of the Italian Empire from 1936 to 1941. The Italians constructed huge and expensive infrastructure projects, that drained the Italian economy but reduced in those years the unemployment in the Kingdom of Italy. They did 18,794 km (11,678 mi) of new roads asphalted: in 1940 Addis Ababa was connected by state-of-the-art roads to Asmara and Mogadishu called Via dell'Impero. Furthermore, 900 km (559 mi) of railways were reconstructed or initiated/planned (like the railway between Addis Abeba and Assab), dams and hydroelectric plants were built, and many public and private companies were established in the underdeveloped country. The most important were: \\"Compagnie per il cotone d'Etiopia\\" (Cotton industry); \\"Compagnia etiopica del latte e derivati\\" (Milk industry); \\"Cementerie d'Etiopia\\" (Cement industry); \\"Compagnia etiopica mineraria\\" (Minerals industry); \\"Impresse electriche d'Etiopia\\" (Electricity industry); \\"Compagnia etiopica degli esplosivi\\" (Armament industry); \\"Industria per la birra dell'AOI\\" (Beer industry); \\"Trasporti automobilistici (Citao)\\" (Mechanic & Transport industry). There was an urban project for the enlargement of Addis Ababa, but these architectural plans -like all the other developments- were stopped by World War II.Addis Abeba's 1939 Architectural plan After World War II After WWII, the Italian Ethiopians were given a full pardon by the newly returned Emperor Haile Selassie, as he saw the opportunity to continue the modernization efforts of the country.Photos and articles of Italoethiopians who took refuge in Italy He declared that no reprisals would be taken against the Italians, and many remained for decades, until the overthrow of the Emperor in the Ethiopian Civil War in 1974. Nearly 22,000 Italo-Ethiopians took refuge in Italy during the 1970s. Their main organization in Italy is the Associazione Italiana Profughi dall'Etiopia ed Eritrea (A.I.P.E.E.).Associazione Italiana Profughi dall'Etiopia ed Eritrea (AIPEE) In recent years, some Italian companies have returned to operate in Ethiopia, and a large number of Italian technicians and managers arrived with their families, residing mainly in the metropolitan area of the capital.https://dait.interno.gov.it/servizi-demografici Contemporary relations The Obelisk of Axum in Rome in 2002, before its repatriation. In the mid-1990s despite a previous arrangement with the Dergue regime under Menghistu in the 1970s to cede the Obelisk of Axum to Italy in exchange for medical facilities and forgiving an accumulated debt to the Italian government, a populist movement made up of Italians and Ethiopians (both in country and expatriates around the world) began to petition the then current Italian government to return the obelisk,Chicago Tribune,March 10, 2002 \\"Ethiopia Again Demands Italy Return Obelisk\\" an event which eventually culminated in its repatriation in 2005 to Axum, the city of its creation.The Guardian, 20 April, 2005 \\"Obelisk returned to Ethiopia after 68 years\\" Ethiopia has the largest concentration of Italian schools and cultural institutes in Africa (such as the Scuola Statale Italiana of Addis Abeba), which foster and promote Italian and Ethiopian culture and are free to the publicItalian Cultural Institute of Addis Ababa The Italian firm Salini CostruttoriGrand Renaissance Dam Project in Ethiopia was chosen by the Ethiopian government to design and build the Millennium or Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile river which when completed will be the largest dam and hydroelectric plant in Africa.

The rest of the series are preserved in various private collections. History The series The navigator's hope does not appear to have a direct connection with the life of the artist. Similar Mir√≥ works at similar times were clearly linked to contemporary events. For instance, The Hope of a Condemned Man was linked with the condemnation and execution of the revolutionary Salvador Puig Antich by General Franco's government, or his so-called burned paintings that may have been a reflection of the revolutionary events of May 1968. Between 1968 and 1973 Mir√≥ was in Mallorca. He consolidated his style and renewed his interest in Eastern culture as well as other interests. Jacques Dupin speaks of the influence that Japanese art had on Mir√≥ because he sees the lines as calligraphic gestures on patches of intense color. As explained Pilar Caba√±as in Universidad Complutense de Madrid, this influence was reciprocal, and came from far away. During the Surrealist Exhibition held in Tokyo in 1937, the Japanese artist Shuzo Takiguchi wrote the first critical Japanese Mir√≥. The two artists met and expressed their desire to establish some sort of collaboration but due to personal problems and Takiguchi's precarious state of health, this collaboration did not materialize until 1967, just a year before the first work of the series The navigator's hope. That year, the catalogue of the exhibition of Mir√≥'s Maeght gallery several poems are illustrated by Mir√≥ himself, including a Takiguchi. During the following years and until the mid seventies, Mir√≥ and Takiguchi collaborated on several occasions.Cabins 1999  Series  { class = \\"wikitable sortable\\" ! Register ! Work ! Date !

The pictures were characterized by colourful graphics on a black or dark background. There are obvious similarities between the first two examples of the series The navigator's hope, corresponding to 1968, and the artist's work The hope of a condemned Man, especially in the gesture and the use of the relationship between figure and background. In contrast, other works of the series, corresponding to 1973, are much closer to the play La Chanson des voyelles, painted in 1966, kept in MoMA in New York City. Unlike Mir√≥ was used as the black paint on the Spanish Civil War as the black loses the drama that had reached and becomes a collection of subtle nuances which are displayed on lines and rounded shapes and white colors. In the latest works by increasing the number of thick lines, the black backgrounds are offset by large masses of color that gained prominence and the stroke is close to the Eastern calligraphy.

In 1974 NAMRU-5 was established as its own command and was housed in the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute(former Imperial Central Laboratory Research Institute). The mission of NAMRU-5 was to conduct research and development on infectious diseases of military importance in sub-Sahara Africa. Gambella became the focus of a major malaria control effort and studies on malaria immunology. Applied research focused on the general areas of insect repellents, insecticide resistance, insect attractants and louse control. Members of the NAMRU-5 staff were also among the last Americans to ever see smallpox before its eradication. NAMRU-5 built collaborative research efforts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; with local medical facilities, including the Haile Selassie University Medical School and various hospitals in Addis Ababa; and with the London School of Tropical Medicine, the University of Washington, Case Western Reserve University Department of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. NAMRU-5 was disestablished in April 1977 following the communist takeover of the government of Ethiopia which ordered all members out of the country in 4 days.

The history of the NPA dates back to 1888, when an association of Nevada newspapers was first organized. Mark Twain was a founding member at that time. In 1924, the organization officially became the Nevada State Press Association after a journalism professor at the University of Nevada, Reno spearheaded a reorganization campaign. The organization dropped the word \\"State\\" from its name in 1995, becoming simply the Nevada Press Association. The board of directors that governs the association is composed of 11 officers elected by member newspapers from around the state. Each year, the NPA hosts a Better Newspapers Contest in which member publications compete for first, second and third place in categories ranging from Best Feature to Journalist of Merit (given to journalists with less than five years of experience). The offices of the Nevada Press Association are located in the historic Rinckel Mansion. The mission statement of the association is as follows: \\"The Nevada Press Association is dedicated to representing the common interests of Nevada newspapers, furthering the public's right to know through an understanding that strong newspapers (protected by the First Amendment) are the cornerstone of a democratic society, promoting a closer fellowship within the newspaper fraternity, encouraging the elevation of journalistic standards and promoting the value of newspaper advertising.\\" http://www.nevadapress.com/nevadapress.com/Welcome.html NPA Member publications =Daily newspapers= * Elko Daily Free Press * Las Vegas Review-Journal * Las Vegas Sun * Reno Gazette-Journal * Nevada Appeal * Sparks Tribune =Non-daily newspapers= * Battle Mountain Bugle * Boulder City Review * Comstock Chronicle * Construction Notebook * Dayton Courier * Desert Valley Times * El Tiempo * Ely Times * Eureka Sentinel * Fernley Leader * Gaming Today * The Humboldt Sun * High Desert Advocate * VEGAS INC * Lahontan Valley News * Las Vegas Business Press * Las Vegas CityLife * Las Vegas Weekly * Lincoln County Record * Lovelock Review-Miner * Mason Valley News * Mesquite Local News * Mineral County Independent-News * Moapa Valley Progress * Nevada Legal News * Nevada Rancher * North Lake Tahoe Bonanza * Northern Nevada Business Weekly * Pahrump Valley Times * The Record-Courier * Reno News & Review * Sierra Sun * Tahoe Daily Tribune * Tahoe World * Tonopah Times- Bonanza * Vegas Seven * View * Virginia City News * Wells Progress * Wendover Times =Specialized publication= * Athlon Sports * CarsonNow.org * Construction Notebook * El Tiempo * Gaming Today * VEGAS INC * Las Vegas Business Press * Nevada Legal News * Nevada Magazine * The Nevada Rancher * Northern Nevada Business Weekly * Veterans Reporter * View References External links * Category:Newspaper associations Category:Organizations based in Nevada Category:Organizations established in 1888 ","title":"Nevada Press Association"},{"id":"33251700","text":"Harold Andrews may refer to: *Harold Andrews (footballer, born 1897) (1897‚Äì1984), English football forward, for Nelson, Merthyr Town and Exeter City in the 1920s *Harold Andrews (footballer, born 1903) (1903‚Äì1988), English football forward, for Lincoln City, Notts County, Barnsley, Luton Town & Accrington Stanley fl.1920s-1930s *Harold Andrews (politician) (1945‚Äì1995), broadcaster and politician in Newfoundland *Harold Marcus Ervine-Andrews (1911‚Äì1995), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross See also *Harry Andrews (1911‚Äì1989), English actor ","title":"Harold Andrews"},{"id":"33251726","text":"This a list of characters appearing in the Nickelodeon animated series Back at the Barnyard and its 2006 film Barnyard. Main characters =Otis= Otis (voiced by Chris Hardwick (series); Kevin James (film) is a cow who is the leader of the barnyard. Although an adult male, he does not take offense to being called a \\"cow\\", unlike Peck, who gets offended when someone calls him a \\"chicken\\" and thinks ‚Äúrooster\\" would be more respectful. This descrepancy is not explained in the series. Otis is a huge party animal and enjoys anything with action or stunts and enjoys watching sports bloopers. Unlike a real cow, he can voluntarily squirt milk out of his udders. In the episode \\"Cowman and Ratboy\\", Otis becomes a superhero named Cowman. He also appears as Cowman in the 1-hour special \\"Cowman, the Uddered Avenger\\".Some of his other aliases are \\"Professor Exposition\\", politician \\"Ned Bovine\\", newsman \\"Gil O'Malley\\", golfer Heifer Woods (punning off the famous golf star Tiger Woods) along with many other human disguises, and in the show's Christmas special, we learn he went to high school with two of Santa Claus' reindeer, Donner and Blitzen. He also plays a lot of pranks on the Farmer's neighbor Nora Beady. Otis makes a cameo in the pilot episode of Planet Sheen along with Pig. =Pip= Pip (voiced by Jeff Garcia) is a great, gray, barn mouse who speaks with a slight Mexican accent and often rides around on his best friend Otis' shoulder. He has a crush on Bessy, the sassy and sarcastic cow best friend of Abby, but she always rejects him. Pip's superhero ego is Ratboy, the sidekick of Cowman. Pip is not usually involved with the gang's crazy schemes as much as Freddy, Peck, Pig, etc. are, but still, he usually comes along for the ride. Pip's human disguise makes people question him, to which another animal says 'He's the world's smallest man!'. =Abby= Abby (voiced by Leigh Allyn Baker) is a female cow. Abby is also very athletic, allergic to petunias, has an obsessive-compulsive addiction for organizing, and loves cats. For some reason, she replaces Daisy. =Pig= Pig (voiced by Tino Insana) is a filthy, fat pig and is the only character in the show to be named after his own species. He is very gluttonous and would eat anything, and he does so uncontrollably. In several episodes, Pig has various segments on the show that often interrupt the episode at its most important parts, with a few memorable segments are \\"Viewer Mail\\", \\"Ask Dr. Pig\\", a makeover segment and \\"Hollywood: Fact or Fiction?\\", which serves as filler time when an episode story is slightly shorter than its air time. Pig has a strong, but quite strange, love for unicorns, and he wishes for one in the Christmas special, and is also the animal on the barnyard to dress up and disguise as humans the most times. He has a pet skunk named Skunky, and in one episode he is shown to sing in an angelic tenor. In another episode, after Pig sat on Pip's hand, it left a mark, and the animals believe that he is related to the pet pigs of Prince Fripplehoot, telling by a birthmark shaped like a crown on his backside and is therefore royal, but the stuck-up pigs turns him down. His superhero name is \\"Mr. Hamtastic.\\" Pig makes a cameo in the pilot episode of Planet Sheen along with Otis. =Freddy= Freddy (voiced by Cam Clarke) is a very funny, but dim-witted ferret (although he more closely resembles a waddling kangaroo) who is best friends with Peck, a rooster whom he's often tempted to eat; he used to be a carnivore, but then he's become a vegetarian to assimilate to the barnyard. However, in multiple times in the series, Freddy has shown gestures of or attempted to eat Peck, but every time when he tries, his attempt is thwarted, either intentionally or unintentionally. He is illiterate, and suffers from paranoid delusions and has multiple personality disorders. It's notable how Freddy is the only character to almost be banished from the barnyard twice for crimes he never committed. Also, he's a character who's been struck by lightning multiple times throughout the series, but once, he temporarily became a genius after being struck. Freddy's superhero name is Paranoid Man. =Peck= Peck (voiced by Rob Paulsen), is an intelligent, but weak chicken who is best friends with Freddy and appears to be unaware of Freddy‚Äôs recurring urges to eat him. He is considered to be extremely accident prone. Peck seems to share a slight rivalry with Root, a larger, braver rooster on the barnyard, such as in \\"Pecky Suave\\", where we learn that Peck is shown to have a crush on a beautiful hen named Hanna. Peck's superhero name is \\"The Green Rooster.\\" =Duke= Duke (voiced by Dom Irrera) is a sheepdog border collie who is in charge of the Farmer's flock of intelligent sheep. Duke is clearly no match for the intellect possessed by the sheep he herds. Duke loves being a leader and being in charge of things, though no other animal wants him to be the leader because he is too irresponsible. This is first shown in the movie after Ben, the barnyard leader, is killed and Duke wants to take his position as leader, but no other animal except his fellow dogs and a cat, wants him to take the place of Ben and wants Otis instead. In the series, Duke fancies himself as the barnyard's unofficial safety inspector and makes the barnyard watch a boring safety film once every year. Duke only enjoys dog activities, such as playing ball, so he doesn't hang around with Otis and his friends much, and as a result, sometimes feels lonely and left out. =Bessy= Bessy (voiced by Wanda Sykes) is the sassy brown cow and coarse that has a tendency to yell and Abby's best friend. She's not afraid to tell it like it is. She also knows how to pull a prank. Bessy finds Otis childish and idiotic, so she lives by insulting him and assaulting him. Pip is in love with Bessy, but she always rejects him, despite taking advantage of this sometimes. Bessy is also seen implicating with other animals, such as Freddy. She also disguises herself very little and does not participate in Otis's plans. She had a son who floated away with balloons at a county fair. All she has to remember him by is his cowbell, which, strangely, Otis has. In addition, she is the principal of the Barnyard School and the judge of the barn court. =Mrs. Beady= Noreen \\"Nora\\" Beady (voiced by Maria Bamford), more commonly known as Mrs. Beady, is a housewife who lives close by to the barnyard. She is aware that the animals can speak, and regularly attempts to expose their antics to the world. She is neurotic and has become obsessed with unmasking the animals, whose mischief often harms her. But no one else believes her because everyone else thinks she's insane, and whenever she attempts to expose the talking animals, the animals always find a way to sabotage her plan. In the pilot episode, it is revealed that Nora is the aunt of Eugene, another enemy of animals. =Farmer Buyer= Farmer Buyer (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) is the vegan owner of the barnyard for whom Otis cares deeply. Still, when the animals need some time alone to work on a private project (a movie they are trying to make, a theme park they are attempting to build, etc.), that does not stop them from trying to drive him away with a prank phone call. In the film, whenever he sees or suspects the animals of having human-like mental abilities, he is always kicked unconscious by Miles. =Snotty Boy= Eugene \\"Snotty Boy\\" Beady (voiced by Steve Oedekerk) is a minor antagonist in Barnyard and the secondary antagonist of Back at the Barnyard. He is Nora and Nathan Beady's nephew and Phlegmy Boy's cousin. Snotty Boy's uncle and aunt babysit him when his parents drop him off, much to Nathan's dismay. Snotty Boy is dim-witted, mean-spirited, selfish, spoiled, unpleasant, greedy, dishonest, bratty, and obnoxious. He enjoys torturing the animals, his best friends, and Mr. Beady, which is the basis of the hatred by them. However, he only bullies his uncle when Mrs. Beady isn't around. He is also rude towards his parents and often mocks them as well. Recurring characters =Mr. Beady= Nathan Randall Beady III (voiced by Steve Oedekerk), more commonly known as Mr. Beady, is Mrs. Beady's reluctant husband who miserably tries to convince his wife that animals do not talk. Mrs. Beady often calls him \\"Mr. Lump\\" because he always sits on a chair watching TV and rejects everything Mrs. Beady says about the talking barn animals. He is also shown to be miserable on a semi-constant basis, on some occasions wishing for death. He is mostly seen with a Beverage in his hand which appears to be either Soda or Beer. =Sheep= The Sheep (voiced by Chris Hardwick, Leigh- Allyn Baker, Cam Clarke, Rob Paulsen and Jeff Bennett) always hang around together in an eternally-close herd and are more intelligent than Duke. They often quote famous literature and make snide comments toward Duke. They seem to be very intelligent and philosophical despite their farmly upbringings. =Etta= Etta (voiced by Leigh-Allyn Baker (series); Andie MacDowell (film) is the lead hen and the mother of Maddy. She used to be a good friend of Ben. =The Jersey Cows= The Jersey Cows are Eddy, Igg and Bud (voiced by S. Scott Bullock, Maurice LaMarche and John DiMaggio), 3 cows who enjoy pranking humans and dislike having rules. Eddy is the leader out of the 3 cows. They're seen in the episodes \\"Cow's Night Out\\" and \\"Otis' Mom\\", and also have cameo appearances in several other episodes as well. =Everett= Everett (voiced by Lloyd Sherr) is the farmer's old bloodhound. The elderly dog first appears in the movie, where he celebrates his 13th birthday, making him 91 in dog years. As the oldest animal on the Barnyard, Everett is depicted as being droopy and is as thin as his own skeleton, which can easily be seen. Everett uses a walker to get around, except for when he is playing an instrument, and hardly ever talks, but in very few episodes, he speaks. In an episode, it is revealed that he is once an explorer and he is a good fighter when he is protecting the corn from the crows. =Skunky= Skunky (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is Pig's pet skunk who is considered as the latter's best friend, much to Otis' chagrin, as seen in \\"Pig Amok\\". In \\"Doggleganger\\", it is revealed he hates Duke. He appears in \\"Snotty's New Pet\\", where Pig threw him through the window to skunk Snotty. He appears in later episodes. =Tony Twocheeks= Tony Twocheeks (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a gopher entrepreneur who lives near the Barnyard. He often cons those who buy from him. He has an Elvis-like hairdo, sunglasses, and is sometimes seen chewing on a toothpick.

Many of the animals fear her, due to the pain she inflicts whenever she performs a physical. However, unlike Snotty Boy, she is oblivious to the suffering her patients go through, and actually loves animal. She appears in only four episodes: \\"Dead Cow Walking\\", \\"Snotty's Day Out\\", \\"Doggleganger\\", and \\"Dream Birthday\\". Animals (and sometimes people) fear her checkups. Farmer Buyer also seems to hold secret affections towards the Vet, as seen in \\"Dream Birthday\\". =Root= Root (voiced by Nathaniel Stroman) is Peck's rival. He hosts the weekly talent show at the barn. =Baxter= Baxter (voiced by Kevin McDonald) is a small white dog with pointed ears who became Duke's nemesis after he met him at an animal clinic in the episode \\"Doggleganger\\".

He also tricks the masses into thinking he is dead, but the animals later discover it is a publicity stunt to keep the paparazzi away from him. Apparently, Bigfoot can also fly and has his own theme song similar to Gamera. In multiple episodes, it is shown that he is afraid of flash photography. =Goat= Goat is a brownish-gray goat who is known for giving rides to Otis (i.e. The Great Sheep Escape, The Chronicles of Barnia).

The game's title and plot are inspired by the Biblical story of the Binding of Isaac. In the game, Isaac's mother receives a message from God demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith, and Isaac, fearing for his life, flees into the monster-filled basement of their home where he must fight to survive. Players control Isaac or one of eleven other unlockable characters through a procedurally generated dungeon in a roguelike manner, fashioned after those of The Legend of Zelda, defeating monsters in real-time combat while collecting items and power-ups to defeat bosses and eventually Isaac's mother. The game was the result of a week-long game jam between McMillen and Himsl to develop a The Legend of Zelda-inspired roguelike that allowed McMillen to showcase his feelings about both positive and negative aspects of religion that he had come to discover from conflicts between his Catholic and born again Christian family members while growing up. McMillen had considered the title a risk but one he could take after the financial success of Super Meat Boy, and released it without much fanfare to Steam in September 2011, not expecting many sales. The game soon gained popularity partially as a result of various Let's Play videos showcasing the title. McMillen and Himsl released an expansion \\"Wrath of the Lamb\\" in May 2012, but were limited from further expansion due to limitations with the Flash platform. They had started working with Nintendo in 2012 to release a 3DS version, but Nintendo later backed out of the deal, citing controversy over the game's religious themes. Developer Nicalis worked with McMillen in 2014 to complete a remake of the game, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, bringing additional features that McMillen had planned that exceeded Flash's limitation, as well as to improve the game's graphics and enable ports for other systems beyond personal computers, including PlayStation 4 and Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and the Nintendo Switch. McMillen later worked with James Id to develop The Legend of Bum-bo, which serves as a prequel to The Binding of Isaac. The Binding of Isaac has been well-received, with critics praising the game's roguelike nature to encourage repeated playthroughs. By July 2014, McMillen reported over 3 million copies had been sold. The game has been said to contribute to renewed interest in the roguelike genre from both players and developers.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot of The Binding of Isaac, showing Isaac attacking (center) and two enemies (top left and top right) The Binding of Isaac is a top-down dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, in which the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to the dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels in the manner of a roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations. Once a room is cleared of monsters, it will remain clear, allowing the player to re-trace their way through the level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all his hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly- generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol, contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.  Plot  The Binding of Isaacs plot is very loosely inspired by the biblical story of the same name. Isaac, a child, and his mother live in a small house on a hill, both happily keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing pictures and playing with his toys, and his mother watching Christian broadcasts on television. Isaac's mother then hears \\"a voice from above\\", stating her son is corrupted with sin, and needs to be saved. It asks her to remove all that was evil from Isaac, in an attempt to save him. His mother obliges, taking away his toys, drawings, and even his clothes. The voice once again speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must be cut off from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still questions her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen and walks to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen. During the game's loading points, Isaac is shown curled up in a ball, crying. His thoughts are visible, ranging among rejection from his mother and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight. The first ten endings serve as introductions to unlocked items and mechanics, while the final three suggest that Isaac climbs into a toy chest and suffocates.  Development and release  The Binding of Isaac was developed following the release of Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When Super Meat Boy was released to both critical praise and strong sales, he felt that he no longer had to worry about the consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered he could take further risk with the concept. The Binding of Isaacs main concept was the result of a weeklong game jam that McMillen had with Florian Himsl; at the time, his co-contributor on Super Meat Boy, Tommy Refenes, was on vacation. The concept McMillen had was two-fold: to develop a roguelike title based on the first The Legend of Zelda game's dungeon structure, and to develop a game that addressed McMillen's thoughts on religion. McMillen had been inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of the original Zelda games. Random rooms were created for each floor of the dungeon by selecting ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons‚Äîfighter, thief, cleric and wizard. On the story side, McMillen explained that the religious tone is based on his own experiences with his family, split between Catholics and born-again Christians. McMillen noted that while both sides born out faith from the same Bible, their attitudes were different; he found some of the Catholic rituals his family performed inspiring, while other beliefs they had were condemning of several pastimes McMillen had participated in like Dungeons & Dragons. He took inspiration from that duality to create Isaacs narrative, showing how religion can both instill harmful feelings while also bringing about dark creativity. McMillen also considered the scare tactics used by the Christian right to condemn popular media of the 1980s, such as heavy metal and video games. McMillen noted how many of the propaganda films from this period featured satanic cults that would sacrifice children, and he noted how many Biblical stories mirrored these concepts, subsequently building the story around that. He also stated that he also tended to like \\"really weird stuff\\" relating to toilet humor and similar types of off-color humor that did not sit well with his family and which he had explored in previous games before Super Meat Boy. While Super Meat Boy helped to make his reputation (including being one of the featured developers in Indie Game: The Movie), he felt it was a \\"safe\\" game considering his preferred type of humor, and used Isaac to return to this form, considering that the game could easily be \\"career suicide\\" but would make a statement about what he really wanted to do. Within the week, they had a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to complete it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the size and scope of both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012. = Soundtrack = Danny Baranowsky, the game's composer and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early on with the project shortly after the completion of the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas. = Cancelled Nintendo 3DS port = In January 2012, as the game has surpassed 450,000 units sold, McMillen stated that he was approached by a publisher that had interest in bringing the title to the Nintendo 3DS as a downloadable title through the Nintendo eShop, though McMillen had reservations given Nintendo's reputation for less risque content. In late February, McMillen stated that Nintendo had rejected the game because of \\"questionable religious content\\". He believed this stemmed from Germany's classification board rating the existing Windows version of the game as \\"age 16+\\" due to potentially blasphemous content, the first such time a game was rated in that manner in the country. McMillen noted that Nintendo executives he spoke to before this decision had noted some blasphemous content would have been acceptable, and were more concerned with overtly religious content. He also noted that he was approached about his willingness to make some changes to the game to make it more suitable for the 3DS, but never was given a list of specific changes. McMillen speculated that Nintendo was worried about its reputation; because of the game's resemblance to The Legend of Zelda, an unknowing child could potentially have downloaded the title and been shocked by the content, which would have reflected poorly on Nintendo. Several game websites were outraged at Nintendo's decision. Though disappointed with Nintendo's decision, McMillen did not think the loss of the 3DS port was a major issue, and saw a brief sales burst on Steam as the news was covered in gaming website. McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content. Nintendo would later allow the Rebirth remake to be released on both the New Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U in 2015; this came in part because Nintendo's Steve Singer (vice president of licensing), Mark Griffin (a senior manager in licensing), and Dan Adelman (the head of indie development) championed support for The Binding of Isaac. = Wrath of the Lamb = An expansion to the game, entitled Wrath of the Lamb, was released through Steam on May 28, 2012. McMillen was inspired to create the expansion not only due to the success of the base game, but because his wife Danielle had fully completed the base game, the first game he had written in which she had shown significant interest. The expansion adds 70% more content to the original, and contains more than 10 bosses, over 100 items, over 40 unlocks, two additional endings, and two additional optional levels. This expansion added new \\"alternate\\" floors, which can replace the normal floors, creating an alternate route through the game. These floors contain harder enemies, and a different set of bosses. Other features include a new item type, Trinkets, which have a variety of passive or triggered effects when carried, as well as new room types. McMillen had plans to release a second expansion beyond Wrath of the Lamb, but was constrained by the limits of Flash at this point. = The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth = Sometime in 2012 after Isaac's release, McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis who asked if McMillen was interested in bringing the game to consoles. McMillen was interested, but insisted that they would have to reprogram the game to get around the limitations of Flash and to include Wrath of the Lamb and the second planned expansion, remaking the game's graphics in 16-bit instead of vector-based Flash graphics. Further, McMillen had wanted nothing to do with the business aspects of the game, having recounted the difficulties he had in handling this for Super Meat Boy. Nicalis agreed to these, and began work in 2012 on what would become The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, an improved version of the title. It was released on November 4, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita, with versions for the Wii U, New Nintendo 3DS, and Xbox One released on July 23, 2015. The game introduced numerous new playable characters, items, enemies, bosses, challenges, and room layout seeds for floors. A content pack, entitled Afterbirth was released for Rebirth starting October 2015, adding new alternate chapters, characters and items, as well as wave-based Greed mode. A second update, Afterbirth+, added further additional content and support for user-created modifications, and was released on January 3, 2017. = Other games = McMillen collaborated with James Id to develop The Legend of Bum-bo, which was released on November 12, 2019 for Windows and later for iOS and Switch. Bum-bo is described as a prequel to Isaac, and Isaac and Gish appear as characters in the game. Isaac also appears as a playable character in the fighting game Blade Strangers and the puzzle game Crystal Crisis. On June 27, 2018, Edmund McMillen announced and later released a card game adaptation in cooperation with Studio 71 titled The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls.  Reception  The Binding of Isaac received generally favorable reviews from game critics. On Metacritic, the game has an average of 84 out of 100 based on 30 reviews. The Binding of Isaac has been received by reviewers as a game with high replayability with the extensive range and combinations of power-ups that the player can encounter during a run-through, while providing an accessible Zelda-inspired framework that most video game players would recognize and easily come to understand. John Teti for Eurogamer praised the game for its replayability through the randomization aspects, calling it \\"the most accessible exploration of the roguelike idea\\" that he had seen. Edges similarly commented on the lure to replay the game due to its short playthrough time, calling it \\"an imaginative and quick-witted arcade experience that manages to be both depraved and strangely sweet by turn\\". GameSpot's Maxwell McGee stated that the game smartly has removed extraneous features such that \\"what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions\\". Though the game is considered to be accessible to new players, reviewers found the game to be a difficult challenge, often set by the randomness of what power-ups the player happened to acquire during a single run. Writers for The A.V. Club rated the game an A on a grading scale, and favorably compared the title to McMillen's Super Meat Boy, requiring the player to have \\"masochistic patience in the face of terrible odds\\". This difficulty was considered mitigated by the large number of possible power-ups that the game offers, most would not be seen by players until they have replayed the game many times. McGee noted that while players can review what items they have discovered prior to a run-through, this feature does not explain what each item does, leaving the effect to be determined by the player while in game. Game Informers Adam Biessener noted that while The Binding of Isaac had a number of software bugs on release that may briefly detract from the experience, \\"McMillen‚Äôs vision shines through\\" in the game's playability, art style, and story. Neilie Johnson for IGN found that some players may be put off by the game's crudeness but otherwise \\"it's totally random, highly creative and brutally unforgiving\\". Similarly, Nathan Muenier for GameSpy noted the game had some shock value that one must work past, but otherwise was \\" imaginative\\" and \\"utterly absorbing\\". Alternatively, Jordan Devore for Destructoid considered the visual style of the game one of its \\"biggest selling points\\", following from McMillen's past style of dark comedy from Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky's soundtrack was found by reviewers to well-suit the themes of the game, and used appropriately to avoid extensive repetition during a playthrough. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku called the soundtrack as the combination of several genres and the musical styles of Danny Elfman, Muse, and Final Fantasy that created something \\"dark and unique\\". The Binding of Isaac was nominated in the Best Independent Game category at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to Minecraft. McMillen had only expected the game to sell a few hundred copies when he released it on Steam. For the first few months of its release, sales were roughly a few hundred per day, but shortly thereafter, McMillen found sales suddenly were boosted, a fact he attributed to numerous Let's Play videos that had been published by players to showcase the game and drove sales. This popularity also drew interest by players that wanted to create custom mods for the game, which would become a factor in the design of the sequel to better support modding. By November 2012, the game sold over one million copies, with at least one-quarter of those having purchased the \\"Wrath of the Lamb\\" extension. As of July 2014, the game has sold over 3 million copies. By July 2015, following the release of Rebirth, the combined games had over 5 million units sold. The Binding of Isaac is said to be a contributing factor towards the growth of the roguelike genre since around 2010, with its success paving the way for later games that used the roguelike formula, such as FTL: Faster Than Light and Don't Starve.

He was convicted of illegally trading away US$2 billion (GB¬£1.3 billion) as a trader for Swiss investment bank UBS. While at the bank he primarily worked on UBS' Global Synthetic Equities Trading team in London where he engaged in what would later be known as the 2011 UBS rogue trader scandal. After serving a prison sentence, he lost several appeals against the Home Office decision to deport him to Ghana. Early life and education Kweku Adoboli was born on 21 May 1980 in Tema, Ghana, to John Adoboli, a senior United Nations official. He spent his early years in Israel, Syria and Iraq, before moving to the United Kingdom in 1991. He attended Ackworth School in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, where he was head boy. In his profile on the school's website, he wrote that he wanted to be an athlete. In 2000, after finishing school, he started reading Chemical Engineering at the University of Nottingham, but switched to E-commerce and Digital Business Studies. In 2000, he was elected as the Communications Officer of University of Nottingham Students' Union. In mid-2002, Adoboli worked as a summer intern at UBS's operations department. He graduated from Nottingham in July 2003. Career Adoboli joined UBS's London office as a graduate trainee in September 2006. After working for two years as a trading analyst in the bank's back office, he was promoted to a Delta One trading desk. In 2008, he became a director on the ETF desk, and by 2010, he was promoted to director, with a total annual salary of almost ¬£200,000. Beginning in 2008, Adoboli started using the bank's money for unauthorised trades. He entered false information into UBS's computers to hide the risky trades he was making. He exceeded the bank's per-employee daily trading limit of US$100 million, and failed to hedge his trades against risk. He also used his personal funds on two spread betting accounts, IG Index and City Index, where he lost around ¬£100,000. In mid-2011, UBS launched an internal investigation into Adoboli's trades. On 14 September 2011, Adoboli wrote an e-mail to his manager admitting to booking false trades. His trades cost the bank $2 billion (¬£1.3 billion) and wiped off $4.5 billion (¬£2.7 billion) from its share price. The trading losses he incurred while trading for his bank were the largest unauthorised trading losses in British history. Charges and conviction On 15 September 2011, Adoboli was arrested by City of London Police. He was charged with two counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of false accounting. He was in prison on remand until 8 June 2012, when he was granted bail subject to being electronically tagged and placed under curfew at a friend's house. On the morning of 20 November 2012, a jury at Southwark Crown Court unanimously found Adoboli guilty on one count of fraud. Later the same day, after receiving an instruction allowing for a majority decision with a single vote against, the jury found him guilty of a second count of fraud. The jury also found him not guilty on the four false accounting charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. The City of London Police said: \\"This was the UK's biggest fraud, committed by one of the most sophisticated fraudsters the City of London Police has ever come across.\\" Imprisonment and subsequent appeal against deportation  Adoboli served out his sentence at HMP The Verne in Dorset, then at HMP Ford in West Sussex and finally at HMP Maidstone in Kent. He was released in June 2015. As he was solely a Ghanaian citizen, having never naturalised as a British citizen despite having lived in the United Kingdom since 1991, Adoboli was liable for automatic deportation under Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 as a foreign criminal who had been sentenced to at least twelve months of imprisonment. He was served with deportation proceedings in July 2015, and lived with friends in London and Edinburgh. After his release he gave many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry on operating ethically and avoiding the mistakes he made. Adoboli lost his original appeal against the Home Secretary's order of deportation made against him in July 2016, and continued to make attempts to appeal; he was eventually denied permission for a judicial review of the deportation order and his deportation was originally scheduled for September 2018. Adoboli believes his deportation is due to the Home Office hostile environment policy on immigration. Officials from the Home Office, however, state that their actions and the underlying decision on an application of a long-standing government policy, supported by the law. Adoboli was deported to his native Ghana on 14 November 2018 after his appeals against deportation were turned down.

However, the quartet soon discover that the house they have been sent to rob belongs to a dreaded don named Lalla Bhatti (Mahesh Manjrekar), an unpleasant sod who doesn't think twice about breaking his own brother's arm (Shehzad Khan) for an unpaid debt. If robbing a don's residence was not enough, the quarter also manage to get in the way of a 'poetic' spouting Intelligence agent VP Singh (Ravi Kissen) keeping tabs on the don, an underworld patriarch Khan (Prem Chopra) and an East Asian thug named Asif trying to trace his stolen car. Pretty soon, all the characters of the film are pulled in a cat and mouse game with each other, with some audio tapes containing some damning conversations being the prize of the game. In the climax, the quartet, with some help by a local hustler Varinder (Mika Singh) and his moll Sharmili (Kim Sharma) manage to set off the bad guys against each other. But soon enough, it is revealed that Batliwala was behind the whole thing, and wanted to set the quartet up to get revenge on his brother who is now in jail because of them. The quartet manage to save themselves and hire Khan to murder Batliwala.

The Salvation Army also had a Commanding Post in Ngopa, which is overseen by the Commanding Officer. Moreover, United Pentecostal Church and Christ Redemption churches also use Ngopa as their pastorate headquarters. Water, Electricity and Other Essential Supply System = Water = Ngopa has an enviable water supply system, which runs with the help of gravitational force. More than half of the families have private water connection, and public water points are available in the streets. There are very few families still depending upon natural water points. = Electricity = Ngopa receives electrical power through 11 kV transmission line from Khawzawl Power Station. It is distributed again from Ngopa Power Substation to Ngopa and neighbouring villages. Normally, Ngopians receive a regular supply of electric power. = Other Essential Supplies = There is one petroleum oil filling station operated by a private firm and one LPG Agent. The petrol station and the LPG agent feed Ngopa and its neighbouring villages. There are two shops that sell electronic goods like washing machines, televisions, etc. There are about four hardware stores, two wholesale shops, and many small variety shops which serve the people's needs. Recreational Places and Community Halls = Recreational Places = There are several recreational places in Ngopa. There are three football fields, three tennis courts, three volleyball courts, two indoor stadiums for badminton, a basketball court, and a table tennis hall. In the northern part of town there is a mini sports complex with football grounds, a tennis court, and two volleyball courts. Ngopa is well known in Mizoram for its talented tennis players. = Community Halls = Three community halls in Ngopa are overseen by YMA, and two conference rooms/halls are owned by government departments. The YMA community halls are Jubilee Hall, Ngopa Chhimveng Hall, and Zawlbuk. Jubilee Hall has the highest seat capacity, while Zawlbuk is the newest and the most furnished community hall. There is also an SSA Block Resource Centre Hall and an NREGS Conference Hall.  Places of interest  = Watch Tower = Watch Tower, Ngopa's 80th-Year Monument is constructed on a hilltop. This symbol for the people of Ngopa receives many visitors. A shiny steel cross, the symbol of Christianity, has been placed on the top of the tower. In memory of those who have already answered the heavenly call, loved ones have sponsored the placement of granite plates embedded in the wall which bear touching words. = FK Tea's Estate = FK Tea Estate F. K. Tea Estate is another place of interest that is popular with tourists. It is located in the northern side of the town and is about three kilometers from Ngopa. The good metal road runs across it. It is one of the largest tea gardens in Mizoram. There is also a facility on the property where green tea leaves are processed and made ready for use. Mizo Tea is produced, sold, and distributed from here to different parts of the state. This tea garden and processing facility are owned and operated privately by F. Kapsanga and his family. = Tuani Lung = Tuani Lung. Tuani Lung is an ancestral place connected with one of Mizo's famous love stories, Tuani leh Chhawrtuineihlala. It is located north of Ngopa, about ten kilometers from town. In memory of the two lovers, Tuani and Chhawrtuineihlala, two stones were erected. YMA, Ngopa Branch is responsible for the preservation and oversight of this ancestral site. Students and tourists often visit. = Lengteng = Lengteng, the second highest point in Mizoram is not far from Ngopa. However, the peak is not approachable by vehicle. To reach the peak from Ngopa by foot take at least half a day. It is located in the southern side of the famous 'Sialkal' range, which is also known as Himalaya of Mizoram. Lengteng and its surrounding area is covered by thick forest, and the area is proclaimed as a reserved sanctuary for animals. Important Rivers = Tuivai = The Tuivai River, which originates from Manipur state, is the largest river near Ngopa; it runs towards the south. Tuivai is very important for the stability and growth of the economy of Ngopa. Every year huge amounts of sand (aggregate) are collected from the Tuivai River for building purposes. The river is a source of good quantity fish possessing a unique flavor. The freshwater snail of Tuivai also has a unique, tantalizing flavor, best among the freshwater snails found in Mizoram rivers. Since the 1980s, there has been proposal on the table to construct a dam on the Tuivai River for hydroelectric power production. Enthusiasm for the project has dwindled and been rekindled over the years and is still under consideration today. Most of the residents in the area who of the teenagers at the time of the first proposal are becoming grandparents. Though they have not completely abandoned hope for construction of hydro-electric power plant, the hope that still lingers is becoming faint. = Tuiphal = Tuiphal is the second largest river that runs in the south toward the west. The Tuiphal River provides mineral resources like sand (aggregate) and stones for the Ngopians. Tuiphal has a small, easily cultivated plain which provides paddy fields and supplies fresh fish to Ngopians. = Tuila = The Tuila River runs on the eastern side toward the north. Although not a large river, small plains at the river's edge provide one of the rice bowls of Ngopa. And the fish of Tuila possess an indescribably wonderful flavor. = Tuithil = Tuithil is a small river which runs toward the south. Even though it is the smallest river in the area, it has the largest plain, which served as the rice bowl of Ngopa.

Baen Books) Cover artist: Clyde Caldwell Wind Rider's Oath is a fantasy novel by American writer David Weber, the third book in the \\"War God\\" series. It follows the adventures of Bahzell Bahnakson and his friend Brandark. The format is a swords-and-sorcery land with dwarves, elves, humans, halflings and hradani - the 5 Races. There is a pantheon of Gods, some good and some vile. It is followed by Sword Brother, a novella published together with a January 2007 edition of Oath of Swords, the second book in the series.  Plot  At the end of The War God‚Äôs Own, Bahzell had accepted the surrender of the much larger force commanded by the Sothoii Baron Tellian. Bahzell, Brandark and Kaeritha are now visiting the Baron's castle from which the baron rules a large portion of the Sothoii Empire. The surrender by Baron Tellian has caused political unrest within the Sothoii nation as does the presence of Bahzell and his entourage of Hradani, members of most recent chapter of the War God's monks. Bahzell and his fellow Hradani run to the aid of the remnant of a herd of Coursers who were attacked by minions of one of the evil gods. For centuries these phenomenal, sentient horses have been revered by the Sothoii. They sometimes form lifelong mental links with a few select Sothoii warriors who are then known as \\"Windriders\\". Bahzell is the first non-Sothoii to become a windrider and rides a Courser who, like Bahzell, has become a champion of the war god. This, along with the obvious effort and sacrifice the Hradani have made to save the Coursers does much to alleviate the political tensions. Meanwhile, Kaeritha, another war god champion, obeys her call to the Sothoii Warmaids, who are keen that there is no diminution of their legal rights. The devotees of the vile gods continue - as a third strand of their long-planned attack on the Sothoii - to manipulate and attack in Baron Tellian‚Äôs own lands.

Background Project number J32. Before the pacific war, the IJN wanted to raise the training efficiency of bombers for the outbreak of war. The Yakaze was converted to a target ship for bombing training, however, her armour was thin because she was converted from a destroyer. Yakaze was able to sustain only the impact of 1 kilogram bombs. The IJN wanted the target ship top join the Combined Fleet to use it in the southern front. Hakachi was built with such a background, she was able to sustain 10 kilogram bombs dropped from meters altitude. Hakachi was the only purpose-built vessel in the IJN designed as a bombing target ship. Her flat steel deck gave her the appearance of an escort carrier and protected against 10 and 30 kilogram training bombs. The IJN built later the ≈åhama-class as a next generation target ships, because Hakachi was the only one available for training new pilots of bomber planes. Service The Hakachi was commissioned on 18 November 1943, on 1 December, she was assigned to the Combined Fleet. On 24 December, she sailed to Truk and she worked bombing training. Two months later, she was heavily damaged by U.S. carrier aircraft during Operation Hailstone. She sheltered at Palau on 24 February 1944, and was repaired by Akashi. She was modified to serve as an escort for local convoys and rearmed with two 4.7-inch and 28 Type 96 25-mm AA guns and carried 36 Depth charges. On 18 March, she sailed to Lingga Islands. On 24 May, she sailed to Davao Gulf. She worked in each place. On 1 October, she undertook convoy escort operations. She survived the war at the Seto Inland Sea. From 1 December 1945 the ship was assigned to the Allied Repatriation Service as a special transport ship. 11 December 1946 Hakachi arrives at Sasebo on her last repatriation voyage. In all, she transports 1,641 former military personnel back to Japan. 1947 she was scrapped in Osaka at Fujinagata Zosensho.

Marriage negotiations presumably began in 1469, as Henry's father, Otto V had formed an alliance with Margarete's uncle William. The Saxon side had delayed the marriage until the expansion of the Celle Castle was completed, as the district and castel of Celle had been promised to Margarete as her wittum.

Opened in 1877, it is connected to the Porto Metro, with local intercity and commuter service (operated by Comboios de Portugal, the Portuguese national railway operator). The railway station provides Lisbon to north access, a through- station, and not a terminus station, serving the Lisbon-to-north allowing through running of trains from Lisbon to the north of Portugal. History The tender notice issued in 1877 for the exploration of the rail service concession at the Railway Station of Pinehro A zincography design of the Campanh√£ station in 1835 A view of the platform and passengers waiting at the updated Campanh√£ station (1899) The first plan for a station was presented in 1860, to be built in Esteiro de Campanh√£ and that connected the Douro line to Minho, through an extension that follows the Campanh√£ valley to the branches along the Rio Tinto. Initially designated, the Esta√ß√£o de caminho de ferro do Pinheiro (Pinheiro Railway Station), the station at Campanh√£ was designated for lands occupied by the estates of Quinta do Pinheiro and Quintas do Valado. In 1872, the current layout was definitively set by Manuel Afonso Espregueira, Pedro In√°cio Lopes and Alexandre Eiffel. Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, from Viana do Castelo, had a licentiate degree in mathematics from the University of Coimbra, and completed courses in infantry and general staff at the Escola do Ex√©rcito (Military School). Later he attended the √âcole Imperiale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, in Paris, where he was one of the better students and colleague of other important people, such as Sadi Carnot (later President of the French Republic. In 1880, he abandoned the army and entered the public service (specifically the Ministry of Public Works) where he held various positions and was part of several projects (such as artificial port of Leix√µes, improvements to the Barra do Porto and Figueira da Foz, among others). He was a director of the first Divis√£o Hidr√°ulica do Reino (Hydraulic Division of the Kingdom) that was responsible for ports and inlets along the area north of the Mondego, except Aveiro. Between 1872 and 1885, Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, was director general for the Companhia Real dos Caminhos-de-ferro (Royal Railway Company), but in 1874, he was responsible for the elaboration of the general plan, that included all the lines that crossed the Douro and Norte region. By 1875, the first trains began to run along the northern Douro, between Pinheiro-Campanh√£ and Braga. On 28 April, they began work on the \\"Eiffel Bridge\\", projected by Seyrig from the Eiffel School of Paris. An accord was established between the government and the Royal on 15 September 1875, to begin the construction of the railway station. On 4 November 1877, following diverse vicissitudes during the construction, the inauguration, along with that of the Bridge D. Maria Pia was celebrated, with the presence of King D. Lu√≠s and Queen D. Maria Pia. The first train arrived the railway station from S√£o Bento in 1896. In 1923, Cottinelli Telmo in partnership with Lu√≠s da Cunha, authored the first project plan to construct a dormitory for railway personnel, but was never executed. A second version, which was submitted in 1925, was approved. Between 1943 and 1945, Cottinelli Telmo expanded the construction by building a warehouse for foodstuffs. By decree 104/97, the management of the railways was entrusted to a new company, the Rede Ferrovi√°ria Nacional (National Railway) in 1997. Commemorations celebrating the Portuguese railway system's 150 years were celebrated at Campanh√£ in 2006. Architecture A view of the Largo da Esta√ß√£o and Campanh√£ station A view of the rail platform and rear facade The station is situated in an isolated space, implanted on level terrain, on the western end of the city of Porto, along the right margin of the Douro River. The principal facade is exposed to the Largo da Esta√ß√£o towards the urban centre of Campanh√£, and its rear towards the railway lines and departure platforms. In actuality it is a central station to the city. The station includes, not only the passenger terminal, but also some support buildings, with sanitary installations, covered wharfs and carriage house. The main building has a rectangular plan, that comprises five bodies, that occupy a linear tract. The rectangular, two- story, central corp is slightly extended from the main body, and flanked by the lateral, single-story wings, that extend to another two lateral sections. The facades are plastered and painted in white, along with the frames and bunting, while the pilasters, decorative friezes and cornices are in granite. All first-story facades are broken by rounded windows or doorways, interspersed by pilasters and ionic capitals, while similar motifs are included in the upper floor of the central block. This facade (oriented to the west) is divided into five sections, with the central partially section decorated in granite, with split silhouettes, while the floors are separated by friezes and cornices, this topped by elaborate friezes along the second floor, punctuated by three central inscriptions PORTO - CAMPANH√É - PORTO and a minor inscription under the cornice: REFER. The frontispiece integrates a circular clock, flanked by fins, and finished in semicircular pediment with wide phytomorphic key. On the ground floor there are three perfect, molded back porticos, with flagstone integrated with two windows on each side. On the upper floors there are six balcony windows, surrounded by rectangular frame and topped by cornice, protected by stone balusters (on the central section) and iron railings on the sides. The intermediate sections are torn by six spans identical to those on the ground floor of the central facade. The facades of the lateral bodies, are broken by two windows and central door (at ground floor) and three balcony windows (on the upper floor). The lateral facades with identical layout, has a visible mezzanine between the two floors, while underneath the frieze is a blue-and-white azulejo panel, with the inscription PORTO CAMPANH√É. The rear facade is symmetrically-broken by numerous spans of identical composition, with a full-length porch, resting on the cornice and iron pillars resting on granite plinths, supported by the boarding platform. Service Campanh√£ station is one of two railway stations in Porto, with the other being the S√£o Bento (the city centre terminus station for local trains and passenger service to the north, including the Douro line). All Comboios de Portugal (CP) services operate through Campanh√£, including other services such as the Alfa Pendular high speed trains and Inter Cidades (inter-city) suburban trains, which continue on to S√£o Bento. Suburban trains coming from General Torres reverse here and continue to S√£o Bento. Porto Metro station Campanh√£ is an integral line within the Metro do Porto, except Line D; all these services route through the station.

Other animals may replace horses in art and occasionally for actual ceremonies. The term biga is also used by modern scholars for the similar chariots of other Indo-European cultures, particularly the two-horse chariot of the ancient Greeks and Celts. The driver of a biga is a bigarius.CIL 6.10078 and 6.37836. The general term for chariot driver is auriga. Other Latin words that distinguish chariots by the number of animals yoked as a team are quadriga, a four-horse chariot used for racing and associated with the Roman triumph; triga, or three-horse chariot, probably driven for ceremonies more often than racing (see Trigarium); and seiugis or seiuga, the six-horse chariot, more rarely raced and requiring a high degree of skill from the driver. The biga and quadriga are the most common types. Two-horse chariots are a common icon on Roman coins; see bigatus, a type of denarius so called because it depicted a biga.This is disputed. In the iconography of religion and cosmology, the biga represents the moon, as the quadriga does the sun.Doro Levi, \\"Aion,\\" Hesperia 13.4 (1944), p. 287. Greek and Indo-European background Procession of two- horses chariots on a loutrophoros, c. 690 BC The earliest reference to a chariot race in Western literature is an event in the funeral games of Patroclus in the Iliad.John H. Humphrey, Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing (University of California Press, 1986), p. 5. In Homeric warfare, elite warriors were transported to the battlefield in two-horse chariots, but fought on foot; the chariot was then used for pursuit or flight.Donald G. Kyle, Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient World (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 161‚Äì162. Most Bronze Age chariots uncovered by archaeology in Peloponnesian Greece are bigae.Mary Aiken Littauer, \\"The Military Use of the Chariot in the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age,\\" in Selected Writings on Chariots, Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness (Brill, 2002), p. 90. The date at which chariot races were introduced at the Olympian Games is recorded by later sources as 680 BC, when quadrigae competed. Races on horseback were added in 648. At Athens, two-horse chariot races were a part of athletic competitions from the 560s onward, but were still not a part of the Olympian Games.Kyle, Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient World, p. 161. Bigae drawn by mules competed in the 70th Olympiad (500 BC), but they were no longer part of the games after the 84th Olympiad (444 BC).Edward M. Plummer, Athletics and Games of the Ancient Greeks (Cambridge, Mass., 1898), p. 38. Not until 408 BC did bigae races begin to be featured at Olympia.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, pp. 6‚Äì7. In myth, the biga often functions structurally to create a complementary pair or to link opposites. The chariot of Achilles in the Iliad (16.152) was drawn by two immortal horses and a third who was mortal; at 23.295, a mare is yoked with a stallion. The team of Adrastos included the immortal \\"superhorse\\" Areion and the mortal Kairos.Antimachus apud Pausanias 8.25.9. A psychoanalytic discussion of this yoking is given by George Devereux, Dreams in Greek Tragedy: An Ethno-Psycho- Analytical Study (University of California Press, 1976), p. 12 A yoke of two horses is associated with the Indo-European concept of the Heavenly Twins, one of whom is mortal, represented among the Greeks by Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, who were known for horsemanship. Robert Drews, The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East (Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 152. Bigae at the races consul advances in his biga at the pompa circensisAs identified by Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, \\"The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 86.1 (1982), p. 71. (4th century, opus sectile from the Basilica of Junius Bassus) Horse- and chariot-races were part of the ludi, sacred games held during Roman religious festivals, from Archaic times. A magistrate who presented games was entitled to ride in a biga.Frank Bernstein, \\"Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 224. For an example as recorded in an inscription, see CIL 10.7295 = ILS 5055. The sacral meaning of the races, though diminished over time,Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 262. The Church Fathers recognized the religious significance of ludi, including both sporting events and theater, and therefore instructed Christians not to participate; see, for instance, Tertullian, De spectaculis. was preserved by iconography in the Circus Maximus, Rome's main racetrack. Inscriptions referring to the bigarius as youngPuerilis in CIL 6.100078 = ILS 9348; infans in ILS 5300. suggest that a racing driver had to gain experience with a two- horse team before graduating to a quadriga.Jean-Paul Thuillier, \\"Le cirrus et la barbe. Questions d'iconographie athl√©tique romaine,\\" M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, Antiquit√© 110.1 (1998), p. 377, noting that the \\"major and minor\\" races held for the Robigalia may be junior and senior divisions. =Construction= A main source for the construction of racing bigae is a number of bronze figurines found throughout the Roman Empire, a particularly detailed example of which is held by the British Museum. Other sources are reliefs and mosaics. These show a lightweight frame, to which a minimal shell of fabric or leather was lashed. The center of gravity was low, and the wheels were relatively small, around 65 cm in diameter in proportion to a body 60 cm wide and 55 cm deep, with a breastwork of about 70 cm in height. The wheels may have been rimmed with iron, but otherwise metal fittings are kept to a minimum. The design facilitated speed, maneuverability and stability.Marcus Junkelmann, \\"On the Starting Line with Ben Hur: Chariot-Racing in the Circus Maximus,\\" in Gladiators and Caesars (University of California Press, 2000), pp. 91‚Äì92. Modern reenactment of a biga race The weight of the vehicle has been estimated at 25‚Äì30 kg, with a maximum manned weight of 100 kg.Junkelmann, \\"On the Starting Line with Ben Hur,\\" pp. 91‚Äì92. The biga is typically built with a single draught pole for a double yoke, while two poles are used for a quadriga.J.H. Crouwell, \\"Chariots in Iron Age Cyprus,\\" in Selected Writings on Chariots, Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness (Brill, 2002), p. 153ff. The chariot for a two-horse racing team is not thought to differ otherwise from that drawn by a four-horse team, and so the horses of a biga pulled 50 kg each, while those of the quadriga pulled 25 kg each.Junkelmann, \\"On the Starting Line with Ben Hur,\\", pp. 91‚Äì92. The models or statuettes of bigae were art objects, toys, or collector's items. They are perhaps comparable to the modern hobby of model trains.The Roman historian Suetonius records that \\"At the beginning of his reign [Nero] used to play every day with ivory chariots on a board\\" (Sed cum inter initia imperii eburneis quadrigis cotidie in abaco luderet). Play in abaco (\\"on a gameboard\\") may imply a strategic game with rules; for other Roman board games see ludus duodecim scriptorum and ludus latrunculorum. The ivory quadrigae may have been actual miniatures, or game pieces that represented the chariots. See Junkelmann, \\"On the Starting Line,\\" p. 89. Mythological and ceremonial use The bigae of Achilles and Memnon, each drawn by one white horse and one black horse (hydria, 575‚Äì550 BC) In his Etymologies, Isidore of Seville explains the cosmic symbolism of chariot racing, and notes that while the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, represents the sun and its course through the four seasons, the biga represents the moon, \\"because it travels on a twin course with the sun, or because it is visible both by day and by night ‚Äî for they yoke together one black horse and one white.\\"Isidore, Etymologies 18.26, as translated by Stephen A. Barney et al., The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 368 online. Chariots frequently appear in Roman art as allegories of the Sun and Moon, particularly in reliefs and mosaics, in contexts that are readily distinguishable from depictions of real-world charioteers in the circus.Dunbabin, \\"The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments,\\" p. 85. Luna in her biga drawn by horses or oxen was an element of Mithraic iconography, usually in the context of the tauroctony. In the mithraeum of S. Maria Capua Vetere, a wall painting that uniquely focuses on Luna alone shows one of the horses of the team as light in color, with the other a dark brown. It has been suggested that the duality of the horses drawing a biga can also represent Plato's metaphor of the charioteer who must control a soul divided by genesis and apogenesis.M.J. Vermaseren, Mithraica I: The Mithraeum at S. Maria Capua Vetere (Brill, 1971), pp‚Äì15. 14; Plato, Phaedrus 246. Greek and Roman art depicts deities driving two-yoke chariots drawn by a number of animals. A biga of oxen was driven by Hecate, the chthonic aspect of the Triple Goddess in complement with the \\"horned\\" or crescent-crowned Diana and Luna, to whom the biga was sacred.Prudentius, Contra Symmachum 733 (Migne); Friedrich Solmsen, \\"The Powers of Darkness in Prudentius' Contra Symmachum: A Study of His Poetic Imagination,\\" Vigiliae Christianae 19.4 (1965), p. 248. See Servius, note to Aeneid 6.118 on the identification of Hecate trimorphos with Luna, Diana, and Proserpina. According to Hesiod, Theogony 413f., Hecate originally had power over the heavens, land, and sea, not heaven, earth, and underworld. Triptolemus is depicted on Roman coins as driving a serpent-drawn biga as he sows grain in response to Demeter's appeal to him to teach mankind the skill of agriculture, such as on an Alexandrine drachma, see .

Bigatus Boys acting out chariot races with a cart pulled by two large birds, possibly herons or ostriches (mosaic, Villa del Casale, c. 300 AD) The bigatus was a silver coin so called because it depicted a biga.

It was first published in the online magazine Tor.com August 11, 2010.  The ‚ÄúBusiness Model‚Äù  An alien race called the Falshi uses the creation of civilizations and the Fermi Paradox as a means of accumulating and collecting valuable resources. Their \\"business model\\" consists of the following steps: #Use life-seeding devices to spread basic single-celled life on billions of planets in a target galaxy (i.e. Panspermia) #Wait millions or billions of years for life to evolve to sentience on several of these planets. #Individual starships then secretly monitor the radio transmissions of these civilizations, once they develop into a technological society. The crew then goes into stasis for millennia at a time, but are brought out of stasis by automated systems when they detect that radio transmissions have ceased. #Most industrial civilizations will eventually render themselves extinct through warfare, usually involving weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, etc.) but other times simply overpopulation, depleted resources, and pollution. The Falshi call this \\"Closure\\". #While the civilization flourished, it extracted most of the construction metals, valuable radioactive elements, and other rare or useful resources from within the planet. Once they have killed themselves off, the silently-observing Falshi then move in and simply collect these already-extracted resources from the surface. On a net level across an entire galaxy over millions of years, this is significantly cheaper than sending out automated drones to directly mine for the resources. It is illegal to outright invade one of the seeded civilizations, and the Falshi must wait for them to drive themselves into extinction without outside interference. The Falshi do not manipulate the seeded civilization in any way, nor were they genetically designed with a predisposition to kill each other: the Falshi simply discovered that (according to the Fermi Paradox) most industrial civilizations will drive themselves into extinction before developing interstellar spaceflight. The percentage of civilizations that survive to an interstellar stage is actually so astronomically low that out of billions of planets to choose from, a single survey ship might never encounter one.  Synopsis  Two Falshi, Jon and Toku, are on their way to a planet called Earth that they assume has met its demise like all the other planets they have visited. However, after waking from stasis, they discover that humanity has survived their ‚ÄúClosure‚Äù within a megastructure. Jon and Toku are then contacted by the surviving humans before later allowing a human ship to dock with them. As a human envoy boards their ship, Jon and Toku utilize a universal translator to communicate with the humans. The human leader, Renolz, reveals that the megastructure houses the only surviving human civilization of a nuclear war hundreds of years prior. Out of curiosity, Jon reveals the origins of humanity and the Falshi business model, despite Toku‚Äôs protests. The humans are dismayed to learn their existence is little more than a disposable labor force for the Falshi. Despite this, the humans offer a trade alliance with the Falshi but are rejected by Toku. Irritated, Renolz criticizes the Falshi for their callousness and vulture-like business practices. Toku attempts to ease the tension by half- heartedly offering for the Falshi to return in a thousand years to check on the humans. Her offer is countered by Renolz, who cryptically states that humanity may instead find them. Fearful of escalating the situation further, Toku cuts off communication and waits until the humans‚Äô dwindling air supply forces them to return to Earth. As they leave, Renolz ominously vows that the Falshi will hear from humanity again. Unable to proceed with resource collection, Jon and Toku decide to return to the nearest trading station. Jon remains optimistic that the humans will eventually destroy themselves regardless. Toku worries that their interference has given humanity, now aware of the Falshi and their operations, a reason to survive.

Career =Club= Early career in Germany M√ºller started at his hometown club, K√∂ln, where he went through the ranks and eventually played their reserve team in the lower leagues. He made a total of 64 appearances for them in three seasons, and never made any first team appearances. His contract expired in the summer of 2010 and he then signed for 2. Bundesliga side Duisburg. He made his first league appearance on 25 November 2012 vs St. Pauli due to an injury to regular first choice shot- stopper Felix Wiedwald. He was not able to answer his international duties with the Philippines for the 2012 AFF Suzuki Cup. Switzerland stint On 16 July 2013, he joined Swiss club Servette FC, signing a one-year deal with an option for two more years. Sometime in 2016, M√ºller was loaned to √âtoile Carouge of the Swiss league, 1. Liga Promotion. On June 11, 2016, Ceres F.C. of the United Football League announced that Muller will be joining the club. He is set to be included in the squad during the transfer window from July 18‚Äì31 at the end of the first round of the double-round robin league. His contract with √âtoile Carouge was scheduled to be terminated by the end of June. Ceres-Negros in the Philippines Ceres F.C. which then plays in the United Football League signed M√ºller mid-season of the 2016 edition of the league after the goalkeeper had stint with Etoile Carouge on loan. He remained with Ceres when it joined the Philippines Football League, as Ceres-Negros F.C. in 2017. However he announced he took a leave from Ceres-Negros in December 21, 2017 after helping the club win the league title and revealed that he has earlier informed his club as early as June that he would be leaving the club after the inaugural season ended. He stated through social media that he made the decision to give more attention to his pregnant wife.

He was eventually named in the final 20-man squad for the tournament and the provisional Philippines under-23 squad for the 2011 Southeast Asian Games. He made his debut for the Philippine U23 national team at the Southeast Asia-wide regional games and later for the senior squad at the 2011 Long Teng Cup. In 2013, he was included in the Philippines squad for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification campaign. In both matches he was chosen to start ahead of Neil Etheridge and did not concede a single goal, helping the Philippines to qualify for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup. On March 22, 2017, he announced his retirement from the Philippine national team to spend more time with his family. He made 22 international caps for the Philippines often serving as an alternate goalkeeper to Neil Etheridge. He was originally listed in the 23-man Philippine squad which was set to play a friendly against Malaysia the following the day, which was the national team's first full international match in 2017.

The ranch was founded in 1867 by Cornelius O'Keefe.  Cornelius O'Keefe  Cornelius O‚ÄôKeefe was born on July 26, 1838 near Fallowfield, Ontario. His father, Michael O‚ÄôKeefe (ca. 1783-1864) was an Irish immigrant from Kilworth, County Cork, and his mother, Esther Demers, was French Canadian. Cornelius was the seventh child of Michael and Esther, who ran a farm in Nepean Township, Upper Canada. In 1862, having heard of the discovery of gold in British Columbia, he travelled west via the Isthmus of Panama. After an unsuccessful attempt at gold-mining in the Cariboo, he worked in 1862 on the construction of the Cariboo Road between Clinton and Bridge Creek under Gustavus Blinn Wright. Later he helped to build 115 Mile House at Lac la Hache. In 1866 O‚ÄôKeefe met Thomas Wood, a native of Newfoundland, in the vicinity of Kamloops, where Wood had wintered a herd of cattle. The two men went into partnership, first driving the cattle to the Big Bend gold area of the Columbia River and then going overland to the Willamette valley in Oregon, where they purchased a herd of about 180 head. Subsequently they met Thomas Greenhow, an Englishman, who also became a partner, and returned with him through Washington Territory and the Okanagan valley. Arriving at the head of Okanagan Lake in June 1867, the three men each pre-empted 160 acres of bottom land. O‚ÄôKeefe liked to tell his children that on the first rainy day on his new ranch, he built himself a chair. By 1871 Wood had relocated his ranch. O‚ÄôKeefe and Greenhow remained in partnership, establishing a small general store to serve the native people and the few settlers in the north Okanagan. In 1872 this store became the home of the valley‚Äôs first post office; O‚ÄôKeefe would serve as postmaster until 1912. Located at the end of the wagon road into the Okanagan, the post office also became the terminus of the British Columbia Stage Line. Sometime after his arrival O‚ÄôKeefe became involved in a relationship with an Okanagan woman, Alapetsa Stalekaya, from the nearby Head of the Lake band. Together they had two children, a boy and a girl. This relationship not only improved O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs domestic circumstances, but also established an alliance with the Okanagan. The alliance was to be strained in 1873 when O‚ÄôKeefe filed an additional pre-emption on land claimed by the Okanagan but exempted from the reserve boundaries established in 1865. The disputed land would be granted to the natives after a lengthy negotiation. The 1870s were a time of dwindling markets for the cattlemen of the British Columbia interior. O‚ÄôKeefe and Greenhow were content to build up their herds and use the income from their store and post office, and from a newly constructed grist mill, to purchase additional lands. By 1876 O‚ÄôKeefe owned 960 acres of prime Okanagan bottom land with good access to water. O‚ÄôKeefe returned to Nepean Township in 1877 and married Mary Ann McKenna in Fallowfield on 20 November. They were to have five sons and four daughters over the next 16 years. During that time O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs fortunes improved dramatically. The depression that had followed the gold-rush was lifted by the economic activity resulting from the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the early 1880s. For ranchers like O‚ÄôKeefe, living near the line of construction, there was a ready market for beef and other goods. With the completion of the CPR, interior ranches gained access to new markets in coastal British Columbia and in southern Alberta, where livestock were in demand for foundation herds. The O‚ÄôKeefe Ranch, which by the mid-1890s had reached about 12,000 acres, raised cattle and sheep and had large acreages in wheat. But the successful growing of fruit in the Okanagan valley placed increasing pressure on the large cattle ranchers to sell their lands for settlement. This, coupled with a falling off of the beef market in the late 1890s and the overgrazing of pasture lands, brought about the end of large- scale ranching in the Okanagan. O‚ÄôKeefe was one of the last to sell. Having previously subdivided and sold about 3,000 acres, he disposed of most of his remaining holdings in 1907 to the Land and Agricultural Company of Canada. Mary Ann O‚ÄôKeefe had died in 1899, leaving O‚ÄôKeefe, at the age of 63, with eight surviving children. He returned to Fallowfield and, on 8 Jan. 1900, married Elizabeth Theresa Tierney. The couple would have three sons and three daughters, the last child born when Cornelius was 76. After 1907 O‚ÄôKeefe invested in town lots in Vernon and constructed theatres there and in Kamloops. A justice of the peace, he also served as director of the British Columbia Cattle Association, director of the Okanagan and Spallumcheen Agricultural Society, and president of the Vernon Jockey Club. He was active in the Conservative party and in 1911 was elected honorary president of the Vernon Conservative Association. He lived until his death in his lovely ranch house, which remained in the family‚Äôs hands until 1977 and is preserved today as an historic site.  O'Keefe Ranch Historic Site  O'Keefe Ranch is an historic site situated 12 km north of the City of Vernon. It was originally opened by Cornelius and Elizabeth O'Keefe's youngest son, Tierney. Tierney and his wife Betty operated the ranch as a family business for 10 years, until they sold the ranch to the Devonian Group of Charitable Foundations, who in turn sold it to the City of Vernon for $1 to be operated as an historic site in perpetuity. Today, O'Keefe Ranch is operated by the O'Keefe Ranch and Interior Heritage Society, a non-profit group. It is also a registered charity. The ranch is open to the public each year from approximately May until October, and offers public programming and events. Each year, between 2-3,000 elementary school children visit the ranch for educational programs, including tours of the O'Keefe Mansion, Balmoral Schoolhouse and General Store. The O'Keefe Ranch houses approximately 10,000 artifacts, of which 2,500 originally belonged to the O'Keefe family. The O'Keefe family's original textual documents, books and photographs are housed in an on-site museum and archives and are available to the public for viewing. A portion of these archival materials have also been digitized and can be viewed online through the Digitized Okanagan History project.  Historic Buildings  O'Keefe Ranch has retained several original buildings from the 19th century, many of which are open to the public from May until October for self-guided tours. They are decorated as they would have been during the 19th century. = St. Anne's Church = St. Anne's Church was built in 1889 to service the North Okanagan. It is one of the earliest extant churches built in the North Okanagan and was originally a Roman Catholic church. Today it is open to the public for viewing during the ranch's open season and is outfitted with original pews, pump organ and Oblate priest's vestments. The church is also available as a wedding venue. = Blacksmith Shop = The ranch is home to a blacksmith shop, though it is not an original building. Cornelius O'Keefe's 19th century blacksmith shop was located across the highway, on the land that is now the Spallumcheen Golf Course. The current building was reconstructed in the 1960s from found materials, and houses the family's original Peter Wright anvil and other early tools. = General Store = The original General Store was opened in 1870 and remained in use until 1919 when it was torn down. Today visitors can stroll through a reproduction of the original store that was constructed in the 1960s with found materials. It is outfitted with numerous 19th century artifacts, including Cornelius O'Keefe's original safe and postal scales. = Log House = Cornelius and Mary Ann O'Keefe's original log house, built ca. 1876. Visitors are able to tour the house and view the parlour, kitchen, and upstairs bedroom. In 1882, Canada's Governor General, the Marquis of Lorne visited the Okanagan for a hunting trip and was put up in this log home. = Chinese Cooks House = This small house, constructed around 1890, housed the family's Chinese cooks who worked on site. = O'Keefe Mansion = The mansion was constructed in stages beginning in 1886, and was completed by 1896. Today, it is the only building on the ranch where visitors may sign up for a guided tour. It houses numerous pieces of original 19th century furniture purchased by the O'Keefe family, as well as a Mermod Freres music box, a Steck Baby Grand piano, and a 115-piece set of Meissen Porcelain. = Greenhow Museum = The Greenhow Museum is a museum adapted from a house constructed in 1941, over the original foundation of the Greenhow Mansion. The Greenhow Mansion was commissioned by Elizabeth Greenhow and constructed in 1892. It was destroyed by fire in 1939, after which the present building was reconstructed. Today, the Greenhow Museum is divided into galleries with rotating annual exhibitions, open to visitors during the ranch's open season from May to October. The Greenhow Museum also houses the ranch's archives and contains thousands of original documents, books and photographs. = Cowboy Bunkhouse = The Cowboy Bunkhouse was built in the 1940s and is decorated today with original cowboy gear and reproduction bunks. = Balmoral Schoolhouse = The Balmoral Schoolhouse is not original to the ranch, but was instead built in the Balmoral region of in the Interior of British Columbia in 1912. It was moved to the Ranch in the 1990s and re-staged as a Victorian schoolroom. In the entryway are display cases with early 20th century education artifacts. = Schubert House = The Schubert House is not original to the Ranch. It was built in 1892 by Augustus Schubert III, son of Augustus Schubert II and Catherine Schubert, members of the Overlanders of 1862 group. The Schubert House was transported to O'Keefe Ranch in 1989, and visitors are able to view it during the open season from May until October. It contains numerous original Schubert family artifacts from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Early life Larsen was born in Aarhus on 23 September 1893, the son of L.M. Larsen and Thyra Vilhelmine Unmack. His father was the director of the city's poorhouse and Larsen was raised there. Larsen said that his childhood among the poor was \\"this mixture of tragedy and baroque, macabre comedy\\" and gave him an understanding of social problems and the dark sides of society. Larsen had an older brother, Eiler Larsen, who earned fame as \\"the Greeter\\" in Laguna Beach, California. Career Larsen graduated from law school in 1918 and worked in the criminal courts. He served as chairman of the district rent control board. As chairman of the city library association, Larsen was instrumental in forcing the city to refurbish its library system.

He was again elected to the Aarhus city council in 1943. Following the sudden death of Aarhus mayor, Stecher Christensen, Larsen was chosen as his successor beginning 21 June 1945. He served until 1 October 1958. The Danish historian Ole Degn stated that Larsen was a primary influence on social and philanthropic development: new public housing projects, the preservation of natural green spaces and beaches, and the support of the arts, library science and cultural institutions. According to Degn, Larsen suffered from violent mood swings. Debilitating depression led him to abandon political office in 1958. Personal life Larsen married Ingeborg Carla Held Andersen, the daughter of a postmaster, on 27 November 1919. She died on 15 January 1961 in Aarhus. Larsen died 23 March 1965.

Brendan Nagle, Stanley M. Burstein retrieved approximately 21:24GMT 29.9.11 The scroll was written in the 18th century B.C. by Nebmare-nakht, the royal scribe and chief overseer of the cattle of Amun. It was directed to his pupil, Wenemdiamun, and advocated the benefits of becoming a scribe while simultaneously denouncing other jobs such as farming and soldiering for the physical labor and danger involved. The text was later used as practice for new scribes.  Context  During Senusret III's reign, the political difficulties of the 10th, 11th, and 12th dynasties had been nearly resolved, leaving him free to campaign deep into Nubia, dig canals, and increase the power of his government. This increase in government created a need for more scribes, and the Papyrus Lansing served not only as a message encouraging Nebmare-nakht's apprentice Wenemdiamun to continue his journey to become a scribe, but also increased public interest as the document circulated, encouraging many others to become scribes as well. In addition, new scribes copied the Lansing Papyrus, in which role it served as both practice and propaganda. The papyrus was found in Thebes and acquired by the British Museum in 1886.  Content  The Papyrus Lansing is divided into five parts: Praise of the Scribe's Profession; Advice to the Unwilling Pupil; All Occupations Are Bad Except That of the Scribe; The Misfortunes of the Peasant; and The Scribe Does Not Suffer Like the Soldier. = Praise of the Scribe's Profession = The first section introduces the author as Nebmare-nakht, royal scribe and chief overseer of Amun-ra's sacred cattle. He then claims that becoming a scribe will lead to great advancement, and Wenemdiamun should shun all else in the pursuit of becoming a scribe. Finally, he claims that writing pleases \\"more than bread and beer\\". = Advice to the Unwilling Pupil = The second section begins by chastising Wenemdiamun for his slowness to obey and mourning that no amount of whipping can seem to fix his laziness. Nebmare-nakht says that Wenemdiamun would make in excellent scribe if he put himself to his work. Then he again declares how enjoyable writing is, this time comparing it to the joy of a mother with her newborn. = All Occupations Are Bad Except That of the Scribe = Nebmare-nakht begins by explaining that the occupation of the launderer is inferior because they have to burden their arms with carrying around heavy laundry and scrubbing clothing. The potter is inferior because they end up covered in clay, the cobbler \\"mingles with vats. His odor is penetrating. His hands are red with madder, like one who is smeared with blood.\\" The watchman's job is inferior because they have to stay up all night. The merchants have to travel upstream and downstream all the time and are busy. Sailors don't expect to see Egypt again when they leave. If carpenters don't sell their wood, the shipwright will get after them, and the man who cuts the timber gets it worst of all because he has to stay out working all day. = The Misfortunes of the Peasant = When it rains, the peasant is soaked. He farms all day and makes rope all night. If he leaves out his team of horses, they get eaten by jackals and he has to beg for money to get another one. When he finally has the money to proceed, his field needs to be plowed again and he has to use borrowed grain. Even then, there are snakes, and sometimes the crop doesn't grow. Nubians can steal grain, and if there's none to give, the farmer is beaten, tied, and thrown in a well. Then his wife and children are made into slaves, and there's still no grain. = The Scribe Does Not Suffer Like the Soldier = Nebmare- nakht advises Wenemdiamun to make himself a trusted scribe because he can gain wealth and prestige if he does. Nebmare-nakht then states that a soldier is the lowest of the low in rank, has to wake at all hours, toils like a slave, and is hungry. He has no clothes and little water, and is taken quickly by disease or arrows. If he lives, he will be worn out from marching. The scribe has to worry about none of this.

Career  Having graduated from the Technic School of Bydgoszcz, Andrzej Przybielski started with traditional jazz, playing with Bogdan Ciesielski and Jacek Bednarek within the \\"Traditional Jazz group\\". Until the mid-60s, he played cornet and trumpet, specializing in blues and Dixieland music, his inspiration coming from Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. In 1968, along with the Gdansk Trio he won the Jazz nad OdrƒÖ (Jazz aboard the Oder). In 1969, along with the Modern Music Foundation, he took part in the Jazz Jamboree festival. He composed for the Warszawa National Theatre, the Performer Theatre in Zamo≈õƒá, and the Witkacy Theatre of Zakopane.

Gurley was known for making small, figurine-shaped candles for the main holidays, most notably Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Halloween. The company was owned by Franklin Gurley, who also designed the candles. Gurley candles have become popular collectible items. Company history The company started out in Buffalo, New York in the 1939 as part of candlemaker Franklin Gurley's W&F; Manufacturing Co. Inc. At first the Gurley line was commissioned by the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company (now ExxonMobil) as a way to reuse excess paraffin produced as a by-product of the oil refinery process. Gurley's first products were marketed under the name Tavern. The product line consisted of wax lips and teeth, as well as a limited number of small candle figures in holiday shapes such as ghosts, pilgrims, and Santa Claus. By the late 1940s the company's business was almost exclusively novelty candles. In 1949 Franklin Gurley bought the rights to the Tavern brand, and changed the name to the Gurley Novelty Co. Under the Gurley Novelty Co. name the company continued to manufacture the small wax figures that had made it prosperous. Most candles were manufactured for specific holiday themes. Though each candle came with a wick, they were not marketed as practical candles. Rather, most were purchased as small wax figures for holiday display. Smaller candles were sold individually out of shallow cardboard boxes. Sets, and larger candles were sold in sealed paper boxes. Beginning in the 1960s the two and three-candle sets, and larger candles, were generally sold shrink-wrapped in cellophane. Most candles had a round paper Gurley label attached to the bottom.Ledenbach, Mark. Vintage Halloween Collectibles. Krause Publications, 2003. Tavern and Gurley candles were inexpensive. The 3 1/2 inch figures were sold for decades for $0.10 each, in packs of two for $0.29, and threes for $0.49. Individual larger sizes rarely exceeded $0.99. Tavern and Gurley candles were primarily sold at dime stores such as Ben Franklin's and Woolworth's, though they could also be found at larger stores such as Macy's. Sales continued to rise throughout the 1950s and peaked in the late 1960s. By the late 1970s the company was in decline. Today, Gurley Novelty candles are popular collectibles. By far the most popular are the Halloween and Christmas candles, though demand has recently increased for Thanksgiving and Easter candles as well. The company's line of Glow Candles were the company's most expensive products. They were never a big seller and today are rare.

The GWS focuses on the scientific and heritage values of these areas by promoting professional research and resource stewardship across all the natural and cultural resource disciplines that are required for modern-day park management. The society is named after George Mel√©ndez Wright (1904 - 1936), an American biologist who conceived of, then conducted, the first scientific survey of fauna for the National Park Service between 1929 and 1933. Wright took a pioneering, holistic approach to wildlife management issues in the National Parks and he and his colleagues spent years in the field researching wildlife issues, and advocating for an ecosystem-wide approach to managing species within, and bordering, the parks. About Wright The GWS is named in the honor of George Mel√©ndez Wright. Wright was born in San Francisco, California to a Salvadoran mother and a U.S. American father, both of whom died when he was still young. He was raised by a great aunt, Cordelia Ward Wright, who encouraged his fascination with the natural world and his interest in science. Throughout his childhood, Wright cultivated a practice of observing and recording the habits of wildlife, particularly birds. At the age of 16, Wright started his studies in forestry and vertebrate zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. During his time at the university, Wright spent his summer vacations exploring California, the West, and beyond for recreation as well as research. While still a student at Berkeley, Wright accompanied one of his mentors, Joseph Scattergood Dixon, the Economic Mammologist for Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, on a collecting trip up to Alaska, sponsored by a wealthy East Coast naturalist, in search of the eggs of the elusive surfbird. The trip was a success, with Wright becoming the first person to successfully locate a surfbird's nest. In 1927, Wright entered into the National Park Service and joined the staff of Yosemite National Park as Assistant Park Naturalist, working under Carl Parcher Russell. Through this work as well as his time spent in national parks throughout the west, Wright became very concerned about what he would come to call ‚Äúthe problems caused by conflict between man and animal through joint occupancy of the park areas.‚Äù In 1929, with the help of Joseph Dixon, Wright convinced then National Park Service Director Horace Albright to approve a survey of the wildlife and wildlife issues in the national parks in the western U.S. The survey was a ground-breaking project which took root during the early years of the Great Depression; Wright himself funded the survey and the salaries for his two colleagues, Dixon and Benjamin Hunter Thompson. The results were published in 1932 as Fauna of the National Parks of the United States, a Preliminary Survey of Faunal Relations in National Parks. Their follow-up publication, rounding out the two part \\"Fauna\\" series, Wildlife Management in the National Parks was published in 1934 and was soon adopted as official National Park Service policy. For the first time, the survey and reports established science as the basis for wildlife conservation in American national parks. In 1933, Wright became the first chief of the newly-formed Wildlife Division of the Park Service. Under his leadership, and with the aid of Civilian Conservation Corp funding, each of the national parks began to survey and evaluate the status of wildlife on an ongoing basis in order to identify urgent problems especially in regards to restoration, conflict management, and rare or endangered species. In February of 1936, Wright died in an automobile accident at the age of 31 near Deming, New Mexico, while serving on a commission establishing new parks along the Mexican border. Had he lived, Wright likely would have become one of America‚Äôs most influential conservationists  The Society  The GWS was founded in 1980 by Robert M. Linn and Theodore Sudia, both of whom served in the position of chief scientist of the U.S. National Park Service. The society was created in response to a need voiced during the first and second national conferences on science in the U.S. national parks (1976 and 1979, respectively): namely, for an independent nonprofit professional association to exchange and synthesize information useful to natural and cultural resource management. Membership Membership in the GWS is open to anyone who shares its objectives. Most members come from the U.S. and Canada, with other individuals scattered across countries outside of North America. As of 2011, the GWS has 980 members. Although named in honor of a scientist, from the beginning the GWS has been interdisciplinary: members come from a wide variety of fields, such as archaeology, biology, history, social science, air and water quality, environmental ethics, etc. The interdisciplinary nature of the GWS distinguishes it from professional societies focused on particular subjects. Scope and Activities The GWS is concerned with parks, protected areas, and cultural sites anywhere in the world. These three overlapping terms cover a broad array of places, both ‚Äúcultural‚Äù and ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù managed by different entities under a variety of designations: * parks at all levels: national/federal, state/provincial, county, and city * historic, archaeological, and other cultural sites; cultural landscapes; protected landscapes/seascapes * research areas and designated wilderness within national and state forests; other protected natural areas * national and state/provincial wildlife refuges, and other similar protected public lands * natural and cultural areas and sites administered by tribal nations and/or indigenous people; community-conserved areas; sacred natural sites * marine protected areas; estuarine, freshwater, and other aquatic sanctuaries * private land-trust reserves The GWS also encompasses disciplines and activities that link with or otherwise support the work of parks, such as GIS and museum work. The two main activities of the GWS are both related to the sharing of interdisciplinary information. It organizes the U.S.‚Äôs largest professional conference in the field, the George Wright Society Conference on Parks, Protected Areas, and Cultural Sites, held every two years; typically, over 1,000 people attend. Recent conferences have included sessions on inventory and monitoring, remote sensing, wilderness, climate change, and cultural heritage interpretation. Between 1981 and 2018, the society published The George Wright Forum: the society's journal on parks, protected areas, and cultural sites. Issues focused on such topics as environmental history and U.S. national parks, civic engagement, integrating science and management, and the 100th anniversary of Parks Canada. In January of 2020, the GWS teamed up with The UC Berkeley Institute for Parks, People, and Biodiversity to found the Parks Stewardship Forum. The Parks Stewardship Forum, \\"explores innovative thinking and offers enduring perspectives on critical issues across the whole spectrum of place-based heritage management and stewardship. It is the only professional conservation journal with an interdisciplinary focus, publishing insights from all fields related to parks, protected areas, cultural sites, and other forms of place-based conservation.\\" The GWS promotes greater diversity in the parks professions through three programs: the George Melendez Wright Student Travel Scholarship aimed at minority students, and a Native Participant Travel Grant Program, aimed at Native people from North America, both of which are given to enable attendance at the GWS's conference; and Park Break, a week-long, in-park seminar where graduate students learn about research and resource management issues in the host park. Through the GWS Awards Program, the society recognizes achievements in Natural Resources, Cultural Resources, Social Science, and Communications, as well as lifetime accomplishments in any of the park-related professions. The GWS offers a daily news digest, Parkwire, that provides links to research and resource management news from parks, protected areas, and cultural sites around the world.

Erie is located eight miles west of Salmo, southwest of Nelson. The town of Erie was originally known as North Fork. Erie was founded in the 1860s when prospectors discovered gold in a canyon on a stream called North Fork Creek. North Fork Creek is now called Erie Creek. A mineshaft was bored up on the mountain at the Arlington claim and removed ore for several years. Cabins and bunkhouses were built about 1897 on the mountain. The Second Relief claim was formed later and worked too. One miner was named Gillam [who incidentally was the grandfather to singer Michelle Phillips.] The Great Northern Railway, working locally as the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway, built a line and siding--Erie Siding-- to load the ore at the foot of the mountain. The mines only ran for a dozen years when the majority of mining activity moved to Ymir and Sheep Creek areas. Mining continued sporadically in the years thereafter. The town of Erie declined and moved into lumbering and homesteading when other towns such as Ymir and Salmo became more metallurgically prominent. Today there is a motel and cafe at the location.

A. Shiva Ayyadurai (born Vellayappa Ayyadurai Shiva, December 2, 1963) is an Indian-American scientist, engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and promoter of conspiracy theories and unfounded medical claims. He is notable for his widely discredited claim to be the \\"inventor of email\\", based on the electronic mail software called \\"EMAIL\\" he wrote as a New Jersey high school student in the late 1970s. Initial reports that repeated Ayyadurai's assertion‚Äîfrom organizations such as The Washington Post and the Smithsonian Institution‚Äîwere followed by public retractions. These corrections were triggered by objections from historians and ARPANET pioneers who pointed out that email was already actively used in the early 1970s. Ayyadurai also attracted attention for two reports: the first questioning the working conditions of India's largest scientific agency; the second questioning the safety of genetically modified soybeans. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ayyadurai became known for a social media disinformation campaign about the coronavirus: spreading conspiracy theories about the cause of coronavirus; promoting unfounded COVID-19 treatments; and campaigning to fire Anthony Fauci for allegedly being a so-called \\"deep state\\" actor. Ayyadurai holds four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), including a Ph.D. in biological engineering, and is a Fulbright grant recipient. He garnered 3.39% of the vote as an independent candidate in the 2018 United States Senate election in Massachusetts, and ran as a Republican in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, but lost to Kevin O‚ÄôConner in the primary.  Early life and education  Shiva Ayyadurai was born Vellayappa Ayyadurai Shiva in 1963, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He grew up in the Muhavur village in Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu. At the age of seven, he left with his family to live in the United States. In 1978, as a 14-year-old high school student, Ayyadurai attended a summer program at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (NYU) to study computer programming. While a student at Livingston High School in New Jersey, Ayyadurai volunteered at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) where his mother worked. There he created an email system to emulate the paper-based interoffice mail system then in use at the medical school. In 1982, he registered the copyright for his software, called \\"EMAIL\\", as well as for the program's user documentation. Ayyadurai's undergraduate degree from MIT was in electrical engineering and computer science; he took a master's degree in visual studies from the MIT Media Laboratory on scientific visualization; concurrently, he completed another master's degree in mechanical engineering, also from MIT; and in 2007, he obtained a Ph.D. in biological engineering from MIT in systems biology, with his thesis focusing on modeling the whole cell by integrating molecular pathway models. In 2007, he was awarded a Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant to study the integration of Siddha, a system of traditional medicine developed in South India, with modern systems biology. Career =Millennium Cybernetics= In 1994, Ayyadurai founded a company called Millennium Cybernetics, which produces email management software originally called Xiva and now called EchoMail. The software analyzes incoming email messages to organizations before either replying automatically or forwarding it to the most relevant department. By 2001, customers included Kmart, American Express, and Calvin Klein, as well as more than thirty U.S. senators to help handle constituent email. EchoMail competed with more established customer relationship management software that had an email component. On its website, EchoMail describes Ayyadurai as the \\"Inventor of Email\\". =CSIR India= In 2009, Ayyadurai was hired by India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India's largest science agency, by its director general, Samir K. Brahmachari. CSIR was mandated to create a new company, CSIR Tech, that would establish businesses using the research conducted by the country's many publicly owned laboratories. Ayyadurai reported that he had spent months trying to create a business plan for CSIR Tech, but received no response from Brahmachari. Ayyadurai then distributed a draft plan, which was not authorized by CSIR, to the agency's scientists that requested feedback and criticized management. His job offer was subsequently withdrawn five months after the position was offered. Brahmachari said that \\"the offer was withdrawn as [Ayyadurai] did not accept the terms and conditions and demanded unreasonable compensation.\\" In its report, The New York Times said that \\"going public with such accusations is highly unusual. Mr. Ayyadurai circulated his paper not just to the agency's scientists but to journalists, and wrote about his situation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\\" In that letter, Ayyadurai said his report was intended to explore institutional barriers to CSIR's entrepreneurial mandate. He said that CSIR scientists reported that \\"they work in a medieval, feudal environment\\" that required a \\"major overhaul\\". The letter was co-authored by a colleague, Deepak Sardana. Pushpa Bhargava, founding director of the CSIR's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, endorsed the letter, calling Ayyadurai's sacking the worst of many cases he had seen of \\"vindictiveness in the CSIR\\" and accused CSIR administration of being \\"impervious to healthy and fair criticism\\". The incident was seen as an example of the difficulty some Indian expatriate professionals may encounter returning home after growing accustomed to the more direct management style of the U.S. =Genetically modified food= In 2015, Ayyadurai published a paper that applied systems biology, which uses mathematical modeling, to predict the chemical composition of genetically modified (GM) soybeans, and whether or not they were substantially equivalent to unmodified soybeans. The paper claimed that GM soybeans have lower levels of the antioxidant glutathione and higher levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, making the modified soybean substantially different, contrary to previous safety assessments. Shortly after publication, Ayyadurai embarked on a speaking tour of the U.S. At the National Press Club, he said that genetic modification had \\"fundamentally modified the metabolic system of the soy\\", disrupting the \\"beautiful way of detoxifying [formaldehyde]\\" present in non-GM soy.Ayyadurai, V.A. Shiva. (2015) \\"Systems Biology reveals GMO testing is flawed\\", Facebook. Retrieved August 26, 2018. The European Food Safety Agency evaluated the paper and determined that \\"the author's conclusions are not supported\\" due to the lack of information on the input into the model, the fact that the model was not validated and because no measurements of soybeans were made to establish whether GM soy actually contained elevated levels of formaldehyde. Plant scientist Kevin Folta noted that there was \\"no evidence ever published ... that shows a difference in formaldehyde between GM and non-GM varieties\\". Ayyadurai later cited the study as evidence of a lack of safety standards for GM foods and bet Monsanto a $10 million building if they could prove that they were safe. Monsanto did not take up the challenge but stated that GM food did indeed undergo safety assessments that \\"are more rigorous and thorough than assessments of any other food crop in history\\". In 2016, Ayyadurai promised to donate $10 million to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign if she could disprove his research. = Politics = On March 17, 2017, Ayyadurai filed as a Republican candidate in the 2018 United States Senate election in Massachusetts, running against incumbent Elizabeth Warren. On November 11, 2017, he announced he would run as an independent and ultimately garnered 3.4% of the vote. Ayyadurai said that Senator Warren was at the top of a U.S. \\"neo‚Äìcaste system\\" composed of \\"academics, career politicians and lawyer/lobbyists\\", a \\"spineless clan\\" who never expect to be challenged. He said he would take a science and engineering perspective on problem solving, focusing on immigration, education and innovation. He called for secure borders and an end to sanctuary cities, support for more choices in public education, and for more scrutiny of \\"pay- to-play\\" science research. Ayyadurai has accused Warren of voting in favor of the Farmer Assurance Provision and against a GM labeling bill sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. However, the Act was reportedly passed to avoid a government shutdown, and Warren petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for \\"regulations to ensure that the labeling of GMO products is fair, standardized and transparent.\\" In August 2017, Ayyadurai spoke at the Boston Free Speech rally, a gathering which drew large counter-protests and whose speaker line-up included right-wing extremists. Ayyadurai later disputed how the event was characterized, tweeting that the \\"establishment\\" wanted to block attendance and media coverage and sought a \\"Race War to divide us\\". In April 2018, the city of Cambridge threatened Ayyadurai with daily fines for an alleged zoning code violation if he did not remove a banner on his campaign bus. The banner featured his campaign slogan, \\"Only a real Indian can defeat a fake Indian\\", together with a digitally altered image depicting Warren in a Native American headdress, a reference to her claim to be of part Cherokee descent. The city reversed its position the following month and Ayyadurai, in turn, dropped a lawsuit alleging that his free speech rights had been violated. During the campaign, Ayyadurai appeared on a livestream with Matthew Colligan, a white supremacist known for his participation in the 2017 Unite the Right rally. Colligan requested that Ayyadurai bless a small statue of Kek, the green frog that came to prominence as a symbol of the alt-right during the 2016 United States presidential election. Ayyadurai obliged and described Colligan as \\"one of our greatest supporters\\". Ayyadurai ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. =COVID-19 misinformation= During the COVID-19 pandemic Ayyadurai used social media to spread various conspiracy theories and misinformation about the pandemic. In January 2020 he claimed that the coronavirus was patented by the Pirbright Institute, but the patent he referenced relates to avian coronavirus, which infects birds, not SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the pandemic. Ayyadurai defined COVID-19 as \\"an overactive dysfunctional immune system that overreacts and that's what causes damage to the body\\", and claimed that vitamin C could be used to treat it. He alleged that the coronavirus was spread by the \\"deep state\\" and accused Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of being a \\"Deep State Plant\\". Ayyadurai called for Fauci to be fired and his supporters lobbied for Fauci to be replaced by Ayyadurai. In March 2020 he published an open letter to president Donald Trump where he wrote that a national lockdown was unnecessary and advocated that large doses of vitamins could prevent and cure the disease. In April 2020, Politico and Vanity Fair reported that QAnon supporter DeAnna Lorraine recommended that Shiva be included in coronavirus discussions at Donald Trump's White House. \\"EMAIL\\" invention controversy Ayyadurai makes the widely disputed claim to be the \\"inventor of email\\". His claim is based on the software he wrote as a 14-year-old student at Livingston High School in New Jersey. In 1979‚Äîsome sources say 1978‚Äîhe wrote an implementation of an interoffice email system, which he called EMAIL. A November 2011 Time Techland interview by Doug Aamoth, entitled \\"The Man Who Invented Email\\", argued that EMAIL represented the birth of email \\"as we currently know it\\". In that interview, Ayyadurai recalled that Les Michelson, the former particle scientist at Brookhaven National Labs who assigned Ayyadurai the project, had the idea of creating an electronic mail system that uses the header conventions of a hardcopy memorandum. Ayyadurai recalled Michelson as saying: \\"Your job is to convert that into an electronic format. Nobody's done that before.\\" In February 2012, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History announced that Ayyadurai had donated \\"a trove of documents and code\\" related to EMAIL. Initially, the museum‚Äîinaccurately‚Äîcited the program as one of the first to include the now common \\"subject and body fields, inboxes, outboxes, cc, bcc, attachments, and others. He based these elements directly off of the interoffice mail memos the doctors had been using for years, in hopes of convincing people to actually use the newfangled technology.\\" Ayyadurai's claims drew editorial clarifications and corrections, as well as criticism from industry observers. In a followup to its acquisition announcement, the Smithsonian stated that it was not claiming that Ayyadurai had invented email, but rather that the materials were historically notable for other reasons related to trends in computer education and the role of computers in medicine. The Smithsonian statement distinguished Ayyadurai's achievement by noting that historians in the field, \\"have largely focused on the use of large networked computers, especially those linked to the ARPANET in the early 1970s\\". The statement pointed out that Ayyadurai's approach instead \\"focused on communications between linked computer terminals in an ordinary office situation\\". The Washington Post also followed up with a correction of errors in its earlier report on the Smithsonian acquisition, stating that it incorrectly referred to Ayyadurai as the inventor of electronic messaging; the 'bcc', 'cc', 'to' and 'from' fields existed previously; Ayyadurai had not been honored as the \\"inventor of email\\". Writing for Gizmodo, Sam Biddle argued that email was developed a decade before EMAIL, beginning with Ray Tomlinson's sending the first text letter between two ARPANET-connected computers in 1971.i.e. the first network email using the \\"@\\" syntax; email between users on the same mainframe was already common. Biddle quoted Tomlinson: \\"[We] had most of the headers needed to deliver the message (to:, cc:, etc.) as well as identifying the sender (from:) and when the message was sent (date:) and what the message was about.\\" Biddle allowed for the possibility that Ayyadurai may have coined the term \\"EMAIL\\" and used the header terms without being aware of earlier work, but maintained that the historical record isn't definitive on either point. Biddle wrote that \\"laying claim to the name of a product that's the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room. But creating a type of airplane named AIRPLANE doesn't make you Wilbur Wright.\\" Thomas Haigh, a historian of information technology at the University of Wisconsin, wrote that \\"Ayyadurai is, to the best of my knowledge, the only person to have claimed for him or herself the title 'inventor of email'.\\" Haigh argued that while EMAIL was impressive for a teenager's work, it contained no features that were not present on previous electronic mail systems and had no obvious influence on later systems. \\"The most striking thing about Ayyadurai's claim to have invented electronic mail is how late it comes. Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [his] greatest achievement\\". Haigh wrote that by 1980, \\"electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical email system for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet.\\" David Crocker, a member of the ARPANET research community, writing in the Post, said, \\"The reports incorrectly credited [EMAIL's] author, a 14-year-old in the late 1970s, as the 'inventor' of email, long after it had become an established service on the ARPANET.\\" Another computer historian, Marc Weber, a curator at the Computer History Museum, said that by 1978, \\"nearly all the features we're familiar with today had appeared on one system or another over the previous dozen years\\", including emoticons, mailing lists, flame wars, and spam mail. After the controversy unfolded, MIT disassociated itself from Ayyadurai's EMAIL Lab and funding was dropped. MIT also revoked Ayyadurai's contract to lecture at the bioengineering department. Ayyadurai characterized the earlier work of Tomlinson, Tom Van Vleck and others as text messaging, rather than an electronic version of an interoffice mail system. Responding to his critics on his personal website, Ayyadurai described EMAIL as \\"the first of its kind‚Äîa fully integrated, database-driven, electronic translation of the interoffice paper mail system derived from the ordinary office situation.\\" He maintained that EMAIL was the first electronic mail system to integrate an easy-to-use user interface, a word processor, a relational database, and a modular inter-communications protocol \\"integrated together in one single and holistic platform to ensure high-reliability and user-friendliness network-wide.\\" Ayyadurai presented a press release on his webpage asserting that his undergraduate professor Noam Chomsky, of MIT's Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, also supported his claims. In March 2016, Ayyadurai alleged that the overlooking of his achievements was a result of racism. He complained about Raytheon, where Tomlinson worked on ARPANET. After Tomlinson's death, Ayyadurai told The Hindu that he believed that news outlets retracted their stories about him because, \\"Raytheon advertises in publications like the Huffington Post and CNN\\" and that if he were \\"a white guy and had a copyright for email, I would have my photo on every stamp in the world.\\" The day after Tomlinson's death, Ayyadurai tweeted: \\"I'm the low- caste, dark-skinned, Indian, who DID invent #email. Not Raytheon, who profits for war & death. Their mascot Tomlinson dies a liar\\". = Gawker = In May 2016, Ayyadurai filed suit against Gawker Media for $35 million, alleging that their website Gawker published \\"false and defamatory statements\\", causing \\"substantial damage to Dr. Ayyadurai's personal and professional reputation and career.\\" The filing also named writer Sam Biddle, executive editor John Cook, and Gawker founder and CEO Nick Denton. Gawker Media responded that, \\"These claims to have invented email have been repeatedly debunked by the Smithsonian Institute, Gizmodo, the Washington Post and others.\\"Shiva Ayyadurai v. Gawker Media, et. al., Complaint (D. Mass, filed May 10, 2016) In November 2016, the by-then-bankrupt Gawker Media settled the lawsuit with Ayyadurai for $750,000 as part of a broader settlement with wrestler Hulk Hogan and journalist Ashley Terrill, all of whom were represented by attorney Charles Harder. In a statement, Ayyadurai said that \\"history will reflect that this settlement is a victory for truth\\". Biddle denounced the settlement and said he fully stood by his reporting. Denton wrote that \\"we expected to prevail\\" in the Ayyadurai and Terrill lawsuits, \\"but all-out legal war with\\" billionaire Peter Thiel, who financially backed Harder, was untenable in terms of cost, time and human toll. Katie Hafner, the author of several books on Internet history‚Äîincluding one on the development of ARPANET email‚Äîsaid, \\"This situation is both bizarre and appalling in that here we are simply trying to get the record straight, and [Ayyadurai has] managed to make money off claims that appear to be misleading.\\" = Techdirt = In January 2017, Ayyadurai, again represented by Harder, filed a $15 million libel lawsuit on similar grounds against Techdirt founder Mike Masnick and two other parties for a series of articles published beginning in September 2014.Shiva Ayyadurai v. Floor64 Inc et. al., Complaint (D. Mass, filed January 4, 2017) In February, Masnick, represented by the firm Prince Lobel, filed two motions to dismiss. One motion argued that the articles were constitutionally protected opinion and written about a public figure without actual malice. The second motion asked for dismissal under California's anti-SLAPP law that compensates defendants for some legal expenses.Memorandum of Floor64, Inc. and Michael Masnick in support of motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(B)(5) and 12(B)(6) (D. Mass, filed February 17, 2017) Memorandum of defendants Floor64, Inc. and Michael Masnick in support of their special motion to strike plaintiff's complaint pursuant to the California Anti-SLAPP law (D. Mass, filed February 17, 2017) In September 2017, United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor dismissed the defamation claims against Techdirt, but declined to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP law. In his ruling, Saylor wrote that definitions of \\"email\\" vary widely. Therefore, \\"whether plaintiff's claim to have invented e-mail is 'fake' depends upon the operative definition of 'e-mail.' Because the definition does not have a single, objectively correct answer, the claim is incapable of being proved true or false.\\" The two parties filed cross-appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but settled out of court in May 2019, with no money changing hands. Techdirts articles remain online with an added link to a rebuttal on Ayyadurai's website. = Other actions = In January 2017, Harder threatened the Diaspora Foundation with legal action unless it removed three posts by Roy Schestowitz that Harder alleged were \\"defamatory\\" towards Ayyadurai. (The Diaspora Foundation is part of the Free Software Support Network, which is in turn run by Eben Moglen and the Software Freedom Law Center.) Personal life Beginning in 2014, Ayyadurai was romantically connected with the actress Fran Drescher. On September 7, 2014, Ayyadurai and Drescher participated in a ceremony at Drescher's beach house. Both tweeted that they had gotten married, and the event was widely reported as such. Ayyadurai later said it was not \\"a formal wedding or marriage\\", but a celebration of their \\"friendship in a spiritual ceremony with close friends and her family\\". The couple split up in September 2016.

It flew in 1935 but had only made four test flights when the Bernard company was declared bankrupt, preventing further development. Design and development In the early 1930s the French Navy became interested in catapult launched floatplane fighters and the Soci√©t√© des Avions Bernard produced the twin float Bernard H 52 in response, deriving it from their earlier Bernard 20, 74 and 260 land based fighter aircraft. The H stood for the new Naval Hydravion class. The Navy did not adopt the H 52 but put forward a specification which called for supercharging to 4,000 m (13,100 ft) and a stalling speed of less than 100 km/h (62 mph). This brought designs from four manufacturers; one of these, the Bernard H 110, was a H 52 development, slightly larger and with a more powerful engine. The Bernard H 110 had a mid mounted cantilever wing. In plan, it was straight tapered with elliptical tips. Following the methods used on earlier Bernard aircraft, the wing was a single piece structure which incorporated part of the fuselage. In the place of spars it had six span-wise cells formed from vertical alloy plates separated by spacers close to the wing surface. Each cell was separated from the next by wider spacers, all of which were shaped to the airfoil profile. The H 52 was metal skinned but the H 110 was fabric covered as the Navy found this easier to repair. The cells were vertically expanded at the centre of the wing structure to form the cockpit area of the fuselage between the engine and the rear part. On its trailing edge the wing carried horn balanced ailerons and inboard flaps, with pilot controlled, full span Handley Page slots on the leading edge. The rear fuselage, beginning just behind the open cockpit and the trailing edge of the wing, was built around four longerons. These connected, via four steel members in the wing centre section, to the engine mountings. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a mid set tailplane and fin. The rudder and separate elevators were both balanced. Ahead of the wing leading edge, the 530 kW (710 hp) Hispano-Suiza 9Vbs nine cylinder radial engine was enclosed by a long chord cowling with small superimposed fairings, two per cylinder, for the valve mechanisms and drove a three blade propeller. The H 100 had a pair of floats close in length to that of the fuselage and fitted with mid-length steps and water rudders at the stern. They were made from v√©dal, duralumin plated with pure aluminium to improve their salt water resistance. Each float was mounted by five streamlined struts, two outwards and upwards to the wing and three upwards to the lower fuselage. This arrangement left the central fuselage to carry bombs if required. The H 110 carried a pair of Darne 7.5 m (0.295 in) calibre machine guns, mounted in the wings just above the floats and firing outside the propeller disc. The H 110 flew from the Seine in June 1935 without incident, taking off with slots open in six seconds. Three more flights were made before S.A.B. was declared bankrupt. The H 110 then became the property of the administrators and was scrapped and the Navy ordered the Loire 210.

It is located west of the junction of Ferguson and Lardeau Creeks. It came into being with the discovery of gold in the region. In 1897, the Lardeau Hotel opened. By 1899, Ferguson had a main street with hotels, shops and saloons, and a population of 800. It had a newspaper called The Ferguson Eagle. It eventually went into decline and by 1920 was almost deserted. The Lardeau Hotel stood into the 1970s. The main street is said to have come back to life in the 2000s, when many lots were sold to cabin builders. Though mines in the surrounding mountains which had been supplied through Ferguson (Broadview, True Fissure, Nettie L., Silver Cup) had generally fallen into disuse by the 1970s, substantial mineral resources remain in the area. In 2006 5 mines to the west of Ferguson were consolidated into the Thor deposit, which began gold production again in 2017. Ferguson was founded and named for Dave Ferguson, who came from Grand Bend, Ontario in 1891, and vanished in Saanich in December 1903.

He was a judge in Ireland who held the office of Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and was noteworthy as the first judge to hold assizes in Ulster. His career suffered due to suspicions that he was secretly a Roman Catholic. These suspicions were due partly to his marriage into a famous recusant family, and partly due to the indifference which both he and his wife showed to the Anglican faith. Background He was the fifth son of Sir William Pelham of Laughton in East Sussex and his second wife Mary Sandys, daughter of William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys of the Vyne and Margaret Bray. Sir William Pelham, Lord Justice of Ireland (died 1587) was his full brother, and Sir Nicholas Pelham (1517-60) was his older half-brother. Sir William Pelham, Lord Justice of Ireland, Edmund's elder brother Early career His father died when he was about five years old. Little is recorded of his life until 1563 when he was admitted to Gray's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1574. He remained at Gray's Inn for 40 years, becoming Reader and Ancient of the Inn, but he does not seem to have advanced far in his legal career, although he was elected to the House of Commons as member for Hastings in 1597.Hester, P.W. The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603 The fact that his wife Ellen Darrell belonged to an openly Roman Catholic family no doubt hindered his career. His enemies accused him, if not of actual Catholic sympathies, at least of being a \\"cold professor\\" of the Protestant faith. He rarely and only with obvious reluctance attended Church of England services,Hester History of Parliament and even more rarely took Holy Communion, at a time when failure to attend Church once a week and take Communion at least once a year was a breach of a legal duty, as well as being evidence of recusancy.Kenyon, J.P The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.5 In Ireland In 1601 he finally became Serjeant-at-law: since he was now close to 70, this might reasonably have been expected to mark the high point of his career. However, in 1602 Sir Robert Napier, who had long been recognised as unfit for high office, was at last removed as the Irish Chief Baron, and Pelham, perhaps because of his brother's long experience as Lord Justice in Ireland, was chosen to replace him. His enemies noted with glee that the Spanish invasion of Ireland and the ensuing Battle of Kinsale filled him with trepidation, and he was accused of deliberately delaying his departure to Ireland until peace was restored. As Chief Baron he is best remembered for holding the first assizes in Donegal in 1603. Allowing for an element of self-congratulation in his own description of the assizes, he seems to have been highly successful in this task: he wrote that \\"the people reverenced him as though he had been an angel from Heaven, and prayed him on their knees to return to minister justice unto them\\".Ball F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol I p.228 He was knighted by King James I of England at Greenwich in 1604. He sat on a commission to inquire into damage suffered by landowners during the Nine Years War, went on the Leinster assize in 1605, and acted as Commissioner of the Great Seal the same year. However he was now an old and sick man: he went to Bath to recover his health in 1606, but died at Chester on 4 June.Ball, p.228 Sir Arthur Chichester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, praised him as a diligent and very worthy judge. Family Scotney Castle, the home of Pelham's wife Ellen Darrell His marriage to Ellen (or Helen) Darrell, daughter of Thomas Darrell of Scotney Castle, Sussex, and his second wife Mary Roydon, was a surprising one for an ambitious lawyer, since the Darrells were notorious recusants who allowed the Jesuits to use Scotney as a refuge. He had five sons including his eldest son and heir Herbert (born 1587), ancestor of the Pelhams of Catsfield, and three daughters, including Ellen (who was still alive in 1609). His widow continued to suffer legal troubles after his death, on account of her Catholic faith. Little appears to be known of Edmunds's children, except for his eldest son. Herbert, and his daughter Ellen, who was charged with recusancy in 1609, along with her mother. Her brother Herbert, by contrast, was reputed to be a strong Puritan, who was opposed, like most Puritans, to the wearing by the local vicar of the surplice. He compared the practice colourfully to a sow wearing a saddle, for which remark he was reported to the authorities by the local churchwarden in 1611.Brandon, Peter and Short, Brian The South East from 1000 AD Routledge London and New York 2014 p.145  References  Category:1606 deaths Category:People from Sussex Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:English MPs 1597‚Äì1598 Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:17th-century Irish lawyers Category:16th-century Irish people Category:16th-century English lawyers Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer Edmund ","title":"Edmund Pelham"},{"id":"33253498","text":"Now That's What I Call Music! 40 was released on November 8, 2011.

It was re-constituted twice between 1951 and 1990 as a medium transport squadron and was finally disbanded in October 1990. History =Indian and Atlantic Oceans= The Squadron was formed from 33 Flight at St Albans in Port Elizabeth on 1 July 1942 and was deployed as a torpedo bomber / coastal reconnaissance squadron patrolling the South African coast flying aged Avro Ansons as part of Coastal Command SAAF.Martin and Orpen, (1979) p.275 The Ansons were gradually replaced and on 12 September 1942 the first Lockheed Ventura Mk I was received and by end 1942 the squadron was only operating Venturas in coastal operations. The first operational deployment was that of Operation Volley, where Venturas from 23 and 25 Squadrons were deployed to intercept German blockade runners together with HMS Sirius and HMS Phoebe in a 400-mile coastal belt off Agulhas between 15 and 21 September 1942.Turner (1961) pp. 155 The German submarine U-504 had been attacking Allied shipping off Cape Agulhas from October 1942 and the squadron was deployed to search for the submarine together with HMS Express and HMS Catterick - unsuccessful patrols failed to prevent the sinking of SS Empire Chaucer, SS City of Johannesburg and US Liberty ship Anne Hutchinson (which broke in two) - the squadron did however succeed in escorting the bow portion of Anne Hutchinson under tow of the South African minesweeper HMSAS David Haigh back to port in Port Elizabeth.Turner (1961), pp. 183 =Mediterranean= In May 1944 the squadron was moved to the Mediterranean with the sea party sailing from Durban on the 13 May for Port Tewfik en route to Pomigliano in Italy and the first five aircraft left AFB Swartkop on the 2 June. By September the squadron was operating from Campomarino landing ground at Biferno. It was planned that the squadron and its Venturas would be used for anti-submarine patrols but by the time it reached the Mediterranean, there was no longer any need for additional anti-submarine squadrons and it was subsequently assigned as part of the Balkan Air Force. =Balkans= The squadron commenced operations in the Balkans on 30 August 1944 and was converted to Martin B-26 Marauder IIIs on 20 November 1944 flying tactical bombing missions in support of Tito partisans in Yugoslavia. The squadron operated from Pomigliano d'Arco in Italy and remained part of the Balkan Air Force until the end of the war, when it was moved back to the Union of South Africa and disbanded on 15 July 1945. =South Africa= On 1 January 1951, the squadron was re-constituted and equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakotas taken over from the Citizen Force 21 Squadron and operated on a part-time basis until the unit was re-numbered as 44 Squadron on 13 November 1953. It was again re-established at AFB Ysterplaat in February 1968 and re-equipped with C-47s until October 1990 when it was disbanded for the last time.

Once dubbed ‚ÄúThe P.T. Barnum of Country Music‚Äù for his large personality, Haney is best known for organizing the first multi-day bluegrass music festival as well as influencing the careers of the Osborne Brothers, Porter Wagoner, Conway Twitty, Merle Haggard,Random Memories The Statler Brothers and Loretta Lynn. He was inducted to the Bluegrass Hall of Fame in 1998 by the International Bluegrass Music Association.  Early life  Haney was born in Rockingham County, North Carolina on September 19, 1928 just as the Bristol Sessions were in full swing. While he was growing up, he didn't like country music at all. In an interview with Fred Bartenstein on August 4, 1971, Haney said he had enjoyed hearing his brother Charles Haney and some friends singing \\"Rainbow at Midnight\\" and began to enjoy a few of Ernest Tubb's records, but still disliked country music. He grew up listening to Bill Monroe, but claims to have never understood why people liked to listen to the music. Then he met Clyde Moody, who knew Bill Monroe and introduced the two future partners. Haney was offered a job working for Monroe and took it solely based on monetary reasoning. \\"I was at Clyde's house, and he [Bill Monroe] come there, in Danville, Virginia. Then I met him and two or three months after that he called me and said he had some show dates canceled and [asked] would I book four or five show dates for him and I did and they turned out real good.\\" Monroe informed Haney that if he ever wanted to quit his job at a battery plant making automobile batteries, he could go to work for him. Haney worked with Monroe for about a year and a half booking shows and traveling with the band. Haney had another opportunity through Monroe to work at Bean Blossom. He stayed there from June until September 1955. Although Haney still had not developed an appreciation for the music he was promoting, he took pride in the fact that he was associated with Monroe and his contributions to this music, which had grown in popularity. When Haney went back to North Carolina he stumbled upon a band that needed someone to help them book shows. They were called the Farm Hands and included Allen Shelton, Curly Howard and Roy Russell.  Professional career  In 1953, Bill Monroe hired Haney as a booking agent for his band, Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys. Haney booked for the band until 1965. Haney was responsible for recruiting fiddler-star Bobby Hicks to band in 1954, initially as a bass player. Haney also managed bluegrass duo Reno and Smiley between 1955 and 1964. While working with Reno and Smiley, he initiated the daily television show, ‚ÄúTop ‚Äòo the Morning,‚Äù on WDBJ, Roanoke and wrote and co-wrote Reno & Smiley staples songs \\"He Will Forgive You,\\" \\"Kneel Down\\", \\"I Never Get To Hold You In My Arms Anymore\\" and \\"Jimmy Caught the Dickens (Pushing Ernest in the Tub).\\" Beginning in the 1960s, Haney began to lump some of the bluegrass and country acts together on the same stage. With the help of Ralph Rinzler in 1965, Haney produced the first weekend-long bluegrass music festival, held at Cantrell‚Äôs Horse Farm in Fincastle, Virginia. This multi-day model became the standard format for bluegrass festivals and there are now more than 500 such events annually. Haney continued staging the festival over the next few years at various locations, including his 160 acres of renovated land in Camp Springs, NC. During the 1970s, Haney published Muleskinner News, a prominent monthly bluegrass magazine and the second of its kind. He co-wrote songs such as The Letter and To See My Angel Cry.  Death  Haney died Wednesday on March 16, 2011 at Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital in Greensboro, North Carolina of complications from a stroke at the age of 82.  Awards and Legacy  Haney was honored with The International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA)'s Award of Merit in 1990 and was later inducted into The Bluegrass Hall of Fame in 1998. The IBMA describe the lasting impact of Haney's multi-day festival: \\"The event proved to be a prototype and precursor that initiated the festival movement in America and ultimately in other countries, bringing incalculable economic benefits to the industry and creating a larger and more diverse audience for the music.\\"  In Media  Haney was featured prominently in the 1971 movie Bluegrass: Country Soul, which was reissued on DVD in 2006. He can be heard introducing Merle Haggard on two live albums, Okie From Muskogee (1969) and The Fightin' Side of Me (1970)  References  Category:1928 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Rockingham County, North Carolina Category:American bluegrass musicians Category:Country musicians from North Carolina ","title":"Carlton Haney"},{"id":"33253560","text":"Volcanic ash from the eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull disrupted air travel in Europe in 2010. Plumes of volcanic ash near active volcanoes are a flight safety hazard, especially for night flights. Volcanic ash is hard and abrasive, and can quickly cause significant wear to propellers and turbocompressor blades, and scratch cockpit windows, impairing visibility. The ash contaminates fuel and water systems, can jam gears, and make engines flameout. Its particles have low melting point, so they melt in the engines' combustion chamber then the ceramic mass sticks to turbine blades, fuel nozzles, and combustors‚Äîwhich can lead to total engine failure. Ash can also contaminate the cabin and damage avionics. In 1991, the aviation industry decided to set up Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) for liaison between meteorologists, volcanologists, and the aviation industry. Prior to 2010, aircraft engine manufacturers had not defined specific particle levels above which they considered engines at risk. Airspace regulators took the general approach that if ash concentration rose above zero, they considered airspace unsafe, and consequently closed it. The costs of air travel disruption in Europe after a volcanic eruption in 2010 forced aircraft manufacturers to specify limits on how much ash they considered acceptable for a jet engine to ingest without damage. In April, the UK CAA, in conjunction with engine manufacturers, set the safe upper limit of ash density at 2 mg per cubic metre of air space. From May 2010, the CAA revised the safe limit upwards to 4 mg per cubic metre of air space. To minimise further disruption that this and other volcanic eruptions could cause, the CAA created a new category of restricted airspace called a Time Limited Zone. Airspace categorised as TLZ is similar to airspace under severe weather conditions, in that restrictions should be of a short duration. However, a key difference with TLZ airspace is that airlines must produce certificates of compliance for aircraft they want to enter these areas. Any airspace where ash density exceeds 4 mg per cubic metre is prohibited airspace. Volcanic ash in the immediate vicinity of the eruption plume is different in particle size range and density than that in downwind dispersal clouds, which contain only the finest particle sizes of ash. Experts have not established the ash loading that affects normal engine operation (other than engine lifetime and maintenance costs). Whether this silica-melt risk remains at the much lower ash densities characteristic of downstream ash clouds is currently unclear. Experts recognised that there was an issue following British Airways Flight 9 in 1982, and therefore the ICAO established the Volcanic Ash Warning Study Group. Due to the difficulty in forecasting accurate information out to 12 hours and beyond, the ICAO later set up Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs). Volcanic hazards to aviation Volcanic ash consists of small tephra, which are bits of pulverized rock and glass less than in diameter created by volcanic eruptions. The ash enters the atmosphere from the force of the eruption and convection currents from the heated air, and is then carried away from the volcano by winds. The ash with the smallest size can remain in the atmosphere for a considerable period of time, and can drift away from the eruption point. The ash cloud can be dangerous to aviation if it reaches the heights of aircraft flight paths. Chait√©n volcano stretching across Patagonia from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean Pilots can't see ash clouds at night. Also, ash particles are too small to return an echo to on-board weather radars on commercial airliners. Even when flying in daylight, pilots may interpret a visible ash cloud as a normal cloud of water vapour and not a danger‚Äîespecially if the ash has travelled far from the eruption site.Video on Dangers of Volcanic Ash by International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations In the image from the Chait√©n volcano, the ash cloud has spread thousands of kilometers from the eruption site, crossing the width of South America from the Pacific coast and spreading over the Atlantic. Volcanic ash has a melting point of approximately , which is below the operating temperature of modern commercial jet engines, about . Volcanic ash can damage gas turbines in a number of ways. These can be categorised into those that pose an immediate hazard to the engines and those that present a maintenance problem. = Immediate hazards to aircraft = Volcanic ash is composed of fragments of rock, crystalline material, and volcanic glass. The glass component has the lowest melting temperature‚Äîlower than temperatures inside the combustor of a gas turbine engine. Ash that finds its way into the combustor may melt. Combustor and turbine components are cooled, as the metals they are made of have lower melting temperatures than the gas temperature inside the engine core. Molten ash that touches these surfaces is likely to freeze, and accrete on the metal surface. The most sensitive surface is the high-pressure turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), situated immediately downstream of the combustor. The gas flow is choked through the NGVs, and so the flow area through the NGVs is a controlling area for the engine. If this area is reduced due to an accretion of ash, a smaller mass flow rate of gas passes through the engine core. Reduced mass flow leads to the turbine doing less work. The turbine drives the compressor, which accordingly also does less work compressing the air. If the compressor can no longer contain the high pressure gas in the engine core, the gas flow can reverse and flow out of the front of the engine. This is known as an engine surge or a compressor surge, and is often accompanied by a ball of flame that bursts out the front of the engine. This surge is likely to extinguish the flame in the engine combustor, known as a 'flame-out'. Once the high pressure in the core dissipates, the engine should be free to restart. Restarting an engine at altitude can be difficult, due to the lower temperatures and pressures of the ambient gas, but is not normally a problem. The reduced flow area of the NGVs can make it harder to restart the engine. Volcanic ash carries significant electrostatic charge. Fine ash that enters electronic components within the engine or airframe can cause electrical failure‚Äîwhich poses an immediate hazard to the aircraft. Institute of Mechanical Engineers Symposium: Aviation Safety in Volcanic Ash Clouds: Progress since E15. Nov 2013 = Ash-induced problems requiring increased maintenance = # Volcanic ash, as a hard substance, damages gas turbine compressors. It erodes by impacting compressor blades and vanes and removing material‚Äîand abrades by three body interactions between the rotating blade, ash particle, and compressor annulus. Changing the shapes of the blades and vanes and increasing gaps between blades and annuli both help reduce engine fuel efficiency and operability. # Molten ash that sticks to cooled surfaces can block cooling holes. This stops cooling air flow and heats surrounding metal, leading to accelerated thermal fatigue. This process affects combustor and turbine components. # Ash can accumulate and partially block fuel spray nozzles, impairing air and fuel flow fields and mixture stoichiometries in the combustor. Such adverse conditions reduce engine performance and can create local hot spots that increase the combuster's thermal fatigue rate. = Other volcanic hazards to aviation = Sulfur dioxide‚Äîanother product of volcanoes that is carried in ash clouds after an eruption‚Äîis corrosive to aircraft that fly through it. = Countermeasures = There has been an attempt to prove that the sulphur dioxide usually accompanying a volcanic eruption is indeed a good indication of the presence of ash clouds such as to facilitate avoidance of ash clouds in aviation. However, it has been found that the two species of clouds tend to separate due to windshear. Additionally, the detection methods have limitations, as both species have the potential to be masked by other types of aerosol, such as water or ice; this contributes to great variability in the data. Therefore, as there is no consistent overlap between SO2 and the ash, SO2 is not a reliable indicator for ash clouds. Accidents and incidents In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 flew through an ash cloud, lost power from all four engines, and descended from to only before the flight crew managed to restart the engines. A similar incident occurred in 1989 to KLM Flight 867.

It is found on Papyrus Chester Beatty II and narrates the dispute that occurs between Maat (Truth), his unnamed son, and Gereg (Falsehood).  Papyrus Chester Beatty II  The papyrus on which the tale was found is known as Papyrus Chester Beatty II. It dates to the New Kingdom's 19th Dynasty, and there does not seem to be disagreement about this date as many scholarly sources agree on this date. Papyrus is also created from the plant of the same name and can be carbon dated because it is organic matter (Strudwick 484). It is written in hieratic script, the simplified/cursive form of hieroglyphics (Strudwick 482). Papyrus Chester Beatty II was found in fragments at Thebes in Upper Egypt, and like most discoveries found at Thebes, it is mostly religious with political overtones. It was donated to the British Museum in 1930 and has been there ever since, but it is not on display (\\"Collection Object Details: Papyrus Chester Beatty 2\\").  Literary background  The story fits into the genres of melodrama (a narrative in which evil momentarily gains the upper hand) and partial allegory (Vinson 33; Griffiths 90). Its themes are the triumph of maat (order, peace, truth, justice) over isfet (chaos) and how \\"truth must be vindicated by the wiles of falsehood\\" (Vinson 48; Griffiths 91).  Story  Author Steve Vinson gives the following summary of \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" in his article \\"The Accent's on Evil: Ancient Egyptian 'Melodrama' and the Problem of Genre:\\" > Gereg (Falsehood) claims that Ma'at (Truth) has stolen a dagger from him, > and he convinces the Ennead (the nine original gods in the Heliopolitan > creation myth) of the truth his allegation. The Ennead permits Gereg to > blind Ma'at and forces Ma'at to serve Gereg as door-keeper. However, Ma'at > performs his task virtuously and well, and eventually Gereg can't stand his > presence any more. Gereg orders two of Ma'at's servants to take him out into > the desert where, so Gereg hopes, Ma'at will be devoured by lions. But the > servants let Ma'at escape, and Ma'at takes refuge in the home of a beautiful > lady, with whom he has a son. The son grows up, learns the truth of who his > father is and how he had been treated by Gereg and demands justice before > the Ennead. Gereg, sure that Ma'at must be long dead, swears an oath that if > Ma'at is found alive and blinded as the son alleges, then he will willingly > suffer blindness himself. When Ma'at's son produces Ma'at, Gereg is, in > fact, blinded and sentenced by the gods to serve Ma'at as doorkeeper. > (Vinson 47)  Implications of \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\"  There are many implications. Some of these consequences are religious and cultural. One of them is the importance and popularity of certain myths in Ancient Egypt. The relationship between myth and literature in Ancient Egypt is that myths are generally integrated into literature, and \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" chooses to integrate the Osiris and the Horus and Seth/Set myths (Baines 377; Griffiths 90). Despite the many parallels to these two myths, it is only a partial allegory rather than a full one (Griffiths 90). It only concerns the names of the characters and is not used enough to make this story a full allegory (Griffiths 90-91). Another religious and cultural implication involves the theme of \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood:\\" the triumph of ma'at over isfet (Vinson 33). Ma'at had existed since creation but was in a constant struggle with the forces of chaos (Strudwick 366). If order broke down, chaos would follow (Strudwick 366). This concept is so important is it made the moral of \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood.\\" The tale's allegorical nature downplays the narrative's mythological aspect in order to highlight an important moral that Egyptians wanted to ensure in their society and culture (Baines 374). This would guarantee that ma'at would continue and ultimately triumph over chaos. Other implications are political and historical. Since \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" uses the myth involving Horus and Seth, it brings up the problem of succession that drives the main conflict in that myth (Strudwick 118). At this time in Egypt, Ramesses II was on the throne of Egypt and a new dynasty was in control of the country (Lesko 99). Ramesses would have commissioned this in order to legitimize his own reign and succession as well as the new dynasty through this story (Lesko 100). Author Leonard Lesko even goes as far as to say that this is deliberate political propaganda (Lesko 100). Its audience would have to be a large one. Propaganda (legitimizing succession in this case) is meant to be seen by lots of people, not be kept hidden, and the popular myths it contains would help it reach a wide audience as well. This means that the source is also biased because it would be on the side of Ramesses II in order to secure his status in Egypt. This myth also demonstrates the importance of ma'at in political terms. The pharaoh was the one who essentially keeps it by defeating Egypt's enemies, pleasing the gods as their high priest, restoring what was broken, and more (Strudwick 366). Ma'at's role is also seen in the important role the judicial system plays (Campagno 25). The main conflict between Truth and Falsehood is settled essentially in court with the Ennead acting as judge and jury (Campagno 26). The law and the order, truth, and justice that goes with it is personified by ma'at (Strudwick 366). The final implications of this story are social. It reveals the social aspect of ma'at: harmony \\"between and amongst gods and human beings\\" (Vinson 47-48). \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" also illuminates the role of women at this point in Egyptian history. There seemed to be negativity towards the influential roles women played in the previous dynasty, and it manifests itself in this piece (Lesko 102). Ma'at, a female concept, is made male (Baines 374). The woman in the tale only exists to desire Truth and conceive his son; she does not play a major part (Vinson 47). This is in stark contrast to the major role the goddess Isis plays in the original Osiris myth (Griffiths 90).  Secondary analysis and further reading  There have been many scholars who have commented on \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood.\\" The following selections used to research this entry give great discussions on this source and provide opportunities to further knowledge on the subject. The first analysis comes from the following two books: Miriam Lichtheim's Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume II: The New Kingdom and William Simpson's The Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, Stelae, Autobiographies, and Poetry. Both of these books have translations of \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" and provide some insight into this primary source with their introductions to the selection and in the footnotes (Lichtheim 211; Simpson 104-107). John Baines's chapter called \\"Myth and Literature\\" in Ancient Egyptian Literature: History and Forms gives great analysis. In this selection, Baines explores the relationship between myth and literature in Ancient Egypt. He concludes that myths are generally integrated into literature in order to transmit morality as well as cultural values and concerns. Baines also provides plenty of analysis as it relates to the best example of integrating myth and literature--\\"The Tale of Truth and Falsehood\\". He points out how changing the villain to a woman transforms the role of Seth, and the story's role as an allegory diminishes its wide-ranging significance to highlight morality. Naming the father ma'at could mean that the narrative should be understood as the full realization of the ma'at concept (Baines 361-377). \\"Two Observations on the Tales of 'The Contendings of Horus and Seth' and 'Truth and Falsehood'\\" by Marcelo Campagno in the journal Trabajos de Egiptolog√≠a - Papers on Ancient Egypt is another good analysis. His comparison of \\"The Contendings of Horus and Seth\\" and \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" reveals two major similarities between the famous stories. One of the parallels the author discusses is how both stories make use of myths involving Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Horus. However, there are differences between the many versions of the myths. The second parallel between the two stories is that both stories seek judicial solutions to the main conflict. It seems like the judicial systems in each one are different, and it relates to how important kinship and \\"state 'logics'\\" are in the stories and in Egypt. This article is important in understanding the primary source for these reasons, and because the truth and justice involved in a judicial solution is another example of the triumph of ma'at over isfet (Campagno 19-30). J. Gwynn Griffith's journal article \\"Allegory in Greece and Egypt\\" found in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology researching allegory in the eastern Mediterranean region provides good information on \\"The Tale of Truth and Falsehood.\\" First of all, it provides many of the ways that this story relates to both the Osiris and the Horus and Seth myths. Griffiths is also clear to point out that \\"The Tale of Truth and Falsehood\\" is a partial allegory that illustrates the influence of two popular myths in society at the time. The article also establishes the theme‚Äî \\"truth must be vindicated against the wiles of falsehood\\" (Griffiths 79-102). \\"Three Late Egyptian Stories Reconsidered\\" by Leonard Lesko analyzes major literary works such as \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" in order to determine \\"political realities.\\" The author discovers several themes throughout these works including succession, negativity towards influential women, and \\"irreligiosity toward the gods.\\" Lesko claims that the transition from the 18th to the 19th Dynasties is the reason for these themes in the works mentioned in his study. A new family needed to stabilize succession, there was negative sentiment towards the powerful 18th Dynasty females, and Ramses the Great deified himself. The new family could use these popular stories as propaganda and legitimize their new dynasty. This research is important to the study of the primary source because many of these political themes are evident in \\"The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood\\" (Lesko 98-103). Steve Vinson's journal article \\"The Accent's on Evil: Ancient Egyptian 'Melodrama' and the Problem of Genre\\" from the Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt tries to discover what \\"genre\\" means as it relates to Egyptian literature and how to distinguish between them. The author tries to do this through analyzing many important Egyptian narratives such as \\"The Tale of Truth and Falsehood\\" in terms of \\"plot and characterization.\\" There is a lot of information in this article about \\"The Tale of Truth and Falsehood.\\" Vinson categorizes the primary source as a \\"melodrama\\" where evil momentarily gains the upper hand and as an allegory. Vinson also provides the story's theme‚Äîma'at will triumph over isfet (Vinson 33-54).

She grew a wide variety of plants and incorporated locally quarried stone to create walls, steps and terraces. Ferrell gardens, or The Terraces as they were called, became nationally noted for their beauty and were open to the public.Catherine M. Howett, A Southern Lady's Legacy: The Italian Terraces of LaGrange, Georgia, Journal of Garden History, 1982 vol. 2, no.4, p. 343-360. One such visit was written up in the local newspaper of the time, The LaGrange Reporter, who wrote of the majestic grove of oaks, the scented breeze and how they were speechless with astonishment at the bewildering paradise opening out before us.Troup County Archives, The LaGrange Reporter, May 28, 1888. Italian Villa Built In Georgia's Most Famous Garden proclaimed The Atlanta Journal on April 30, 1916 when Fuller and Ida Callaway opened their new home to visitors for their 25th wedding anniversary. The article goes on to quote Mr. Callaway talking about the garden: > Forestry and botanical experts, amazed at the wonderful growth of flowers, > shrubs and trees, some rare specimens of which from Japan, Australia, China > and the Holy Land thrive better than in their native lands, have tried to > explain this phenomenon by stating that there is some peculiar property of > the soil, but they are wrong. That's not the explanation. It's just > ordinary, LaGrange, Georgia soil. The real cause of the wonders which exist > in this garden is the seventy years of love and devoted care which Mrs. > Ferrell gave to the garden.The Atlanta Journal, Sunday, April 16, 1916. Architect Neel Reid added fountains and other statuary to the gardens when the Callaway home was built to further integrate the home with the gardens. Callaway Family Fuller Earle Callaway (1870-1928) was born in Troup County, Georgia and was an entrepreneur from an early age, selling sundries to rural housewives and farming. At age eighteen he opened a five-and-ten-cent store and soon owned several other stores and a wholesale business. He later invested in the textile business and eventually had several businesses employing thousands of people. He married Ida Jane Cason (1872-1936) of Jewell in 1891, and they had two sons, Cason Jewell Callaway (1894-1961) and Fuller Earle Callaway Jr. (1907-1992) Both sons grew up working in and managing their father's textile mills which were sold to Deering-Milliken in 1968. Cason married Virginia Hollis Hand (1900-1995) of Pelham in 1920 and Fuller Jr. married Virginia's younger sister, Alice Hinman Hand (1912-1998) ten years later. After retiring from the mills, Cason worked on developing better farm practices at his Blue Springs Farms near Hamilton, Georgia. He and Virginia opened Ida Cason Callaway Gardens in 1952.Kaye Lanning Minchew, Family, The New Georgia Encyclopedia, 2009 Following Ida's death in 1936, her two sons, Cason and Fuller Jr. submitted sealed bids for Hills & Dales to see which one would get the family home. Fuller, Jr. worried half the night that he wouldn't get the place and the other half of the night that he would. The bids were very close, but in the end Fuller, Jr. and Alice moved into the family home.Alice H. Callaway and Forrest Clark Johnson III, \\"Family Gleanings\\", Sutherland-St. Dunston Press, p.3. Following Alice's death in 1998, the estate was bequeathed to Fuller E. Callaway Foundation. As the Callaways instructed, the estate became a museum for the enjoyment of the visiting public. After renovations and the addition of a visitor center, the estate opened to the public in October 2004. Extensive renovations on the second and third floor of the home were completed in April 2010 and now visitors tour all three floors of the home. , \\"Fuller E Callaway Foundation\\" See also  References   External links  * http://www.hillsanddales.org Category:Historic house museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses completed in 1916 Category:Historic district contributing properties in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses in Troup County, Georgia Category:Museums in Troup County, Georgia Category:Italianate architecture in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Villas in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Troup County, Georgia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Hills and Dales Estate"},{"id":"33253815","text":"Darren Collins (born 1969) is a Paralympic athletics competitor from Australia.

He played with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs in their band the Foggy Mountain Boys from 1949 to 1962, among other major bluegrass acts during his lengthy career in music. Early years Born to Carrie and Calvin Sechler in China Grove, North Carolina, on December 25, 1919, \\"Curly\\" was destined to have a huge contribution on Bluegrass music.Parsons, Penny. 2016. Foggy Mountain Troubadour: The Life and Music of Curly Seckler. Champaign: University of Illinois Press. In his youth and formative years, Seckler learned to play music from his parents. His father, Calvin, played old time fiddle, harmonica, and autoharp, while his mother taught him how to play the organ. Seckler like most of his local contemporaries, was forced into a life of labor, tirelessly working in a local cotton mill for sustenance with his brothers. However, this laborious sentencing did not hamper his musical development, Seckler found time to keep up his love for music, expanding his musical knowledge by picking up the five string banjo. Seckler began learning the instrument from local musician, Happy Trexler. Career In the early years of his professional career, Seckler accompanied his brothers George and Duard, playing the tenor banjo and providing vocal harmonies. The group was called the Yodeling Rangers and were propelled to local stardom in 1935, when they were invited to perform daily on the radio in Salisbury, North Carolina. With a fresh new name, the Trail Riders, soon began playing steadily throughout the south-eastern US. Soon the word got around, the Trail Riders had some of the finest musicians around and this notoriety caught the eye of Charlie Monroe, brother of Bill Monroe, and former guitarist of the acclaimed Monroe Brothers. After their breakup, Charlie was looking for new musicians to play with on the emerging Bluegrass circuit. He proposed that Seckler join him on tour. The nineteen-year-old agreed and received twenty dollars a week. Seckler continued to enjoy success on the Bluegrass touring circuit and in 1949 joined Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and the rest of the Foggy Mountain Boys band. In this new ensemble, Seckler continued to sing tenor harmonies, but switched to the mandolin. During this time, he developed the \\"Chop\\" rhythm technique which helped to propel the rhythm section of The Foggy Mountain Boys sound. Seckler stayed with the Foggy Mountain Boys until 1962. Upon Lester Flatt's death in 1979, Seckler returned to Bluegrass as leader of the Nashville Grass band. Seckler held this position until his retirement in 1994 ( Seckler AP).associatedpress Later years and death The International Bluegrass Music Association honored Seckler in 2004 by inducting him into its International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame; Seckler was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010. His release of \\"Sixty Years of Bluegrass with My Friends\\" in 2005 on the Copper Creek label solidified Seckler's place as one of the pioneers of the genre and steward of customs and traditions. Throughout his career, Seckler played with Jim and Jesse McReynolds, Mac Wiseman, the Stanley Brothers, the Nashville Grass, Doyle Lawson, and many others. Seckler died in his sleep on December 27, 2017, just two days after his 98th birthday.

From 1867 to 1869 Vincke was a deputy in the parliament of the North German Confederation. He is regarded as one of the greatest Prussian orators of his time. In 1852 he dueled with Otto von Bismarck; the duel ended without injury to either man. He was known for his anti-Polish stance, and his unusually direct and candid statement in the German parliament - \\"The existence of the Prussian state depends on the Polish state never existing again\\" - was widely quoted by, among others, The Times in March 1863 (at the time of the Polish January Uprising) and by Karl Marx in his work on German‚ÄìPolish relations.

Orozco, \\"ORDER OF SONS OF AMERICA,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/veotu), accessed September 29, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The OSA expanded to chapters in various cities throughout Texas including Somerset, Pearsall and Corpus Christi. As one of the three largest organizations of its type in the 1920s, its goal was to protect and advance the interests of Mexican-American citizens and their community, seeking to counter discrimination against them. Limiting their members to native-born US or naturalized citizens, the group was led by Spanish-speaking Mexicans of the upper class, including attorneys, teachers, and entrepreneurs.Gutierrez, David G. Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants, and the Politics of Ethnicity. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California press, 1995. 74-7, 81-2. Historical context During the first quarter of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants were recruited to work in the United States. Mexican-American citizens, some of whom had families whose roots in the Southwest preceded its annexation by the United States, began to realize they were being lumped together with the immigrants because of physical, language and other ethnic similarities although they were United States citizens and had a long history of settlement. Mexican-American citizens who were native-born and veterans of World War I particularly resented being subject to the same discrimination as new Mexican immigrants. Mexican Americans believed they were being associated with immigrants who were typically poor and took the lowest-paying jobs. Because of the harsh anti- Mexican feelings in parts of the US, Mexican-American citizens resisted being associated with immigrants from Mexico. As the Mexican immigrant population in the American Southwest continued to grow, Mexican Americans began to lobby for immigration restrictions. Ideology The Order of the Sons of America believed that assimilation to majority American culture would enable them to become equal members of American society in all respects. The OSA only allowed membership to native born and naturalized citizens of the United States, believing that their interests were different from those of Mexican immigrants. Excluding Mexican immigrants from membership and taking a stance against large scale immigration were bold and controversial political strategies. The OSA wanted to persuade Anglo Americans that Mexican Americans were as loyal and admirable as other Americans. OSA members concluded that having maintained Mexican culture and ethnicity had hindered their ability to be accepted as equal American citizens. As such, they held their meetings in English and used the American flag liberally in their iconography. They also adopted ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù as an official hymn of the organization, and the saying ‚ÄúFor Our Country‚Äù as the motto.Julie Leininger Pycior, La Raza Organizes: Mexican American Life in San Antonio, 1915‚Äì1930, as Reflected in Mutualista Activities (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Notre Dame, 1979). By living American lifestyles, members of the OSA sought to achieve social justice. The organization's purpose was to use its \\"influence in all fields of social, economic, and political action in order to realize the greatest enjoyment possible of all the rights and privileges and prerogatives extended by the American Constitution.\\" Founding and organization The Order of the Sons of America was organized under a constitution. Among the creators were John C. Solis, a twenty-year-old wholesaler; Francisco (Frank) Leyton, a thirty-year- old saddle maker; his brother Melchor Leyton, a baker; and Santiago G. Tafolla Sr., a district criminal court clerk.Orozco, Cynthia. No Mexicans, Women, Or Dogs Allowed, The Rise Of The Mexican American Civil Rights Movement. Univ of Texas Pr, 2009. . On November 4, 1921 over 150 people came together at Fest Hall for the first OSA meeting. They elected Santiago G. Tafolla as president of the OSA and Feliciano G. Flores, a deputy sheriff, as vice president. They chose The Order of the Sons of America as their official name. The OSA received a state charter on January 4, 1922; in 1925 it opened the OSA headquarters in downtown San Antonio. By 1923 the original San Antonio chapter had around 250 members, including Manuel C. Gonzales. By 1928 the Corpus Christi Chapter had around 175 members who included Louis Wilmot, Bernardo F. Garza, and Andr√©s de Luna. Constitution In 1922 members drafted a 45-page, English-language constitution for the organization. Clemente Idar, James Tafolla Sr., and Ramon Carvajal Jr. worked on this, which they translated into Spanish in 1927. It included a preamble, order of business, declaration of principles, officers‚Äô stations, obligations, bylaws, rules of order, and a committee report. The constitution said that members were ‚Äúto use their influence in all fields of social, economic, and political action in order to realize the greatest enjoyment possible of all the rights and privileges and prerogatives extended by the American constitution.‚Äù Members were required to be over the age of sixteen and United States citizens of Spanish or Mexican origin. While none was ever organized, the OSA constitution allowed for juvenile sub-organizations and ladies auxiliaries. Chapters Known chapters created by the original San Antonio Council were in Texas cities including: Somerset and Pearsall by the year 1923 and Corpus Christi by 1924. In 1927, the Corpus Christi chapter created a council in Kingsville. Other known councils existed in Alice and Beeville. Historical contributions The OSA fought to increase Mexican-American representation in the political sphere and decrease social and economic ethnic segregation.

David W. Close is the Artistic Director and Conductor. Established in 1927 by Flushing residents, the Oratorio Society of Flushing competed with the prestigious Oratorio Society of New York, founded 54 years earlier. In 1985 the Society incorporated as the Oratorio Society of Queens (OSQ), covering members throughout the borough. Today the membership is borough-wide and even includes several Bronx and Nassau County residents. OSQ is a charter member of both the Queens Council on the Arts and the Flushing Council on Culture & the Arts. Throughout its history, OSQ has been non-sectarian, and membership is open to anyone.  History  OSQ in concert The Oratorio Society of Queens, originally known as the Oratorio Society of Flushing, was founded in 1927. The idea of a community-based mixed voice chorus, dedicated to sharing the aesthetic values oratorio music expresses, was conceived by Mrs. Edward Keefe. She was initially assisted by John W. Norton, organist and choirmaster of St. George's Episcopal Church; and Edward M. Franklin, a leading layman of the church. The charter members were drawn from Flushing's several old, prominent families, but in keeping with the democratic spirit historically associated with Flushing, membership was open to all. Among other members was Bertha Parsons, the last owner-resident of John Bowne House before it was opened as a museum of early Flushing. On May 12, 1927 a chorus of 100 voices directed by John Norton performed Felix Mendelssohn's \\"Hymn of Praise\\" to critical acclaim before an audience of 900 at Flushing High School. There would be carol singing at Flushing Hospital, after which the singers would sing at a founder's home and partake of a lovely party in the festively decorated house. Local merchants provided financial support and articles for door prizes at fundraising events. The Society was supported by member dues, subscribers, bake sales and fundraising dinners. Mrs. Maude Wilson was made an honorary member in the early 1930s because she contributed the entire proceeds of her Annual Party and Dahlia Flower Show to the Society. Fundraising was always a necessity even though concert accompaniment was originally by organ or piano. The chorus, subsequently conducted by Herbert Stavely Sammond, and later by Lawrence Rasmussen, performed two major concerts a year until 1943, when Mr. Rasmussen was called to service in World War II. Rehearsals were suspended until 1946 when Mr. Rasmussen returned. David Katz, founder of the Queens Symphony, succeeded Mr. Rasmussen in ensuing years, dispelling the notion that the works of the great masters are too deep and profound for the average person to understand and appreciate. By its seventy-fifth anniversary in 2003, Maestro David Close had, for thirty-five years, successfully continued the traditions established by the founding members. The expansion to full orchestra accompaniment with professional vocal soloists created the need for increased funding. Although it hosts its annual Fundraising Benefit Event each April, the society depends upon grants from corporate and public funds in addition to traditional ticket sales and subscriptions. In 1985, the Society changed its name to the Oratorio Society of Queens in recognition of membership deriving from all parts of Queens. The entire Borough was learning that one need not travel to Manhattan for classical music, one could go to The Performing Arts Center at Queensborough Community College, St. Andrew Avellino Church, the Reformed Temple of Forest Hills, Trinity Lutheran Church, Christ the King High School, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park under the Unisphere, Seuffert Bandshell in Forest Park, Bayside High School, Colden Center, or various venues in Brooklyn and Long Island. The Society appeared at the 1939 New York World‚Äôs Fair and in later years at Lincoln Center. = Notable members = * Margaret Harshaw, contralto, became a Metropolitan Opera singer. * John Easterlin, tenor, has become a world-renown singer recently singing at The Lyric Opera in Chicago. * Cornelius L.

The town is located west of Crawford Bay on the east side of Kootenay Lake, opposite the entrance to West Arm Provincial Park. In the early 1890s, the Hendryx interests built a smelter on the east side of Kootenay Lake to treat the ores from their Blue Bell lead-silver mine at Riondel. By 1895 the Pilot Bay Smelter was in operation with 200 men employed. A town emerged around the smelter called Pilot Bay. Pilot Bay had a population of 1,000 and had 4 hotels, 3 stores and some other businesses. Mines which shipped their ore to the smelter include the Blue Bell, Ainsworth Mines, and Slocan Mines. In 1896 the Hall Mines Smelter in Nelson had started and become too much competition for Pilot Bay. This resulted in the closure of Pilot Bay Smelter in 1896. The Pilot Bay Smelter reopened in 1905 but was eventually closed permanently. Today all that is left is the ruins of the smelter and remnants of the town.

Ruddock was located on an isthmus between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain, north-northeast of LaPlace. Although the town was destroyed by a hurricane in 1915, it is still signed as an exit on Interstate 55 and marked on Louisiana state highway maps, as of 2011. History In 1892, William Burton and C. H. Ruddock founded the Ruddock Cypress Company. They constructed a sawmill and a town to serve their business; the town became Ruddock. In 1902, the sawmill burned down and was later rebuilt. By 1910, the town had a population of 700. At the height of its prosperity, Ruddock was a progressive, booming community built on stilts above the black waters of the swamp. Stilt- supported wooden sidewalks ran the length of the village with walkways branching out to two-story houses on each side. The vibrant village also boasted a community center, a blacksmith shop, a locomotive repair shop, an office and commissary for the Ruddock Cypress Lumber Company, a one-room schoolhouse, the Holy Cross Catholic Church, and a railroad depot with a two- story rooming house attached. The Owl Saloon, specializing in men's entertainment, was discretely located about a half-mile south and down the line from the town. There were no grocery stores in the isolated village, with housewives taking the daily train to New Orleans to do their shopping. Destruction In September 1915, the 1915 New Orleans Hurricane hit Ruddock, destroying the town and killing 58 residents of Ruddock and the nearby town of Frenier. Ruddock has since become overgrown by vegetation, and all that remains of the settlement is decayed wood from the buildings.

Design and development The SunFun started as a foot-launched glider design, the VJ-24, and was developed into a wheeled undercarriage motor glider, the VJ-24W. The VJ-24 was derived from the earlier Volmer VJ-23 Swingwing and differed from that design by replacing the wooden structure with metal and employing a constant chord, strut-braced wing in place of the VJ-23's cantilever, tapered wing. The aircraft is built from aluminium tubing covered with aircraft fabric. The span wing is braced by V-struts, supported by triangular jury struts. The fuselage is built around a keel tube that mounts the cruciform tail at the aft end, the wing and cockpit in the center and the engine at the front. The specified engines are the Yamaha KT100 go-kart powerplant and the McCulloch MAC-101, mounted in tractor configuration on the front of the keel tube, above the aircraft's nose. The landing gear is of conventional configuration, using spoked bicycle wheels for the main gear. Pilot weight is limited to . The take-off and landing distances with the engine are both .

The idea has garnered currency as a means of compelling institutions to pay, rather than avoid, taxes; it has also aroused the ire of nationalists as an infringement upon national sovereignty. Proposed worldwide taxes = Financial transaction tax= The financial transaction tax has been supported by a number of economists as both a rectification of jurisdictional discrepancies in taxation. Discussion of a global FTT has increased in the 2000s, especially after the Late-2000s recession.  UN Global Transaction Tax In 2009, the UN Millennium Development Goals programme was a proposed beneficiary of the Tobin Tax. According to Dr. Stephen Spratt, \\"the revenues raised could be used for....international development objectives...such as meeting the [ Millennium Development Goals ].\\" These are eight international development goals that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed (in 2000) to achieve by the year 2015. They include reducing extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.Background page, United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 16 June 2009. In 2000, a representative of a ‚Äúpro Tobin tax‚Äù NGO proposed the following: \\"In the face of increasing income disparity and social inequity, the Tobin Tax represents a rare opportunity to capture the enormous wealth of an untaxed sector and redirect it towards the public good. Conservative estimates show the tax could yield from $150-300 billion annually. The UN estimates that the cost of wiping out the worst forms of poverty and environmental destruction globally would be around $225 billion per year.\\" At the UN September 2001 World Conference against Racism, when the issue of compensation for colonialism and slavery arose in the agenda, Fidel Castro, the President of Cuba, advocated the Tobin Tax to address that issue. (According to Cliff Kincaid, Castro advocated it \\"specifically in order to generate U.S. financial reparations to the rest of the world,\\" however a closer reading of Castro's speech shows that he never did mention \\"the rest of the world\\" as being recipients of revenue.) Castro cited holocaust reparations as a previously established precedent for the concept of reparations. Castro also suggested that the United Nations be the administrator of this tax, stating the following: > \\"May the tax suggested by Nobel Prize Laureate James Tobin be imposed in a > reasonable and effective way on the current speculative operations > accounting for trillions of US dollars every 24 hours, then the United > Nations, which cannot go on depending on meager, inadequate, and belated > donations and charities, will have one trillion US dollars annually to save > and develop the world. Given the seriousness and urgency of the existing > problems, which have become a real hazard for the very survival of our > species on the planet, that is what would actually be needed before it is > too late.\\" On March 6, 2006, US Congressman Dr Ron Paul stated the following: \\"The United Nations remains determined to rob from wealthy countries and, after taking a big cut for itself, send what‚Äôs left to the poor countries. Of course, most of this money will go to the very dictators whose reckless policies have impoverished their citizens. The UN global tax plan...resurrects the long-held dream of the 'Tobin Tax'. A dangerous precedent would be set, however: the idea that the UN possesses legitimate taxing authority to fund its operations.\\" =Bank tax= Bank taxes have also been proposed as another means of worldwide taxation, as have been sales taxes. Proposals include the Financial stability contribution (FSC) and Financial Activities Tax (FAT). =Wealth tax= A global wealth tax of about 1% on all wealth, including individual assets exceeding about US$ 1 million (including stocks and bonds) and all publicly listed companies and all trusts would raise at least US$ 600 billion per year (that's 1% of total world market capitalization, which in 2012 is about US$ 60 trillion). About half of that amount, about 300 billion per year, corresponds to the total developmental budget goal of 0.7% GNP of industrialised countries (see Millennium Development Goals), which would enable poorer countries cross the threshold of economic competitivity in 15‚Äì20 years (cf. Jeffrey Sachs: The End of Poverty). Some 300 billion per year would also be necessary to limit global warming to +2 degrees Celsius and finance recovery from more frequent climate disasters. Expensive but probably inevitable strategies to slow global warming include renewable energy research, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reforestation (or preventing deforestation). On December 7, 2009 Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives stated her support for a \\"G20 global tax\\" that combined selected wealth and transaction taxes. Controversies =Sovereignty= In US and other countries' nationalist movements, the idea of global taxation arouses ire in its perception by such circles as a potential infringement upon national sovereignty. =Should the bank tax be global?= On August 30, 2009, British Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Adair Turner had said it was \\"ridiculous\\" to think he would propose a new tax on London and not the rest of the world. However, in May, and June 2010, the government of Canada expressed opposition to the bank tax becoming \\"global\\" in nature.

The character is voiced by American actor Zachary Levi, who decided to audition for the role upon learning that he would also be providing the character's singing voice. Levi's duet with singer and co-star Mandy Moore, \\"I See the Light\\", would go on to become the actor's first professionally recorded song and musical debut. Loosely based on the prince in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \\"Rapunzel\\", Flynn is a wanted thief who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower after stealing a crown. Blackmailed by Rapunzel into taking her to see the kingdom's floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday, Flynn undergoes a change of heart as he gradually begins to fall in love with Rapunzel. Flynn was created by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard because they felt that the incarcerated Rapunzel needed someone to escort her out of the tower. He was conceived as a thief as opposed to a traditional prince in favor of making him a funnier and edgier character. Originally written as a British farmer, Flynn was ultimately developed into a swashbuckling thief inspired by fictional characters Han Solo and Indiana Jones, and actors Gene Kelly and Errol Flynn; Flynn Rider was named after the latter. Flynn has divided film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's refreshing humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm in comparison to traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly accused of being a marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim.  Development  = Conception = Filmmaker Walt Disney himself had first attempted to adapt the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \\"Rapunzel\\" into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too \\"small\\". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided that it would be best \\"to blow up the scale of the film\\" and transform it into a \\"big event\\", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that \\"Rapunzel needed to get out [of the tower] ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going.\\" In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief ‚Äì dubbed \\"a subtle yet startling twist for Disney\\" by The New York Times ‚Äì to avoid creating a character who is too \\"safe\\", opting for a funnier and \\"edgier\\" antihero instead. Greno elaborated, \\"When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... a lot of them are kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool,\\" continuing, \\"They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme.\\" However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that \\"There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'\\" Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: Originally, Flynn was conceived as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that \\"Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. So she has a very limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy.\\" The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender- neutral Tangled is due in part to Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is \\"to name the movie after the Princess\\", the directors had initially thought that the film \\"would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while\\". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that \\"When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea.\\" Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with \\"an ironic counterpoint\\", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As \\"an example of first-person voice-over narration\\", Flynn's narration \\"compels the viewer to identify empathetically with\\" Flynn and Rapunzel. = Voice = Greno and Howard were not particularly interested in casting solely A-list actors as the voices of main characters Flynn and Rapunzel. Instead, the directors simply searched for actors who had \\"the right voice\\" for these characters. Writing for ReelViews, film critic James Berardinelli felt that the directors' decision mirrored \\"Disney's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big name stars were often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents\\". Hundreds of actors and singers auditioned and were considered for the role of Rapunzel's love interest, among them comedian Dan Fogler and American Idol alum Clay Aiken. However, the role of Flynn Rider was ultimately won by American actor Zachary Levi because he, according to Greno, \\"nailed\\" his audition. Levi auditioned for the role after he first received a telephone call from his agent informing him about the film. Identifying himself as \\"a huge Disney nut\\", Levi was immediately \\"sold\\" on the project. His interest was further cemented by the fact that he would also be providing the character's singing voice. Additionally, Levi appears to have a history playing male \\"characters who are surrounded by tough, strong women\\". Required to audition a song in the style of a singer-songwriter, Levi decided to perform James Taylor's \\"Sweet Baby James\\" for the directors. Flynn is voiced by American actor Zachary Levi, whose Academy Award-nominated duet with pop singer Mandy Moore, \\"I See the Light\\", marked his musical debut. When Levi was first cast as the voice of Flynn, the character had been scripted as a British farmer at the time, requiring Levi to voice him with a British accent until Flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an American accent. Although Flynn and Rapunzel share several scenes together during the film, Levi and singer Mandy Moore, his co-star who provides the voice of Rapunzel, recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts, which Levi cited as one of the challenges he endured while working on the film, in addition to having to star in the television series Chuck simultaneously. Levi's starring role on Chuck required the actor to constantly \\"shed a character and take on another character and shed that character and then go back to something else\\". However, Levi and Moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet \\"I See the Light\\", Levi was not intimidated by the thought of recording the song, describing the experience as \\"an added bonus\\". However, he admitted to having been nervous to sing with Moore, a professional singer, and working with composer Alan Menken. Although the actor identifies himself as \\"no stranger to singing\\" due to his background in musical theatre, Levi's performance of \\"I See the Light\\" is considered to be his \\"big singing debut\\" because it was his first time recording a song professionally. It took Levi approximately one year to record all of his dialogue due in part to his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, \\"He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn.\\" On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's \\"voice was really just a slight variation of [his] own\\". Wanting to sound \\"more appropriate\\" for the film's medieval setting, Levi \\"cleaned up [his] own diction and made things a little bit more polished\\", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a \\"very family friendly\\" version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, \\"I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up,\\" likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine. = Characterization, design and analysis = Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to be funny and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One occasion in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did not like this because, according to Greno, Flynn \\"did this reaction where [he] treated her like she's nuts\\". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to \\"connect\\" emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is \\"at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them\\", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, \\"At his heart, he's really kind of a lost soul who doesn't quite know what he wants and who he is.\\" Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, \\"are skilled but have a human side to them\\". Flynn is considered an antihero because \\"He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive\\" and \\"he is also extremely narcissistic\\". Originally, the character resembled a \\"burlier leading man\\", described by Greno as \\"a muscular commoner/farm boy\\". However, the directors had always envisioned Flynn as \\"a dashing thief\\". To assist with the development of Flynn's design, Howard and Greno held a large meeting with thirty of Tangleds female employees. Calling it the \\"Hot Man Meeting\\", the employees were encouraged to \\"bring in pictures of their favorite hunky men\\". The Hot Man Meeting was created because the directors, who found that they were very much impressed with Rapunzel's design, felt that \\"Flynn [needed] to be up to [Rapunzel's] level\\". Greno described the Hot Man Meeting as \\"crazy\\", elaborating, \\"Photos of all the hottest men in Hollywood [were] being thrown around a room. Photos being torn in half and pasted back together. Eyes were ripped from one picture and put on another. Heads were torn from photos,\\" concluding, \\"I've never seen anything like it.\\" Howard cited American actor Clark Gable and English footballer David Beckham among several celebrities by whom Flynn was influenced during the meeting, joking that the employees eventually \\"started using Nathan and me as examples of what not to do\\". Defending Flynn's personality, Levi explained that \\"Deep down, Flynn has a good core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naivet√© of Rapunzel.\\" The actor concluded that \\"These are two very different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure.\\" According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn \\"teaches [Rapunzel] about courage\\". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a \\"partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own.\\" Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as \\"more humane\\". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn \\"a charismatic bad boy\\", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that \\"Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib in a way that many people now associate with DreamWorks.\\" On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character \\"only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities\\". According to Tison Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn \\"amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting\\", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries \\"most of the [film's] modern humor\\". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's \\"main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance\\".  Appearances  Flynn debuted in Tangled (2010) as a sought-after bandit who discovers refuge in Rapunzel's secluded tower after stealing a crown. There the character is blackmailed by Rapunzel, who seizes the crown to convince Flynn to guide her to the floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday, while Mother Gothel, her vain, controlling guardian, is absent. Flynn is pursued by a police horse named Maximus; the vengeful Stabbington brothers, two former accomplices of his; and Gothel, who grows increasingly obsessed with retrieving Rapunzel to continue using her hair to grant her eternal life. Meanwhile, Flynn falls in love with Rapunzel and undergoes a change of heart, only to be apprehended by the Stabbington Brothers, who hand him over to the officials, who sentence him to death. Maximus helps him escape and return to Rapunzel's tower to rescue her. However, upon seeing Rapunzel tied up and gagged, Gothel fatally stabs him. Rapunzel convinces Gothel to let her use her hair to heal him, promising to submit to her if she is allowed to heal him with her hair. A dying Flynn protests , preferring to die than let Rapunzel become a prisoner to Gothel so he uses a shard of a shattered mirror to cut her hair, which causes it to lose its power and turn brown, causing Gothel to age into dust. Flynn succumbs to his blood loss, but is saved by the leftover magic in one of Rapunzel's tears. By falling in love with Rapunzel, Flynn undergoes a dramatic change of heart; he stops thieving and returns to using his birth name, Eugene. Eugene later appears in the 5-minute short film Tangled Ever After, that features his marriage with Rapunzel. Eugene/Flynn also appears in the 2017 television series Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. It takes place between the feature film and the short Tangled Ever After. Over the course of the series, Eugene struggles with trying to find the perfect moment to propose to Rapunzel with him deciding to wait until she is ready. Due to circumstances the Captain of the Guards, who initially disliked Eugene, steps down from his position and promotes Eugene to the spot, much to his surprise. He considers the position before finally accepting the title; forever leaving his criminal past behind him. In the series finale, Eugene finally proposes to Rapunzel in the same spot he fell in love with her; out in the Corona lake on a boat.  Reception  = Critical response = Kirk Baird of The Blade described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him \\"loveable\\". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as \\"a hero invested with enough colour to liven up what could have been a monochromatic role\\". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is \\"better than a prince\\". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, \\"If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment‚Äîone more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time.\\" Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that \\"Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable\\". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although \\"Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast.\\" Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a \\"fop\\", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him \\"bland\\". The Scotsman wrote, \\"it's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from\\" the film. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn \\"a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk\\". Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not \\"all that heroic\\". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's \\"sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth ‚Äì makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam\\". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's \\"initial shakiness\\" is \\"amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of\\" Flynn. Accusing the character of \\"lacking both superficial and emotional individuality\\", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as \\"rather obnoxious\\", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as \\"vanilla\\". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post- Dispatch referred to it as \\"flippant\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as \\"annoyingly smart-alecky\\". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as \\"clunky\\". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to \\"a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration ‚Äì combined with a hasty prologue ‚Äì almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club\\". However, Goss relented, \\"The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest.\\" Meanwhile, critics lauded the character's relationship and chemistry with Rapunzel enthusiastically, likening it to that of a romantic comedy. Writing for the Mountain Xpress, Ken Hanke felt that \\"what works best is the interplay between the two leads\\", concluding, \\"these animated characters are frankly more believable and charismatic than the human ones in ... Love and Other Drugs.\\" Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the characters' \\"relationship is built on mutual respect and trust, something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies.\\" The Miami Heralds Rene Rodriquez opined, \\"Even though they may seem to be boilerplate fairy-tale heroes, you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together,\\" while Joe Neumaier of the Daily News simply called their relationship \\"cute\\". Ted Fry of The Seattle Times wrote, \\"The back-and-forth banter of what inevitably becomes a courtship is consistently witty and given extra sparkle from adroit characterizations by Moore and Levi.\\" Similarly, Cathy Jakicic, writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, opined, \\"Moore and Levi, meanwhile, breathe new life into the classic love-hate romance.\\" Colin Covert of the Star Tribune felt that both \\"characters are equally strong and funny\\". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the characters' relationship makes the film \\"engaging\\". BuzzFeed author Arielle Calderon compiled \\"19 Reasons Rapunzel And Flynn Rider Are The Best Disney Couple\\", citing their meeting and opposite personalities among them. Babble.com ranked Flynn and Rapunzel among the \\"Top 10 Cutest Disney Couples\\". Levi's performance has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice. Praising the directors' decision to \\"[bypass] big-name stars in favor of lesser-known talent\\", TV Guide described Levi's performance as \\"charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough\\". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi \\"comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters\\", complimenting the fact that \\"the cast's names are less than household stature\\". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as \\"terrific\\". ABC Online appreciated the fact that \\"the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable\\", concluding, \\"Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do a really good job on the voices\\". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi \\"creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen\\". Hucks went on to call Flynn \\"one the better [Disney heroes] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while\\". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's \\"quick-tongued delivery\\", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor \\"does a nice job\\" as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore \\"adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters\\", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as \\"excellent as the rogueish hero\\". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi \\"a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn\\". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that \\"Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest\\". Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as \\"impressive\\". Flynn is often regarded as one of Disney's most attractive heroes. In 2012, Vanity Fair conducted a poll for which readers were asked to vote for the sexiest Disney hero of all-time. Pairing Flynn against Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid, Flynn beat his competition by less than one percent, garnering 50.35 percent of the total votes. E! ranked the character third in its article \\"The Definitive Ranking of Disney Princes Based on Overall Dating Eligibility\\". Writing for Seventeen, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley ranked Flynn the sixth most \\"dateable\\" Disney prince. Oakley joked, \\"I like a man who is unaplogetically himself\\", continuing, \\"If you gotta go around with a fake name ... then you're simply not on my level.\\" BuzzFeed author Louis Peitzman ranked Flynn the fourth most attractive Disney prince, praising the character's hair and eyebrows in 2013. BuzzFeed also ranked Flynn second on the website's list of the \\"Top Ten Hottest Male Cartoon Characters\\", calling him a \\"bad boy with a heart of gold\\". = Marketing controversy and criticism = Critics harshly criticized the film's controversial change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled. Holding Flynn's role and characterization partially responsible for it, they accused the character of being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film's trailers. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dawn C. Chmielewski observed that Tangleds marketing campaign involved \\"amp[ing] up the role of the dashing Errol Flynn-styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden-haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story\\". Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as \\"an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater\\". One of the film's trailers features Flynn \\"trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her 'the smolder'\\" while \\"emphasiz[ing Flynn's] ... action components ... over the more girl-oriented fairy tale stuff\\", according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine. Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was \\"obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie\\". Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film's marketing and the idea that \\"The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy ... whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside.\\" Referring to the film's title as \\"idiotic\\", Matt Neal of the Standard-Examiner wrote, \\"Disney claims it changed the film's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider's role in the film ... but that title-change excuse doesn't fly.\\" Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a \\"hijacking of a princess's tale\\", panning the character as \\"a crude commercial calculation, a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren't going to be too girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude.\\" Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities, specifically to \\"take Ken's role as [Barbie's] male arm candy\\". Empires Helen O'Hara defended Disney's claim \\"that the new title reflects the fact that [Tangled] is very much a two-hander, with Mandy Moore's innocent but (inevitably) feisty Rapunzel and Zachary Levi's street-wise yet clueless Flynn sharing the lead\\". O'Hara went on to argue that both characters \\"get decent character development too, and base their growing love story on more than a single longing glance\\". Todd Hertz of Christianity Today observed that \\"Disney changed the film's title and showcased the swashbuckling Aladdin-meets-Robin- Hood character who replaces the original story's prince\\", but felt that \\"Luckily, these marketing moves don't compromise Tangleds phenomenal storytelling or considerable charm. Hertz concluded, \\"Still, the movie wisely takes a page from Pixar's playbook to fill the movie with so much well-done slapstick humor, action, goofy characters, and genuine fun that boys won't feel like the ads gave them the old bait-and-switch to trick them into a 'girl' movie.\\"  References  Category:Tangled characters Category:Film characters introduced in 2010 Category:Disney Prince characters Category:Fictional outlaws Category:Fictional German people Category:Fictional thieves Category:Kingdom Hearts characters ","title":"Flynn Rider"},{"id":"33254599","text":"Reading list may refer to: * Reading list, required books to be read, either as part of the syllabus on an academic course, or social gathering (e.g. Book discussion club, or similar). * Reading List (Apple), a Safari web browser bookmarking feature for saving links to webpages, with simple metadata for later reading, synchronized across devices.

Together they form three points of an unlikely triangle, living, laughing and larging it together. After a big birthday party for Alice, they end up having an unplanned threesome during which Alice becomes pregnant. After discovering that he is infertile, Mitch tells Richie that he is the baby's biological father. They then decide to ditch the party lifestyle, have the baby, and raise it together as a threesome. Characters and cast =Main characters= * Alice Heston (Amy Huberman) is the female lead. Alice's long-term friendship with Richie leads to her relationship with boyfriend Mitch. * Mitch Ennis (Stephen Wight) meets Richie at his brother's funeral, and the two become friends. A blind date leads to Mitch and Alice dating. * Richie Valentine (Emun Elliott): Best friends with Alice (since university) and Mitch, but unable to commit despite an active love life. * Lily Owen Valentine-Ennis: is the trio's baby whom Alice gives birth to in the last episode of the first series. She is to be one of the main cast in the second series. Her characteristics are currently unknown. =Supporting roles= * Lorraine Heston (Pauline McLynn): a self-created glamour-puss and a bit of a nightmare control freak. She loves her daughter Alice dearly, but that love more often than not expresses itself as a domineering cattiness. Lorraine is all about the tan and the chatter and loves a good party, but behind the champagne bubbles the claws are out. Lorraine is wealthy and lives in Tenerife most of the year, where she flirts with boys, tolerates Alice‚Äôs father Malcolm, and drinks way, way too much. * Sue Ennis (Paddy Navin): a woman who couldn‚Äôt be more like her son Mitch, or any closer to him; two peas in a pod who still love each other's company. Sue is down to earth, unpretentious and incredibly caring ‚Äì as well as charmingly sentimental and a bit of a motor-mouth. Of all the mums, she‚Äôs the least demanding, and will probably end up being far and away the best babysitter. * Jenny Rouse (Joanna Roth): Richie‚Äôs mum couldn‚Äôt be less like Sue to look at. Jenny models herself on Anna Wintour; immaculate fashions and flawless styling, and is a design icon in her own right. Well spoken and perfectly poised, Jenny is every inch a lady ‚Äì but she‚Äôs not above chatting up boys on Richie‚Äôs behalf. Jenny is desperate for Richie to find someone special and give her a gorgeous son-in- law to coo over. * Dave (Adam Garcia): Richie's boyfriend. Episodes =Series 1 (2011)= =Series 2 (2012)= Reception The series has received a mostly positive critical reaction. Actor Russell Tovey praised the series. Catriona Wightman, writing for Digital Spy, also praised the series, coming to the conclusion that \\"it's really rather good indeed.\\" The British Comedy Guide said \\"after the double-bill opener, Threesome has made a fantastic start. The potentially quite unlikeable situation and characters have proved to be anything but, and some great set-piece lines and scenes really made us laugh out loud. We found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, and can't wait for the rest of the series.\\" Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Catherine Gee said \\"Threesome throws up some funny moments and there's plenty of good chemistry between its stars.\\" In a slightly more negative-mixed-positive review, Lucy Mangan, writing for The Guardian, said \\"the jokes are weak but when it's not trying to be funny, Threesome is very funny.\\" Writing a negative review, again for The Guardian, Martin Skegg said \\"presumably it's meant to be funny, but you'll be searching high and low for the jokes.\\" David Crawford writing for the RadioTimes gave a highly positive review, saying \\"starting from a preposterous premise, this rambunctious comedy manages to get hearty, and frequently filthy, laughs from its unlikely situation. The humour is suitably broad for the subject matter, but there are neat gags, and wonderful physical comedy.\\" Liam Murphy, writing for On the Box, gave a mixed review, saying \\"this is a sitcom with potential and as long as it avoids the trappings of most comedy pregnancies (see season 8 of Friends) then I might just watch the rest of the series!\\" In January 2013, the British Comedy Guide gave the show the Comedy.co.uk Editors' Award saying: \\"We congratulate production company Big Talk and Comedy Central for giving this unique series the chance to grow. It seems to have boosted the channel's confidence in ordering more original comedy\\". DVD and Blu-ray release On 17 October 2011, BBC Worldwide, released the series to download on the iTunes Store.

The primary has a spheroidal shape. Its minor-planet moon measures approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 24 March 1996, by Australian astronomer Robert McNaught at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia. was also a target of a rejected mission-proposal for the Marco Polo spacecraft. In 2017, scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Purple Mountain Observatory revealed a plan to land a probe on this asteroid in 2029, as part of an asteroid exploration mission.  Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7‚Äì1.4 AU once every 1 years and 1 month (395 days; semi-major axis of 1.05 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.35 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which corresponds to 11.0 lunar distances. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, the body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Siding Spring.  Target of rejected Marco Polo mission  Due to its binary nature and its low delta-v heliocentric orbit (also see Hohmann transfer orbit), this asteroid was selected for MarcoPolo-R, which was the Marco Polo spacecraft first proposed mission. MarcoPolo-R was originally selected for the assessment study phase in the M3 slot of ESA's Cosmic Vision program, but rejected in favor of PLATO by the end of 2012.  Target of planned Chinese mission  China plans to land a probe on after 2020 as part of its asteroid exploration mission. The mission includes plans for fly-by of three asteroids (one of them is 99942 Apophis), and land on to conduct in situ sampling analysis on the surface, according to Ji Jianghui, a researcher at the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the expert committee for scientific goal argumentation of deep space exploration in China. The probe is also expected to conduct a fly-by of a third asteroid to be determined at a later time. The entire mission is expected to take about six years.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 21 February 2008. As of 2018, it has not been named.  Physical characteristics  The carbonaceous body is characterized as a rare B-type and hydrated C-type (Ch) asteroid, respectively. = Lightcurves = Several rotational lightcurves of this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations taken by astronomers Petr Pravec, Petr Scheirich and Stefano Mottola, as well as by the Very Large Telescope VISR instrument. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 3.594 to 3.595 hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 to 0.10 magnitude (). The asteroid is an oblate ellipsoid with a nearly spherical shape. = Diameter and albedo = According to numerous observations, including the EXPLORENEOs survey, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission and the Spitzer Space Telescope, the asteroid measures between 1.55 and 1.90 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of 0.03 to 0.05. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts an albedo of 0.04 and a diameter of 1.90 kilometers.  Satellite  During the photometric observations in December 1998, the binary nature of this asteroid was revealed. It was the first binary near-Earth asteroid for which eclipse events were detected in the visible spectrum. The binary system has a diameter ratio of , a density of 1.4 g/cm3, and an ecliptic latitude of -84¬∞ for its mutual spin axis. The asteroid moon has a diameter of approximately 490 meters and an orbital period of 16.1508 hours. Its orbit is nearly circular, with an eccentricity of 0.1 and a semi-major axis of approximately 3.4 primary radii. The moon's rotation period remains unknown.

This endemic subspecies is the only live pigeon present in the Laurel forest habitat of the Azores Islands. Description The Azores wood pigeon closely resembles the mainland wood pigeon subspecies of Africa, Columba palumbus excelsa. Its plumage is somewhat darker and conspicuous, with slightly brighter colour than the European subspecies (Columba palumbus palumbus), especially on the upper parts and the underwing coverts. The bill is orange to yellow and the coloring is paler at the tip, and the eyes are pale yellow. It has white neck markings and iridescent green and purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers stiffen to form white spots on the sides of the neck, with more extension than the European common wood pigeon, but similar to the Asian wood pigeon, Columba palumbus casiotis. The Azores wood pigeon also has white in the wings and a more extensive green iridescence on the nape. The common wood pigeon may be distinguished from other pigeons by its larger size. Ecology It is present on seven islands and extinct on Flores island. This pigeon shared its habitat with the extinct laurel forest mountain pigeon, or black pigeon (). The extinct species was tamer than the Azores wood pigeon. However, the species is in danger of disappearing, like the related Madeiran wood pigeon, (Columba palumbus maderensis). The Azores wood pigeon is found mainly in wooded areas. The largest number of breeding members are found in March. Like the other islander race of common wood pigeon and some species of Macaronesian or Pacific Islands wood pigeons, the Azores have a low rate of reproduction, less than the common wood pigeon. The Azores wood pigeon lays one white egg. In 2003, seven of the nine islands of the Azores were surveyed. The survey gave density estimates of 14.52 birds/km2 on Terceira and 5.14 birds/km2 on the other six islands. Azores wood pigeon densities in the Azores were still much lower than those of the common wood pigeon in mainland Europe. Populations in the Azores may now be limited by the availability of breeding habitat and over-winter food supply. There are strong differences between wood pigeon abundance on the different islands of the archipelago, notably with densities on the island of Terceira being higher than on any of the other islands. In 1905, The German ornithologist Ernst Hartert identified it as a subspecies. Azore wood pigeons play an important ecological role; they are the only birds in the area capable of eating the larger native drupes, a laurel forest species, and disperse the seeds. Its numbers fell sharply after human colonization of the archipelago and it vanished altogether from some of the islands. The major cause of its population decline was habitat loss from forest clearance, but hunting and nest predation by introduced species like rats, were also contributory factors. Any intrusion of humans or animals such as dogs and cats can cause great concern in the nesting population. The black rat is a species that climbs trees in search of food and assaults birds' nests causing, at least, the abandonment of eggs and ruination of the breeding season. Endangered The Azores wood pigeon is endangered. Protection of the laurel forests and an effective ban on hunting enabled an increase in numbers. This species has a greater dependence on water than other species of pigeon. It inhabits beaches and islands in the evergreen broadleaf forest, macaronesian laurisilva, dense subtropical forest and warm temperate evergreen broadleaf forests. It is heavily dependent on a mature forest, whose seeds are dispersed by the birds. Also it feeds in pastures and farmland, in cultivated land and tilled land. It is present inland on Terceira especially on the west coast and near Lagoa da Junco. There are a few specimens in S√£o Miguel near Lagoa Azul. The species has virtually disappeared due to de-forestation. The breeding area is found only near bodies of fresh water with dense tree cover, where couples can nest. Diet changes seasonally as the availability of fruit fluctuates. Leaves can comprise the major part of the diet at certain times of the year, especially when there is little fruit available. The bird browses on leaves and buds, especially during breeding. It prefers foliage and buds at the tips of the branches. They eat rounded and fleshy young leaves, leaves from genus Prunus, young shoots from Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, and Brassicaceae (Cruciferae). Taxonomy The genus Columba is the largest within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are typically pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. One of several subgroups within Columba consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle's pigeon, the Trocaz pigeon, and the African Afep pigeon. Two Macaronesian endemic pigeons, Bolle's and Trocaz, are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of C. palumbus. The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canary Islands, Azores, and Madeira have a volcanic origin and have never been part of a continent. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonized by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. One of these was the lineage of extinct species laurel forest mountain pigeon or Azores black pigeon (). Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle's pigeon may have arrived in the Canary Islands about 5 mya. An older lineage gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the laurel pigeon, C. junoniae, may date from 20 mya. The Trocaz pigeon was recognised as a different species from the other local form, the now-extinct Madeiran wood pigeon, the two local pigeons never interbred or habitually associated together. The Trocaz pigeon is a monotypic species, although in the past Bolle's pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the Trocaz pigeon. The most recent common wood pigeon arrival came from a European or African subspecies, giving rise to the subspecies C. palumbus maderensis, on Madeira and Columba palumbus azorica in the Azores islands.

ICON studies the interaction between Earth's weather systems and space weather driven by the Sun, and how this interaction drives turbulence in the upper atmosphere. It is hoped that a better understanding of this dynamic will mitigate its effects on communications, GPS signals, and technology in general. It is part of NASA Explorers program and is operated by UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory. On 12 April 2013, NASA announced that ICON, along with Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD), had been selected for development with the cost capped at , excluding launch costs. The principal investigator of ICON is Thomas Immel at the University of California, Berkeley. ICON was originally scheduled to launch in June 2017 and was repeatedly delayed because of problems with its Pegasus XL rocket. It was next due to launch on 26 October 2018 but the launch was rescheduled to 7 November 2018, and postponed again just 28 minutes before launch. ICON was successfully launched 11 October 2019 (UTC).  Overview  ICON's observational geometry, showing both in-situ and remote sensing of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. ICON will perform a two-year mission to observe conditions in both the thermosphere and ionosphere. ICON is equipped with four instruments: a Michelson interferometer, built by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, measures the winds and temperatures in the thermosphere; an ion drift meter, built by UT Dallas, measures the motion of charged particles in the ionosphere; and two ultraviolet imagers built at UC Berkeley, observe the airglow layers in the upper atmosphere in order to determine both ionospheric and thermospheric density and composition. Many low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station (ISS), fly through the ionosphere and can be affected by its changing electric and magnetic fields. The ionosphere also acts as a conduit for many communications signals, such as radio waves and the signals that make GPS systems work. The ionosphere is where space weather manifests, creating unexpected conditions; electric currents can cause electrical charging of satellites, changing density can affect satellite orbits, and shifting magnetic fields can induce current in power systems, causing strain, disrupting communications and navigation or even triggering blackouts. Improved understanding of this environment can help predict such events and improve satellite safety and design.  Launch planning  Upon initial completion and delivery of the ICON observatory in 2016, launch plans centered around the launch range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. ICON was originally scheduled to launch in June 2017, but was repeatedly delayed because of problems with its Pegasus XL rocket. The rocket was mated to its air-launch aircraft Stargazer for a launch attempt in June 2018. This launch was cancelled days before because the rocket showed issues on the first leg of the ferry flight to Kwajalein. Given the availability of the launch range in Cape Canaveral, and a review of the suitability of this site, it was adopted as the ICON launch site. The October 2018 launch from Florida was scheduled after an initial review of the avionics issues. Whereas the delays in 2017 were due to concerns with rocket-payload and fairing separation systems, the 2018 delays were due to noise in the rocket avionics systems. The issues resulted finally in the 2018 Cape Canaveral launch being scrubbed minutes before the scheduled launch. These issues were ultimately resolved and ICON launched from Cape Canaveral on October 11, 2019 [UTC]. After an approximately month-long commissioning period, ICON will begin sending back its first science data in November. The launch system has a good track record launching small science payloads for NASA, and had a successful launch in December 2016. The launch system has placed more than 80 satellites in low orbit since its first in 1990. Launch windows: * 2017, Kwajalein Atoll, Pacific Ocean - delayed for investigation of separation systems * June 2018, Kwajalein Atoll - delayed for noise in avionics systems * October 2018, Cape Canaveral, FL - scrubbed for noise in avionics systems *October 2019, Cape Canaveral, FL - successfully launched Northrop Grumman's Pegasus XL rocket is carried aloft by the Stargazer aircraft to approximately 40,000 feet over the open ocean, where it is released and free-falls five seconds before igniting its first-stage rocket motor.ICON - Press Kit (PDF) from October 2018. NASA. The aircraft can also ferry the launch vehicle to different sites. The launch was delayed multiple times after its original planned launch date in June 2017. The launch took place 11 October 2019 (UTC). Science payload ICON carries four scientific instruments designed to image even the faintest plasma or airglow to build up a picture of the ionosphere's density, composition and structure. The complete instrument payload has a mass of and are listed below: *Michelson Interferometer for Global High-Resolution Thermospheric Imaging (MIGHTI) *Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) is an ion drift meter *Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV), an imager *Far Ultra-Violet (FUV), an imager MIGHTI was developed at the United States Naval Research Laboratory, IVM at the University of Texas, and EUV and FUV were developed at the University of California. MIGHTI measures wind speed and temperature between 90 and 300 km in altitude. The velocity measurements are gathered by observing the Doppler shift in the red and green lines of atomic oxygen. This is done with the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) which uses √©chelle gratings. The temperature measurements are done by photometeric observations with a CCD. MIGHTI is designed to detect wind speeds as low as 10 mph, even though the spacecraft would be traveling at over 14,000 mph (to stay in orbit). IVM collects in situ data about ions in the local environment around the spacecraft, whereas EUV and FUV are cameras. EUV is designed to observe height and density of the daytime ionosphere, and detect the glow of oxygen. The solar panels produce 780 watts, but the instruments' power consumption ranges between 209‚Äì265 watts when in science mode.  Mission Operations  Once launched, and for the duration of its two-year science mission, the ICON observatory is controlled and operated by the Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Space Sciences Laboratory at UC Berkeley. The UCB MOC currently operates seven NASA satellites. ICON was placed into a 27-degree inclination orbit, and communications are through TDRSS, the orbiting NASA communications network. Ground contacts with ICON are performed mainly from the Berkeley Ground Station, an 11-meter dish, with backup contacts out of Wallops and Santiago.

Coral is also farmed by scientists for research, by businesses for the live and ornamental coral trade, and by private reef aquarium hobbyists. Coral reef farming involves extracting a part of a coral colony or free-floating larvae from a reef, and growing them in a nursery until outplanting would be successful. It is commonly referred to as the \\"gardening method\\" and has been compared to silviculture as a management practice that mimics natural ecosystems.Levy, G, Shaish, L, Haim, A & Rinkevich, B (2010) \\"Mid-water rope nursery--Testing design and performance of a novel reef restoration instrument\\" Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 560‚Äì569.

Benefits of healthy reefs  Orange cup coral housed in the ƒÄnuenue coral farm in Honolulu, Hawaii. The light is deep blue to simulate the light of the deep sea. This species can be found up to 130 meters deep. A healthy reef houses a large amount of biodiversity with varying species of corals. It requires herbivores including parrotfish and collector urchins that graze on infesting algae. Most corals require oligotrophic waters, that is, water that is clear and nutrient poor. Corals derive nutrients from zooxanthellae symbionts, as well as from plankton and other free floating particles. Zooxanthellae require a mixture of white and blue light to thrive within the coral, depending on the coral type. Some corals, like the orange cup coral, do not require light, and rely on the plankton or free floating nutrients as sustenance.https://sta.uwi.edu/fst/lifesciences/sites/default/files/lifesciences/documents/ogatt/Tubastraea_coccinea%20-%20Orange%20Cup%20Coral.pdf Coral reefs protect the coastline from erosion and storm damage. They are important foundation species that increase biodiversity in the area by providing nursery ground and habitat for nearly one third of saltwater fish species. These include ten percent of all fish captured for human consumption, even though reefs only cover less than one percent of the ocean's surface. Reefs in decline Reefs are affected by severe weather events, such as cyclones,Shaish, L, Levy, G, Katzir, G and Rinkevich, B (2010) \\"Coral Reef Restoration (Bolinao, Philippines) in the Face of Frequent Natural Catastrophes\\" Restoration Ecology, 18(3): 285‚Äì299. temperature changes of 1‚Äì2 degrees of the average water temperature over a period of weeks, from predation by crown of thorns starfish, and from competition for habitat with other foundation species such as algae. Algae can take over coral habitats when the water contains excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) or when fishing stocks are too low and herbivorous fish do not keep the algae at bay by eating it. Corals can minimally protect themselves from algae as well, by removing it with their polyps. When corals are in suboptimal conditions they are less able to protect themselves from algal coverage, diseases, and other stressors. This diversion of energy from growth puts the coral's life at risk. Coral bleaching is the result of the loss of vital zooxanthellae; any of the stressors can cause bleaching. The corals expel their symbionts because they are trying to get rid of any foreign bodies that might be causing them stress. Corals can survive up to a week without the zooxanthellae, but it is difficult. Corals can recover from bleaching and uptake vital zooxanthellae again but this requires a change in environment and the lessening of stressors. Natural stressors to the coral reef are further aggravated by the human impact on coral reefs. Anthropogenic stressors such as runoff, coastal development, dynamite fishing, cyanide fishing, overexploitation of resources and marine pollution, put 58% percent of the world's reefs under threat as of 2009.Coral statistics FAO, Rome.

Coral propagation can improve coral cover, biodiversity, and structural heterogeneity of a degraded reef. Success has been achieved with fire coral, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Acropora hemprichii.Gateno, D, Barki, Y & Rinkevich, B (2000) \\"Aquarium maintenance of reef octocorals raised from field collected larvae\\" Aquarium Sciences and Conservation, 2(4): 227‚Äì236. A restored reef hosts organisms associated with the reef, such as reef fishes. Reefs are delicate and complex ecosystems. It is difficult to replicate what a damaged reef looked like before the damage occurred. Most coral farms that are utilized for mitigation of damage are only able to propagate the fast growing corals that are easy to grow. Slow growing corals are expensive to propagate and are not a fast growing foundation species which is needed when damage occurs. Most coral reefs will take decades to return to their previous state. Nursery-grown coral promote reef resilience by making contributions to the larval pool. This could have a positive effect on new growth if transplanting of the new coral is made just before a larval release season. Oceanographer Baruch RinkevichBaruch Rinkevich Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research. Retrieved 30 September 2011. coined the term active restoration to describe coral reef farming, in contrast with what he described as passive restoration efforts focused on mitigation of stressors by means such as the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Coral reefs are often placed in MPAs in the hope that reducing human activity will allow the coral to recover. Aquarium trade Coral fragments recovered from bomb fishing sites ready for replanting Many people enjoy the creating their own coral display in a home aquarium. In response to this, businesses farm coral to supply them. Some companies farm in sunlit greenhouses instead of artificially lighted aquariums.Oceans, Reefs & Aquariums (ORA). Retrieved 30 September 2011. The 1999 Hawaii Marine Ornamentals Conference concluded with a recommendation to \\"give highest priority to projects involving the advancement of marine ornamental aquaculture and reef preservation.\\" Conferees pressed the importance of encouraging hobbyists to supply only from coral reef farms to help deter over- harvesting. Conferees recommended initiatives to encourage consumer understanding that cultured ornamentals are a more sustainable and 'higher value' alternative to wild-caught live reef organisms.Corbin JS (2001) Marine Ornamentals '99: Conference highlights and priority recommendations Aquarium Sciences and Conservation, 3(1‚Äì3): 3‚Äì11. Methods =For conservation= The stages to farming for reef restoration are: collecting polyps or larvae; growing the specimens in tanks; further growth in sea nurseries and re- transplantation onto the reef. Collection Coral fragments replanted in nontoxic cement Coral can reproduce asexually by budding or sexually by spawning. Collecting coral polyps from existing reef colonies or fragments can be done any time. Branches, fragments, or tips of branches are common targets. This is the most widely practiced method. Collecting coral spawn is generally an annual activity, conducted immediately following a spawning event. Coral colonies on a reef usually spawn together in a synchronized event on a specific day. This allows for hundreds of thousands of coral embryos to be collected at one time. This method is known as spat stocking. At the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium in Townsville, Australia, large colonies of Acropora formosa have collection devices placed above them during spawning.Hough, PD (1996) \\"The captive breeding of Great Barrier Reef Corals: a new wave of Aussie culture\\" American Zoo and Aquarium Association, Annual Conference, Hawaii, pp. 151‚Äì156. Small mature colonies are transplanted from the reef into a tank for spawning. They can then be reattached to the reef. Using this method, the mother colonies are unaffected. This method has also been proved effective on Red Sea soft coral species, Alcyonarians: Clavularia hamra, Nephthea sp. and Litophyton arboreum. Tank cultivation Linden describes an apparatus made of Petri dishes lined with preconditioned Mailer's paper disks on which the planula of Stylophora pistillata are grown. One- month-old survivors were transferred onto plastic pins in a mid-water coral nursery, where the trays were covered with fitted plastic nets to prevent predation and detachment. After four months, more than 89% of the corals had survived.Linden, B & Rinkevich, B (2011) \\"Creating stocks of young colonies from brooding coral larvae, amenable to active reef restoration\\" Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 398(1-2): 40‚Äì46.  Ocean cultivation  Next the corals are transported into floating nurseries in the sea. The corals float in the water column, attached on a submerged structure. Some authors recommend 6 metres depth to ensure the corals get the right amount of sunlight. They are affixed to an artificial substrate. This is usually made from string, wire, mesh, monofilament line or epoxy. The colonies remain there from 8 to 24 months to reach a size for transplantation back to the reef. Return to the reef When the corals are big enough to be transplanted into the reef, the transplantation stage involves securing to the corals by plastic pegs or masonry anchors or with epoxy. =For commercial or exhibition supply= For commercial markets, the process is the same except that the ocean cultivation is extended until the colonies reach marketable size (about fist-sized) and the final step is replaced by extraction and packaging for sale. Economy Coral aquaculture offers alternative livelihoods to people living near the reefs. This is especially important for communities where fishing or harvesting marine organisms have become unsustainable, such as in Indonesia.Bentley, N (1998) \\"An overview of the exploitation, trade and management of corals in Indonesia\\" Traffic Bulletin, Cambridge, 17: 67‚Äì78. It is possible to use coral resources in a way that is environmentally friendly. Many coral reefs are in impoverished locations. Coral reef aquaculture requires only basic, cheap materials, making it possible for communities with limited resources.Ellis S (1999) Farming soft corals for the marine aquarium trade Center for Tropical and Subtropical Aquaculture, Publication 140. Some new methods, such as seeding of concrete tetrapods containing coral larvae, make it possible to reduce costs and outplanting time compared to previous approaches. History Broodstock coral on display at Mote Marine Laboratory One of the first serious attempts at propagating coral ex situ occurred at Noum√©a Aquarium in 1956. At the time it was common for aquarium hobbyists in Germany to create home \\"mini-reefs\\". Commercial coral propagation began in America in the 1960s, and hobby industry took off in the early 1980s. The trend was attributed to hobby magazines. In 2009 the US government awarded $3.3 million for a project to cultivate 5,000 colonies of Acropora. Researchers claimed that transplanting 35 colonies per year would restore coral populations to 1970s levels in 10 years. Research and development Coral aquaculture provides insights into coral life histories. Petersen showed that early sexual recruits grow larger when fed the nauplii of brine shrimp. This discovery could shorten the fragile post settlement time in the hatchery.Petersen, D, Wietheger, A & Laterveer, M (2008) \\"Influence of different food sources on the initial development of sexual recruits of reefbuilding corals in aquaculture\\" Aquaculture, 277(3‚Äì4): 174‚Äì8. The Mote Marine Laboratory keeps many broodstock colonies at its Tropical Research Laboratory. The laboratory website reports that its colonies are grown from fragments rescued from boat groundings and environmental disturbances. The corals in the broodstock reserve provide fragments for restoration research. Studies are done to determine optimal size, shape and season for restoration.Coral aquacultural research Mote Marine Laboratory. Retrieved 9 September 2011. Market Indonesia and the Philippines supply ~85% of coral reef products. Indonesia requires 10% of coral production to be transplanted into the ocean. As of 2012, a majority of coral imports to the US were wild-caught, although an increasing proportion were cultured. From 1990 to 2010, imports increased by some 8% annually. Imports declined thereafter the wake of the Great Recession and from increasing domestic production. Commercial trade in stony and reef-building corals is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In Indonesia, most production is located around airports to speed the shipping process.

The Principal Investigator was Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.NASA - NASA Selects Science Investigations For Concept Studies, 29 September 2011. FINESSE was one of three Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX) mission concepts that received $2 million to conduct a nine-month mission concept study in August 2017. The mission study was terminated prematurely following the selection by European Space Agency of an identical concept, the ARIEL exoplanet atmosphere survey mission. Had it been selected for implementation, FINESSE would have launched no earlier than 2022 and lasted at least two years. The other two finalist concepts competing with FINESSE were Arcus (an X-ray space observatory) and SPHEREx (a near-infrared space observatory). In February 2019, it was announced that SPHEREx had been selected. Overview FINESSE would have consisted of a space observatory tasked to study exoplanet atmospheres by spectroscopically surveying over 500 planets outside the Solar System with the goal of gaining understanding of the processes responsible for their composition, and how the Solar System fits into the larger family of planets.FINESSE Mission to 500+ transiting exoplanets. NASA JPL. Accesses 1 October 2017 FINESSE was a candidate for NASA's next Explorers program MIDEX mission, and conducted a nine-months-long Phase A study starting from August 2017 to refine its mission concept. While FINESSE was selected as finalist for the MIDEX mission, NASA also conditionally selected the CASE proposal as an Explorers Program Partner Mission of Opportunity (PMO). FINESSE and CASE share the same Principal Investigator and science team. CASE, or Contribution To ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets, is a proposal for US participation in the European ARIEL space telescope. An exoplanet atmosphere survey mission, ARIEL is similar to FINESSE both in spacecraft capability and scientific objectives. CASE was selected on the condition that it will only be constructed if ESA selected ARIEL. At the time this was announced, it was still uncertain whether ARIEL will be ultimately selected or not. NASA had stated that if ARIEL and CASE are selected, they would not select FINESSE as the next MIDEX mission. In March 2018, ARIEL was selected by ESA for the fourth Cosmic Vision Medium class mission (M4). Work on FINESSE was terminated as a result. Although FINESSE did not ultimately receive a flight opportunity, its goals will likely be achieved by the 2028 ARIEL mission. Science objectives *Determine key aspects of the planet formation process. FINESSE would obtain the atmospheric composition measurements of metallicity and carbon/oxygen ratio. *Determine key factors that establish planetary climate. FINESSE measurements would determine planetary energy budgets from the dayside to the nightside. Principle FINESSE would have measured the atmospheric light spectra of exoplanets transiting or eclipsing their parent star. The proposed spectrometer functions in the infrared (0.5-5.0 Œºm). It would have used a 75 cm diameter primary mirror. References Further reading and external links *Old FINESSE website (inactive) *Swain, M. R. (2010).

Wilson and Emma Johnson. He was well known for having played bass with The Foggy Mountain Boys. An elder brother had taken up guitar, and soon they began playing together as \\"Chuck and Slim, The Johnson Brothers\\". They played at reunions and social gatherings around the area. The brothers found themselves in High Point, North Carolina, auditioning for the new radio station WMFR which began broadcasting in 1936. They were offered a regular time slot every Thursday morning. Their father believed farm work should take priority, so they eventually cancelled their weekly show. The next big thing for The Johnson Brothers occurred at the 1937 Fourth of July Horse Show in Kernersville, North Carolina. There the brothers entered a competition for performers and won the award for \\"Best Individual Entertainers\\". Rainwater decided to move to Winston-Salem. For four years he found few opportunities in music. He served in the Marines during World War II. In April 1945 he was discharged from active duty and returned to Winston- Salem, where he found work at an auto dealership. While employed there he met a local musician, Woody Hauser. The two formed the band the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys. In 1946 they helped sign on station WTOB and became a regular part of its programming. While playing for WTOB the band played a few local shows in nearby schools. It was during this time that Charles Johnson became \\"Little Jody\\". Clad in baggy pants, suspenders, and old shirts the character that would soon be made famous with Flat and Scruggs was born. Little Jody and Woody played together for almost three years. After a trip with Woody and several friends to the Grand Ole Opry, Jody determined that he would one day play the Opry. After the trip Jody and Woody were offered the chance to play during the intermission of a Bill Monroe road show in Lexington, North Carolina, which is where Rainwater first met Lester Flatt. In 1948, Jody Rainwater left North Carolina for Roanoke, Virginia where he joined the Blue Star Boys. Later that year he learned that Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and others were leaving the Blue Grass Boys to form the Foggy Mountain Boys. Jody was asked to join them to handle bookings and advertising, but he decided to stay in Roanoke. In 1949 a coal strike devastated the Bristol area's economy and the Foggy Mountain Boys left WCYB for Lexington, Kentucky. WCYB offered the Farm and Fun Time slot to the Blue Star Boys and they took it. This didn't work out well, and at this point Flatt again offered the booking job to Jody, who immediately accepted it. In addition to booking, Jody joined the group on their Saturday night slot on WVLK's Jamboree as Cedric Rainwater's comedic partner. The comedy duo was a hit and Jody was soon being billed as Cedric's younger brother. Lester Flatt suggested the name Little Jody Rainwater and it really stuck. However, the comedic antics of the Rainwater brothers were short lived. Soon Cedric decided to join Hank Williams' Drifting Cowboys and leave bluegrass. The Foggy Mountain Boys found themselves in need of a bassist. For the next three years Rainwater played an important part in the band's sound and stage presence. He was both booking and playing shows. Working seven days a week up to eighteen hours a day. By May 1952 Jody was \\"right at a nervous breakdown\\", and, at the advice of a physician he put in his notice. The band was working in central Virginia at the time and he was offered a job working as a deejay at WSVS. With flexible hours and steady pay Jody jumped at the chance. On June 7, 1952 Rainwater left the Foggy Mountain Boys and began his career in radio.

Jebb was the eldest son of Mr Justice Richard Jebb and his wife Jane Louisa Finlay, and nephew of John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick. He was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Dublin. After graduating MA in 1829, Jebb briefly held the rectory of Dunerlin in Ireland before becoming a prebendary of Limerick Cathedral (1832), rector of Peterstow, Herefordshire (1843), a prebendary of Hereford Cathedral (1858) and a canon residentiary (1870). Jebb married Frances, daughter of General Sir Richard Bourke, in September 1831 (she died 1866). Jebb was a leading authority on the Anglican choral tradition and a significant figure in the English choral revival. When Walter Hook, vicar of Leeds, proposed to reinstate choral services and a surpliced choir at Leeds Parish Church in 1841, it was to his friend Jebb that he looked for advice. With his cathedral background Jebb argued that in churches with a choir, the desired musical effect should not be marred by \\"the roar of the congregation\\". He persuaded Hook to adopt the cathedral form of service at Leeds rather than the alternative model demonstrated by the Revd Frederick Oakeley at Margaret Chapel, London, in 1839, where the choir‚Äôs role was to lead the congregation in response, hymn and psalm. Jebb's policy was first made public in Three Lectures on the Cathedral Service (1841). A more scholarly and definitive treatment of the topic was published in his The Choral Service of the United Church of England and Ireland (1843) which was an enquiry in the low state of service and music provision in cathedrals and collegiate churches. He funded the building costs of the new rectory at Peterstow. St Peter's Church at Peterstow was restored in the 1860s under Jebb with Sir George Gilbert Scott as architect. The reopening was on 2 July 1866. The Peterstow Millennium Book, published by the villagers, 2000, p. 17.

History =Dominican= In early 13th century, St. Dominic Guzman was a canon regular at the Cathedral of Osma in Spain. He accompanied his bishop on a trip to Denmark to arrange a marriage between the son of the King of Castile and a member of the Danish royal family. On the return trip, Dominic encountered the followers of the Duke of Albi in southern France. The Duke was a leading Cathar, which embraced a gnostic form of Christianity. Dominic undertook a preaching campaign to them, in order to bring them back to an orthodox understanding of the faith. Several women who responded to his preaching sought a completely new direction in their lives. In response to this, Dominic established a house for them in Prouille in 1206,\\"Religious Orders (Christian)\\", Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics: Picts-Sacraments (James Hastings et al., eds.) T. & T. Clark, 1919, p. 702 where they could lead lives of prayer and penance. In 1880, four nuns of the Dominican Sisters of Perpetual Adoration from the Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament in Oullins, France arrived in the Diocese of Newark, at the invitation of Bishop Michael Corrigan. By 1884, the Monastery of St. Dominic had been constructed based on Old World designs with an arched cloister, the traditional well, the vault resting-place of the departed, and the double grills separating them from the outer world. By 1889, Corrigan had become Archbishop of New York, and seven nuns from Newark re-located temporarily to establish Corpus Christi Monastery in Hunt's Point in the Bronx.The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Vol. II, New York. The Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 121 Today the Second Order of St. Dominic \\"...consists of cloistered nuns who take solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and dedicate themselves to a life of silence, prayer, and penance.\\"\\"St. Dominic Establishes Second Order\\", Dominican Friars Foundation They support themselves through intellectual, manual, and artistic work. =Franciscan= St. Francis of Assisi began his life of preaching and penance in the Tuscan region of Italy around this same time. His preaching drew a young noblewoman of the city, the Lady Clare to be inspired to follow his way of life. Determined to take this step, Clare snuck out of her family's palace to join Francis and his brothers on the night of Palm Sunday 1211. After receiving her commitment and giving her the Franciscan habit, Francis then entrusted Clare to the care of a nearby community of Benedictine nuns for her training in monastic life.

It was also one of the first written public declarations of universal human rights. Abraham Isacks op den Graeff (c. 1646 ‚Äì c1731) was an original founder of Germantown, Pennsylvania, as well as a civic leader, award-winning weaver, and signer of the first organized religious protest against slavery in colonial America. He, or his brother Derick, are briefly mentioned in John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \\"The Pennsylvania Pilgrim\\" simply as \\"Op Den Graaf\\". Early life Abraham op den Graeff was born c. 1646 in Krefeld, Germany. He was the son of Isaac Herman op den Graeff and grandson of Herman op den Graeff. The Op den Graeff family were originally Mennonites, and are believed to have come from nearby Aldekerk in the Catholic Duchy of Julich about 1605 to avoid persecution. At that time Krefeld was an exclave of the County of Moers, and under the authority of the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands. In contrast to the leaders of Julich and the nearby Electorate of Cologne, the leaders of the Netherlands were tolerant of non-conforming religions. As a result, Krefeld had become a point of refuge for the persecuted Mennonites. Many of the Krefeld Mennonites were weavers, or practiced other cloth making trades such as dying. Abraham himself was a weaver. Quaker missionary work in the lower and middle Rhine River valley during the 1660s resulted in the conversion of a number of Mennonites in and around Krefeld. Among these converts were Abraham Op Den Graeff and his family. The Quakers were not as readily tolerated by the people of Krefeld. In 1679 five of them, including Abraham's brother Herman, were forcibly exiled from Krefeld. They were eventually allowed to return through pressure from the English Quakers, but by this time William Penn's Colony was being established (1681-1682). The opportunity to follow their Quaker beliefs without fear of persecution was undoubtedly a major factor in their decision to emigrate from Krefeld. Abraham and his brothers were among the first to leave, arriving at Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania on the Concord in October 1683.\\"The Friend, Volume 48\\", The Friend., 1875.

History A folio from the Baburnama: An awards ceremony in Sultan IbrƒÅhƒ´m Lodi's court before an expedition to Sambhal in the early 16th century. The district was announced on 28 September 2011 and created by the state government on 23 July 2012 as one of three new districts in the state. At the time of its creation, the state government decided to name the new district \\"Bhimnagar\\" in honour of the social reformer, Bhimrao Ambedkar. However, massive protests broke out in Sambhal town and the adjoining rural areas against the move to give a new name to the ancient town.UP: Protest in Sambhal Over Change of District's Name Sambhal had been known by the same name for over five hundred years, had been an important town in medieval India, and had never had any connection with Bhimrao Ambedkar, a dalit icon. The protests against renaming the town were successful and the government had to revert to the old name of Sambhal. Geography The district of Sambhal is part of the Moradabad division in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Bahjoi town serves as its district headquarters. The districts which adjoin Sambhal are (clockwise from north) Amroha, Moradabad, Rampur, Badaun, Aligarh and Bulandshahr. The nearest major metropolis is New Delhi.

It was developed by a team of Spanish researchers at the Spanish National Research Council's Biotechnology National Centre headed by Dr. Mariano Esteban. The vaccine is based on the Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus used during the 1970s to help eradicate the smallpox virus. The B in the name \\"refers to HIV-B, the most common HIV subtype in Europe\\". It has been stated by Dr. Esteban that, in the future, the vaccine could potentially reduce the virulence of HIV to a \\"minor chronic infection akin to herpes\\". History =Non-human testing= The vaccine was originally tested on a number of mice and macaque monkeys in 2008 against the Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and it was found to be successful in creating an immune system response to SIV infection. =Phase I testing= The initial testing on human subjects was conducted on a testing pool of thirty HIV-free individuals. Six of the pool were given a placebo and had no results. Of the other twenty-four individuals, twenty-two exhibited a \\"very strong immunological response against the HIV virus\\", bringing the success rate of the testing to 92%. The immune reaction that the successful testers exhibited lasted for a period close to a year for 85% of the testers, who had no \\"significant secondary effects\\". It was also shown that, from blood tests in the 48th week after administration of the vaccine, in 72.5% of the volunteers, \\"specific antibodies\\" had formed to combat possible HIV infection. Specifically, the blood tests revealed that the immune system production of CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes were at 38.5% and 69.2% each for the testers given the vaccine, while the amounts in the group given the placebo remained at 0%. The next step with the vaccine within Phase I testing is to conduct a trial with HIV-positive testers, in order to determine if there is a \\"therapeutical effect of the vaccine\\" on those already infected with the virus.

The firm was founded by Ellis Ivory, and is now headed by his son, Clark Ivory. In 2017, the firm was the 60th largest homebuilder in the nation, according to Builder magazine. History =Early Years= The firm was founded as Ivory & Company. In the early 1970s it began developing lots and eventually became one of the largest land developers in the state of Utah, doing roughly 18-20% of all lot development in the state, about 2,000 lots a year. As the market struggled in the late seventies/ early eighties, the firm decided that building homes themselves on the lots they owned would be necessary to better the company‚Äôs situation. In 1983 the firm built its first 30 homes. =Development= In 1988 Ivory & Company became Ivory Homes. Since then the firm, experienced huge growth in the years of the housing boom, has been Utah‚Äôs number one homebuilder for the next 31 years. In 1994 Clark Ivory began the process of buying the company from his father Ellis. By 2000 Ellis had fully retired and Clark had complete responsibility, continuing to heads the company as CEO. Today the firm has 170 employees and 70 sales consultants. The company has experimented with new ‚Äògreen technologies‚Äô, and in 2011 reported all of their homes to be energy star certified. In 2018, Ivory committed to plant 30,000 trees within 10 years in the state of Utah. In the past decade the company has introduced the Ivory Financial Fitness program, to help people overcome their credit issues so they can get a loan to buy a home. It also offered a three-year lease guarantee to home owners, so that buyers have three years to sell their existing home. As Utah started to face the economic issue of limited housing affordability and a significant housing gap, in 2017 the firm initiated a program, Ivory Innovations, offering competitions and prizes for innovative ideas on making housing more affordable. =Controversy= In December 2013, the Applewood Park mobile home complex announced rent increases for their property totaling 44 percent over a six-month period. Applewood Park was purchased in 2011 by a company affiliated with Ivory Homes, ICO Multifamily Holdings. Residents, suspect the rent increases are designed to force them to abandon their homes and allow ICO to replace the neighborhood with a 186-unit apartment complex. In 2018, Ivory Homes partnered with Woodbury Corporation in proposing a project for the vacant former Cottonwood Mall Site. This proposal was a mixed- use project with high-rise apartments, single-family homes, and, commercial use It was approved by the Holladay City Council, but later challenged by a group of local residents because of its high density.

Since the existing laws allowed only for the naturalization of white people and black people, the Chinese plaintiff Ah Yup attempted to argue that Chinese people were white. A federal court in California dismissed this contention with reference to then current scientific and popular ideas about race, emphasizing that \\"Orientals\\" were unfit for participation in republican government because of the unsatisfactory political culture which existed in Asia at the time. Case classification Prerequisite cases were cases based on racial restrictions on naturalization. The first reported prerequisite case was handed down in 1878. From 1878 until the end of racial restrictions on naturalization in 1952, fifty-one more prerequisite cases were decided in jurisdictions around the country, all the way from California to Washington D.C. All of these had to do with applicants from a variety of countries including, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the Philippines, India and Syria. Almost all of these cases were instances where the applicants presented claims of white racial identity.Lopez, Ian H. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York: New York UP, 1996. Print. pg. 35 Ah Yup was the first prerequisite case. This case gave a sense of what to expect in future cases, as well as the reasoning that reflected almost every other prerequisite case that would be presented in the United States.Lopez, Ian H. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York: New York UP, 1996. Print. pg. 38 History Ah Yup was an ethnically Chinese immigrant who applied for naturalization. The petition stated that all of the qualifications required by the statute to entitle the petitioner to be naturalized were present, as long as the statute authorized the naturalization of a native of China of the \\"Mongolian race\\" (a term used at the time to include people from most Asian ethnic groups). The question then being posed by this case was, 'is a person of the Mongolian race a \\"white person\\" within the meaning of the statute?'Lopez, Ian H. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York: New York UP, 1996. Print. pg.169 On April 29, 1878, the Ninth Circuit Court in California denied Ah Yup the right to naturalize. The court did this by citing the 1802 naturalization laws and all revised statutes that had been passed since. At the time of Ah Yup's petition, the laws granted all 'free white persons\\" as well as all \\"aliens of African nativity, and persons of African descent\\" the right to naturalize. The court ruled that Mongolians could not be classified as \\"white,\\" and made it clear that the existing provisions prevented all except \\"whites\\" and those of African descent from naturalizing to the United States.\\"This Month in History: In Re Ah Yup Rules Chinese Ineligible for Naturalized Citizenship on April 29, 1878.\\" Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Program. Web. 28 Sept. 2011. . Decision Circuit Judge Lorenzo Sawyer presided over this case. He noted that this case constituted the first naturalization application by a person from China. Sawyer turned to evidence coming from science and that of amici curiae to assist the court in a decision. The evidence coming from science was based on contemporary anthropological thought on racial classifications.Lopez, Ian H. White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race. New York: New York UP, 1996. Print. pg. 38 Judge Sawyer diligently reviewed the legislative history of the naturalization statute. He not only wanted to rely on the opinions of the amici, but also the scientific evidence as he searched for a clue to the meaning of the question of Chinese naturalization. The judge carefully examined congressional debates that came about because of Senator Sumner's opposition to racial restrictions. These debates directly dealt with and questioned Chinese naturalization.

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane, Ophelia originated in a tropical wave in the central Atlantic, forming approximately midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles on September 17\\\\. Tracking generally west-northwestward, Ophelia was upgraded to a tropical storm on September 21, and reached an initial peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 22\\\\. As the storm entered a region of higher wind shear it began to weaken, and was subsequently downgraded to a remnant low on September 25\\\\. The following day, however, the remnants of the system began to reorganize as wind shear lessened, and on September 27, the National Hurricane Center once again began advisories on the system. Moving northward, Ophelia regained tropical storm status early on September 28, and rapidly deepened to attain its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) several days later. The system weakened as it entered cooler sea surface temperatures and began a gradual transition to an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed by October 3\\\\. Following the development of Ophelia, numerous storm watches and warnings were issued for the northeastern Caribbean Islands. Residents were urged to prepare for strong winds and substantial flooding. As the system made its closest approach, Ophelia produced several inches of rainfall, leading to mudslides and several road rescues. While light rain totals and gusty winds below tropical storm force were recorded on the island of Bermuda, storm surge and dangerous rip currents along the coast caused minimal damage. In Newfoundland, heavy rainfall contributed to floods that destroyed roads and many buildings. Following Ophelia's transition into an extratropical cyclone, residents across Europe were urged to prepare for strong winds in excess of 75 mph (120 km/h) in some locations, as well as rainfall accumulations up to . In northern Ireland, a combination of moisture and significantly cooler weather produced several inches of snow across the region, cutting electricity to hundreds. Overall, there were no deaths reported in association with Ophelia, and damage was minimal. Meteorological history The formation of Hurricane Ophelia is attributed in part to a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa in mid-September. As the wave tracked westward, it began to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and was subsequently introduced with a low chance of tropical development in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook. Though atmospheric wind shear was only marginally favorable, the cloud pattern organized, and a surface low-pressure area developed in association with the disturbance. Deep shower and thunderstorm activity continued to fire as the disturbance moved in a general westward motion, and it was assessed with a high chance of development by early on September 19. Following satellite trends and data from the Advanced Scatterometer, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC the following day, while positioned roughly 1300 mi (2090 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, and to a tropical storm six hours later. alt=Satellite image of a tropical cyclone in open water. Cloud activity stretches three-fourths the way around the cyclone, and the center is partially exposed. Tropical Storm Ophelia continued to intensify as it moved west-northwest. Curved convective bands became prominent in the northern semicircle of the cyclone, and deep convection developed near the center. This intensification trend was short-lived, however, as increased wind shear from a nearby upper-level low caused the low-level center to become partially exposed. Despite the poor presentation on satellite imagery, data from a nearby buoy revealed that the system was stronger than previously thought, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 22\\\\. As the upper-level low moved closer to Ophelia, inducing increasingly unfavorable shear on the storm, it caused the low-pressure area to become completely void of thunderstorms. While deep convection waned significantly early on September 23, it made a comeback by that afternoon, and an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft found 60 mph (95 km/h) winds in the system, much stronger than the intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) the system was assessed with before the flight. This intensity did not maintain long as the cloud pattern once again became disorganized. The low-level center became exposed once again during the pre-dawn hours of September 25, and without the return of organized shower and thunderstorm activity, led to the NHC declaring Ophelia as a remnant area of low pressure, while situated 180 mi (290 km) east of the northern Leeward Islands. Though the low-level center dissipated later that afternoon, a well-defined mid-level center lingered. The National Hurricane Center initially assessed the remnants of Ophelia with a low chance of regeneration as deep convection fired in association with the low, but these odds were subsequently increased to a medium chance by the afternoon hours of September 26. A new low-level circulation developed within the well- organized cloud mass, and the system was once again given a high chance of tropical cyclone formation that evening. Following an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance flight into the system, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ophelia at 1200 UTC on September 27, and was once again upgraded to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) 18 hours later. As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge positioned across the central Atlantic, it began to curve northward and intensify once again. Deep convection blossomed atop the center late on September 28, and microwave imagery depicted the development of an eye. Upper-level outflow expanded in all four quadrants of the cyclone by the afternoon hours of September 29, and satellite intensity estimates continued to rise, prompting the NHC to upgrade Ophelia to a Category 1 hurricane by 1800 UTC that day. An unexpected period of rapid deepening began early on September 30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) by 0600 UTC and became the season's third major hurricane‚Äîa Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale‚Äîtwelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October 1, with cloud tops in the eye of the system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category 4 hurricane at 0000 UTC on October 2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940 mb (hPa; 27.76 inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800 UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600 UTC on October 3\\\\. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day. Preparations and impact alt=Satellite image of an organized with a ragged eye and some spread out mass of clouds. Though the center of Ophelia remained 205 mi (330 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, its outer bands produced heavy rains across the region. In Dominica, more than of rain fell over parts of the country, triggering flooding along several rivers. Nearly 1,600 people were stranded and many cars were washed away by the flooding, while landslides severed access to several communities. Several businesses and schools were closed in preparation of the storm. As Ophelia made its closest approach to the region, heavy rainfall submerged Canefield Airport, and numerous roads, buildings and farms were damaged, leaving residents trapped. Gusty winds, reaching 37 mph (60 km/h) at times, and scattered thunderstorms affected portions of Guadeloupe. Following Ophelia's upgrade to hurricane status on September 29, the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) issued a tropical storm watch for the entirety of the island. Over the following days, the threat of damaging winds gradually decreased as the storm's forecast track took it far enough east of the territory to spare the region of a direct hit. Correspondingly, the BWS discontinued the watch on the evening of October 1. Four flights from the United States to Bermuda were canceled due to stormy conditions. Along the coast, the Department of Parks raised high surf warnings for the entire south shore and temporarily closed Horseshoe Beach. Additionally, a few local events were postponed. Passing roughly 140 mi (220 km) east of Bermuda, the outer bands of Ophelia produced of rain and wind gusts up to 35 mph (55 km/h) across the islands. On October 1, Environment Canada issued a tropical storm watch for the Avalon Peninsula. Throughout Newfoundland, residents were warned of heavy rains approaching . Striking the region just over a year after Hurricane Igor, Ophelia revealed that repairs made in the wake of the previous hurricane were occasionally inadequate. Six roads on the Burin and Bonavista peninsulas were shut down during the storm; two of the works sustained significant damage. Several culverts installed after Igor were washed away by Ophelia. While Ophelia was still impacting Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that the remnants of the storm would bring unsettled weather to the nation within a few days. In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time monthly record high of 86 ¬∞F (29.9 ¬∞C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with the remnants of the storm were expected to produce snowfall across the United Kingdom as well. In County Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.

The agreement came to the attention of the authorities and the men were tried at the Court of Session. They were found guilty and the election of Michaelmas of 1773 was annulled and the burgh council dissolved. The burgh also lost its right to elect a Member of Parliament. The rights were restored and a new council elected in 1781.  Misconduct  Three members of the Stirling burgh council, including the Provost of Stirling and a bailie, elected at Michaelmas in 1773, entered into an unlawful agreement. This agreement, which became known as the \\"Black Bond\\", was that no person should be selected to sit on the council without the agreement of all three persons, and that each man would support the other during elections. They also agreed that any appointments to council officer positions (such as that of Deacon) should be by agreement of the three men, this being carried out by their vetting of a shortlist of candidates. They agreed to maintain the bond, which effectively gave full control of the council to the three, throughout their lifetimes. Two of the men were elders of the Church of Scotland and one in the Secession Church (Stirling being unusual in having a milder civic oath that permitted the election of Anti- Burghers to public office).  Court case  The three men were brought to trial in the Court of Session in November 1773 on charges of corrupt influence over the matter. All other councillors elected at Michelmas were also charged with the offence. At court the three men admitted the existence of the agreement, but stated that they had never attempted to influence an election and that the agreement had ended earlier in 1773. The other defendants professed to have no knowledge of the bond. The prosecution called a writer and other witnesses from the town who testified to the existence of the illegal agreement. The court found that the election was \\"illegal, unwarrantable and contra bonos mores [against good morals]\\", and ruled that the results be voided. It was also shown that the election of magistrates had been compromised and this was also voided. The council was dissolved and the burgh was suspended from all corporate privileges including the right to elect a Member of Parliament; the burgh was administered directly by a government commission. The defendants appealed to the House of Lords, but they upheld the original verdict of the Court of Sessions. The agreement was popularly known as the \\"Black Bond\\". Following a petition by the inhabitants to the Crown, the burgh's privileges were restored under a new constitution in 1781 by the King (George III) in council. This allowed for the election of 21 councillors and magistrates at Michaelmas of that year by the burgesses and merchants of the town. The new constitution reduced the influence available to senior council members, with some directly elected officers and others chosen by a wider subset of the council.

The first object acquired by William JohnstonThe Johnston Collection (TJC) is a multi award- winning and critically acclaimed museum situated in leafy East Melbourne that invites creatives from the broader visual arts and design communities to re- interpret the Collection through a regular program of re-installation and interventions of the permanent collection. The museum has a superb collection of English Georgian, Regency, and Louis XV fine and decorative arts, and objet d‚Äôart which was a gift from William Robert Johnston (1911-1986) to the people of Victoria. Johnston was a prominent Melbourne-born antique dealer, real estate investor and collector. The Collection is displayed in a constantly changing domestic setting, in his former residence, Fairhall, an historic East Melbourne townhouse. Since it first opened to the public in 1990, The Johnston Collection has been inviting creatives from contemporary art and design communities to create dialogues with its collection. In keeping with William Johnston's wish that Fairhall be rearranged, the Collection is guest-curated and re-imagined regularly. So, like a public art gallery, its interior rooms are dedicated to regular rehangs and reinterpretations.The museum also offers special exhibitions, study days, lectures and workshops throughout the year, sharing stories and inspiring communities. TJC encourages challenges to traditional making, thinking and practice through contemporary responses to the Collection, along with more customary responses that reflect historical techniques, materials and making. As such, the permanent collection is not static - with commissioned projects from invited contemporary creatives who draw on this collection, as well as creating new works based on their own practices for their installations, their reinterpretations. Awards The Green Room As a leader and innovator in the arts The Johnston Collection has been awarded for supporting studio artists and curators. The Johnston Collection has been honoured to receive awards and accolades recognising our important work in supporting artists and exhibitions.

Constructed in 1860, and originally named Cadzow, the house was purchased by William Johnston in 1952. Johnston occupied the house from 1972, until his death in 1986. Internally the structure of Fairhall remains essentially as Johnston left it. Under his ownership, the house was remodelled to simulate the appearance of a Georgian townhouse. These alterations included changes to the fenestration, the replacement of the front door and the insertion of a semicircular fanlight. The house and its collection were bequeathed to the people of Victoria by Johnston shortly before his death. Fairhall was converted into the house museum, and a courtyard garden was designed by John Patrick in the English manner to highlight Johnston‚Äôs love of gardening. In accordance with Johnston‚Äôs wishes, the Collection is displayed in a domestic setting within Fairhall, without labels, ropes or barriers. All visitors are conducted through the house by volunteer guides. There is an established tradition of re-dressing and decorating Fairhall, initiated by Johnston himself. Johnston often brought his decorating skills to the fore, rearranging the furniture, not only in Fairhall but also his country property Chandpara and his shop Kent Antiques, to make little vignettes within the spaces. Today, the Collection is rearranged for three themed tours per year, with guest curators invited to interpret the space. These have included Lynne Landy and Lady Potter, fashion designer Akira Isogawa, decorator Robert Thomson, and antique dealers Jamie Allpress and Francis Dunn.

He retired on 22 June 2018 as the second most senior Supreme court judge. Earlier, he was the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court and Gauhati High Court. He was also one of the 4 judges who held a controversial press conference against the Chief Justice of India Justice Dipak Misra. Early life Chelameswar was born in Peddamuttevi village of Movva mandal, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, the son of Jasti Lakshminarayana, a lawyer who practised at the district court, and his wife Annapoornamma. After completing his schooling in Machilipatnam, Chelameswar enrolled at Loyola College, Chennai and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Science with Physics as his major subject. He then studied Law and obtained an LLB from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam in 1976. Career Chelameswar served as an Additional Judge at the then High Court of Andhra Pradesh. Later, he became the Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court in 2007. He was later transferred as the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court and was elevated as a Judge, Supreme Court of India in October 2011. According to an Op-Ed in The Economic Times: Notable Judgements =Freedom of Speech= Chelameswar and Rohinton Fali Nariman formed the two judge bench of the Supreme Court of India which struck down a controversial law which gave Indian police the power to arrest anyone accused of posting emails or other electronic messages which \\"causes annoyance or inconvenience\\". The judges held Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which made such offenses punishable up to three years imprisonment, to be unconstitutional. According to Chelameswar and Nariman, several terms in the law they were striking down were \\"open-ended, undefined and vague\\" which made them nebulous in nature. According to the judges: \\"What may be offensive to one may not be offensive to another. What may cause annoyance or inconvenience to one may not cause annoyance or inconvenience to another.‚Äù In their judgement the judges clarified that a distinction needs to be made between discussion, advocacy, and incitement. Any discussion, or advocacy of even an unpopular cause cannot be restricted, and it is only when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement whereby it causes public disorder or affects the security of the state can it be curbed. The judgement has been welcomed for defending the Indian Constitution's ideals of tolerance and the Constitutional provisions of free speech. It has been pointed out that the controversial law struck down by Chelameswar and Nariman had gained notoriety after many people in India started getting arrested for seemingly innocuous reasons on the ground that they had violated the now scrapped law. =Aadhaar= A three judge bench of the Indian Supreme Court, comprising Chelameswar, Sharad Arvind Bobde, and Chokkalingam Nagappan, ratified an earlier order of the Supreme Court and clarified that no Indian citizen without an Aadhaar card can be deprived of basic services and government subsidies. This ratification by the three judge bench however was made invalid by the subsequent judgements of the Supreme Court and notifications by the Government of India making Aadhar mandatory for basic services and government subsidies. =National Judicial Appointments Commission(NJAC) verdict= In his dissenting opinion in the NJAC verdict(2015), Chelameswar had criticised the collegium system of appointing judges, which he said has become \\"a euphemism for nepotism\\" where \\"mediocrity or even less\\" is promoted and a \\"constitutional disorder\\" does not look distant.

Total workers numbered 89,248 and formed 33.92% of the total population, and non- workers numbered 173,903 and formed 66.08% of the population. The District Human Development Report points out that in the CD blocks of the region situated in the close proximity of the Kolkata metropolis, overwhelming majority are involved in the non-agricultural sector for their livelihood. On the other hand, in the Sundarbans settlements, overwhelming majority are dependent on agriculture. In the intermediate region, there is again predominance of the non-agricultural sector. Though the region is not very close to Kolkata, many places are well connected and some industrial/ economic development has taken place. Note: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/ government/ institution. When a person who works on another person's land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer.

It includes factory, mining, plantation, transport and office workers, those engaged in business and commerce, teachers, entertainment artistes and so on. =Infrastructure= There are 65 inhabited villages in the Jaynagar I CD block, as per the District Census Handbook, South Twenty-four Parganas, 2011. 100% villages have power supply. 65 villages (100%) have drinking water supply. 17 villages (26.15%) have post offices. 57 villages (87.69%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 38 villages (58.46%) have pucca (paved) approach roads and 27 villages (41.54%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 2 villages (3.08%) have agricultural credit societies and 5 villages (7.60%) have banks. =Agriculture= The South 24 Parganas had played a significant role in the Tebhaga movement launched by the Communist Party of India in 1946. Subsequently, Operation Barga was aimed at securing tenancy rights for the peasants. In the Jaynagar I CD block 735.35 acres of land was acquired and vested. Out of this 568.02 acres or 77.24% of the vested land was distributed. The total number of patta (document) holders was 957. According to the District Human Development Report, agriculture is an important source of livelihood in the South Twentyfour Parganas district. The amount of cultivable land per agricultural worker is only 0.41 hectare in the district. Moreover, the irrigation facilities have not been extended to a satisfactory scale. Agriculture mostly remains a mono-cropped activity. According to the District Census Handbook, the saline soil of the district is unfit for cultivation, but the non-salty lands are very fertile. While rice is the main food crop, jute is the main cash crop. In 2013‚Äì14, there were 91 fertiliser depots, 22 seed stores and 50 fair price shops in the Jaynagar I CD block. In 2013‚Äì14, the Jaynagar I CD block produced 8,941 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop, from 4,613 hectares, 643 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 249 hectares, 2,905 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 862 hectares, 613 tonnes of jute from 29 hectares and 3,510 tonnes of potatoes from 108 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. =Irrigation= In the Jaynagar I CD block, in 2013‚Äì14, 14.17 hectares were irrigated by deep tube well. Poor irrigation and high soil salinity results in the mono-cropping pattern of cultivation in a major portion of the South 24 Parganas district. As a result of its closeness to the Bay of Bengal, the river waters are mostly saline and are unsuitable for irrigation. Added to the rather gloomy irrigation scenario is the problem of frequent floods. =Pisciculture= In the Jaynagar I CD block, in 2013‚Äì14, net area under effective pisciculture was 1,185 hectares, engaging 10,757 persons in the profession, and with an approximate annual production of 52,652 quintals.

The poverty rates were very high in the Sundarbans settlements with all the thirteen CD blocks registering poverty ratios above 30% and eight CD blocks had more than 40% of the population in the BPL category. The Sundarban region remains the most backward region in terms of quality of life. As per rural household survey in 2005, the proportion of households in South 24 Parganas with poverty rates below poverty line was 34.11%, way above the state and national poverty ratios. Economy =Livelihood= In the Jaynagar II CD block in 2011, among the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 14,804 and formed 15.88%, agricultural labourers numbered 33,952 and formed 36.41%, household industry workers numbered 12,219 and formed 13.10% and other workers numbered 24,467 and formed 34.60%. Total workers numbered 93,240 and formed 36.98% of the total population, and non-workers numbered 158,924 and formed 63.02% of the population. The District Human Development Report points out that in the CD blocks of the region situated in the close proximity of the Kolkata metropolis, overwhelming majority are involved in the non-agricultural sector for their livelihood. On the other hand, in the Sundarbans settlements, overwhelming majority are dependent on agriculture. In the intermediate region, there is again predominance of the non-agricultural sector. Though the region is not very close to Kolkata, many places are well connected and some industrial/ economic development has taken place. Note: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/ government/ institution. When a person who works on another person's land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer. Household industry is defined as an industry conducted by one or more members of the family within the household or village, and one that does not qualify for registration as a factory under the Factories Act. Other workers are persons engaged in some economic activity other than cultivators, agricultural labourers and household workers. It includes factory, mining, plantation, transport and office workers, those engaged in business and commerce, teachers, entertainment artistes and so on. =Infrastructure= There are 47 inhabited villages in the Jaynagar II CD block, as per the District Census Handbook, South Twenty-four Parganas, 2011. 100% villages have power supply. 47 villages (100%) have drinking water supply. 20 villages (42.55%) have post offices. 45 villages (95.74%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 8 villages (17.02%) have pucca (paved) approach roads and 15 villages (31.91%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 1 village (2.13%) has an agricultural credit society and 5 villages (10.64%) have banks. =Agriculture= The South 24 Parganas had played a significant role in the Tebhaga movement launched by the Communist Party of India in 1946. Subsequently, Operation Barga was aimed at securing tenancy rights for the peasants. In the Jaynagar II CD block 2,264.89 acres of land was acquired and vested. Out of this 2,034.12 acres or 89.88% of the vested land was distributed. The total number of patta (document) holders was 1,342. According to the District Human Development Report, agriculture is an important source of livelihood in the South Twentyfour Parganas district. The amount of cultivable land per agricultural worker is only 0.41 hectare in the district. Moreover, the irrigation facilities have not been extended to a satisfactory scale. Agriculture mostly remains a mono-cropped activity. As per the District Census Handbook, the saline soil of the district is unfit for cultivation, but the non-salty lands are very fertile. While rice is the main food crop, jute is the main cash crop. In 2013‚Äì14, there were 57 fertiliser depots, 9 seed stores and 54 fair price shops in the Jaynagar II CD block. In 2013‚Äì14, the Jaynagar II CD block produced 27,359 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop, from 13,254 hectares, 461 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 148 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. =Irrigation= In the Jaynagar II CD block, in 2013‚Äì14, 16.59 hectares were irrigated by deep tube well. Poor irrigation and high soil salinity results in the mono-cropping pattern of cultivation in a major portion of the South 24 Parganas district. As a result of its closeness to the Bay of Bengal, the river waters are mostly saline and are unsuitable for irrigation. Added to the rather gloomy irrigation scenario is the problem of frequent floods. =Pisciculture= In the Jaynagar II CD block, in 2013‚Äì14, net area under effective pisciculture was 1,885 hectares, engaging 31,645 persons in the profession, and with an approximate annual production of 67,827 quintals. Pisciculture is an important source of employment in the South 24 Parganas district. As of 2001, more than 4.5 lakh people were engaged in pisciculture. Out of this 2.57 lakhs were from the 13 blocks in the Sundarbans settlements. =Banking= In 2013‚Äì14, the Jaynagar II CD block had offices of 8 commercial banks and 2 gramin banks. =Backward Regions Grant Fund= The South 24 Parganas district is listed as a backward region and receives financial support from the Backward Regions Grant Fund. The fund, created by the Government of India, is designed to redress regional imbalances in development. As of 2012, 272 districts across the country were listed under this scheme. The list includes 11 districts of West Bengal. Transport The Jaynagar II CD block has 1 ferry service and 2 originating/ terminating bus routes.

Geography The Kultali CD block is located at . It has an average elevation of . The Kultali CD block is bounded by the Jaynagar I and Canning I CD blocks in the north, the Basanti CD block in a part of the east, Sundarbans National Park in parts of the east and south, and the Jaynagar II CD block in the west. The South 24 Parganas district is divided into two distinct physiographic zones: the marine-riverine delta in the north and the marine delta zone in the south. As the sea receded southwards, in the sub-recent geological period, a large low-lying plain got exposed. Both tidal inflows and the rivers have been depositing sediments in this plain. The periodical collapse of both the natural levees and man-made embankments speed up the process of filling up of the depressions containing brackish water wetlands. The marine delta in the south is formed of interlacing tidal channels. As non-saline water for irrigation is scarce, agriculture is monsoon dominated. Some parts of the wetlands are still preserved for raising fish. The Kultali CD block has an area of 306.18 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 9 gram panchayats, 120 gram sansads (village councils), 46 mouzas and 43 inhabited villages, as per the District Statistical Handbook, South Twenty-four Parganas. Kultali and Maipith Coastal police stations serve this block.Headquarters of this CD block is at Jamtala. The Kultali CD block has 191.561 km of embankments. Breaches in these embankments varied from 5 km in 2003-04 to 23.4 km in 2006-07. Embankments raised along rivers are of critical importance for the safety of lives and protection of crops, against daily tides and tidal surges. Technologically the embankment structures are weak and there is need of proper drainage of accumulated rain water through sluice gates. Crude cuts in embankments for drainage of accumulated rain water and channels built for providing water to large fisheries (bheris) also add to the hazards. Cyclones and tropical depressions are regular threats. Gram panchayats of Kultali CD block/panchayat samiti are: Deulbari, Gopalganj, Gurguria Bhubaneswari, Jalaberia I, Jalaberia II, Kundakhali Godabar, Maipith Baikunthapur, Meriganj I and Meriganj II.

Founded in 1540, Marmato is one of the historic gold-mining regions of the hemisphere. He was murdered on September 1, 2011, while returning home. Strip mining and the murder of a priest From 1946 onwards, the Colombian government had established a zone in the hills where the town stands as a preserve for mining by the various small miners of the town. This was in effect until 2007, when the Canadian mining company Medoro Resources merged with a Colombian mining company to form a conglomerate called \\"Gran Colombia Gold\\". The new corporation proposed digging a massive strip mine on the site of the town. This would require the total demolition of the town and the relocation of its populace. The people of the town resisted this, claiming that the government had violated its own rules in agreeing to this. Reynal, the local Roman Catholic pastor had resisted attempts by the mining company to get his endorsement of their plans. In August 2011, Reynal was given notice by the company that the Archbishop had agreed to the sale of the Church's property in the town. He decided to travel to Bogot√°, the nation's capital, to verify the company's claims. On 1 September 2011, while Reynal-Restrepo was returning on his motorbike from the trip, he was stopped just outside the town and shot to death. Opponents of the plans to move the town claim that it was agents of the mining company who murdered him, due to his opposition to the plans. Reynal himself had made a video just days before his death, in which he said that only his death would end his opposition to the move. Spokesmen for the mining company say that his death was a regrettable case of random banditry.

It was invented by the scientist John W. Huffman and colleagues at Clemson University. JWH-175 is closely related to the widely used cannabinoid designer drug JWH-018, but with the ketone bridge replaced by a simpler methylene bridge. It is several times weaker than JWH-018, having a binding affinity at the CB1 receptor of 22 nM, though some derivatives substituted at the 4-position of the naphthyl ring have potency more closely approaching that of the equivalent naphthoylindoles. This makes JWH-175 considerably less potent than most synthetic cannabinoid drugs used in synthetic cannabis blends, and it is unclear if JWH-175 has ever been used for this purpose. However it has still been explicitly banned in several jurisdictions including Russia and some Australian states, in order to stop its potential use as an ingredient in such products. In the United States, all CB1 receptor agonists of the 3-(1-naphthylmethane)indole class such as JWH-175 are Schedule I Controlled Substances.

In the RGB color model used to create all the colors on computer and television screens, brown is made by combining red and green light at different intensities. Brown color names are often not very precise, and some shades, such as beige, can refer to a wide variety of colors, including shades of yellow or red. Browns are usually described as light or dark, reddish, yellowish, or gray-brown. There are no standardized names for shades of brown; the same shade may have different names on different color lists, and sometimes the one name (such as beige or puce) can refer to several very different colors. The X11 color list of web colors lists seventeen different shades of brown, but the complete list of browns is much longer. Brown colors are dark or muted shades of reds, oranges, and yellows which are created on computer and television screens using the RGB color model and in printing with the CMYK color model. Browns can also be created by mixing two complementary colors from the RYB color model (combining all three primary colors). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce brown because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker; the stronger red and yellow colors prevail, thus creating the following tones. Below is a list of some of the common brown colors. Red-brown (web color \\"brown\\") The web color called \\"brown\\" is displayed at right.

Late in the 18th century, the concept of being a Filipino was still nebulous and infantile. The name did not even originally apply to all the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago, but to a small group of Spaniards born there. Motivated by the injustices prevalent in the Philippines, small colonies of native expatriate students in Europe involved themselves in the Propaganda Movement with the purpose of exposing these abuses and in the process began to assume a consciousness articulating reforms of a national interest that was consequently distinct from Spain. Liongson was one of these Filipino students in Madrid. He walked among peers who would one day become Philippine National Heroes. Early years Scion of the Philippine sugar gentry, Liongson was born in Pampanga's ancient capital, Villa de Bacolor to Emigdio Liongson and Eulalia Tongio.Villa de Bacolor Cultural, Literary and Civic Foundation, Inc.

The Suez Canal opened a month earlier on November 17, 1869 establishing a regular steamship service between the Philippines and Europe. The implementation of the Education Decree of 1863 saw the establishment of a primary school for boys and girls in each town of the country. The resulting boom in trade and influx of new ideas gave rise to an emerging educated and moneyed elite. Ilustrados in Madrid (Circa 1890): Francisco Tongio Liongson, standing sixth from left After completing his primary education in Bacolor, Liongson studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila and earned his diplomas in Bachiller en Artes (1887), Titulo de Profesor en Segundo Ense√±asa (1888) and Titulo de Agrimensor y Perito Tasador de Tierras (1889).Guerrero, Fernando Ma., Villanueva, Rafael.

In acknowledgement of his valuable medical service, Liongson was appointed presidente of Pampanga's Provincial Health Board as soon as the transition to civil control was effected.Journal of the American Medical Association. Vol. 73 No. 10. 6 September 1919, p. 777. Under his able leadership and precedent-setting measures, much of the resistance to modern sanitary, quarantine and health practices, caused largely by superstition and ignorance, were overcome.Larkin. (1993a) p. 163. Pampanga went on to control the cholera epidemic of 1902, to fully eradicate the incidence of smallpox in the province by 1906, and to completely free the province of Hansen's disease by 1909.Larkin. (1993a) pp. 164-165 From the ashes of war By 1903, Liongson's parents, Capitan Midiong and Apung Laly, had since died; leaving behind agricultural landholdings ravaged by war. Faced with the tasks of salvaging the remnants of his inheritance and of supporting the inquilino families under his care, the doctor assumed the mantel of the gentleman farmer and entrepreneur, and realized that the young nation's economy needed serious restructuring and help. On August 8, 1905 at a public hearing for the reduction of tariffs on sugar and tobacco, Liongson submitted a paper on the petition to establish an agricultural mortgage bank and tariff reduction.Nagano, Yoshiko. \\"The Agricultural Bank of the Philippine Government, 1908-1916\\".

He highlighted the great need for the insular government to relieve planters from the current depressed condition of agriculture. It was the beginning of his role as one of the sugar industry's spokespersons. Consequently, the U.S. Congress enacted the Agricultural Bank Act (Public Act No. 243) in 1906 providing the establishment of the Agricultural Bank of the Philippine Government, the precursor of the Philippine National Bank, which was subsequently created to replace the former institution in 1916. Tariffs were gradually phased out beginning with the Payne Aldrich Act of 1909 until its complete removal in 1913 with the Underwood Tariff Act. The consequent prosperity resulted in a robust economy leading to among others the expansion of sugar crop production and milling capacities. In January 1918, a group of large-scale sugar planters gathered in San Fernando, Pampanga to organize a central sugar mill financed from native capital. The group included Jose de Leon, Augusto Gonzalez, Francisco Liongson, Honorio Ventura, Tomas Lazatin, Tomas Consunji, Francisco Hizon, Jose P. Henson, and Manuel Urquico.Felix Joven. Pampanga Sugar Development Co. Inc (Pasudeco). Sugar News XXXII (1956) At that time, foreign capital financed the construction of new centrals, and the conservative Pampanga planters considered it risky to mortgage their lands to the Philippine National Bank in order to finance the mill. Biting the bullet, the Pampanga Sugar Development Company (PASUDECO) was incorporated in April 1918 and began its first full milling operations in 1922.Larkin.(1993a) pp. 287-288 However, \\"on the first milling season in 1920 the planters paid up not only their crop loan but their original debt to the Bank.\\"Letter from PNB President Rafael Corpus, Manila, to Manuel Quezon, Manila, March 30, 1926, QP Continuing the struggle for independence Since 1902, the Partido Federalista, a party supported by the American insular government, dominated provincial and local elections.

Ilustrado Politics: Filipino elite responses to American rule, 1898-1908. Ateneo de Manila University Press, Quezon City, Philippines: 1989, pp. 170-171. The pro- independence nationalist front was however splintered into many factions exhibiting various shades of independence and nationalism - from the most urgent, Urgentistas, to the most immediate, Imediatista. Even the Federalistas changed their name to Partido Nacional Progresista, the Progresistas, to give them a nationalistic flavor.Corpuz. Onofre D. The Roots of the Filipino Nation, Vol. II Aklahi Foundation, Inc. Quezon City, Philippines: 1989, p. 550. The pro-independence nationalist front had to unite in order to win a decisive victory for the coming First Philippine Assembly elections in 1907. By 1906, the various groups were reduced to two main proponents: the Partido Union Nacionalista of Rafael Palma and Felipe Agoncillo and the Partido Independista Imediatista of Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a.Corpus. Liongson was a member of the Imediatista negotiating team and his friend of the Filipino Colony days in Spain, Galicano Apacible, was a member of the other party's team.Cullinane. (1989) p. 404.

Independence politics In 1914, the United States invited the Philippines to participate in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915) in San Francisco and the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego to be held in the same year. These events were considered battlegrounds between the retentionist's and the pro-independence factions in the politics for Philippine independence.Kramer, Paul Alexander. The blood of government: race, empire, the United States, and the Philippines. USA. University of North Carolina Press: 2006, pp. 352-382. Infamous Philippine Tribal Tree House at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The struggle for Philippine independence had its supporters and detractors in the United States. Historically, the Democratic Party supported independence while the Republican Party opposed it and favored retention. The Republicans would paint the image of the Philippines as uncivilized, backward and unprepared for self-rule, while the Democrats thought otherwise and implemented measures to effect the rapid transition to self-rule and independence. The perception of the Philippines by the American people was therefore critical in soliciting support for either side. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 in St. Louis, Missouri showcased a reservation filled with Philippine minority tribes. The Philippine exhibit was very successful and popular but projected a grossly wrong impression that the country was a nation of primitive savages. The perception that Filipinos lived in trees remained in the American memory for generations. The task of changing and improving the Philippine's image was placed on the country's organizing board of the Panama-Pacific and Panama- California events. This board was composed of Leon Maria Guerrero, president; William W. Barclay, director general and Francisco Liongson.U.S. Philippine Commission.

Both Guerrero and Barclay were involved in the past St. Louis event while Liongson provided fresh inputs to the new undertaking. After the event, Governor-General of the Philippines F. B. Harrison reported, \\"The result of their efforts was a complete success and has been gratifying to the people of the Philippines and their friends. For the first time the Philippine Islands were presented to the outside world by an exhibition of the education and accomplishments of the 8,000,000 civilized inhabitants of the islands, instead of an exhibit of the 1,000,000 or less partly civilized inhabitants of the mountains and more remote regions, as has been the case in exhibitions, pictures, and lectures upon so many occasions in the recent past.\\"U.S. Philippine Commission.

Not being a lawyer, he unexpectedly intervened in debates that ventilated legal issues such as the Bill on Partnership and the Bill on Conditional Liberty for Prisoners. In the midst of monumental parliamentary controversies, Liongson demonstrated a profound knowledge and understanding of both medical and juridical sciences.Guevarra. In these debates, he was able to move members of the Senate to vote his way on the merits of his principled arguments. He, however, failed to convince his party mates when the Divorce Bill was deliberated on. Acting on his conscience and on the overwhelming sentiment of his constituents, Liongson opposed his own majority party's sponsored bill and gained the public's admiration when he openly declared that he would prefer death to the passage of the law that would destroy the base of the Filipino family.Quirino, Carlos.

In all the fields of human endeavor, Senator Liongson displayed a special interest and dedicated his intelligence in the development of those sciences that are advantageous for the Philippines. His public and private lives are now the most eloquent testimonies of the ideal he pursued whilst alive: to dedicate all his energy and activities for the service of his fatherland. When I think of the Senator of the Third District during the time he was occupying his seat ‚Äì now veiled with crepes of mourning ‚Äì in this august Senate, he seated beside me and was the most committed supporter of certain issues I sucitated in the parliamentary debates. I, like the whole Archipelago, cannot help but lament at his loss. His death assumes the total sorrowful meaning of a national loss. And I say national loss, because his dynamism, his vigor and his patriotism channeled to serve the country in these historical moments will be of great and undisputed value; will be positive contributions in the task of nation building whose completion we anxiously hope for.Guevarra. \\\\- Sen.

Shumate's main influences were Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, Curly Fox, and his uncle who played the fiddle while he was growing up. Shumate joined the band after Bill Monroe heard him playing on the radio station WHKY from downtown Hickory, North Carolina, and asked him to join the Blue Grass Boys. Howdy Forrester, who was Bill Monroe's fiddle player at the time, gave his notice and was going into the Navy. At age 20, Shumate became the fiddler for the Blue Grass Boys, and he sang bass on gospel songs. During this time, the Blue Grass Boys were also a baseball team, so they would arrive early to towns they were playing at and challenge the local baseball team. Unfortunately, there were no recordings made while Shumate was in the Blue Grass Boys. During a visit to Nashville, Shumate met Earl Scruggs, who he knew because they were both from Hickory, North Carolina, and encouraged Scruggs to audition for Bill Monroe. During the time that Scruggs auditioned for Monroe, the band members were Jim Shumate, Lester Flatt, Sally Ann Forrester, Jim Andrews. By the next week, Howdy Forrester had returned from the Navy. He came back to play fiddle for the Blue Grass Boys and Jim Shumate left to work in the furniture business in North Carolina. Although Shumate convinced Earl Scruggs to audition for Monroe's band, he did not end up playing when Scruggs joined. In 1948, the band members of the Blue Grass Boys changed again. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs started their own band, The Foggy Mountain Boys, with Cedric Rainwater and Jim Eanes. Soon after, Jim Shumate joined them and played the fiddle on their first recording session. That same year, he competed against some of the best fiddlers in the United States and won the National Fiddler's Convention in Richlands, Virginia. He was known for his innovative, bluesy fiddle style and his mastery of syncopation and speed. In 1995, Jim Shumate received a North Carolina Folk Heritage Award. He performed as a solo artist, composed sacred songs, and also played with his band, Sons of the Carolinas. In his final years, Jim had been battling kidney failure and dementia. On October 7, 2013 he became very ill. The next day, he took a serious fall and was taken to the hospital. He was later transferred to Catawba Regional Hospice near his home in Hickory, North Carolina where he died at the age of 91.

He was born into an Ilustrado family from Pampanga, Philippines at the turn of the 20th century and raised with the revolutionary values of an emerging Philippine identity which held freedom, justice, honor, patriotism and piety sacred. He witnessed the rapid changes that transformed the Philippines from a repressed society cloistered in a Spanish convent for over 300 years into modern, hedonistic consumers of American Hollywood glamor for 50 years. This period of transition brought instabilities to core family values as the generation gaps wreaked havoc on the social, political, economic and political foundations of a young nation. It was a period of experimentation where the natives began to grapple a new democratic way of life and self-rule; where sacred paternalistic relationships were giving way to egalitarian modes; where traditional gender and familial roles were questioned, and where a new foreign language and the need for a national alternative were alienating the nation from understanding the aspirations of its elders. Liongson, in his unique, inimitable literary style captured snap shots of these struggles with anachronism in plays and articles written in the language that he mastered and loved best, Spanish. His works have since become precious gems of Philippine literature in Spanish and historic records of the Filipino psyche and social life between 1896 and 1950.

His trip to the United States was delayed by the latter's entry into the First World War. His extended three-year sojourn in Spain provided the opportunity to absorb the language, culture and literary arts of the Iberian peninsula. The literary works of Spaniard Miguel de Cervantes, particularly the early 17th century novel Don Quixote, would soon prove to be a propitious influence in the young man's future. He traveled to the United States before returning to the Philippines in 1919Francisco Liongson Alonso Search Results-FamilySearch.org, retrieved on 10 October 2011 not knowing of his father's untimely death. Upon his arrival in Manila, the shocking, unexpected news of his father's demise caused the first epileptic seizure that will continue to debilitate him for the rest of his life. Restrained from pursuing an active professional practice, he engaged in a more leisurely lifestyle administering a sugar fortune that he inherited at a young age. He married his first cousin, Do√±a Julita Eulalia Ocampo, who would become his indispensable partner in life and particularly in his contributions to Philippine literature in Spanish. Circulo Escenico Don Paco was one of the founders and first president of the Circulo Escenico, a Spanish dramatic club of aficionados founded in Bacolor, Pampanga that rose to national prominence and became the longest surviving organization of its kind in the Philippines. Circulo Escenico (circa 1930): Debut performance of La Indiana at the Manila Opera House. The club traces its origins to a fund-raising event to build a school organized by the town's parish priest, Fr. Pedro P. Santos. The activity involved a dramatic presentation of an all-male cast, one act literary-musical zarzuela entitled, Morirse a Tiempo, by members of the community. The event was such a great success that the enthusiasm and interest generated within the town and throughout the province demanded another presentation of a grander scale. Indiana, the next presentation of the community involving characters of both genders, was packed to the rafters prompting the group of performers to form an association of aficionados of the theatrical arts soon after. The goals of the proposed club were 'to promote and maintain the conservation of the Spanish language and to develop talents and aptitude for the stage; allocating time for recreation and solace for the spirit as well as art and enthusiasm among a public tired of cinema's vulgarity.' The by-laws were approved with the first board of directors elected in August, 1922.Liongson, Francisco A. Historia Compendiada del Circulo Escenico Program Notes, Circulo Escenico presenta ¬øColaborador? San Beda College Auditorium. Manila. March 7, 1948. pp. 6-9. Circulo Escenico was officially inaugurated on January 6, 1923 in Teatro Sabina Bacolor, Pampanga with a grand gala presentation of a comedy in two acts, Jarabe de Pico and a one act zarzuela, Doloretes, launching its artistic and charitable endeavor, and its pro-Hispanic cultural mission. Basking in the subsequent successes and positive commentaries from the Manila press, the club ventured to premiere Nobel Prize in Literature Winner Jacinto Benavente's comedy in two acts Los Intereses Creados and a one-act zarzuela, La Cancion de Olvido , in the capital in June, 1929. The performances were received with much acclaim and admiration by the appreciative Manila public that the Circulo decided to make the capital its new home.Liongson. Except for the period of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the club sustained annual performances for thirty-one years until 1955 when it quietly exited the stage. In 1977, Dr. Mariano M. Alimurung resurrected the Circulo featuring mainly Don Paco's original works until 1980 when he met an untimely death. The Circulo was headed by able presidents through the years. They included Francisco A. Liongson (1923, 1950) Ignacio P.

It dwells on how the household is neglected when the wife insists in practising a career. Mi Mujer es Candidata is a comedy in one act, first staged on December 30, 1932. It was written when women first ran as candidates for public office in a general election. It discouraged women from getting involved in politics especially if they were married. ¬øEs Usted Anti o Pro? is a comedy in one act, first staged on October 26, 1933. The title was inspired by the debates that led to the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act. The people was then divided into two factions: those in favor were called Pros, and those who were against were called Antis. 4-3-4-3-4 is a comedy in one act, first staged on February 12, 1935. It depicts the joy of two sweethearts for having won the sweepstakes first prize with ticket number 43434. The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes became a national indulgence in the quest for instant wealth. The Tagalog translation of the same title was written by Epifanio Matute.Dramatic Philippines.

Viva La Pepa is a comedy in three acts, first staged on October 12, 1935. It was based on the campaign supporting economic protectionism for which an association called Proteccionismo Economico, Practico y Activo was organized and simply called PEPA. The play is a parody of the National Economic Protectionism Association (NEPA) which was founded in 1934 to hasten industrial development in preparation for independence contained in the Tydings‚ÄìMcduffie Act. Dramatic Philippines (circa 1954): performance of Ang Kahapong Nagbalik at the Manila Opera House. El Pasado Que Vuelve is a drama in one prologue, three acts and one epilogue, first staged on June 19, 1937. The play portrays the last years of the Spanish regime during the Philippine Revolution. It highlighted the good customs and virtues the country possessed in politics, society, morality, religion and love then, compared to the degeneration and corruption of contemporary values. Considered as Don Paquito's best work, the masterpiece was inspired by Jos√© Rizal's Noli Me T√°ngere and El filibusterismo. This play was the most repeatedly staged and had been translated into Tagalog and English. The Tagalog translation, Ang Kahapong Nagbalik, was written by Senator Francisco (Soc) Rodrigo during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.Esteves, A. Francisco Liongson.

Manila: March 2, 1957 Juan de la Cruz is a drama in three acts, first staged on March 12, 1938 to celebrate the anniversary of the Philippine Commonwealth. The play deals with the tragedies that befall men when greed, power and lust disrupts the harmony in the home and the community at large. It features social unrest in the home and the barrio instigated by power brokers for political advantage and selfish interests. In Philippine imagery, Juan dela Cruz symbolizes the good, noble and honest Juan who has to carry the cross of adversity and suffering in life as a human being. Las Joyas de Simoun is a drama in three acts, first staged on June 19, 1940. Act 2710 of 1917 allowed divorce in the Philippines for the first time in its history. Since then, a popular clamor to repeal it persisted. In touch with the sentiments of the times, the play portrayed a wise and fearless attack against divorce. The title is an allusion to Jos√© Rizal's character in El filibusterismo, Simoun, who uses his jewels and wealth to corrupt and destabilize society. The Tagalog translation, Ang Mga Hiyas ni Simoun, was written by Primo Arambulo in 1940.Arambulo, Primo. Ang Mga Hiyas ni Simoun. Manila: 1940. ¬øColaborador? is a tragic-comedy farce in one prologue and three acts, first staged on March 7, 1948 on the Silver Anniversary celebration of Circulo Escenico. It was inspired by the pains and worries of every Filipino of being accused a Japanese collaborator during the Second Philippine Republic. Parity is a comedy in one act, first staged on March 6, 1949. The play did not concern the 1947 Parity Rights plebiscite in the Philippines, a major controversy in everyone's mind at the time. It involved the parity and equality of rights between men and women which was an equally burning issue. Don Paco was honored with the distinction of membership in the La Academia Filipina de la Lengua Espa√±ola (Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language) on November 7, 1947 in recognition for his literary works.Castrillo Brillantes, Lourdes. 81 Years of Premio Zobel: A Legacy of Philippine Literature in Spanish.

Hispanic Twilight The most prolific period of Spanish literature was during the American period in the History of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946). Don Paco was among the well-known playwrights of the period, which included Claro M. Recto, Antonio Abad, Jes√∫s Balmori, Pascual H. Poblete, Nicasio Osme√±a and Benigno del Rio.Manuud, Antonio. Brown Heritage: Essays on Philippine Cultural Tradition and Literature. Quezon City : Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1967. p. 512 However, the legitimate stage couldn‚Äôt compete with movies for patronage and English was becoming a more dominant language. The introduction of English in the public school system in 1900 marked the death knell of Spanish in the Philippines.Abad, Antonio. \\"Circulo Escenico, Baluarte del Espa√±ol en Filipinas\\". Voz de Manila. 28 Junio 1950. pp. 2-5 Within thirty years, the ominous signs were beginning to show. Circulo Escenico faced increasing difficulty in sourcing young actors and actresses. The regular performers were getting older and newer elements were not easy to come by. By the time the Third Philippine Republic was inaugurated in 1946, the patronage of the Spanish theater dramatically dwindled except for a few familiar old faces, who faithfully watched the Circulo's productions every year.Abad. Measures were introduced to stem the tide of the Spanish demise as early as 1947 when Republic Act 343 or the Sotto Law was enacted. Unfortunately, the law made the teaching of Spanish only optional.Rodao, Florentino. Spanish Language in the Philippines: 1900-1940. p. 105 www.florentinorodao.com/scholarly/sch97a.pdf . Retrieved on 6 January 2012. Circulo Escenico was in the forefront in the campaigns to make Spanish obligatory. The First Congreso de Hispanistas de Filipinas was held in 1950 to rally support for the language. Representing Circulo Escenico, Don Paco delivered his impassioned speech tracing Spain's legacy in the Philippines and underscoring the role of the Congress to awaken the country from its lethargy and to reaffirm its historic heritage and place in the Hispanic community of nations.Congreso de Hispanistas de Filipinas.Diario de sessiones del primer Congreso de Hispanistas de Filipinas. - Manila : Cacho Hermanos, 1950 By May 1952, the Magalona Law or Republic Act 709 made Spanish compulsory in all universities and private schools for two consecutive years.Rodao. In March 1953, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Relations Martin Artajo and his entourage arrived in the Philippines to grace the Second Congreso de Hispanistas.Del Rio, Benigno. Alfilarazos. Voz de Manila. 11 March 1953. p.7 In honor of the visiting dignitaries, the Executive Committee of the Congress scheduled a theatrical performance authored by a Filipino. At the recommendation of Academician Benigno del Rio, Circulo Escenico was commissioned to present El Pasado Que Vuelve for the occasion. Minister Artajo and his entourage failed to attend the performance. Not even the director of the local Instituto de Cultura Hispanica showed up. To onlookers, the apparent snub focused on the absurdity of Filipinos hankering for Spanish culture when even Spanish officials cared so little about it. Del Rio lamented the fact that the Spanish dignitaries missed what could have been the last presentation of a Spanish theatrical play in the land.Del Rio. He proved prophetic when the growing disinterest for Spanish continued unabated, and Circulo Escenico quietly left the stage two years later. In the last days of the Circulo, Don Paco was relentless in the struggle to keep Spanish alive. In what could have been his valedictory, he said ... Those immortal words of the great Benavente in his play, 'Intereses Creados', aptly applies to the members of this Circulo: ‚ÄòThat it is not all farce in the farce; because there is something divine in our lives that is real and eternal, and it does not end when the farce is over.‚Äô Circulo Escenico may you age, neither by your years nor by your labor because they make you old and staunch your energies, but by the lack of Hispanic elements that time is claiming at its passage, whose breath and spirit are your life. Continue with your sublime and beautiful mission and always raise the curtains when you can, even if in the final act only two hands are left to applaud you and one heart that beats with yours, and like you, weeps at the somber sunset of a culture and the lingering agony of certain death of a rich and sonorous language which you continue to use with fervor under these skies whether on or off stage. Continue pushing the old and broken Thespian cart with your arms, even in its passing you see only fields of solitude and withering wastelands of a worn and near dead Hispanism. You belong to the Quixotic race, and like Quixote you will die fighting til the end. Lady or Gentleman Circulista, may you continue riding the exhausted Rocinante of your ideals through the Philippine fields of Montiel; continue on your quest even if you need to fight like a Hidalgo, not with windmills, but with mills of steel that will leave you bloodied if not dead; because with your courage, tenacity and death, you would have demonstrated: that not by bread alone does man live; but by ideals; even if those ideals are found hidden behind the farcical cart, which sometimes laughs and sometimes cries for the solace and amusement of your public.Liongson, Francisco. Continua tu camino. Voz de Manila 31 March 1955 p. 4 Tributes The Hispano-Filipino theater lives and Liongson is one of its most solid pillars. Liongson is part of a planetary system in which stars shine brilliantly in no despicable magnitude. Some have already departed; others live if at all in slumber. But of those who live, the genuine militant goldsmith and forger who is pounding constantly on the anvil in proper timing is without doubt, Francisco Liongson. The theatrical production of Liongson, which covers the most varied themes as much as its quality and its dimensions, inspires respect and faith in the most non-believer with regard to the depth of the Spanish theater in the Philippines.Briones, Manuel C.

And for the future survival of the Spanish language, Sr. Liongson has come to swell the ranks, each time more evident, of those who here cultivate it.Telar, Segundo. Las Joyas de Simoun.

Full play here. The Court of Duke Frederick =Duke Frederick= Duke Frederick is the younger brother of Duke Senior and the father of Celia. Prior to the play he usurps power from his older brother. His hatefulness and paranoia are displayed when he banishes Rosalind, the daughter Duke Senior. However, at the end of the play, as Duke Frederick brings his army towards the forest to kill his brother, he happens upon an old priest who convinces him to take up the monastic life of peace and simplicity. =Celia= Celia is the daughter of Duke Frederick. She has been portrayed as a foil to her cousin, Rosalind. She displays qualities of the head and heart similar to her cousin. Rosalind and Celia are intimate friends who have been bred and brought up together. It is the love for Rosalind that makes Celia choose a life of voluntary exile. In fact, Celia effects her own individuality so that her cousin may shine brilliantly all the more. 'Celia' literally means 'heavenly' and she is really divine. She may be called the 'moral heroine' of the play as Rosalind is its 'intellectual heroine'. =Touchstone= Touchstone =Le Beau= Le Beau is a courtier in the Court of Duke Frederick; he commands the court. =Charles= Charles is the court-wrestler, who appears in the first Act of the play. He is a source of some preliminary information regarding the two Dukes and their two daughters. Orlando fights against him in the wrestling match. It is his defeat which makes Orlando a hero enabling him to win the heart of Rosalind. He is also the means to convey Oliver's villainy and serves as a foil to Orlando. The Exiled Court of Duke Senior in the Forest of Arden =Duke Senior= Duke Senior is the elder brother of Duke Frederick. He has been banished by his younger brother. He, along with his faithful follower, lives in the Forest of Arden and fleets his time careless as they did in the Golden World. His daughter Rosalind is kept at the court by Duke Frederick to company Celia. Duke Senior appears as a contented man who rarely feels adversity. At the end of the play he is restored with the kingdom by Duke Frederick. The father of Rosalind and the rightful ruler of the dukedom in which the play is set. Having been banished by his usurping brother, Frederick, Duke Senior now lives in exile in the Forest of Arden with a number of loyal men, including Lord Amiens and Jaques. We have the sense that Senior did not put up much of a fight to keep his dukedom, for he seems to make the most of whatever life gives him. Content in the forest, where he claims to learn as much from stones and brooks as he would in a church or library, Duke Senior proves himself to be a kind and fair-minded ruler. =Rosalind= The daughter of Duke Senior. Rosalind, considered one of Shakespeare's most delightful heroines, is independent-minded, strong-willed, good-hearted, and terribly clever. Rather than slink off into defeated exile, Rosalind resourcefully uses her trip to the Forest of Ardenne as an opportunity to take control of her own destiny. When she disguises herself as Ganymede‚Äîa handsome young man‚Äîand offers herself as a tutor in the ways of love to her beloved Orlando, Rosalind's talents and charms are on full display. Only Rosalind, for instance, is both aware of the foolishness of romantic love and delighted to be in love. She teaches those around her to think, feel, and love better than they have previously, and she ensures that the courtiers returning from Ardenne are far gentler than those who fled to it. =Jaques= Jaques is one of the followers of Duke Senior. He acts like a cynic throughout the play. He is always in a melancholic mood, earning him the title of Melancholy Jaques and constantly criticizes the Duke and other characters. Also, he does not like the world of court and always criticizes it. He is a lead, and says two of Shakespeare's most common monologues. =Amiens= Amiens is one of the lords attending on Duke Senior in the forest of Arden. He agrees with the Duke when the latter says \\"sweet are the uses of adversity\\". He is not prepared to exchange his life in the forest with the comfortable life at the court. He is deeply attached to Duke Senior and, therefore, has willingly accompanied him to the forest of Arden. Amiens does not, in any way, contribute to the action of the play. He does however sing two songs that allude to and perhaps clarify the plot. The Household of the deceased Sir Rowland de Boys =Oliver de Boys= Oliver is the eldest son of Sir Rowland de Boys and the heir to his father's estates. In the beginning of the play he appears as a usurper like Duke Frederick. He ill-treats his younger brother Orlando, denies him good upbringing and education. He acts like a villain and even tries to kill Orlando by instigating the wrestler, Charles. By the end of the play he gets reformed and falls in love with Celia - which contributes to the happy ending of the play. =Jacques de Boys= He is the second son of Sir Rowland de Boys and the brother of Oliver and Orlando. He only appears at the end of the play when he brings the news of Duke Frederick's reformation. =Orlando de Boys= =Adam= Adam is the old faithful servant of the family of Sir Rowland de Boys, who spent four-score years in the family with unflinching devotion to his master. His loyalty to the old master is evidenced by the touching reference to the dead master when Oliver calls him an old dog. He loves Orlando, because he is the image and 'memory of old Sir Rowland'. He places all the savings of his thrifty life and faces all unknown perils to save the life of the young master from the clutches of the cruel brother. Thus Adam has the 'soul of a servant to him'. =Dennis= He is a servant in the household of Oliver de Boys. Country folk in the Forest of Arden =Phoebe= A shepherdess =Silvius= Silvius is a young shepherd who represents the romantic lover. He is madly in love with Phoebe, a rural girl who does not return his love. Throughout the play, Silvius behaves like a love-sick youth, pining away for Phoebe. He commits many follies and performs many ridiculous actions; even threatening to commit suicide if his love is not returned. Silvius is a typical dejected lover who has no self-respect. Phoebe treats him in an indifferent manner and exploits him to acquire the love of Ganymede whom she loves. She constantly rebukes and insults Silvius, yet he longs for her love. Rosalind feels sympathy for him and scolds him for having become a 'tame snake' because of his passion for Phoebe. Finally, he marries Phoebe with the clever manipulation of Rosalind. =Audrey= Audrey is a homely, ugly and ignorant shepherd girl. Touchstone introduces her to the Duke as 'a poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own'. She is attracted by the courtly manners and wit of Touchstone and Touchstone probably discovers in her rich honesty. Touchstone falls in love with Audrey. Their love is a parody of the romantic love of the hero and the heroine of the play. =Corin= Corin is an old shepherd that, despite being in love during his youth, has outgrown his folly and attained worldly wisdom. He feels deeply for the enamored Silvius and tries to console him. He is a simple-hearted shepherd who eats what he earns, envies no man's happiness, and is content with his lot. Touchstone calls him a 'natural philosopher'. Corin is an innocent rustic with a good deal of humanity in him. While thinking straightforwardly he never has any inhibitions to proclaim what is on his mind. For Corin, cause and effect exist in a vacuum without any further complexity or need for explanation. Life is seen from a simplistic point of view that renders him much easier to be happy. Corin's simple way of looking at life and things around him make him an intellectually esteemed member of the play who frequently critiques the complexities of the court. =William= William is a country lad - humble and silly. He comes to profess his love for Audrey but during his conversation with Touchstone, he does not show the depth of his feelings. He appears to be a coward. When he is threatened that he would be beaten and killed if he does not give up Audrey, he does not challenge Touchstone, his rival in love. Audrey's silence and her request that William should go away shows that the love between William and Audrey is superficial. =Sir Oliver Martext= Sir Oliver Martext is a vicar who is called to perform the marriage of Touchstone and Audrey.

It is celebrated in the Indian states of Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and in Nepal. It is also known as Sabitri Uwaans in Western Odisha region. Married Hindu women whose husbands are alive observe it as a vow with great dedication and pray for their husband to have a long life. The word reflects the origin and significance of the Vat-Savitri puja. The fast is dedicated to Savitri, who saved her husband Satyavan from being taken by the death god. The same festival is observed on Vat Purnima, the full moon of Jyestha in other regions including Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka. Legend behind the festival The vrata was named after Savitri, the beautiful daughter of King Aswapati of Madra Desa. She selected Satyavan, a prince in exile who was living in the forest with his blind father Dyumatsen, as her life partner. She left the palace and lived with her husband and the in-laws in the forest. As a devoted wife and daughter-in-law, she went to great lengths to take care of them. One day while cutting wood in the jungle, Satyavan's head reeled and he fell down from a tree. Then Yama, the death God, appeared to take away Satyavan's soul. Deeply hurt, Savitri pleaded to Yamraj not to be separated from her husband. If anything, he would take away the soul of her husband and she would also follow. Yamraj, moved by the devotion of Savitri, returned the life of her husband. Soon Satyavan regained his lost kingdom. Customs and rituals All Hindu women observe this festival by worshiping and propitiating Savitri as a Devi. In the early morning, women take purifying baths, wear new clothes and bangles, and apply vermilion to their foreheads. Nine types of fruits and nine types of flowers are offered to the Goddess. Wet pulses, rice, mangos, jackfruits, palm fruits, kendu, bananas and several other fruits are offered as Bhoga (offering) and observe the festival with Savitri brata katha. After fasting for the whole day, the fasting is over and the women have the Bhogal. In the afternoon, when formalities of worship are over, they bow to their husbands and elderly people.

It studies sign processes in culture, which relate to other living beings, communities, and landscapes.Farina, Almo; Santolini, Riccardo; Pagliaro, Giacomo; Scozzafava, Silvia; Schipani, Ileana 2005. Ecosemiotics: A new field of competence for ecology to overcome the frontier between environmental complexity and human culture in the Mediterranean. Israel Journal of Plant Sciences 53(3/4): 167‚Äì175. Ecosemiotics also deals with sign-mediated aspects of ecosystems. Nielsen, S√∏ren Nors 2007. Towards an ecosystem semiotics: Some basic aspects for a new research programme. Ecological Complexity 4(3): 93‚Äì101. For ecosemiotics, environment has semiotic quality in different ways and levels. Material environment has affordances and potentials to participate in sign relations. Animal species attribute meanings to the environment based on their needs and umwelts. In human culture, environment can become meaningful in literary and artistic representations or through symbolization of animals or landscapes. Cultural representations of the environment in turn influence the natural environment through human actions. Ecosemiotics analyzes processes, transmissions and problems that occur in and between the different semiotic layers of the environment. The central focus of ecosemiotics concerns the role of concepts (sign-based models people have) in designing and changing the environment. Concepts of ecosemiotic analysis are, for instance, semiocide, affordance, ecofield, consortium, dissent. The field was initiated by Winfried N√∂th and Kalevi Kull, and later elaborated by Almo Farina and Timo Maran.*Maran, Timo 2007.

Written by Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville and published in 1805, it was the first story of modern speculative fiction to depict the end of the world. Considered a seminal early work of science fantasy, specifically of the Dying Earth genre, it has been described by Gary K. Wolfe as \\"A crucial document in the early history... of what became science fiction\\". Le Dernier Homme was translated into English in 1806 ‚Äì poorly, and neither credited to de Grainville nor described as a translation from a French original ‚Äì under the title Omegarus and Syderia, a Romance in Futurity. This translation remained the only English version available until 2003, when a new translation by I. F. Clarke and Margaret Clarke was published. Creation and publication De Grainville was inspired by Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. Where Milton's work featured the first couple, Adam and Eve, de Grainville writes of the last couple ‚Äì Omegarus and Syderia. Influences from the Biblical Book of Revelation are also seen in the concept that the earth has a predestined day of ending. The influence of Malthusian ideas is also seen, as de Grainville writes at one point of an earth out of balance, population outstripping resources. The work was published in 1805 due to the advocacy of the French literary figure Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, who persuaded the Paris publisher Deterville to offer the book. By the time the book was published, de Grainville was dead, a suicide in February of that year.* The first publication failed to attract any critical notice or sales, but was championed by Herbert Croft, who published a second edition in two volumes, in 1811. This second edition did garner the attention of critics, who praised it. Plot The story is told by a spirit to a young man who comes upon its cave while traveling in Syria. The protagonist, Omegarus, is the son of the King of Europe and the last child born there in a far future in which the earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is fading. He sees a vision of Syderia, the last fertile woman. She lives in Brazil, so he travels there in an airship. After various adventures there, including meeting Ormus, the Spirit of Earth, who urges the two to begin a rebirth of the human race, Omegarus returns to Europe with Syderia by his side. There they meet Adam, the first man, who has been condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter Hell, and who is now charged with persuading Omegarus and Syderia not to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end. He succeeds in having Omegarus leave Syderia, who then dies. Ormus, who cannot survive without humanity, despairs, and the world begins to end and the graves of all the dead to open, initiating the eventual Rapture and the events described in the Book of Revelation. Works inspired Le Dernier Homme inspired three other works. *Le Dernier Homme, po√®me imit√© de Grainville (The Last Man, a Poem Inspired by Grainville) is an 1832 work by Auguste Creuz√© de Lesser, which expands on Grainville's original, describing aerial cities and a failed attempt at leaving Earth to colonize another planet. *L‚ÄôUnit√©ide ou la Femme messie (The Unit√©ide, or the Female Messiah), a mammoth and epic philosophical poem by Etienne-Paulin Gagne published in 1858, sees the return of the character of Omegarus (under the name Omegar). In the work (set in the year 2000), God sends a female messiah to save the world. *Om√©gar ou le Dernier Homme (Omegare, or the Last Man), published the following year by Gagne's wife √âlise Gagne, is another poetic epic about the final days of the Earth. The work known as Omegarus and Syderia did circulate somewhat in London, and several contemporary reviewers noticed resemblances between it and subsequent eschatological works: Byron's \\"Darkness\\" (1816) and Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826).

Route description NC 66 begins at exit 63 of Interstate 74 (I-74) in Horneytown. From there, the highway continues north and meets I-40 at exit 203. After NC 66 crosses over US 421 and I-40 Business it forms a concurrency with NC 150 in Kernersville. NC 66 continues northwest towards Rural Hall. Once NC 66 reaches Rural Hall, it runs parallel to US 52 until King. South of King NC 66 heads north towards Gap. The highway then runs through the mountains of curvy roads until reaching its northern terminus at a Y-intersection with NC 89. History The first NC 66 was an original state highway. It began at NC 60 and NC 65 the current intersection of 4th Street and Cherry Street in Winston-Salem. NC 66 then headed north along today's University Parkway to Stanleyville. From there, NC 66 continues up to Pilot Mountain. In late 1921, NC 66 was extended to NC 89, in Westfield. In 1922, NC 66 was rerouted to Mount Airy. Then NC 66 went north to the Virginia state line. In 1923, NC 66 was rerouted to go from Mount Airy to Virginia State Route 15 at the state line. In 1925, NC 66 was rerouted to follow Patterson Avenue into Winston-Salem. From there, NC 66 replaced NC 64 to Lexington. In 1926, US 121 was assigned the entire routing of NC 66. In 1934, US 52 replaced both US 121 and NC 66 in entirety. The current NC 66 was designated in late 1934 as a renumbering of NC 661\\\\. It went from US 52 (old NC 66) in Rural Hall to NC 89 to the north. In 1936, NC 66 was routed along US 52 to Stanleyville. Then NC 66 was extended to US 421 (current Old Greensboro Road) along new routing. Between 1947 and 1949, NC 66 was routed south of Walkertown. In 1955, NC 66 was extended along US 421 to Kernersville and then on new primary routing to US 311. =North Carolina Highway 64= North Carolina Highway 64 (NC 64) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 10, in Lexington, north to NC 60/NC 77 (Waughtown Street), in Winston- Salem. In 1925, NC 64 was renumbered as an extension of NC 66\\\\. In 1932, NC 64 reappeared as a mostly new primary routing; except around Coleridge, where it replaced part of NC 902\\\\. It traversed from US 421/NC 60 (Liberty Road), in Greensboro, going southeast through Climax, Franklinville, Ramseur, Coleridge and Bennett, to NC 74 (today NC 24/NC 27), west of Carthage. In late 1934, NC 64 was renumbered as NC 22\\\\. =North Carolina Highway 661= North Carolina Highway 661 (NC 661) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 66, in King, to NC 89, in Moores Springs. In 1923, NC 661 was extended northwest along NC 89 to Francisco, then replaced NC 893 to the Virginia state line. In 1924, NC 661 was rerouted at Gap to NC 89 west of Francisco then east along NC 89 to Francisco before continuing to the state line, leaving behind Moore Springs Road (SR 1001). In 1926, NC 661 was rerouted on both ends: south-end to NC 66, in Rural Hall, and north-end being truncated at NC 89, in the Johnstown community; its old segment northeast of NC 89 became a secondary road, later becoming part of NC 704\\\\.
