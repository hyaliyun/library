It was built in stages during the Middle Ages. The oldest part is the nave and the base of the tower, while the most recently constructed part is the large chancel. A large renovation was carried out in the 1960s. Garde Church together with its cemetery and its four lychgates constitute one of the most well-preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden. The church is built of limestone and whitewashed. Three of its portals are of a simple, Romanesque design, typical for the oldest churches on Gotland. The fourth portal, leading to the chancel, is Gothic in style. The church contains wall paintings from 1200 in Russo-Byzantine style, unique in Sweden. Some of its furnishings, such as the baptismal font and the triumphal cross also date from the same, while the altarpiece is from the 17th century. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. Location and surroundings Garde Church and its cemetery forms one of the most well- preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden. It is located around north of the main road between Ljugarn and Lye on eastern Gotland. The area is considered a cultural heritage environment of national interest. The church lies in the centre of the cemetery, which is surrounded by a low wall. The wall has been repaired several times throughout the centuries but never substantially changed since it was built. It is between and high and has four original lychgates. The western lychgate is the main entrance and one of the largest medieval lychgates in Sweden, probably constructed in the first half of the 13th century. It is built in three storeys of tufted limestone and whitewashed, except for the corners and the portal. The lychgate originally had two gates, and the covered space between them is equipped with two niches with seats. The two storeys above were used as a granary, originally for storing the church tithe, until 1917. The top floor of the lychgate was also used as a magazine for the church. The southern and northern lychgates are practically identical, as is the eastern, though it is smaller than the other gates. They are all made of whitewashed tufted limestone with the exception of corners and skirtings which are made of carefully hewn limestone. Inside they have niches with seats. They date from the 14th century. There is also a lychgate that leads to the vicarage, located just northeast of the church, from the road. It is also from the 14th century, and the only one of its kind left on Gotland. A mason's mark in five places on the northern lychgate is identical to mason's marks found in Martebo Church and St√•nga Church. Several graves from the Viking Age, belonging to Christians, have been found in the cemetery, containing fragments of clothing. Before 1739, the layout of the cemetery was such that the richest people were buried closet to the church to the south and east, and poorer people to the west of the church. North of the church was the burial place for criminals.

These were found during an excavation in 1968. It is known that several other churches on Gotland were preceded by wooden churches. It is also possible that the roof trusses of the church came from an earlier wooden church. Any conclusive evidence of an earlier wooden church is however lacking. The presently visible stone church is regardless one of the oldest churches on Gotland. Construction possibly began around 1130. A document from the Diocese of Link√∂ping, to which Gotland belonged during the Middle Ages, contains a note about an inaugural service in the year 1200. This church would have consisted of a tower, nave, and chancel with an apse. The only surviving part of this first stone church is the nave. Characteristic for the earliest churches on Gotland is the less finely hewn stone used as building material, the lack of an articulated base or plinth, and the simple round arched entrance portals, all elements found in the nave of Garde Church. The baptismal font and triumphal cross still in the church are from the same time and were probably acquired in connection with its inauguration. The tower was raised to its current height at the middle of the 13th century. During the first half of the 14th century, the earlier chancel was replaced by the current, disproportionately large chancel and sacristy. The intention was probably to rebuild the whole church, as indicated by the provisional walls that still connect the choir and the nave. The new choir was built by a workshop known by the notname . The church was equipped with a new ceiling in the 1690s, and most of the interior covered with whitewash in 1701. Some reconstruction works were carried out in 1869, during which the last medieval stained glass windows probably disappeared. A thorough renovation was carried out in 1963‚Äì68, during which fragments of medieval wall paintings in the nave were uncovered. Another renovation was done in 2004, when the tower was repaired and the exterior repainted. Architecture =Exterior= The building material of Garde Church is limestone of grey shades, and brick, which is used exclusively in a few decorative elements in the tower facade. The church is whitewashed, except the portals, the corners of the chancel, nave and tower, and the plinths of the tower and the chancel ‚Äî these are made of more carefully hewn limestone. The church has four entrances, three of which (in the tower, and one on each side of the nave) are simple, Romanesque portals. The northern portal of the nave may originally have been the entrance to the now vanished first chancel, and moved to its current location when the church was rebuilt in the 14th century. The southern portal of the chancel is Gothic in style. The portal opening is stepped inwards with three columns on each side in the angles. The capitals are decorated with plant ornaments with faint traces of original paint. The tympanum above the portal is decorated with a sculpture of a sitting Christ with one hand resting on a book and the other raised in a gesture of blessing. The nave has six windows, of which four are medieval and of a simple, round arched design. The chancel has two large, pointed Gothic windows with tracery. These are of a type also found in V√§te, Gr√∂tlingbo and Hablingbo churches. The tower has three storeys in addition to the top floor containing the church bell. The bell was, according to an inscription upon, it made in L√ºbeck in 1608 and later re-cast in Stockholm. Before the tower has enlarged in the 13th century, there were four sound openings at a lower level. After the heightening of the tower, there are now in total twelve comparatively tall openings with pointed arches, three on each side of the tower. The combination of limestone and brick in their decoration is similar to the openings in the church towers at Lye and Burs. =Interior= The former church tabernacle, 14th century. The wooden doors are modern. The church interior is divided into three main spaces: the ground floor of the tower to the west, the nave in the middle and the chancel to the east. The tower ground floor is comparatively small and dark, and connected with the nave with a narrow but tall decorated arch. The nave has highly placed, small windows, while the larger chancel gets its light from the large Gothic windows in the eastern and southern walls. The chancel arch connecting the nave and chancel is made of finely cut limestone. The ceilings of the nave and the tower ground floor are flat, wooden ceilings, while the chancel is covered with its original vault. Above the ceiling of the nave, and under the current roof, old well-made Romanesque roof trusses are preserved. The floor of the church largely dates from the renovation in the 1960s. At that time, fragments of several picture stones were found in the original floor. Some of these have been placed next to the southern wall of the church. There are five niches in the walls of the chancel, dating from the construction period. The largest one of these is a niche with a seat in the southern wall of the chancel, the interior of which is decorated with a painting from the 14th century. The painting depicts Christ seated on a throne. On the northern wall of the choir there is a smaller niche that originally served as a tabernacle, which also contains decorations from the 14th century. The inside of the walls of the church contains a number of carvings, both runic inscriptions and depictions of ships, the latter probably from the late Middle Ages. No original stained glass remains in the church, though the chancel windows still contained medieval stained glass panes in the 1860s. Murals The entire nave was probably originally decorated with murals, but most of these have vanished. One set of murals, on the soffit of the arch connecting the nave to the ground floor of the tower, is however still very well preserved and have never been covered. These are Russo-Byzantine in style, with some influences from Gothic art discernible in the purely ornamental details.. They are recognised as being of high quality and have been called \\"the best evidence of a byzantinizing workshop on Gotland and as such are justly celebrated\\". It has been suggested that there is a relationship with fragmentary paintings in K√§llunge and Havdhem churches, but otherwise no comparable paintings exist in Sweden. They were probably made 1200. The wall paintings depict two male saints standing under arches decorated with palmettes, supported by pillars with decorated capitals. Each saint is standing upright, tending towards contrapposto, and faces the viewer, with the left hand raised in a blessing gesture and the other holding a cross. They are richly dressed in Byzantine dress. This way of representing saints is known from Russia and also from other areas (e.g. St Mark's Basilica in Venice), but always from areas under Byzantine influence. It has been suggested that they depict the saints Florus and Laurus, and the similarities with a similar depiction of these saints in the Church of Agioi Anargyroi in Kastoria, Greece, has been noted. Several efforts have been made to identify from where the stylistic influences of these murals may come, and to speculate about the origins or identity of the artist who made them. The first art historian to point out their relation to Byzantine art was Johnny Roosval in 1911. The following year, a first attempt at finding stylistic parallels in Russian art was made by Ture J. Arne, who suggested a link between the paintings at Garde and the murals in the Russian churches of Nereditsa and St. George in Staraya Ladoga. Later research has also highlighted the similarities with St. George's Church in Staraya Ladoga. The exact nature of the link between these Russian churches and the paintings at Garde remains an open question. It is known that there was a Russian church in Visby (now a ruin) and it is possible that a Russian artist went to Gotland to decorate this church, and at the same time decorated the church at Garde. It may also be that traders from Gotland brought a Russian artist to Gotland from the eastern coast of the Baltic sea. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the paintings also display possible direct influences from Greek and Sicilian art, as well as Western art, which further complicates any definitive judgment on the origins of the artist who made them. This mixture of influences has led to the hypothesis that the artist was trained in a Russo- Byzantine environment but also worked using illuminated manuscripts as pattern books. Contemporary parallels with Russian and Byzantine illuminated manuscripts have also been pointed out. Wherever the artist may have found the inspiration, it has been underlined that the church was built as a Catholic, and not as an Orthodox church; similarly to the churches of 12th-century Sicily, the artistic influences were derived from Orthodox art \\"despite doctrinal and liturgical differences\\".

Baptismal fonts similar to the one in Garde exist in Atlingbo and Hogr√§n churches. Like all baptismal fonts by Byzantios, it has an octagonal basin, decorated with figures in low relief between short columns supporting round arches. Traces of the original paint still remain on the base of the baptismal font; the paint discernible on the basin dates from the middle of the 18th century. The altarpiece of Garde Church is made of sculpted and painted limestone, and dates from 1689, or possibly 1682. Its central section depicts the Last Supper, and is flanked by two sculptures of Moses and Aaron. On top is the monogram of King Charles XI of Sweden. The pulpit was made in 1662, and probably painted in its current colours in 1749. The present pews were installed during the 1960s. The triumphal cross of the church consists of a sculpture of Christ, probably made around 1200, mounted on a cross of later date ‚Äì likely from the 18th century. The crown is a modern replica made with the triumphal cross in Lokrume Church as a model. It is approximately tall and wide. Current use and heritage status Garde Church belongs to within , itself part of the Diocese of Visby within the Church of Sweden. Garde Church is an ecclesiastical monument, number 21300000002676 (sub-number: 21400000444025) in the buildings database of the Swedish National Heritage Board. In 2019, Garde Church was one of the first 56 cultural heritage monuments on Gotland and in Sweden to be explicitly marked with the blue and white shield of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

History  The Nintendo 64 was released in 1996. At the time, The Economist described the system as \\"horrendously complex\\".\\"Nintendo Wakes Up.\\" The Economist Aug 03 1996: 55-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 24 May 2012. The difficulties were said to be a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers, limitations on 3D graphics, technology limits of that time, and manufacturing issues. As the Nintendo 64 reached the end of its lifecycle, hardware development chief Genyo Takeda referred to its programming challenges using the word hansei ( \\"reflective regret\\"). Takeda said, \\"When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power.\\"Croal, N'Gai; Kawaguchi, Masato; Saltzman, Marc. \\"It's Hip To Be Square.\\" Newsweek 136.10 (2000): 53. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 23 July 2013.  Memory  The console uses high-bandwidth but high-latency Rambus DRAM connected to the Reality Coprocessor (RCP) in a unified memory architecture. The R4300 CPU is connected to the RCP through which it accesses RAM, and does not have its own DMA controller. Except for the Game Pak, which is memory mapped on the CPU, all data transfer occurs through DMA to and from the RDRAM. The Reality Signal Processor, Reality Display Processor, peripheral interface, serial interface, and audio interface each have a DMA controller.  Characteristics  = Texture cache = The texture cache was 4 KB in size. Its small size led developers to stretch small textures over a comparatively larger space. The console's bilinear filtering only blurs them. When mipmapping is used, texture width requirements and the extra storage for the mipmap levels limit the largest mipmap level to 2 KB. Toward the end of the Nintendo 64's market cycle, some developers precomputed their textures using multi-layered texturing and small texture pieces that were heavily clamped, to simulate larger textures. Examples of this workaround are found in Rare's Perfect Dark, Banjo-Tooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and in Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Some games with non-realistic aesthetics use plain colored Gouraud shading instead of texturing on certain surfaces (e.g., Super Mario 64). = Fill rate = Many Nintendo 64 games are fill-rate limited, not geometry limited. For example, Z-buffering when enabled is a significant share of memory access, otherwise needed for textures and the frame-buffer. Optimisation is possible by pushing this function onto the RSP and CPU using a custom microcode. Significant performance optimisation can be found by using a microcode appropriate for each game. The Nintendo 64's polygon per second rating is about 160,000 with hardware features enabled.Next Generation, issue 24 (December 1996), page 74 Some of the more polygon-intense Nintendo 64 games include World Driver Championship, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. = Microcode = The Reality Signal Processor (RSP) accepts microcode, through which, a developer can access different operations, create new effects, and optimize for speed or quality. The RSP is a RISC processor, less capable than the CPU, but with an 8-way 16-bit vector engine. The efficacious use of this engine is governed by the microcode, which defines a small instruction sequence for each complex instruction. While promoting the feature of custom microcodes, Nintendo initially refused to share information on how to use the related microcode tools. This was due to the fear that it would be copied by their competitors. However during the console's last few years, Nintendo shared the microcode information with a few developers. Nintendo's official code tools are basic, with no debugger and poor documentation. SGI's default microcode for Nintendo 64 is called \\"Fast3D\\", which some developers claimed was poorly profiled for use in games. Although it generates more than 100,000 high accuracy polygons per second, this microcode is optimized more for accuracy than for speed, and performance suffered. Nintendo's \\"Turbo3D\\" microcode allows 500,000‚Äì600,000 normal accuracy polygons per second. However, due to the graphical degradation, Nintendo officially discouraged its use. Companies such as Factor 5, Boss Game Studios, and Rare were able to write custom microcode that reportedly runs their game engines better than SGI's standard microcode. One of the best examples of custom microcode is Factor 5's N64 port of the Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine PC game. The Factor 5 team aimed for the high resolution mode of 640√ó480 because of its visual crispness. The machine was said to be operating at its limits while running at 640√ó480. The Z-buffer could not be used because it alone consumed the already constrained texture fill rate. To work around the 4 KB texture cache, programmers came up with custom texture formats and tools. Each texture was analyzed and fitted to best texture format for performance and quality. They took advantage of the cartridge as a texture streaming source to squeeze as much detail as possible into each environment and work around RAM limitations. They wrote microcode for real-time lighting, because the supplied microcode from SGI was not optimized for this task, and because they wanted to have more lighting than the PC version. Factor 5's microcode allows almost unlimited realtime lighting and significantly boosts the polygon count. In the end, the N64 version is said to be more feature-rich than the PC version, and is considered to be one of the unit's most advanced games. Factor 5 again used custom microcode with games such as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo. In Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, the team tweaked the microcode for a landscape engine to create the alien worlds. For Star Wars: Battle for Naboo, they used what they learned from Rogue Squadron and made the game run at 640√ó480, also implementing enhancements for particles and the landscape engine. Battle for Naboo has a long draw distance and large amounts of snow and rain, even in high resolution mode.

There is a long history of discussion yet it has not been implemented to date. Interest in and support for universal basic income has increased substantially amongst the public and politicians in recent years. Political parties that include universal basic income on their agenda include: the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish National Party, and the Scottish Green Party. Support for universal basic income is widespread amongst Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat politicians, many of whom were among the 170 MPs and Lords who signed a proposal calling on the government to introduce a universal basic income during the coronavirus pandemic. A public poll by YouGov in 2020 found that in the view of coronavirus pandemic 51% of the public in the United Kingdom support a universal basic income, with 24% unsupportive. A public petition on the UK government website that ran for 6 months from 16 March 2020 to 16 September 2020 calling for universal basic income during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom raised over 114,000 signatures.  History (from Thomas Paine to year 2000)  = Thomas Paine: Agrarian Justice = Thomas Paine, an English-American philosopher and revolutionary, proposed a system whereby all citizens, when reaching adulthood, should be given an equal amount of money from the state. The idea was developed in Agrarian Justice, published 1797. The basic philosophical idea behind the proposal, explained in the book, was the contention that in the state of nature, \\"the earth, in its natural uncultivated state... was the common property of the human race\\". His contemporary and fellow pamphleteer, Thomas Spence, responded with a proposal that more closely fits the contemporary definition of basic income. = Speenhamland = The Speenhamland system was a form of poverty relief in England at the end of the 18th century and during the early 19th century. It started in the village of Speenhamland, but soon spread to most parts of the country. William Pitt the Younger tried to have the system implemented nationally but failed. Although it has one similarity to basic income, in that theoretically everyone was eligible, it was means-tested and it included work conditions and supervision that made it very different from basic income. = 1920s and 1930s= 392x392px Even though basic income and related ideas had been proposed a few times before the 1920s (most notably Bertrand Russell in 1918), it was not until then that a social movement seems to have started around the idea. Valter Van Trier has described this movement, which started in United Kingdom, in his book Every One A King. The idea of basic income was revived prominently by Dennis Milner and his wife Mabel Milner in their pamphlet Scheme for a State Bonus: A rational method of solving the social problem published in 1918. Following this publication, the so-called \\"State Bonus League was formed in july of the same year. The League pushed the idea inside the Labour Party, which dedicated several hearings at the National Congress in 1920 and 1922, but the idea was eventually rejected.[Who framed social dividend? https://www.uantwerpen.be/images/uantwerpen/container1244/files/TEW%20-%20Onderzoek/Working%20Papers/SESO/1989/SESO-1989-006%20(230).pdf] At the same time Major C.H. Douglas, a British engineer and social philosopher, developed a new economic philosophy which he labelled Social Credit. At the heart of the philosophy was a firm belief in the importance of individual freedom, but also that the monetary system had to be changed so that the market system could function properly. In short he combined monetary reform and basic income. = 1940s = The Beveridge report, published in 1942, stated that social insurances should be the main system in society for economic security. Besides that the report also proposed a selective system for those without access to social insurances. Beveridge himself did not like means-testing and selectivism, because it created high marginal tax rates for the poor, but he nevertheless thought that it was a necessary complement. After the war the \\"Beveridge-model\\" became the guiding principle for the welfare state, both in Britain and internationally. Lady Juliet Rhys Williams proposed the \\"New Social Contract\\" as an alternative to the Beveridge Report. In short she proposed basic income in the form of a negative income tax, except that she also recommended a work test. = 1950s ‚Äì 2000 = In 1972 the Cabinet of Edward Heath put forward a proposal for a tax-credit scheme which resembled a citizen's income in some ways but did not cover the whole of the population. In 1979 child benefit which is a citizen's income for children in all but name was introduced.  Contemporary debate and development (2000‚Äì)  371x371px A system of basic income is supported by the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Green Party.http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/news/show/4580/citizen-s-income-key-to- beating-the-poverty-trap For a period the Liberal Democrats also accepted it as official policy, but they have since modified their support. In January 2016, the sole MP of the Green Party of England and Wales, Caroline Lucas, tabled a motion in the British Parliament, calling on the Government to commission research into the effects of a universal basic income and examine its feasibility to replace the UK‚Äôs existing social security system. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is said to be a supporter of universal basic income and on 16 February 2016 said that universal basic income is \\"an idea we want to look at\\". Writing in The New Statesman on 17 February, Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds argues in its favour, (1) as a policy for coping with \\"inevitable but fundamental economic change,\\" (2) as an alternative to \\"the bewildering complexity of our welfare system\\" when \\"people move frequently into and out of work\\", and (3) as a \\"platform from which [people] might fulfil their potential\\". In March 2020, a combined total of over 170 opposition politicians from MPs and Lords, called for the UK government to implement a universal basic income during the coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom. However, the Conservative government and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, both rejected the calls. On 25 September 2020, the Liberal Democrats adopted at their party conference a policy of supporting UBI. = Recent reports = In 2015 the London-based RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) launched its own proposal for Basic Income entitled Creative Citizens, Creative State. It advocated replacing a swathe of UK means-tested benefits with a single universal payment as a response to the changing landscape of work and an ageing population. In March 2019, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) produced the report Nothing Personal: Replacing the personal tax allowance with a Weekly National Allowance. The report maintained that if the Government abolished the personal allowance of income tax and replaced it with a weekly cash payment of ¬£48 a week it could lift 200,000 families out of poverty. The proposed policy swap would shift ¬£8bn currently spent on tax allowances for the 35% highest income families to the remaining 65% of families. However, the report was critical of the notion of a universal basic income, ie, a guaranteed income for all citizens. Approximately a week after the report by the NEF, the think tank Compass published a report written by economists Stewart Lansley and Howard Reed. Entitled Basic Income for All: From Desirability to Feasibility it suggested the government could make tax- free payments of ¬£60 to every adult, ¬£175 for those over 65 and ¬£40 for each child under 18, regardless of other income. This would be designed to cut rising levels of poverty and inequality across the United Kingdom. Their report suggested the cost of reworking the tax and benefits system would be ¬£28bn, less than the aggregate cuts to benefits since 2010 and the changes would return social security spending back to the level of a decade ago to help cover the costs of the UBI. Lansley and Reed followed up this report with a second in 2019, that took a closer look at the financial possibilities of universal basic income in the UK. In Basic Income for All: From Desirability to Feasibility, Lansley and Reed claim that \\"a meaningful basic income of, for example, over ¬£10,000 per year could be paid to a family of four. Sums at this level, paid without condition, would significantly improve the living standards and life chances of millions of people and ... are affordable.\\" In May 2019, a report by Professor Guy Standing, commissioned by the Progressive Economic Forum and forwarded to John McDonnell (the acting Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer) suggested different models for piloting basic income. Standing's report (Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy. A Report for the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer) cites a \\"perfect storm\\" of factors that lead to the need for a basic income: Broad ethical justifications for basic income, which Standing cites as \\"social justice, security, freedom and solidarity\\" are now working in combination with urgent socio-economic demands. \\"A growing proportion of people,\\" the report states, \\"are in the precariat, living bits-and-pieces lives, relying on low wages and incomes that are increasingly volatile and unpredictable and on inadequate and uncertain benefits in times of loss of earnings power.\\" Echoing William Beveridge's 1942 report suggesting the need for a Welfare State in the UK, Standing states there are eight modern giants, stretching form inequality, debt through to neo-fascism, that basic income could help tackle. The report is also highly critical of current UK welfare schemes, mainly Universal Credit, which he states are unfair for large families, have high administrative costs and limit personal freedom.alt= The report deals with the most common objections to a basic income. To the objection that basic income is not affordable, Professor Standing said there are 1,156 tax reliefs in the UK at the moment and if they were scrapped that would pay for a basic income. \\"If we phased out those tax reliefs the total revenue foregone by the Treasury from tax reliefs is ¬£420bn per year and that's their own estimates, not mine,\\" he added. He also suggests \\"a more general Commons Permanent Fund, in which a national investment fund would be built mainly from levies on commercial intrusions into the commons, boosted by contributions from a land-value tax, eco taxes, digital information levies and several others.\\" = Proposed pilots = There are currently no regional universal basic income pilots running in the UK. However, some proposals have been made. In 2018, the Scottish Government agreed to provide 250,000 GBP to assess the feasibility of a universal basic income pilot in four areas: Glasgow, Edinburgh and the regions of Fife and North Ayrshire. The feasibility study will be completed in September 2019, and the government will then decide how best to proceed with a pilot in the four areas. The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce has also produced a report examining some of the benefits and challenges of a basic income system in the region of Fife. And in 2019, the council of Sheffield agreed to work on ensuring that \\"UBI can be implemented successfully in Sheffield‚Äù. The council of Liverpool has also shown enthusiasm for experimenting with a basic income.  Critics  There are also several critics on both the right and left wing. The Conservative MP Nick Boles, is one of them. According to Boles the talk of basic income as a response to the rise of robots is ‚Äúdangerous nonsense‚Äù. The main argument against basic income for the Conservatives, he argues, should be that it is morally wrong. In his forthcoming book Square Deal he writes: ‚ÄúMankind is hard-wired to work. We gain satisfaction from it. It gives us a sense of identity, purpose and belonging ‚Ä¶ we should not be trying to create a world in which most people do not feel the need to work.Tory MP condemning basic income on moral grounds Ian Goldin, Professor of Globalisation and Development at the University of Oxford, has written against UBI claiming it \\"will lead to higher inequality and poverty\\" and \\"undermine social cohesion.\\" Various left-wing pressure groups and think tanks share such suspicions. A report by DPAC (Disabled People Against Cuts) consider that \\"the need to finance universal basic income payments could lead to even more pressure to save money by restricting eligibility [for welfare payments for the disabled] than under the current system. And the left-wing New Economics Foundation concluded that \\"UBI is an individualistic, monetary intervention that undermines social solidarity and fails to tackle the underlying causes of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\\"  Academic debate  249x249pxSeveral British academics have been involved in the basic income debate. Among them the following: * James Meade, a left-leaning economist and winner of the 1977 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, took part in the basic income discussion from time to time. In his last books Full Employment Regained and Agathopia he returned to the question. * Guy Standing has been very active in the debate since the 1980s. He is now especially well known for his theory about the so-called precariat, a new social class which he thinks is growing because of globalisation, and that this development is yet another strong argument for why basic income should be implemented.Britain's labour figures hide the real hours we work every day, The Guardian, Aout 2012Guy Standing: the precariat is growing AngryWhy the precariat requires a basic income, Conference at Ljubljana * Carole Pateman, a British political scientist, has declared that she sees basic income as a fundamental human right. For the system to reach its full potential, however, it is important that the level is not set too low.

Founded by Josh Gabriel and Eric Almgren, Mixman launched in April 1994 and is headquartered in San Francisco. Eric A. Taub, \\"BASICS; Homemade Music With a Professional Sound\\" New York Times. December 21, 2000. History =Early development= The original concept came from prototypes Gabriel developed while a student at the Institute of Sonology in the Netherlands. He had developed a system to control individual music loops and later a hardware configuration that involved projected light beams and sensors. A musician and computer programmer, he had long wanted to make composing and recording music accessible to the average person. \\"Music Made Easier; It's All In the Mix\\" New York Times. October 8, 1998. After Gabriel and Almgren became partners in the early 1990s, they built a team to develop a hardware device prototype that could work with music cartridges much like video game cartridges. Within a year, the prototype was built and contained a hardware controller and music cartridges that held data for each song. The industrial designs of the hardware controller were designed by Scott Summit of Summit Industrial Design. Fundamental patents were also filed on the synchronization technology. The original mission was to create powerful but easy-to-use interactive music creation tools that enabled the user to make and perform music with the digital song elements of their favorite artist or music style in real time. Later, the company turned to developing software as well as publishing dance music. Mixman Official Site. =Products and technology= In 1996, Mixman released the first interactive CD that allowed users to perform live with their PC with zero latency and auto-beat matching. After partnering with record companies in 1996 and publishing one music title, Mixman launched Mixman Studio in 1997 and Mixman StudioPro in 1998, which shifted Mixman from a consumer activity toward a more sophisticated production and creativity tool. Mixman products were sold in both retail consumer outlets like Best Buy, Comp USA, Fry‚Äôs and Circuit City, as well as in the Music Instrument channel such as Guitar Center and other Music Instrument Stores. \\"Mixman DJ Megamix 1.0\\" PC Mag. July 1, 2001. =Artist and label promotion= Mixman developed an online version that in conjunction with its online community promoted independent and major label artists for Mixman‚Äôs label and artist clients. The online community included user services such as an online radio station for user uploads (similar to Soundcloud) and community services (similar to what became offered by MySpace). From 2000-2001, Mixman launched online remixing songs called Mixman eMixes with Brittney Spears, ‚ÄòN Sync, David Bowie, LL Cool J and forty other major artists. \\"Mixman Studio Pro: The Ultimate Software for live-playing DJs comes now with real hardware\\". =Mixman the software company= Starting in 1996, Mixman developed and released several software SKUs to retail, licensed its software to OEMs and record companies and developed its online, self-publishing community. Mixman Studio Pro licensed software to several OEM brands including Sony, Creative Labs and Intel. Mixman also developed and licensed retail and online software in collaboration with major labels with notable titles such as George Clinton‚Äôs Greatest Funkin‚Äô Hits (Capitol) and Tommy Boy‚Äôs Greatest Beats (Tommy Boy/Warners). Computer users were able to dissect and play with Clinton's classics by using Mixman software to keep the beats and mixes in sync.\\"George Clinton Gets Remixed By The Masses\\" MTV News. May 5, 1997. In 1999, Mixman released an apple Macintosh version. In 2000-2001, Mixman partnered with Mattel, Inc. for a hardware and software titled the DM2, which included a custom version of Mixman software, a USB controller manufactured by Mattel under its Apzu brand and creatively guided by Mixman who worked with Vice President of Mattel Steve Sucher and his teams. The DM2 included sounds from the Mixman sound library as well as some name brand artist content. A line of Sound Libraries titled Mixman Soundiscs were also available upon an upgrade to a more advances version of the software. Eliot Van Buskirk, [https://www.cnet.com/reviews/mixman-dm2-digital-music-mixer-review/ \\"Mixman DM2 Digital Music Mixer review:Mixman DM2 Digital Music Mixer\\" CNet. April 30, 2001. Mattel distributed the DM2 in retail chains like Toys-R-Us and Target. Over 200,000 units were manufactured and distributed in retail. When Mixman reformed as an independent company in 2002, Mattel had ceased development of their Apzu teen line, of which DM2 was the first product, and sold to Digital Blue with Mixman‚Äôs approval. From 2002-2005, Mixman continued to develop and release new versions of software and two more SKU‚Äôs based on the hardware controller Mixman LoopStudio and Mixman MP3 Producer. The most advanced version of Mixman software is Mixman StudioXPro, released in 2003. In 2006, Mixman ended its relationship with Digital Blue, stopped manufacturing further hardware units and shifted entirely to internet distribution. Mixman continued to explore partnerships with the music industry and technology companies and focused on a range of licensing and brand partner deals including Pepsi Frito Lay, SCION, M&M; Mars, Hershey‚Äôs, Heineken and others. In 2010, Mixman began developing a new strategy and business plan, and in 2011, Mixman entered a new partnership with Intel Corp. In January 2012 at CES in Las Vegas, Intel announced and presented a new version of Mixman that was exclusively available on the Intel AppUp Store. Notable optimizations were Intel chip architecture and consumer features like Rex file support and Export to Facebook. In 2012 and 2013, Mixman did two more deals with Intel and developed a new version of Mixman titled Mixman Loop10, specifically for the AAIO market with ten point touch capability and the ability to support 1, 2, 4 person playback. Since 2014, the founders have been developing a new model and vision for Mixman now focused on the EDM market that Gabriel has been performing in for over a decade. =Venture financing, merger, IPO= Early seed funding for the company was provided by Almgren, Roger Summit and Dick Asher. Dr. Roger Summit, founder and CEO of Dialog Corporation and electronic music enthusiast, was the first board member and business advisor to the company. Dick Asher, former CEO of Polygram Music and President of Columbia Records (now Sony), also joined the board and became an investor and consultant to the company to facilitate working relationships with major record labels. Mixman‚Äôs Series A preferred stock financing was led by Don McKinney, founder and CEO of International Networking Devices and previously with Sequoia Capital. In 1999, Mixman looked to raise a Series C venture financing in order to expand its internet presence and further development. Mixman was brought together with Beatnik, an internet audio company of similar size to Mixman, by the Mayfield Fund, led by Mayfield Partner Alan Morgan, with the idea that the Mixman application run on the Beatnik web audio platform. Mayfield agreed to fund the combined company with a $12M financing and to take the company public shortly thereafter. Tony Fadell, consulting for Mayfield, who later went on to create the iPod and iPhone, worked with Almgren to write the combined company business plan. Other investors included Zomba Music (later acquired by BMG), which also held a board seat. The combined company quickly grew to 140 people and began preparing its S1 SEC filing to go public. In March 2000, market conditions caused the company to postpone the IPO. During the IPO process, the company raised $35M mezzanine round of financing led by MTV. As the lead revenue generator, MTV continued to invest in, develop and market Mixman software and content and continue partnerships with OEM‚Äôs and music content companies. Matt Ipcar, \\"Mixed Up: From custom-made CDs to custom-made songs\\" MetroActive. July 1998. =Leadership= Gabriel left the company in mid 2000 to start his career as a recording artist/producer and formed Gabriel and Dresden. Almgren left the company in late 2000 to start Vivcom, Inc. (now VMark.tv), a video search company. Almgren remained on the Beatnik board. In late 2002, Mixman once again became a stand-alone company. \\"Artist of the Week: Josh Gabriel\\" Armada. August 6, 2009. Gabriel is the current CEO, and in 2018, Chris Scarborough joined the board as Executive Director. Scarborough spent his early career with Credit Suisse Tech and Media banking and then worked for media investment banking firm, Code Advisors, for which he helped finance and was a strategic advisor to Spotify for eight years.

Brock(1899‚Äì1972), born in Switzerland, was an optometrist, a major contributor to vision therapy, and the inventor of various vision therapy devices including the Brock string. Brock's approach to treating eye disorders was crucial in paving the way to overcoming an erroneous but long- standing medical consensus that stereopsis could not be acquired in adulthood but only during a critical period early in life: neuroscientist Susan R. Barry, the first person to have received widespread media attention for having acquired stereo vision in adulthood, attributes him a central role in her recovery of stereopsis, a discovery which in turn influenced the prevalent scientific conceptions with regard to the neuroplasticity of the visual system.  Working method  Frederick Brock made many contributions to vision therapy, and his work focussed mainly on the application of vision training to the diagnosis and therapy of binocular dysfunction. Brock trained his patients with rich stereo images which closely resembled the natural environment, and favored these over the use of (simplified) stereographs. In a first session with a client, Brock would invest great time into finding a point at which the client already performed binocular fusion, and Brock would refer to this point as his \\"point of attack\\" from which he would try to expand the range of positions in which fusion was achieved. He made use of the peripheral vision of his patients to lock binocular fusion, using his so-called \\"stereomotivator\\" to project large red/green anaglyphic stereo images onto a wall such as to stimulate very large receptive fields in the patients.S.R. Barry, in: He spoke against the use of an amblyoscope during training, because in his view the patient needed to take the correct binocular posture (aiming the two eyes such that they simultaneously look at the same target in space) when fusing, otherwise the training would not be likely to succeed. Aside the well-known Brock string with which patients practice binocular accommodation and vergence, he frequently used images of red/green anaglyphic rings for diagnosis and training.  Influence  Brock's methods have been widely applied in vision therapy. Susan Barry's vision therapist Theresa Ruggiero used Brock's methods and approach in her own vision therapy sessions. Her therapy led Barry to achieve stereo vision, disproving the medical community's consensus that stereo vision in adult life was inachievable. Barry later wrote a paper on Brock's work that was selected as the best published paper in the Journal of Behavioral Optometry in 2011.Susan Barry: Meribeth E. Cameron Faculty Award for Scholarship, Mount Holyoke College, 5 March 2013 (downloaded 24 July 2013)  Personal life  Born in Switzerland in 1899, Brock spoke German at first, but switched to English as his main language after he moved to the United States in 1921 at the age of 22. He saw an analogy between such a transition of languages and the mental transition that is required of a strabismic person. He had some own experience with the strabismic way of seeing, reportedly having had brief moments of intermittent diplopia himself. For most of his professional career, he practiced in Staten Island, NY. Brock published more than 100 papers, journals, manuals, monographs and lecture notes. The Frederick W. Brock Memorial Award for Excellence in Vision Therapy is awarded in his honor.

Fluharty learned acrylic paint at the School of Visual Arts and also attended classes at the National Academy of Fine Arts. For eight years from 2002 until about 2010, he sought classical training for his new work in oil paint. His artistic heroes are Rembrandt and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He married Kristi Fluharty. They have five daughters and a dog named Cash. The family lives in Prior Lake, Minnesota. Career highlights His first major success came when Fluharty designed a cover for Mad magazine in 1996. The New York Times then commissioned five caricatures of Jerry Lewis. \\"That really started it all,\\" said Fluharty. Fluharty served as a worship leader at Sovereign Grace Church in Bloomington, Minnesota, a Christian evangelical church affiliated with Sovereign Grace Ministries. From 2004 to 2008, Fluharty contributed five covers for Der Spiegel magazine. His work was reproduced in the book and traveling show The Art of Der Spiegel: Cover Illustrations Over Five Decades.

Mineral Park Mineral Park was a mining town, now a ghost town in the Mineral Park valley of the Cerbat Mountains in Mohave County, Arizona. Its ruins and cemetery are now located within the property of the mine. Mining in the area began in 1871 and a camp was established soon after. The mines produced primarily silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc. The post office was opened December 23, 1872. It grew to be the largest town in the county and became the county seat in 1873. It had the county courthouse and jail, stores, hotels, saloons, shops, doctors, lawyers, assay offices and two stagecoach stations.

The equations are generalisations of those considered in Fermat's Last Theorem. The conjecture is that if the sum of some k-th powers equals the sum of some other k-th powers, then the total number of terms in both sums combined must be at least k.  Background  Diophantine equations, such as the integer version of the equation a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2 that appears in the Pythagorean theorem, have been studied for their integer solution properties for centuries. Fermat's Last Theorem states that for powers greater than 2, the equation ak \\\\+ bk = ck has no solutions in non- zero integers a, b, c. Extending the number of terms on either or both sides, and allowing for higher powers than 2, led to Leonhard Euler to propose in 1769 that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n kth powers of positive integers is itself a kth power, then n is greater than or equal to k. In symbols, if \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^k = b^k where n > 1 and a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n, b are positive integers, then his conjecture was that n ‚â• k. In 1966, a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture was found by Leon J. Lander and Thomas R. Parkin for k = 5: ::275 \\\\+ 845 \\\\+ 1105 \\\\+ 1335 = 1445. In subsequent years, further counterexamples were found, including for k = 4. The latter disproved the more specific Euler quartic conjecture, namely that a4 \\\\+ b4 \\\\+ c4 = d4 has no positive integer solutions. In fact, the smallest solution, found in 1988, is ::4145604 \\\\+ 2175194 \\\\+ 958004 = 4224814.  Conjecture  In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured that if \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^k = \\\\sum_{j=1}^m b_j^k, where ai ‚â† bj are positive integers for all 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n and 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ m, then m+n ‚â• k. The equal sum of like powers formula is often abbreviated as (k, m, n). Small examples with m=n=\\\\frac{k}{2} (related to generalized taxicab number) include 59^4+158^4=133^4+134^4 (known to Euler) and 3^6+19^6+22^6=10^6+15^6+23^6 (found by K. Subba Rao in 1934). The conjecture implies in the special case of m = 1 that if ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^k = b^k (under the conditions given above) then n ‚â• k ‚àí 1\\\\. For this special case of m = 1, some of the known solutions satisfying the proposed constraint with n ‚â§ k, where terms are positive integers, hence giving a partition of a power into like powers, are:Quoted in ;k = 3 ::33 \\\\+ 43 \\\\+ 53 = 63. ;k = 4 ::958004 \\\\+ 2175194 \\\\+ 4145604 = 4224814, (Roger Frye, 1988) ::304 \\\\+ 1204 \\\\+ 2724 \\\\+ 3154 = 3534, (R.

Most often 1991 as a year of Ukrainian independence is considered as a start of the contemporary Ukrainian literature as from that year on the literary censorship of the Soviet Union ceased to exist and writers were able to deviate from the official socialist realism style. Principal changes took place in Ukrainian literature already in the years of Perestroika (1985) and especially after the Chernobyl disaster. Some researchers consider that contemporary Ukrainian literature started from the 1970-s after the generation of the sixtiers. Due to the increased freedom and openness of the Ukrainian society to foreign influences and much broader contacts with literatures of other countries contemporary Ukrainian literature is different from the literature of soviet and classical period. It turns to the previously forbidden topics (Holodomor, sexuality, drugs, deviant behavior, etc.), using new styles (postmodernism, neo avant-garde, profanity and surzhyk), diversity and mixing of genres, shocking effects and reflecting upon social problems and historical memory. Modern Ukraine also has a significant number of Russophone writers, who are especially successful in the genres of science fiction and fantasy.  History  Oksana Zabuzhko. During the later USSR some Ukrainian writers started to deviate from the officially approved literary style of socialist realism. Among these writers were Valeriy Shevchuk with his psychological prose and the authors of \\"chymeric prose\\" (Vasyl Zemlyak and Volodymyr Drozd) similar to magical realism. There existed also underground literary circles like the Kyiv school of poetry (Vasyl Holoborodko, Mykola Vorobyov, Viktor Kordun, Mykhaylo Hryhoriv), a circle of Lviv writers around the samizdat \\"Skrynya\\" almanac (Hryhoriy Chubay, Oleh Lysheha, Mykola Riabchuk, Viktor Morozov, Roman Kis, Orest Yavorskyi), separate dissident writers like Ihor Kalynets. Authors belonging to Kyiv ironic school (Volodymr Dibrova, Bohdan Zholdak, Les Podervianskyi) are considered to be the forefathers of Ukrainian postmodernism. Contemporary Ukrainian literature was also influenced by the New York group of Ukraininan emigre writers, who separated politics from their art in contrast to the politically active sixtiers writers in soviet Ukraine. On the background of stronger censorship and repression in the times of Brezhnev many writers in Ukraine since 1970-s distanced themselves into inner immigration making their literature self-sufficient. With advent of Perestroika the censorship pressure on writers decreased. This allowed them to turn to previously prohibited styles and themes. The populist canon of social realism was revised, the works of the \\"Shot renaissance\\" modernist generation of 1920-s, diaspora and underground writers were printed. The role of a writer in the society was revised. A writer in soviet Ukraine played a specially important social function, which new postmodernist writers (especially the Bu-Ba-Bu group of poets including Yuri Andrukhovych, Viktor Neborak and Oleksandr Irvanets) tried to debunk. Some of the centers of new Ukrainian literature were situated away from the republican capital of Kyiv. Stanislav phenomenon emerged in Ivano-Frankivsk and included a group of eminent writers like Yuri Andrukhovych, Yuriy Izdryk, Taras Prokhasko, Halyna Petrosanyak and Mariya Makytsey. Mykola Riabchuk was an influential figure in Ukrainian literature in the end of 1980-s and beginning of 1990-s. He edited \\"Suchasnist\\", the most influential literary journal at that period. Thanks to Riabchuk many still to become famous writers were first published. After the collapse of the USSR Ukraine faced a decade of substantial social changes. A free book market had to replace the state-financed soviet publishing system and the support of writers loyal to the regime.  Features  Yuri Andrukhovych Modernist tradition in Ukrainian literature was raptured by extermination of many Ukraininan writers in 1930-es. A Soviet period of considerable cultural isolation followed. This led to the fact some contemporary Ukrainian authors write in classical, modernist or postmodernist styles coming in terms with the historic gap each on their own terms. Many works of contemporary writers are concentrated on darker sides of human life, violence and crisis. This came about as a reaction to the false and compulsory optimism of the official socialist realist literature. There are numerous literary festivals in Ukraine, most important are the Lviv international literary festival, Meridian Czernowitz and Kyivski lavry. Some Ukrainian authors write in a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian called surzhyk (Bohdan Zholdak, Les Podervianskyi, Volodymyr Dibrova, Myhaylo Brynyh) using it to create a comic effect as this is the language of the marginalized. A number of writers of Ukraine write in Russian language. Andriy Kurkov is the best known of them. Also a great number of contemporary Russian science fiction writers originally come from Ukraine or still live there (H. L. Oldie, Alexander Zorich, Yuri Nikitin, Andrey Valentinov, Marina and Sergey Dyachenko and Vladimir Arenev).  Poetry  Serhiy Zhadan Among the well-known Ukrainian poets are Yuri Andrukhovych, Les Beley, Andriy Bondar, Vasyl Herasymyuk, Vasyl Holoborodko, Mariyanna Kiyanovska, Pavlo Korobchuk, Oleh Kotsarev, Halyna Kruk, Dmytro Lazutkin, Oleh Lysheha, Andriy Lyubka, Ivan Malkovych, Bohdana Matiyash, Petro Midyanka, Kost Moskalets, Ihor Pavlyuk, Ihor Rymaruk, Iryna Shuvalova, Ostap Slyvynskyi, Volodymyr Tsybulko, Oksana Zabuzhko, Serhiy Zhadan.

Its first and second editions were published in 1768, with a third edition within twelve months. The full title given to the journal is An account of Corsica, the journal of a tour to that island and memoirs of Pascal Paoli. The book is an account of Boswell's travels in Corsica during a period of military and social upheaval and his subsequent befriending of the Corsican independence movement leader, General Pasquale Paoli. The British involvement in the issues of Corsica included the Corsican Crisis, and the French involvement culminated with the French conquest of Corsica. The Journal contains a foreword in the form of a letter from the Right Honourable George Lord Lyttelton; the \\"Account\\" section details the history, geography and topography of Corsica, while \\"The Journal and Memoirs\\" section covers Boswell's trip and Paoli's memoirs.  Background  In 1765, after spending some time travelling throughout Europe on his Grand Tour, Boswell decided to go to Corsica. He had been in Italy for nine months but wanted to visit somewhere different from the destinations usually included by those undertaking a tour of Europe. Corsica appealed to him as a Scot, as he thought he would gain new experiences and learn more about a nation fighting for its liberty. He had been encouraged to visit by Rousseau. While in Corsica, Boswell stayed overnight in convents and was hospitably treated. The locals were naturally courteous but some mistook Boswell for an \\"English envoy\\". The highlight of his visit was being introduced to Pasquale Paoli. In a letter from Marseilles in 1765, Boswell wrote upon meeting General de Paoli in Corsica: It was a dangerous time as occupational forces from France and Genoa sought to quell the rebellious Corsican independence movement which brought about the short lived Corsican Republic. Before Boswell returned to London, he began to campaign on behalf of Corsica. Several letters were sent to the London Chronicle, some of which were only loosely based on the truth. These continued to be distributed on his return to London; he also approached the Prime Minister William Pitt about it to highlight the plight of his Corsican friends. This campaign helped keep the plight of Corsica to the forefront of the British public; Boswell further encouraged interest in the situation in Corsica by submitting letters from imaginary people purported to be soldiers, diplomats and such like. While this stimulated support, it also garnered interest in his book. General Paoli exiled himself in London and was to remain a lifelong friend of Boswell's.  Content  Engraved illustration on the title page The title page includes the Latin \\"Non enim propter gloriam, divitias aut honores pugnamus, sed propter libertatem solummodo, quam nemo bonus nisi simul cum vita amittit, \\" with the source given as \\"Lit. Comit. et Baron. Scotiae. ad Pap. A.D. 1320 (\\"a Letter of the Counts and Barons of Scotland to the Pope, AD 1320\\"). This identifies the epigraph as from the Scottish Declaration of Arbroath; it may be translated \\"We do not fight for honour, riches, or glory, but solely for freedom which no true man gives up but with his life.\\" The foreword includes a letter from George Lord Lyttelton that thanks Boswell for the book and at the same time berates the Government of that period for its stance on Corsica. Lyttelton states the Government should have shown \\"more respect for Corsican liberty\\" and that he thought it \\"disgraces our nation that we do not live in good friendship with a brave people engaged in the noblest of all contests, a contest against tyranny\\" as he felt they had \\"never given us any cause for complaint.\\" The first section, \\"The Account\\", comprises three chapters. In the first chapter of the book, Boswell opens with the geography, topography, social customs and habits of the inhabitants or as he titles the first chapter ‚Äì \\"Of the Situation, Extent, Air, Soil, and Productions, of Corsica\\". The second chapter gives \\"A concise View of the Revolutions which Corsica has undergone from the earliest times\\" and the final chapter of this section deals with \\"The present State of Corsica, with respect to Government, Religion, Arms, Commerce, Learning, the Genius and Character of its Inhabitants\\". Thereafter appears an Appendix, containing Corsican State Papers. Completing the book is the section which most enthralled readers, \\"The Journal of a Tour to Corsica and Memoirs of Pascal Paoli.\\" Boswell's experiences while travelling in Corsica are covered in the pages in these chapters given in a conversational style.  Reception  Account of Corsica, 1768 First printed in February 1768, An Account of Corsica was Boswell's first published book. The printers were Edward and Charles Dilly of London who purchased the copyright to the book for one hundred guineas in August 1767. Three thousand five hundred copies were initially printed but were all sold within six weeks of publication. Two further editions were quickly reproduced, each print run again of three thousand five hundred copies. It was also being sold in German, Dutch, French and Italian translations within twelve months. Copies of the first edition were sold for six Shillings each. The book was well received and is credited with catapulting Boswell to fame 23 years before his best known work, The Life of Samuel Johnson, was produced. While Boswell was alive, sales of An Account of Corsica were greater than any of his other publications, including The Life of Samuel Johnson book. Such was the success of the book it is said that Boswell was referred to throughout his life thereafter as \\"Corsica Boswell\\" At the time of the publication of the third edition, in correspondence with William Temple at the beginning of May 1769, Boswell wrote: \\"I beseech you to write to me without delay: Dublin is Address enough for Corsican Boswell.\\" At the time the book was published Boswell was twenty- eight years of age and his work was widely read throughout Europe. After the publication of An Account of Corsica Anna Barbauld, a prominent literary critic and poet, wrote a poem about him, which was described by Lucas as a \\"heroic verse\\". Boswell was also praised by the marquise du Deffand in correspondence she had with Horace Walpole. The book also received praise from Napoleon Bonaparte. The book was not well received by everyone; Boswell's father, Lord Auchinleck, referred to Paoli as \\"a landlouping scoundrel of a Corsican\\" and Samuel Johnson was belligerent with Boswell's prolonged interest in Corsica and implored him to \\"empty your head of Corsica, which I think has filled it rather too long\\". However, Johnson did find parts of the account gratifying. He felt the history part of The Account was the same as any other historical writing but thought The Journal to be \\"curious and delightful\\". Catharine Macaulay, an historian of the time, also found fault with the initial Account of Corsica and said it was not as good as The Journal. Thomas Gray was more judicious in his praise; he admired the sections about Paoli but said the correct title for other sections of the book should have been \\"Dialogue between a Green-goose and a Hero.\\" More recent analysis of Boswell's work also debates a theme of hero worship. In 2008, the literary critic William C. Dowling speculated Boswell's journals were founded on his depictions of \\"heroic characters\\". The basis for The Life of Samuel Johnson and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, both written with Johnson as the hero, and An Account of Corsica portraying Paoli as a hero. Armstrong Starkey wrote in 2003 that Boswell's description of Paoli made him a figure of romance and characterised him as a sage and virtuous \\"ancient Roman patriot\\" who only had the interests of his country at heart rather than self glory. Writing in 1995, Rogers highlights similarities between the tales found in An Account of Corsica and the Tour of the Hebrides and refers to Boswell as wanting to be a \\"vagabond with a cause\\" and describes the Corsican uprising as \\"a real gift to Boswell\\".

Line throwers come in two categories: pyrotechnic and pneumatic. Pyrotechnical line throwers are inherently dangerous as they contain explosives which, when triggered, propel a line forward. This equipment should be stored, handled and used appropriately. This equipment requires significant training in order to ensure correct use and to avoid accidents. In the late 1980s, pneumatic line throwers were invented to provide a product that is safer, cost effective, and has long delivery distances. Technology Pneumatic systems have three basic components: the launcher, a projectile, and the line. These systems are based on Newton‚Äôs Third Law of Motion Newton's laws of motion ‚Äì every action has an equal and opposite reaction. As the pressure inside the launcher is released, the air escaping pushes the projectile with a forward momentum. There are no reverse blasts from the muzzle or projectile. The exact delivery distance of the line thrower is largely determined by the weight of the projectile and a given line and the amount of pressure and volume of compressed air. In general terms, the lighter the line, the farther the line can be deployed. Strong, lightweight line made of Dacron or Spectra material is used for applications requiring long delivery distances, such as replenishment at sea. This type of line is also referred to as messenger line and is deployed with the intention of using it to draw larger, stronger ropes and cables across a body of water or geological obstacle. Heavier line can be deployed directly for applications with shorter ranges. Polyspectra and polypropylene lines are examples of ropes used for water rescue. Depending on the type of line throwing device used, the line can also be accompanied with an auto-inflating sling to keep a drowning victim afloat. Climbing line of various diameters can be deployed horizontally or vertically in order facilitate tactical highline or tactical vertical ascent. These lines are sometimes deployed with a grappling hook made from titanium and allow an individual to scale multistory buildings or shipping vessels Applications The basic applications of pneumatic line throwers are ship- to-ship line deploymentArnor Jensen, Basile Bonnemaire, Sveinung L√∏set, K√•re G.

There are also a number of more unconventional applications. These include using a modified pneumatic line thrower as an air gun to tag or attach transmitters to whales. This technique has been used in several studies: bowhead whales off West Greenland,KL Laidre, MP Heide- J√∏rgensen, \\"Role of the bowhead whale as a predator in West Greenland\\", Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 346, p. 285-297, 27 September 2007. minke whales off northern Norway,M.

Guzman, Catalina G. Gomez, Carlos A.

History There are several pneumatic line throwers on the market and depending on the exact technology; they deliver a line different distances. One of the original line throwing devices was the Rescue Rocket. Made of fabric and aluminum parts, this line thrower was a bit clumsy to operate, had relatively short delivery distances, and was specifically used for water rescue. The Rescue Rocket was replaced by other pneumatic line throwers in 1989. There are several interchangeable projectile types which provide for differing deployment distances and the launchers can be supplied with almost any type of rope. The range of payloads are not limited to rope, systems can also be equipped with ladders.

Biography  Perrot's father was the Mayor of the town and died when Vincent was 11. His mother Marina decided to move the family to Limoges. As a child, Vincent Perrot used to listen to the radio France Bleu Limousin, in which a program about the cinema was broadcast. He wrote every week to the presenter to tell him that he did not agree with his point of view on the films he introduced. The presenter later invited him at his program and it was his beginning of his career at 17 on channel FR3.Ma premi√®re rencontre avec Vincent Perrot par Jean-Michel Morange  Career  Perrot started being well known in the late 1980s when he replaced Jean Rochefort who presented Disney Channel on FR3 and then hosting summer afternoons the program 40¬∞ √† l'ombre on the same channel. During the rest of the year, he presented a number of programs including On va gagner, Vincent √† l'heure and Zapper n'est pas jouer. In 1989, still on FR3, he co-hosts the teenager program C'est pas juste. During summer 1997, Perrot joined TF1 and presents the game show Moksh√ª Patam√ª, which had a moderate success. After that, it took him a few years to find again his success on television. He then presented in 2001 L'√©t√© des records on the same channel and Un contre tous (French version of the Belgian game show Septante et un) on France 3. Perrot is one of the most famous radio presenters on RTL, in which he presents Vendredi c'est VIP and Le C√©koidon. He is also one of the most famous guests of the program Les Grosses T√™tes hosted by Philippe Bouvard. In 1998, Perrot became the fastest in the world accelerating with a speed of 402.8 km/h (251.8 mph) with a dragster. In September 2006, he made another record of 530.7 km/h (331.6 mph) in a stopped start. He is the founder of the Perrot Feeler Racing, dedicated to different categories of dragsters. He produces and presents on June 2009 the program Vincent Limites on channel Motors TV. Since summer 2010, with the agreement and the collaboration of Jean-Paul Belmondo, Perrot co-produces the first official documentary about the life and career of the actor.

He is widely regarded as an original and important new voice in African music. His debut studio album, Mashasha, which was released by Elegwa Music in 2011; it was acclaimed by critics internationally and won a Zimbabwe Music and Arts (ZIMAA) award for Best Album. Early life Peter Mujuru was born on 15 October 1982 in Harare, Zimbabwe, to Stellah and Lovert Mujuru. As a child, he was nicknamed \\"Mashasha\\", which in Shona means \\"someone with skills of a champion\\". His earliest exposure to music was from his father, who was an avid record collector and attending the nearby Highfield Presbyterian Church where his mother is an elder. As a child, Mashasha frequently visited the home of neighbor and family friend Oliver Mtukudzi, one of Zimbabwe's most popular and influential singers, where Mashasha began teaching himself to play the bass guitar. He formed an amateur band with Mtukudzi's nephew, Tapiwa \\"Oliver Jr\\" Mtukudzi, who played guitar. The band made its professional debut in 1999, as \\"Oliver Jr and Friends\\", opening for Mtukudzi and his band. Career Portrait of Mashasha 2013 ‚Äì Elegwa Arts Mashasha's musicianship and skill as a bass player was quickly noted, and in 2000 he joined the band Sisonke, led by veteran singer Jonah Mutuma, best known for his work with the band The Pied Pipers, playing original Afro-jazz material and covers. Mashasha worked with this band until Mutuma's death in 2002, by which time he was recognized as a prodigious talent on the local music scene. In 2002, he co- produced and arranged the debut album \\"Nyarara\\" by Malethar (Tafadzwa Mteswa), and became in-demand as a studio and live session bass guitarist, working with Zimbabwean artists Chiwoniso Maraire, Edwin Hamma, Rute Mbangwa, Charles Summerfield, Comrade Fatso and others. In 2003 Mashasha joined the band Too Open, led by guitarist-singer Brian Nhanhanga, playing mostly covers and some original material composed by Nhanhanga. The musicians found their original material made the biggest impact at live performances. Mashasha, Nhanhanga and drummer Sam Chagumachinyi preferred to concentrate on original material but the remaining five band members were apprehensive about the financial risk involved, believing a covers band was more employable and viable. In 2004, Mashasha, Nhanhanga and Chagumachinyi reduced the band to a trio, and from then onwards played exclusively original material, with all three as co- leaders. The subsequent album, Zororo, achieved widespread recognition and extensive airplay, especially the track \\"Matinda Hostel\\". In 2004, Mashasha joined one of Zimbabwe's most popular bands, Andy Brown and the Storm, recording on the album \\"Chiedza\\" and touring around Zimbabwe and internationally. At the same time, Mashasha played regularly with township jazz trombone player Tanga Wekwa Sando. Mashasha continued working with Too Open, and by 2005 the band had built a cult following among jazz audiences in Harare for their spontaneous, unpredictable, high energy live performances and the improvisation, musical creativity, and high level of musicianship of all three members. Working with Too Open, Mashasha had his first opportunity to perform his own original songs and make his debut as a vocalist. The same year, Mashasha joined the Zimbabwean rock band Bush Guru, which toured in Zimbabwe and the UK between 2006 and 2008. In late 2005, Mashasha was invited to participate in the all-star collaboration project \\"Hupenyu Kumusha\\" (Life at Home), commonly known as \\"The Collaboration\\". The project included artists from diverse musical backgrounds, including contemporary mbira player and singer-songwriter Chiwoniso Maraire, star vocalist Busi Ncube, mbira player- cum-percussionist Adam Chisvo, guitarist Roger Mbambo, and classically trained piano player Bengt Post. The album \\"Hupenyu Kumusha\\" was released in 2006, and featured two songs by Mashasha: \\"Spirit\\" and \\"Africa, Why War?\\" The songs made an impact upon their release, resulting in increased media interest in Mashasha and several interviews in the Zimbabwean press and on television. Also in 2005, Mashasha began developing and teaching bass and music workshops for high school students. He featured in two television documentaries by film- maker and music producer Eugene Ulman about the Harare performance venue The Book Caf√©: \\"The Book Caf√© Turns 10\\" (BBC, 2007) and \\"Six Nights a Week at the Book Caf√©\\" (Al Jazeera, 2008) Since 2008, Mashasha has been based permanently in the UK. There he performs as a solo artist and in other lineups. He plays in the bass and drums duo \\"Mashasha & Sam\\", which features now UK-based drummer Sam Chagumachinyi from Too Open ‚Äì which is now also based in the UK. Mashasha's UK performances have included Rise Festival, The Ritzy, Luton Arts Carnival, South Bank Centre, 02 Stadium opening for Oliver Mtukudzi, Zimfest UK, OneTaste Festival, and The Poetry Caf√©. Solo album In 2011 Mashasha completed his debut album as a solo artist. Eponymously titled Mashasha, it was produced by Mashasha and Eugene Ulman. Mashasha and Ulman formed a production company Elegwa Arts and independent record label Elegwa Music to produce and release their work; \\"Mashasha\\" was the first project. The album comprises ten tracks, all of which are original compositions with music and lyrics by Mashasha. The tracks feature an international band that included Australian drummer-percussionist Robbie Avenaim, US jazz trombonist Ku-umba Frank Lacy, piano and keyboard player Danny G. Felix (who also arranged some of the tracks with Mashasha), Senegalese guitarist Jeannot Mendy of Viviane Ndour's Jolof Band, Iranian ney master Davod Varzideh, Sam Chagumachinyi and others. Mashasha at work in London studio The album received high praise from leading critics and publications in numerous countries. Martin Sinnock in Songlines magazine described it as \\"exceptional\\" and \\"a refreshing and sparkling debut\\", awarding it four stars. ABC radio presenter Doug Spencer devoted an episode of the programme \\"Weekend Planet\\" to the release, and called it the \\"standout African debut\\" of the year. The Zimbabwean \\"Sunday Mail\\" described Mashasha \\"a new voice in African music\\". Hello Harare magazine described the album as \\"complex, intense and unique, with each song layered with musical genius\\". Michael Rofe in \\"The Australian\\" called it \\"a revelation from a major talent\\". Other critics have compared Mashasha to artists Richard Bona, Rokia Traore, Youssou N'Dour, Habib Koite and Oliver Mtukudzi. In 2012, Mashasha released the single \\"Musuki\\" on Elegwa Music. Genre and musical style Mashasha on stage, London 2013 (photo by Kevin Igoe) Mashasha's bass playing has been noted for its combination of virtuoso technique, assertive playing and melodic imagination. He has developed an intricate style of playing, which is rooted in traditional Zimbabwean Shona percussion, with a strong influences of blues scales and jazz improvisation techniques. His bass playing style ranges from forceful with a strong sense of urgency, to melancholic and meditative, with noticeable influences from bass players Victor Wooten, Jaco Pastorius, Marcus Miller, Wilbur Ware, Gary Peacock, √âtienne M'Bapp√©, Dave Holland and others. Some of Mashasha's songwriting is based on reinterpreting Zimbabwean popular music styles with his own individual variations, with other influences including West African Afrobeat, East African pentatonic music and traditional music from Iran and the Middle- East. His compositions often feature complex time signatures and harmonies, with multi-layered arrangements and rich instrumentation complimenting dense, polyrhythmic bass and drum lines. Mashasha has a wide vocal range, and is known for his compelling stage presence and charismatic, albeit laconic, performance style. Awards Mashasha was a winner of the Morley Studio Recording Prize in 2011. The album \\"Mashasha\\" won the Zimbabwe Music and Arts (ZIMAA) Award for Best Album in 2011.

At age 16, Jamro≈ºy moved to Szczecin, where she graduated from Liceum og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖce 14. At this time, she adopted the stage name Margaret, the English-language equivalent of Ma≈Çgorzata. At 18, Margaret moved to Warsaw. She began an English studies degree at the Warsaw University of Social Sciences and Humanities but left after three semesters. She earned a degree in fashion design from the International School of Costume and Fashion Design in Warsaw in 2015. Career =2006‚Äì2012: Career beginnings= In 2006, Margaret appeared on the Polish television talent show Szansa na Sukces (\\"A Chance for Success\\") singing Stenia Koz≈Çowska's song \\"Bƒôdƒô czekaƒá\\" (\\"I'll Be Waiting\\"). She returned to the programme in 2009 and won an episode by performing Monika Brodka's song \\"Znam Ciƒô na pamiƒôƒá\\" (\\"I Know You by Heart\\"). She took part in the show's 2009 final at the Congress Hall in Warsaw. In lyceum (college), she performed in a rock band, and in the band oNieboLepiej (\\"Much Better\\"), with whom she sang poetry. In 2010, Margaret appeared in the musical Rent at the Szczecin Opera in the Castle. That year, she co-founded Margaret J. Project, a six-piece electropop band with R&B; and hip hop influences that she formed with music producer and bassist Adam Kabaci≈Ñski. They qualified for the semi-finals of the 2010 Coke Live Fresh Noise competition. The group disbanded in November 2012; their studio album This Is Margaret was released online in 2013. In 2011, Margaret produced a fashion blog that incorporated videos of her singing. Her blogging activity waned as her music career progressed. Early in her career, Margaret also recorded soundtracks for Polish television commercials and films, including \\"Moments\\" and \\"It Will Be Lovely Day\\". The latter was released for digital download in July 2012 under Margaret's birth name, and received radio airplay. According to Polish music manager Maja Sablewska, Margaret was not well-known but her voice was \\"ubiquitous\\". =2012‚Äì2013: Breakthrough with \\"Thank You Very Much\\"; All I Need= While Margaret was blogging, she was approached by her future manager S≈Çawomir Berdowski, who became interested in working with her after hearing her recording of Adele's song \\"Right as Rain\\". Berdowski arranged for Margaret to work with music producers Thomas Karlsson, Joakim Buddee and Ant Whiting, who wrote her debut single \\"Thank You Very Much\\". Shortly after recording the song, Margaret was signed by the Swedish record label Extensive Music. The label signed a licensing deal with Universal Music Poland's Magic Records, which released Margaret's music in Poland. In May 2012, Margaret debuted \\"Thank You Very Much\\" at the 2012 TOPtrendy Festival at Sopot's Forest Opera amphitheatre, and the song was released to Polish contemporary hit radio. Shortly thereafter, Margaret's management decided to withdraw the song from radio stations and designed a promotional plan before re-releasing it. \\"Thank You Very Much\\" and its music video were released for digital download in February 2013 and immediately sold well in Poland. The song won an award as the third-best-selling digital single of 2013 in Poland by a Polish artist. Margaret worked with director Chris Piliero on the song's music video, in which she is surrounded by 30 nude extras. The video was removed by YouTube for violating the website's policy against nudity and sexual content; it was later restored with age restrictions. Following this, Margaret expressed her support of the right to nudity under the slogan \\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\\" and criticised YouTube for censorship. The video received substantial media coverage, contributing to the international success of \\"Thank You Very Much\\". A year after its release, the music video appeared on the website 9GAG, increasing its YouTube traffic to more than 500,000 views in 24 hours. In June 2013, Margaret travelled to Germany to promote \\"Thank You Very Much\\" with a live performance on ZDF Fernsehgarten (\\"ZDF Television Garden\\"). After her appearance on the show, the single peaked at number 38 in Austria and at number 41 in Germany. Margaret's second single \\"Tell Me How Are Ya\\" was released in July 2013 on her first extended play (EP) All I Need, which reached number 50 on the Polish albums chart. She represented Poland at the July 2013 Baltic Song Contest in Sweden, in which she sang \\"Thank You Very Much\\" and an EP cut \\"I Get Along\\", and finished second out of ten competitors. Margaret was nominated in several categories at the 2013 Eska Music Awards, including Best Female Artist, Best Debut, Best Hit and Best Music Video (both for \\"Thank You Very Much\\"), and won the latter. She was also nominated for Best Polish Act at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. In December 2013, Margaret embarked on a promotional tour in Italy, where \\"Thank You Very Much\\" peaked at number 22 on Italy's official singles chart. =2014‚Äì2016: Add the Blonde, Just the Two of Us and \\"Cool Me Down\\"= 2014 Grupa Azoty Grand Festival in Tarn√≥w, Poland in September 2014alt=Margaret on stage speaking into a microphone. She wears a green dress. In January 2014, Margaret released \\"Wasted\\" as the lead single from her first studio album Add the Blonde. The song reached number six in Poland. In February, she became a spokesperson for Play, a Polish telecoms provider. Add the Blonde was released in August 2014, containing all songs from Margaret's 2013 EP All I Need and eight new tracks. It is a pop record that was influenced by retro-disco and ska, and by the work of Madonna. The album reached number eight in Poland and was certified platinum by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV). The same month, Margaret released \\"Start a Fire\\", which was the official song of the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in Poland. She performed it at the tournament's opening ceremony. The song also became the second single from Add the Blonde and peaked at number 10 in Poland. Around this time, she recorded a cover of Katarzyna Sobczyk's song \\"O mnie siƒô nie martw\\" (\\"Don't You Worry About Me\\"), which was used as the theme song of the Polish television series of the same name. Margaret was featured on a 2014 Christmas charity album called Siemacha po kolƒôdzie (\\"Siemacha After Carolling\\"), which was recorded in support of the Siemacha Association; its follow-up Gwiazdy po kolƒôdzie (\\"Stars After Carolling\\") includes two songs recorded by Margaret and was released in 2015. The third single from Add the Blonde, \\"Heartbeat\\", was released in February 2015 and charted at number 11 in Poland. In August 2015, Margaret won two Eska Music Awards for Best Female Artist and Best Artist on the Internet. She became the co-host of the musical television show Retromania, which began airing on TVP1 that September. The show was cancelled after two months. Also in September, a clothing line Margaret designed for fashion retailer Sinsay was released under the name \\"Margaret for Sinsay\\". At the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards, she won the award for Best Polish Act and was nominated for Best European Act. In November that year, she released her second studio album Just the Two of Us, a collaboration with Canadian jazz singer Matt Dusk. The album consists of interpretations of jazz standards. To prepare for its recording, Margaret listened to recordings by Ella Fitzgerald, whom she has cited as an influence. Margaret said she made a jazz record to fulfil her dream and that she has no plans to give up her pop career. Just the Two of Us was promoted with two singles, the title track and \\"'Deed I Do\\". The album reached number 28 in Poland and received a platinum certification from ZPAV. Margaret also appeared in two Polish Coca-Cola advertising campaigns, performing covers of two songs including the Polish- language version of \\"Wonderful Dream (Holidays Are Coming)\\" titled \\"Coraz bli≈ºej ≈õwiƒôta\\" which charted at number 32 in Poland. She was also featured in Deichmann's Polish advertising campaign and by March 2018 had appeared in five more commercials. Margaret at the 2016 RIX FM Festival at alt=Margaret performing onstage wearing two piece floral bodysuit and fringed red jacket. She also wears sunglasses. In February 2016, Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska (TVP) announced that Margaret would compete in Krajowe Eliminacje 2016 (\\"National Eliminations 2016\\"), Poland's national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016, with the song \\"Cool Me Down\\". Margaret quickly became bookmakers' and Eurovision fans' favourite to win both the national final and the Eurovision Song Contest, but in the final of Krajowe Eliminacje in March she finished in second place. Margaret later said: \\"That was a lot of pressure and it was a big lesson for me. I don't feel that music and artists should be ranked in any way. It's not like in sport. Someone will get to the end faster, or jump higher. You can't compare music. You just like it or not.\\" Margaret also said she has no intention of returning to the contest. Ellie Chalkley of ESC Insight analysed the song's impact on the Eurovision Song Contest in 2017; she described it as \\"real, tangible, and long lasting\\" and wrote that \\"even without getting to the competition proper, 'Cool Me Down' might turn out to be one of the most influential Eurovision songs in recent years\\". She added: \\"it exists at a pop-cultural tipping point and the ways in which Margaret's stomper succeeded and failed could affect the sound of the contest for years to come\\". \\"Cool Me Down\\" reached number four in Poland, becoming Margaret's first Polish top-five single, and was certified two-times platinum by ZPAV. In March 2016, Margaret won the Kids' Choice Award for Favourite Polish Star. The following month, she signed an international record deal with Warner Music Group and released \\"Cool Me Down\\" in various territories. The single achieved moderate chart success in Sweden, peaking at number 36, and received a gold certification from the Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF). Its success in the country allowed Margaret to tour Sweden; she played shows during July and August 2016, including televised performances on Sommarkrysset (\\"Summercross\\"), Lotta p√• Liseberg (\\"Lotta at Liseberg\\") and at Rockbj√∂rnen (\\"The Rock Bear\\") awards ceremony. At the 2016 Eska Music Awards, Margaret premiered \\"Elephant\\" and won her second consecutive award for Best Artist on the Internet. \\"Elephant\\" was released as a single on 27 August and charted at number 21 in Poland. Margaret won her second consecutive MTV Europe Music Award for Best Polish Act in November. Both \\"Cool Me Down\\" and \\"Elephant\\" were included on the December 2016 reissue of Add the Blonde. =2017‚Äì2019: Monkey Business and Melodifestivalen= Margaret during her alt=Margaret performing on-stage in a blue dress on a pink background. While working on her third studio album Monkey Business, Margaret voiced Smurfstorm in the Polish- language version of the 2017 animated feature film Smurfs: The Lost Village. To promote the film, she released the song \\"Blue Vibes\\" in March 2017. The following month, she signed an advertising deal with the nail products brand Semilac in Poland. Monkey Business was released in June 2017 and peaked at number eight in Poland. Margaret described the album as \\"versatile\\" and said she had more artistic control over its production than with her debut album; she was in charge whereas with Add the Blonde, she received and acted on advice from her producers. Monkey Business was preceded by the single \\"What You Do\\", which was released in May and reached number 14 on Poland's singles chart. Margaret's collaboration with the Swedish group VAX, titled \\"6 in the Morning\\", was also released in May. She won her third consecutive Eska Music Award for Best Artist on the Internet in June 2017. That September, she received the TVP1 Special Award at the 2017 National Festival of Polish Song. Monkey Businesss cuts \\"Nie chce\\" (\\"I Don't Want To\\") and \\"Byle jak\\" (\\"Anyhow\\")‚Äîwhich are the first two original Polish-language songs of her career‚Äîwere the inspiration for a short film called Nie chce / Byle jak. Released in November, it stars Margaret and serves as a music video for the songs. \\"Byle jak\\" was released as a single the following month and reached number six in Poland. In 2018, Margaret became the first Polish artist to compete in Melodifestivalen, a competition to select Sweden's entry for Eurovision Song Contest, with the song \\"In My Cabana\\". She said she was invited to take part in the contest by the show's producer Christer Bj√∂rkman, who spotted her on Swedish television; Bj√∂rkman later referred to her as \\"incredibly starlike\\". With her participation, she intended to promote her music in Sweden and present herself to a broad Swedish audience. She added that in her opinion, a Swedish artist should represent Sweden at Eurovision. Margaret performed in the second semi-final in February 2018 and advanced to the Andra chansen (\\"Second chance\\") round. She qualified for the final after winning her Andra chansen duel against Moncho, and finished in seventh place with 103 points. \\"In My Cabana\\" was released on the day of her semi-final performance; it charted at number three in Poland and at number eight in Sweden. Following her participation in Melodifestivalen, Margaret appeared in a promotional campaign for new line of a non-alcoholic beer called Warka Radler, which was launched in April 2018. That August, she supported Europride by releasing a single titled \\"Lollipop\\", which served as Warner Music Sweden's anthem for the event. Margaret commented on her involvement in the project: \\"I have always supported love initiatives and love of all kinds. Love is Love.\\" In November, she received her third MTV Europe Music Award for Best Polish Act, becoming the most-awarded artist in this category. She featured on Kacezet's single \\"B≈Çogo≈õƒá\\" (\\"Blissfulness\\"), which was released in January 2019. Margaret returned to Melodifestivalen in February 2019 with the song \\"Tempo\\", finished fifth in the second semi-final and was eliminated from the competition. \\"Tempo\\" charted in Poland at number seven and in Sweden at number 43. Margaret also made a cameo appearance as Gaja Hornby in the 2019 Polish romantic comedy Ca≈Çe szczƒô≈õcie (\\"Their Lucky Stars\\"), and recorded a song of the same name for its soundtrack. =2019‚Äìpresent: New image and independence with Gaja Hornby= With her fourth studio album, Gaja Hornby, Margaret took a new artistic direction, which she felt had more musical and lyrical depth. The album was her first Polish-language record and she co-wrote every track; prior to its release she described it as her most honest album to date. A departure from bubblegum pop which Margaret was previously known for, Gaja Hornby incorporates a more urban sound than her earlier work. The album was named after her alter ego. It was released in May 2019 and charted in Poland at number 13. Jarek Szubrycht in Gazeta Wyborcza praised Margaret for making progress as an artist and noted that Polish producers with whom she worked on the record significantly influenced its sound, which differs from that of her previous work, regarding it as a positive change. Gaja Hornby earned Margaret a Fryderyk nomination for Album of the Year ‚Äì Pop. The album's title track was released as its first single in April 2019, followed by \\"Serce Baila\\" in June, \\"Chwile bez s≈Ç√≥w\\" (featuring Kacezet) in July, and \\"Ej ch≈Çopaku\\" in September. Margaret also collaborated with Polish rapper Young Igi on his single \\"Uk≈Çadanki\\" in July. She served as a coach on the 10th season of The Voice of Poland from September to November 2019. Her final act, Tadeusz Seibert, came in third place. Margaret left the series after one season. She embarked on her Gaja Hornby Tour in October 2019. Around this time, she officially split from her record label and management and terminated her international record deal with Warner Music as she decided to take control of her own career. Margaret announced an indefinite hiatus in December 2019 due to health problems. In February 2020, she founded her own record label titled Gaja Hornby Records. Margaret broke her three-month silence the following month, announcing a collaboration with cancer charity Rak'n'Roll Foundation. She raised 20,000 z≈Ç (‚Ç¨5,000 as of March 2020) through an online fundraiser for the charity, and released the single \\"Nowe Plemiƒô\\" on 19 March as part of their Rak'n'Roll Music project. With the release of the song, it was announced that she had signed with Sony Music Entertainment Poland. In April, she released the single \\"Przebi≈õniegi\\", followed by her collaborations with Polish rappers: \\"Reksiu\\" with Otsochodzi in August and \\"Roadster\\" with Kizo in September, and the single \\"Fotel\\" in October. Artistry Margaret during \\"Lato Zet i Dw√≥jki 2014\\" concert in alt=Smiling Margaret performing on-stage. She is wearing a crop top and a bucket hat. Margaret is an alto. On the single \\"Cool Me Down\\", her vocal range covers around one-and-a-half octaves from G4 to C6. Her vocals were widely compared to Rihanna's, whom some listeners accused Margaret of copying. She responded: \\"In lower registers my timbre is indeed similar to Rihanna's ... I will not apologise for that\\". Although Margaret's music has been classified as pop, she incorporates other musical styles into her songs. She said her music is \\"bitter-sweet. It looks cute and sweet, but it can get serious, wild and crazy.\\" Margaret has been actively involved in the songwriting process for her albums since the beginning of her career. She co- wrote four of the songs on Add the Blonde, most of the songs on Monkey Business, and beginning with Gaja Hornby, she co-writes all of her songs. Majority of her earlier work is in English, which she attributed partly to the fact that her songs sound better when sung in that language. On her first Polish-language album Gaja Hornby, Margaret said she felt ready to open up and sing in her native language, and compared singing in English to wearing a mask. The album introduced Margaret's alter ego Gaja Hornby, which she adopted at the beginning of her career to protect her privacy and regain anonymity. It was inspired by Julia Roberts Pretty Woman character who used different names in the film, and is a combination of a name Margaret wished she was given at birth and the name of her favourite author Nick Hornby. Margaret said the reason to reveal her alter ego was to show her fans the more personal side of her life. The album also marked the beginning of her transition from mainstream pop music to a more urban sound, which was influenced by her husband Kacezet. Margaret has named the Polish singer Gra≈ºyna ≈Åobaszewska as a role model and her biggest inspiration, and credits Polish rapper ≈Åona as a primary influence on her writing style. She has cited Miroslava Duma and earlier in her career Gwen Stefani as her fashion inspirations. =Critical reception= Reviewing Add the Blonde, Codzienna Gazeta Muzyczna (CGM; \\"Daily Music Newspaper\\") called Margaret's voice distinctive, while Onet.pl noted her versatility, writing that she can sing \\"seductively, and innocently, and romantically\\". Onet.pl also praised Margaret for writing her own songs, but CGM called her lyrics \\"rather simple and undemanding, emotionally as advanced as the average listener of the album\\". Jazz Forums Daniel Wyszogrodzki in his review of Just the Two of Us wrote that Margaret has potential as a smooth jazz singer due to the \\"exceptional purity of her voice\\" and its \\"interesting timbre\\". Polish music critic Robert Kozyra, however, described her voice as \\"small\\" and added that her \\"weak\\" live performances reveal her limited vocal capabilities. Interia and Onet.pl, in their reviews of Monkey Business, criticised Margaret's attempt at singing Polish ballads, saying her \\"girly\\" voice is best suited for uptempo songs. Public image and personal life Margaret wearing the alt=Smiling Margaret wearing a white t-shirt with MTV Pride logo. Margaret's fashion style and music are covered widely by Polish media. Several fashion experts have commended her style for its distinctness and versatility. The stylist Basia Richard has been impressed by Margaret's individualism and has named her one of the best-dressed Polish stars. Marcin Brzezi≈Ñski of Viva! magazine expressed his admiration for Margaret's approach to fashion and her lack of limits, while Dorota Wr√≥blewska, the Polish stylist and fashion show producer, noted that Margaret is not afraid of criticism and likes to surprise audiences with her fashion choices. Polish Glamour magazine recognised her as Glamour Woman of the Year in 2014 and Fashion Icon in 2015. Margaret was the eighth-most-googled Polish celebrity while \\"Margaret\\" was the fourth-most-googled word in the Polish music category in Googles 2013 Zeitgeist report. In 2014, she was included on the list of 100 most valuable stars of Polish show business compiled by the Polish edition of Forbes magazine. Her market value was estimated at 235,238 z≈Ç (‚Ç¨57,000 as of July 2014), ranking her 67th on the list. In 2015, the Polish magazine Wprost (\\"Directly\\") placed her at number 38 on its list of 50 most-influential Polish celebrities. In 2018, Margaret confirmed her relationship with Polish musician Piotr \\"Kacezet\\" Kozieradzki. She announced their engagement in May 2019. They married the following January in Peru in a spiritual wedding ceremony performed by shamans. Margaret endorses environmentalism, and named her alter ego after the Greek Mother Earth Gaia. She actively supports LGBT community, and Anja Rubik's \\"SexEd\\" campaign, which promotes sex education. In a 2019 interview with Playboy Poland magazine, she criticised Catholic church for its sexual ethics and said she wants to commit apostasy. She later explained she does not believe in God and said it only feels right to leave the group she no longer feels part of. Margaret also reflected on the social pressure put on women to have children, and said she is unsure whether she will ever want to have children herself. Accolades Margaret has won various accolades during her career, including five Eska Music Awards, a Kids' Choice Award and three MTV Europe Music Awards. Her third MTV Europe Music Award win in 2018 made her the only Polish artist to win the award more than twice. She has also received a SuperJedynka award in 2014 and the TVP1 Special Award at the National Festival of Polish Song in 2017.

Life He was born at Carnew Castle, County Wicklow, Ireland, the third son of Francis Sandford of Sandford, Shropshire, England and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Chalcot Chambre of Williamscot, Oxfordshire, England.Peter Sherlock, ‚ÄòSandford, Francis (1630‚Äì1694)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 23 July 2013. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Sandford escaped to Sandford in England, although afterwards he graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin. Sandford was appointed Rouge Dragon Pursuivant in the College of Arms on 6 June 1661. In 1666, when attending King Charles II at Oxford, he studied in the Bodleian Library, and he was appointed Lancaster Herald on 16 November 1676. With Gregory King, Sandford laboured two years to write a history of the coronation of King James II. This lavish work included twenty seven engravings of the great feasts, processions and fireworks. However shortly afterwards James's deposition took place during the Glorious Revolution so the authors barely covered their expenses, despite James's gift of ¬£300. Ifan K. Fletcher in The Literature of Splendid Occasions in English History called this book the most important descriptive book of the late seventeenth century: \\"James's exalted notions of his kingly office caused him to go minutely into the records of the past. He appointed a Commission for the right ordering of the ceremony in all its details and to draw up a kind of code of precedents to serve for future coronations. Sandford's book was the record upon which all coronations were to be based\\".Ifan K. Fletcher, The Literature of Splendid Occasions in English History (Oxford University Press, 1947). Sandford refused to attend the new monarchs William and Mary. Being conscientiously attached to James II, he obtained leave in 1689 to resign his office of Lancaster Herald to Gregory King, Rouge Dragon pursuivant, who paid him ¬£220 for his office. He then retired to Bloomsbury or its vicinity. He died on 17 January 1694, \\"advanced in years, neglected, and poor\\", in the prison of Newgate, where he had been confined for debt, and was buried in St. Bride's upper churchyard. By his wife Margaret, daughter of William Jokes of Bottington, Montgomeryshire, and widow of William Kerry, he had several children.

Ecology and behavior Haemadipsa picta occur on bushes and grasses about 1 metre or higher above the ground in moist forests. They are fast and actively moving, and even known to fall onto hikers from higher bushes or leaves. They attach themselves to the hands, arms, shoulders, and even neck of passers-by.

The organ builder usually receives a commission to design an organ with a particular disposition of stops, manuals, and actions, creates a design to best respond to spatial, technical and acoustic considerations, and then constructs the instrument. The profession requires specific knowledge of such matters as the scale length of organ pipes and also familiarity with the various materials used (including woods, metals, felt, and leather) and an understanding of statics, aerodynamics, mechanics and electronics. However, although in theory the builder is responsible for all facets of construction, in practice organ building workshops include specialists in pipes, actions, and cabinets, and tasks such as manufacture of pipes, metal casting, and making rarely used components are often delegated to outside firms. After manufacture of all parts of a new organ, the pipes must be pre-tuned and voiced to the desired pitch and sound characteristics. The instrument is then usually partly or wholly assembled in the workshop, dismantled, and reassembled on-site, after which the pipes receive a final tuning and voicing. Organ builders also provide regular maintenance, which includes adjustment of pipes and maintenance of the action, and repairs necessitated by wear and tear, unforeseen problems or rough treatment (including inappropriate temperature and humidity). A complete overhaul of an organ consists of disassembly of the pipes and thorough cleaning of all components and maintenance where needed; changes and additions may also be made to the instrument at the same time. Older organs may also be restored to a previous state, including recreation of damaged and missing parts using historically accurate materials and techniques. In some countries, including Germany, Switzerland, and Norway, organ building is a regulated handwork profession. See also * List of pipe organ builders Further reading * Poul-Gerhard Andersen.

Thomas Laxton was born in the village of Tinwell, Rutland in 1830. He practised as a solicitor in Stamford before his interest in horticulture led him to become an authority on plant hybridisation. By 1858 Laxton was breeding plants. Initially he worked from St Mary's Hill, Stamford and corresponded with Charles Darwin from this address. Early correspondence with Darwin referred to Laxton's work on hybridising peas. Laxton applied scientific methods to plant breeding, making careful observations of parent plants. He recognised the susceptibility of plants to disease and resistance of these diseases by their American counterparts.

It received a First Class Certificate from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1894 under its original name, 'Brown's South Lincoln Beauty' Laxton made observations on gooseberries and Darwin corresponded with him during the 1860s and 1870s on his work. He is probably widely remembered for his contribution to strawberry breeding. In 1872 he began to introduce strawberry varieties from his plant breeding work. Laxton moved the business to Bedford in 1879 and in 1885 Kelly's Directory identifies him as a 'seed grower and merchant' listed at 1 Harpur Place, Bedford. In 1884 he introduced his first major strawberry success 'Noble' a chance seedling of 'Excelsior' and 'American Sharpless'. Followed by 'King of the Earlies' in 1888.

The sinkhole, located in northern Assumption Parish, Louisiana, was discovered on August 3, 2012, and 350 nearby residents were advised to evacuate. Scientists have stated that the evacuation order could last for years. Background Bayous such as Bayou Corne were largely settled by the Acadians in the late 1700s, who were attracted to the locations for its economic potential as an alligator and crawfish nesting site. Beneath much of the state of Louisiana, including these bayous, are salt domes, gigantic deposits left during the formation of the North American continent. These domes vary wildly in scale and depth, some as much as 35,000 feet below the surface and as large as Mount Everest. With such depths and dimensions, these domes are naturally under thousands of pounds per square inch of pressure. The economic value of salt domes has been exploited for centuries. Salt mining has been going on in Louisiana since the Antebellum period, and in the 20th century, the government began using these underground salt caverns as storage reservoirs for crude oil. Where there is a juncture of mining, petroleum engineering, and drilling, care must be taken to maintain stability, so as to prevent a disaster as happened at Lake Peigneur. Bayou Corne is located in Assumption Parish, the highlighted region of southern Louisiana The Napoleonville Dome lies beneath Assumption Parish, and was characterized by 53 distinct caverns, six of which were operated by Texas Brine. One of these, Oxy3, owned by Occidental Petroleum, was more than a mile below the surface. Oxy3 was less than 100 feet from the nearest oil and gas storage-sheath, a distance that, while unsafe, was not illegal. In 2010, Texas Brine applied for a permit to expand Oxy3. Its subsequent pressure tests were unsatisfactory, yet the company felt that the cavern would be able to withstand the pressure regardless. The incident In June 2012, residents of Bayou Corne began to notice unusual phenomena; the ground was prone to shaking and bubbles began to arise from the water. The US Geological Survey noted an increase in seismic activity, but could not point to an exact source or cause. The local government sent in experts, who suspected a natural gas pipeline leak, but that assumption proved false. As the symptoms worsened towards the end of July, Texas Brine officially denied the likelihood of a sinkhole. In reality, the Oxy3 cavern had begun to collapse. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal issued an evacuation order on August 3, 2012 after residents reported smells of crude oil throughout the town. Texas Brine investigated the situation by drilling a relief well and found that the outer wall of the salt dome had collapsed, allowing sediment to pour into the cavern and oil and gas to escape to the surface, causing the shaking and bubbles residents had observed. Expansion When first the sinkhole appeared, it spanned a hectare (2.5 acres). As of late February 2014, the sinkhole is 26 acres and growing. Texas Brine is still responsible for managing the sinkhole and has burned off 25 million cubic feet of gas in an attempt to deplete the escaping reserves. Areas in the vicinity of Bayou Corne have demonstrated a similar, bubbling-up phenomenon, though as of yet no definite connection has been made between these and the original sinkhole. Scientists have no conclusive answer to when the evacuation orders‚Äîlargely dependent on the escaping methane gas‚Äîwill be lifted, yet 3D seismic surveys completed at the beginning of January 2014 show that the sinkhole's expansion is slowing as it begins to stabilize. Aside from the methane escaping via bubbles to the surface, the sinkhole has a tendency to ‚Äúburp‚Äù up debris. This is how its expansion is patterned. Seismic activity will occur, causing it to eject some debris‚Äîboth solid matter and oil‚Äîwhich makes room for more to slough into the hole, including dirt and trees. Impact The residents of Bayou Corne, who as of March 2014 have been evacuated for 19 months, have involved themselves in a protracted legal battle with Texas Brine. From the start of the evacuation, each resident received checks from Texas Brine for $875 per week. Some residents receive these checks without having even left the town, in defiance of the evacuation order. One such resident, Mike Schaff, said of Texas Brine's financial settlement option ‚ÄúThey think we‚Äôre just a bunch of ignorant coonasses.\\" Nine months after the evacuation, Governor Jindal threatened to sue Texas Brine unless they offered a buyout option to residents. Accordingly, Texas Brine offered to deal with the 350 affected residents. As of March 2014, 65 people had accepted some form of buyout. Others have opted to join a class-action lawsuit against Texas Brine which was set to go to trial in 2014. The ecological effects of these developments on local flora and fauna are yet unstudied, but the sinkhole continues to destroy nearby cypress trees, swallowing them during expansion. The Atlantic‚Äôs Tim Murphy has summarized the incident thusly: ‚ÄúBayou Corne is the biggest ongoing industrial disaster in the United States you haven't heard of.‚Äù One class- action lawsuit led to a proposed $48.1 million settlement in 2014, although some residents felt that the legal fees to be awarded ($12.03 million) were too high a percentage of the total.http://theadvocate.com/news/ascension/12053121-123/judge-listens-to- complaints-from In September 2014, Texas Brine requested a permit to discharge wastewater back into the Bayou Corne sinkhole in an effort to fix some of the damage it has caused, which sent former and current residents of the town into a frenzy as a heated debate ensued over whether the company believed to be responsible for severe damage and loss of homes should be given permission to tamper more with an area already considered to be \\"deeply contaminated,\\" as environmental activist Nara Crowley stated.Nunn, Jeffrey A. \\"Bubble, Bubble, Tremors, and Trouble: The Bayou Corne Sinkhole in Assumption Parish, Louisiana.\\" (2014): 303-317. In July 2015, Texas Brine began a series of lawsuits against Occidental Petroleum, claiming that an oil well drilled by Occidental Petroleum in 1986 triggered the cavern wall break that led to the creation of the sinkhole. Texas Brine is currently seeking $100 million in damages from Occidental Petroleum over the issue.Jones, Cathleen E., and Ronald Blom. \\"Pre-event and post-formation ground movement associated with the Bayou Corne sinkhole.\\" (2015). In 2018, it was reported that a state district judge ruled that fault was shared among three companies: Texas Brine was 35% at fault, Occidental Chemical was 50% at fault, and Vulcan was 15% at fault. Appeals to the ruling are expected.

History  Founded in 2010, Generation Opportunity initially focused on a variety of issues including taxes, high gas prices, and broader economic issues. Generation Opportunity then began to look at youth unemployment statistics and the Millennial Jobs Report, which gave unemployment statistics for 18- to 29-year-olds on the first day of each month. In September 2013, Generation Opportunity launched a campaign called \\"Opt Out of Obamacare\\". Evan Feinberg headed the organization from 2013 through 2015. In 2016, the organization released its \\"The State of the Millennial Report\\", which reviews the challenges and opportunities faced by young people in the United States  Issues  = Youth unemployment = On the first Friday of every month, Generation Opportunity uses the information released from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate unemployment for Americans aged 18‚Äì29. Generation Opportunity advocates for removing barriers to youth employment such as occupational licenses and regulations harmful to the sharing economy. Another strategy for reducing youth unemployment that is advocated by the organization is criminal justice reform, since a criminal sentence often traps generations of Americans into cyclical poverty. =Affordable Care Act = Generation Opportunity opposes the Affordable Care Act and has campaigned against it. Generation Opportunity launched its Opt Out of Obamacare campaign in September 2013. Generation Opportunity conducted a college campus tour to 20 campuses to convince college students to sign a petition to opt out of the Affordable Care Act. The organization states that its goal is inform millennials of options outside of the Affordable Care Act, and to raise awareness of the cost of the Act for younger generations. On September 18, 2013 it released a video advertisement named \\"Opt Out - The Exam - Creepy Uncle Sam\\". The video received over 600,000 views within its first 36 hours, 3.5 million views within its first week, and drew a response from President Obama during a speech in Maryland. The video features \\"Uncle Sam\\" intruding between the legs of a female patient during a gynecological exam.

Administratively part of Kremenets Raion of the Ternopil Oblast, the village has 391 inhabitants. Initially founded in the Middle Ages as a village, the settlement was first mentioned in 1421. Throughout the ages the village bore the name of Wierzbica. The village featured a Catholic church founded by Count Plater in 1692 or 1700. In the 18th century the village's owner, J√≥zef Plater, the castellan of Troki, turned it into a small town and renamed to Katrynburg in honour of his wife, Katarzyna Plater (n√©e Sosnowska or Sobieska, sources differ). The name was soon shortened to Katerburg and remained in use until 1944. With time the town passed into the hands of the O≈ºarowski family. Between 1856 and 1877 (Mieczys≈Çaw Or≈Çowicz cites 1854-1897) Countess Cecylia O≈ºarowska erected a new church to replace the old one. After the January Uprising the town was confiscated from the Plater family and donated to Russian general Nikolay Bobrikov. In 1890 the church was also confiscated by the tsarist authorities and donated to a newly established Orthodox community, while the Catholic parish dissolved. In the 19th century the town was primarily Jewish. According to 1870 data, the town had 106 houses and 815 inhabitants, 92 percent of them of Jewish ancestry. Soon after Poland regained its independence in 1918 the town of Katerburg was attached to powiat of Krzemieniec and since 1 October 1933 became a seat of a separate municipality. In 1920 the town's church was reclaimed by the Catholics. By 1929 the town had roughly 1000 inhabitants. Following the outbreak of World War II the town was captured by the Red Army in accordance with the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact. In January 1940 the village of Katerburg became an administrative center of raion and in October of that year its seat was moved to a nearby town of Dederka≈Çy (modern Velyki Dederkaly). After the end of Nazi-Soviet cooperation and the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and the Soviet Union, the town was soon captured by the Wehrmacht. Roughly 400 of the town's inhabitants were rushed into a small ghetto created in the town by the Germans. The ghetto was liquidated on 10 August 1942: officers of the Sicherheitsdienst aided by military police and Ukrainian militias mass murdered 312 Polish citizens, most of them of Jewish ancestry. Several dozen people had died before that date of hunger and diseases. Another mass murder took place on 7‚Äì8 May 1943, when Ukrainian nationalists murdered 28 Poles, 10 Jews and 2 mixed Polish-Ukrainian families as part of their widespread massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. The remaining Poles fled and the town remained almost completely deserted for the remainder of World War II. After the war the town was permanently annexed by the Soviet Union to the Ukrainian SSR, renamed to Katerynivka and repopulated, mostly with ethnic Ukrainians, who now constitute 99.49 percent of its 391 inhabitants (according to Ukrainian census of 5 December 2001). The church was demolished and a small hospital was erected in its place. Likewise the local cemeteries were demolished and turned into an open field and a garbage dump. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992, it is a part of independent Ukraine.

Plot In the 1980s, following the death of their mother, sisters Anne (Sylvie Testud) and Tania (Julie Ferrier) clean out their mother's belongings. Coming across a man's ring among her mother's jewellery Anne, who is a filmmaker, becomes intrigued and begins researching and writing a story about the ring. She eventually discovers a photo of her estranged uncle Jean wearing the ring while posing with her mother and sister. In 1946, just after World War II Russian immigrants L√©na and Michel arrive in Paris after escaping a concentration camp and crossing through the Alps. They apply for French citizenship as Michel was raised in France and fought for the French Foreign Legion. L√©na reveals she is pregnant and gives birth to a girl the couple name Tania. In Lyon the couple make inroads with the French communist community. After they are successful in their bid for citizenship Michel opens a clothing shop making custom suits. He is interrupted one day by L√©na who tells him a man claiming to be his brother, Jean, has showed up on their doorstep. Michel embraces Jean and treats him as one of the family but later reveals to L√©na that he is unsure if the man actually is his brother as his brother Jean was only 9 when he left home and he can't remember what he looked like. He also becomes suspicious when Jean's story of how he came to Paris changes repeatedly. Jean soon makes himself indispensable to Michel, helping him to procure hard to find cloth and transforming his business to ready-to-wear instead of custom made suits. As a result of his newfound success Michel buys a car, a fridge and For a Woman perfume for L√©na. While out for a stroll L√©na reveals to Jean that her marriage to Michel was a sham; arriving at a concentration camp, the guard in charge recognized Michel and told him he could leave. Michel then asked if he could bring his fianc√©e with him and proposed to L√©na without knowing her. While walking Jean realizes he is being followed but manages to escape. Eventually returning home he tells Michel that he still works for the USSR army returning soldiers who have gone AWOL. L√©na begins to feel attracted to Jean and eventually kisses him, when she thinks he will leave. He refuses to sleep with her and later fights with his brother over his loyalty to communism which Jean no longer believes in. Frustrated with his brother and sister-in-law he relocates and drops contact with his family. Michel is approached by the police who tell him his brother is wanted for murder after killing an innocent man. L√©na is finally approached by a friend of Jean's who gives him an envelope to give to him and tells her where he is. L√©na goes to visit him and he reveals that his actual job is finding and killing nazis before they can escape Europe. He now plans to use the money in the envelope L√©na delivered to go to Palestine. Before he leaves however he and L√©na have sex. Despite wanting to leave to be with him Jean tells L√©na to stay with his brother. However, as she is leaving the hotel she sees police and goes back to his hotel room to warn Jean. The two manage to escape but need Michel's help to cross the border. Despite his anger over Jean and L√©na's relationship Michel does help Jean cross the border by giving him his passport and by bringing L√©na's as well so she can go with him. L√©na ultimately decides to stay with Michel. Despite this their relationship is fractured when L√©na gives birth to Anne the following spring and the two finally end their marriage six years later with L√©na raising Anne far from Michel. In 1990 Anne rushes to Ard√®che where her father has been hospitalized. She tells him that her film about his brother is now opening in Japan. Michel tells her that out of the whole story what he remembers most is falling in love with L√©na. Michel dies in hospital and Anne and Tania gather to clean his home. While there Tania discovers a bottle of For a Woman which her father has kept all these years.

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporter's reviewer Boyd van Hoeij stated that the film was \\"handsomely put together\\" and found that Armand Amar's film score supported the transitions between temporal levels. Notes The film had its roots in director Diane Kurys' coming across an old photograph of her father's mysterious brother, Jean, a decade ago. Her father, said Kurys, 'was always very angry with my uncle, and the two men never spoke - there were insinuations that something had happened involving my mother.' Kurys had been told by her mother, when her mother was dying of cancer in the early 1980s, that at her birth Kurys' father did not want to touch her, or talk to her. Since the photograph of her uncle Jean had been from some time in 1947, months before Kurys was born, she wondered whether she could have been the illegitimate child of a liaison between her mother and uncle. The film is Kurys' creative imagining of that possible affair together with real memories of her parents' troubled marriage.

These perennial wildflowers, members of the rose family, are sometimes grown in gardens - mainly for their leaves, which collect sparkling water droplets. Lady's Mantle is commonly seen in unimproved or lightly fertilized grassland, on roadside verges and banks, in chalk downland and on mountain slopes.  Identification  The distinctively corrugated and lobed (5 to 11 lobes with the upper leaves having fewer) kidney-shaped to semicircular leaves of Alchemilla make identification to genus level fairly straightforward. The yellowish-green flowers form clusters. Each individual flower is typically 3mm in diameter, with no true petals but a four-lobed epicalyx, four sepals and usually four but sometimes five stamens. In Britain and Ireland the tiny flowers of Alchemilla vulgaris can be seen from June through to September. Alchemilla mollis, a rather larger species but otherwise very similar, is quite a common garden escape that sometimes appears in hedgerows and on unkempt grassland.

Born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Holohan first excelled at cricket before turning to hurling. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-three when made his senior debut in a tournament game. Holohan went on to play a key part for Kilkenny over the next decade, and won one All-Ireland medal and four Leinster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Holohan won four championship medals, playing with a variety of clubs including Crosspatrick, Johnstown and Tullaroan. Holohan's retirement came prior to the start of the 1926 championship. Playing career =Club= Holohan first played club hurling in 1910 with Crosspatrick. By 1912 he was playing with Johnstown and, two years later, lined out in his first championship decider. Erin's Own provided the opposition, however, they provided little opposition and failed to score. Johnstown registered 3-1, giving Holohan his first championship medal. Holohan transferred to the Tulalroan club in 1915, a decision which resulted in him lining out in a second successive county decider. A 7-2 to 2-2 trouncing of Dicksboro gave him a second championship medal. A period of political instability in Ireland over the next decade led to the county championship either being delayed, unfinished or suspended. In 1924 Holohan lined out in his third county decider. Tullaroan defeated Clonmanto by 4-4 to 2-2, giving him a third championship medal. Tullaroan retained their title in 1925. A narrow 3-4 to 3-3 defeat of Dicksboro gave Holohan a fourth and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Holohan was first selected for Kilkenny in February 1915 for the semi-final of the Wolfe Tone Tournament. In 1916 Holohan was a key member of the Kilkenny team that made a breakthrough in the championship. An 11-3 to 2-2 trouncing of Wexford in the provincial decider gave him his first Leinster medal. On 21 January 1917 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, however, were not the force they once were, having won seven All-Ireland titles in the previous decade, and a 5-4 to 3-2 score line resulted in victory for Tipperary. Kilkenny went into decline following this defeat, however, Holohan remained on the team, losing four provincial deciders over the next few years. In 1922 Kilkenny bounced back. A 3-4 to 1-2 halted Dublin's march to a fourth successive provincial title, and gave Holohan a second Leinster medal. On 9 September 1923 Kilkenny faced old rivals Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider in front of a crowd of over 26,000 at Croke Park. For long periods of the game Tipperary held the lead, and with three minutes to go they were three points to the good. Two late goals by Paddy Donoghue and Dick Tobin secured a 4-2 to 2-6 victory for Kilkenny and an All-Ireland medal for Holohan. Kilkenny retained their provincial crown in 1923. A 4-1 to 1-1 defeat of Dublin gave Holohan a third Leinster medal. On 18 May 1924 Kilkenny were defeated on a 5-4 to 2-0 score line by eventual All-Ireland champions Galway in the semi-final. Holohan won a fourth and final Leinster medal in 1925, albeit in controversial circumstances. Dublin had actually won the game by 6-4 to 4-7, however, a successful objection by Kilkenny resulted in \\"the Cats\\" being awarded the title. On 9 August 1925 Kilkenny faced a 9-4 to 6-0 defeat by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. In May 1926 Holohan was selected on the panel for Kilkenny's final National Hurling League game against Limerick. Though he attended the game he did not tog out as he did not expect he would be used. His failure to do so later became the subject of a bitter dispute between the Tullaroan club and the Chairman of the Kilkenny County Board. Holohan decided to retire from hurling prior to Kilkenny's opening game in the subsequent championship.

According to certain Dutch historians, the expeditions were an \\"obligation\\", because the Dutch had responsibility for law and order. One Indonesian historian has argued that it was actually strategic: that south Sulawesi was the \\"key\\" to controlling the so-called Great East. There was also an economic motive: to extend the tax-collecting powers of the government of Sulawesi. The expeditions received the imprimatur of the Governor of Sulawesi, Alexander Kroesen, in a letter dated 11 February 1904. The chief targets of the expeditions were the most powerful south Sulawesi kingdoms of Bone, Luwu and Wajo. The expeditions were preceded by negotiations, which roundly failed, and on 14 July 1905, in a letter to Governor Kroesen, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz stated his intention to occupy all of south Sulawesi and compel the local rulers to sign the Short Declaration. This was the so-called \\"Peace Policy\\" (Pacificatie politiek). Campaign against Bone On 18 July 1905, twenty-five Dutch warships and one transport anchored about 5,000 metres off Bajoe. The next day a convoy sailed into the Bay of Bone to deliver a letter containing the Dutch demands to La Pawawoi Karaeng Segeri, the king of Bone.The thirty-first king of Bone ruled 1895‚Äì1905. The Dutch demanded that he turn over policing duties in his ports of Bajoe and Pallima to them, and that he accept compensation for giving up his right to tax imports and exports passing through the harbours. The king was given twenty-four hours to respond. On the governor's command, a courier met with the king at Ujung Padang on 21 July. The king refused the demands. La Pawawoi appointed his son, Baso Abdul Hamid, commander-in-chief of his forces and ordered that a state of war be announced throughout the kingdom. He then took oaths of loyalty from his regional commanders and proceeded to prepare defense at those places the Dutch were likely to land. The Dutch came ashore at Ujung Pattiro, at an estuary of the Cenrana River, on 20 July. Many leading men of Bone fell in battle and their forces retreated to Bajoe, which the Dutch attacked on 27 July. Bajoe was the centre of Bone resistance, but it fell to a superior force and the king fled first to Passempe, then to Citta and finally to Gunung Awo in the land of the Toraja. Baso Abdul Hamid was killed in action in this region on 18 November. The state of Bone was completely occupied by 30 July. After the death of his son, La Pawawoi offered terms to the Dutch. He was apprehended and exiled to Bandung on 14 December. There he died in 1911, gaining the posthumous royal name Matinroe ri Bandung (\\"who died in Bandung\\"). Campaign against Gowa On 15 October 1905, the governor of Sulawesi sent a letter to the king of Gowa, I Makkulau Karaeng Lembagaparang,The thirty-third king of Gowa, bearing the regnal name Sultan Husain, ruled 1885‚Äì1906. inviting him to negotiate at Ujung Pandang. The letter was accompanied by the ultimatum that if he did not respond by 18 October, Gowa would be besieged. The Gowan fortresses of Balangnipa, Camba, Pangkajene and Galesong were fortified to resist the Dutch. I Makkulau ignored the ultimatum. When Dutch forces under Governor Kroesen approached his palace at Jongaya, he was asked again to submit, but he instead retired into the mountains with his regalia and court, hoping to draw the Dutch into battle on unfavourable terrain. On 20 October the Dutch attacked. There was serious fighting in Gunungsari and Lakiung. The royal family fled to Limbung. The king's son, I Pangsuriseng Arung Allita, and brother, I Mangimangi Karaeng Bontonompo, then went to the kingdom of Barus, while another son, I Mappanyukki Datu Suppa, fled to the Toraja. On 18 December, believing the king of Gowa was in Barus, the Dutch sent a delegation to re-open negotiations with him, but the king had moved to the region of Alitta of the kingdom of Sawitto. On 21 December, the Dutch besieged the fortress of Alitta, killing all the Gowan soldiers inside, including I Pangsuriseng, and capturing the wounded I Mangimangi. The king himself had escaped to Sidenreng. Surrounded at Warue, he managed to escape, but during his flight fell into a ravine and died. When his remains were discovered by the Dutch, they were brought to Jongaya for burial. After I Makkulau's death, I Mappanyukki remained at large with his forces among the Toraja. After fifteen months of resistance, he was convinced by his father-in-law, La Parenrengi Karaeng Tinggimae, to seek peace with the Dutch. Negotiations were begun through the resident official at Pare-Pare, but before an agreement was reached he was captured and with his followers exiled to Selayang Island. He was allowed to return in 1908, when his uncle, I Mangimangi, was exiled to Bima. Aftermath I Mangimangi at a later date, as king of Gowa Gowa and Bone were annexed to the Government of Sulawesi and Subordinate Areas (Gouvernement Celebes en Onderhoorigheden). In 1911 this was divided into seven sections (afdelingen): Makassar, Bantaeng, Bone, Pare-Pare, Luwu, Mandar and Buton. The east Sulawesi coast was a separate area. Each section was governed through an assistant resident (assistent-resident). With the capture or exile of all the Gowan royal family, the Dutch seized the regalia, including the sword named Sundanga and the chain named Tanisamang. The banner of the Bate Salapanga council was likewise confiscated. Much of the war booty was donated to the Bataviaasch Genootschap, now the Museum Nasional Indonesia, but plenty of weaponry and jewellery found its way to the Netherlands, to be deposited in the National Museum of Ethnology. By a decree of the governor of 17 July 1906, all war booty was the property of the Bataviaasch Genootschap. Some of the booty taken in the campaigns of 1905 was eventually returned to Bone and Gowa, where it is maintained by the royal houses to this day. Notes Sources  Further reading * Michielsen, A. W.

The film tells the story of the musical group The Four Seasons. Original band members Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio (who also composed the film's music) serve as executive producers. Jersey Boys was released in the United States on June 20, 2014. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the musical numbers but criticized the narrative and runtime, and grossed $67 million worldwide. Plot In Belleville, New Jersey in 1951, Tommy DeVito performs together with his brother Nicky, and their friend Nick Massi, as The Variety Trio. He meets 16-year-old Frankie Castelluccio, a barber's son, already well known in the neighborhood for his singing voice. Frankie has the admiration of Genovese Family mobster Angelo \\"Gyp\\" DeCarlo, who takes a personal interest in him. One night, the group attempts a robbery of a safe, resulting in the police later arresting them. In court, Frankie is let off with a slap on the wrist, while Tommy is sentenced to six months in prison. After his release, Tommy reunites with the group, and adds Frankie as lead singer. Frankie changes his professional name to Frankie Vally, and then Frankie Valli. At a performance, Frankie is entranced by a woman named Mary Delgado. He takes her to dinner, and they are soon married. The group, now called \\"The Four Lovers\\", is in need of a songwriter after Nicky leaves. Tommy's friend, Joe Pesci, tells him about a talented singer-songwriter, Bob Gaudio, and invites him to hear the group perform. Gaudio is impressed with Valli's vocals, and agrees to join. The band, having recorded several demos, attempts to attract interest, but has little success. One day, in New York City, producer Bob Crewe signs them to a contract. However, they quickly realize that it only allows them to perform back-up vocals for other acts. Crewe says that the group does not have a distinctive image or sound yet. Inspired by a bowling alley sign, the band is renamed \\"The Four Seasons,\\" and they sing a new song Gaudio has written, \\"Sherry\\", to Crewe, who agrees to record it. \\"Sherry\\" quickly becomes a commercial success, followed by two more, \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" and \\"Walk Like a Man\\". However, before an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Valli is approached by mobster Norman Waxman, a loan shark for one of the other Five Families, who claims that Tommy owes him $150,000. Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mob's associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommy's irresponsibility, not being involved in the group's decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group. Having to tour constantly to pay off the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now ex-wife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her. A few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommy's debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francine's death by drug overdose. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\", becomes a commercial success. In 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band performs \\"Rag Doll\\" onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has gone on to become an Oscar-winning actor (his award-winning role was a fictionalized account of another real-life gangster named for Tommy DeVito). Nick claims to have no regrets about leaving the group, enjoying the time he spends with his family. Bob has retired to Nashville, Tennessee. Lastly, Frankie states that the best time he had during his time with the Four Seasons was before their success, \\"when everything was still ahead of us and it was just four guys singing under a street lamp.\\" Cast *John Lloyd Young as Francis \\"Frankie\\" Castelluccio/Valli *Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio *Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi *Vincent Piazza as Gaetano \\"Tommy\\" DeVito *Christopher Walken as Gyp DeCarlo *Ren√©e Marino as Mary Delgado *Kathrine Narducci as Mary Rinaldi *Lou Volpehttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1742044/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast as Anthony Castelluccio *Freya Tingley as Francine Valli (age 17) **Elizabeth Hunter as Francine Valli (age 7) **Grace Kelley as Francine Valli (age 4) *Mike Doyle as Bob Crewe *Rob Marnell as Joe Long *Johnny Cannizzaro as Nick DeVito *Donnie Kehr as Norm Waxman *Jeremy Luke as Donnie *Joey Russo as Joe Pesci *James Madio as Stosh *Erica Piccininni as Lorraine *Steve Schirripa as Vito *Barry Livingston as Accountant *Miles Aubrey as Charles Calello *Troy Grant as Ed Sullivan *Billy Gardell as Georgie *Francesca Eastwood as Waitress Production In 2010, GK Films acquired the rights to produce a film adaptation of the musical, with Brickman and Elice writing the script for the film. By August 2012, Jon Favreau was engaged to direct and casting had begun. However, in November 2012, it was reported that Warner Bros. had put the film in turnaround; Despite this in May 2013, Frankie Valli noted that production was still underway. By that June, Eastwood became attached to the project as a director. The project came three years after the release of Eastwood's previous film, J. Edgar, which Variety notes was \\"his longest gap between directing projects since 1980\\". Although Eastwood enjoyed the script, he asked for a rewrite, noting that the version \\"was missing a lot of things.\\" This was considered unusual for Eastwood as he became somewhat notorious for using first drafts as the eventual script. A trailer was released for the film on April 17, 2014. For casting, Eastwood sought to cast actors from the play itself rather than more marketable film stars. Eastwood noted that he was pressured to cast more famous leads; however, he refused, stating, \\"You've got people who've done 1,200 performances; how much better can you know a character?\\". The film was shot in Los Angeles, California, where it spent $58.6 million and received the California Film & Television Tax Credit.

While Valli, Gaudio and Devito were arrested in Ohio in 1965, it was did not occur in Cleveland like the film suggests, but at the Ohio State Fair in Columbus.https://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/jersey-boys/ Some of the film's details regarding Devito's life- such as his hygiene, inspiration for Joe Pesci's Goodfellas character named Tommy Devito, and reason for leaving The Four Seasons- were inaccurate. Devito himself stated \\"Some of it is bullsh*t -- where I pee in the sink, and the dirty underwear. I was probably the cleanest guy there.\\" Devito had also previously claimed he in fact left the Four Seasons on his own free will. Contrary to the film's suggestion that he was forced out by the Mafia, Devito blamed things such as excessive travel and changing clothes three times as a day for his departure.

The sign is similar to the sa (cuneiform) sign, but sa's upper horizontal stroke is shorter than the lower anchored horizontal stroke.

It was released as a PlayStation mini available for play on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable on August 10, 2011 in Europe and August 23, 2011 in North America. The port was published by Sanuk Games. The game is a sequel to the 2009 game Hysteria Project. Gameplay As with the first game, Hysteria Project 2 is played from a first-person perspective and composed entirely of full motion video scenes as the unnamed protagonist attempts to flee a man wielding an axe. The gameplay is more varied than in the original game, and involves tapping on the touchscreen during context sensitive moments, and solving various types of puzzle or hidden object-type minigames. An interactive FMV scene in the game. The player must get from behind the wall to the door on the right without being seen. Swiping to the left moves the player further behind the wall, swiping to the right makes the player peer around the corner. The decision tree aspect which dominated the gameplay of the first game is largely absent in the sequel, where decision making is more focused on selecting something on-screen rather than the choice between rigid alternatives. For example, upon entering a room, the player can choose between several actions, such as looking around the room, examining a wardrobe or examining a bodybag. These choices are not presented as text choices as they were in the first game, but are instead available directly in the in-game interface. Puzzle solving is also more prevalent than in the original game, and tends to be combined with tapping on the touchscreen to perform context sensitive actions. For example, as the player hides from the hooded man, the only way to escape is to run into a nearby room by touching on the door, but the player has only a very limited window of time in which to do so. Another example is found when the player is trapped in a room flooding with poisonous gas, and must manipulate a control panel to escape. Plot The game begins with an unidentified man awakening in a hospital bed, to which he has been tied. As the bed is wheeled through a research lab, the man has a series of flashbacks to the first game, and his escape from the hooded man in the woods. A doctor then approaches him, telling him he is exhausted and giving him an injection. Some time passes, and the doctor suddenly panics, saying \\"He's coming back.\\" She then writes something on the player's arm and leaves. The player escapes from his restraints and leaves the room. Confronted with a keypad locked door, he discovers that the doctor has written the code on his arm. Running through the corridors, he encounters the hooded man wielding an axe and dragging a body behind him. Escaping the hooded man, the player finds an earpiece in a bodybag. He uses the device to contact the doctor, who reveals herself to be Professor Lisa Spencer, a scientist who was working with nanotechnology in an effort to determine how a human subject would cope with having nanomachines injected into them. However, as she is explaining her work, the hooded man attacks the player, who escapes into a lab, sealing the door behind him. Looking around the room, he sees a screen showing a video monitor of what appears to be a prison cell holding the smoke monster from the first game. He then logs into Spencer's boss, Gustavo Ortega's, computer, using his dog's name. On the computer he finds footage of his own escape from the woods as well as copies of Sgt. Coyle's files unlocked at the end of the first game. A poison gas is then released into the room, but the player escapes down a hallway filled with lethal lasers, and flees into the basement of the building. However, he is pursued by the hooded man, who turns himself into the black smoke monster and follows the player through an air vent. The game ends with the black smoke re- materializing as the hooded man, and trapping the player in the basement. As the player progresses through the game, pages of Gustavo Ortega's journal can be found. These pages reveal Ortega's descent into madness after injecting himself with his nanomachines. At first, they make him feel incredible, heightening his senses and giving him limitless energy, but he then starts to experience side effects; migraines, blurred vision, black-outs, insomnia, growths on his skin. Eventually, his body and mind break down, and his journal becomes filled with strange drawings. The last page of his journal is a sellotaped page from another book, entitled \\"Learn how to use an axe properly.\\" Reception Upon its release, Hysteria Project 2 received mixed to negative reviews. The iOS version of the game holds an aggregate score of 52 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on six reviews. On GameRankings, the iOS version holds a score of 57.50%, based on four reviews, and the PSP version holds a score of 53.33%, also based on four reviews. Chris Hall of 148Apps scored the game 3.5 out of 5, the same score he had given to the original game. He praised the tone, calling it \\"the scariest, most immersive game in the App Store\\", but he was highly critical of the trial-and-error gameplay and the ease with which the player can die; \\"at the end of the day, fans of immersive horror games will enjoy the fantastic cinematics of Hysteria Project 2. There's no question in my mind that this is the scariest game in the App Store, but it could be so much more. Maybe I'm a wimp, but I don't need to die every 45 seconds to understand the fact that there's a guy that is trying to kill me. I get it. Please stop making me reload.\\" AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba scored the game 3 out of 5, criticizing the lack of narrative progression and backstory; \\"Hysteria Project 2 walks a fine line in keeping its thriller story exciting, but instead of continuing to tread that line it decides to switch off for you.\\" IGN's Levi Buchanan scored it 5 out of 10 (he had scored the original 7.2). As with 148Apps, he was highly critical of the frequency of death scenes and the trial-and-error nature of the gameplay. He praised the graphics, but concluded that \\"Hysteria Project 2 has all of the elements needed for a great horror game: excellent sense of dread and panic, great atmospherics, and a good story. But it just bludgeons you with death scenes that constantly rip you out of the experience. When constructing a world this interesting, Bulkypix should be trying to keep the player fully engaged in it. That's how fear is made. I'm not scared by getting killed every 30 seconds. I'm frustrated.\\" Slide to Play's Andrew Podolsky scored the game 2 out of 4. He found it improved on the original (which he had scored 1 out of 4), lauding the expanded gameplay, more expansive location and longer storyline. However, as with other reviewers, he was critical of the frequency of death scenes; \\"Although Hysteria Project 2 is more fun to play than the original, it's still a very brief and unsatisfying game. We encountered almost every possible death in the game, but the entire experience lasted under an hour, and we see no reason to play through it again.\\" PSPminis' Jasper Nikki scored the PSP version 7 out of 10. He praised the atmosphere, but found the frequency of deaths interrupted the gameplay and disrupted the storytelling; \\"Consistency is what this game is lacking; sometimes the puzzles are straightforward, sometimes they are unreasonable. You have to suffer several deaths without having the faintest clue on what you should do in order to progress.\\" References External links Category:2011 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Full motion video based games Category:Horror video games Category:IOS games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in France ","title":"Hysteria Project 2"},{"id":"40054145","text":"Harris Academy Upper Norwood (formerly Westwood High School and then Westwood Girls' College for Languages and Arts and Ingram County Secondary Girls' School) is a mixed secondary school with academy status, located in the Upper Norwood area of the London Borough of Croydon, England.

It mixes elements of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with those of tales of Jack the Ripper. Plot In the opening scene, Henry Jekyll, a young boy, witnesses his father committing adultery with another woman in a barn. His father catches him and violently whips Henry for spying, scarring him for life and leading to repressed sadomasochistic longings. Many years later, in late 1880s England, the adult Dr. Henry Jekyll is experimenting with the human psyche when he accidentally ingests a mix of ether and cocaine and goes insane. He transforms into the monstrous-looking Edward \\"Jack the Ripper\\" Hyde and murders a prostitute who resembles one that he previously met as a child. He begins a killing spree using the mixture that was originally meant to be an anesthetic in order to influence prostitutes and johns to torture and kill each other. The murders gain the attention of a detective from Scotland Yard as well as Jekyll's wife Elisabeth, who begins to suspect where her husband is going at nights. As \\"Jack\\" Hyde, he enlists two assistants to give out his anesthetic drug to distribute among the lower-class population of Whitechapel. One night, after he transforms, Jekyll is followed by Elisabeth to a brothel and then from there to a sadomasochistic threesome at a local abandoned warehouse where both of Hyde's partners go crazy and attempt to kill each other and her. Elisabeth subdues and kills both and gets away, but Hyde follows her back to her house. He breaks in and murders her before transforming back into Dr. Jekyll, thus getting away with everything and enabling him to continue his killing spree.

Vincent Canby stated that he thinks the film looks \\"19th-century atmospheric\\". While the film is for the most part clearly set in the Victorian era, some of the wardrobe seems deliberately anachronistic and modern, adding to the film's surrealistic ambience. Alain Silver compared the style of the film to those directed by Ken Russell, based on the way that the films incorporate the supernatural, psychology, and sexual imagery. He also said that the prostitutes \\"further unsettle the preconceptions of the audience\\". The book Marked Women: Prostitutes and Prostitution in the Cinema uses the film as an example of sexual brutality against women in films. Reception Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that Anthony Perkins \\"gives a good, funny, if somewhat lopsided performance as the madman of medicine\\". TV Guide reviewed the film, giving it 1 out of 4 stars and saying, \\"EDGE OF SANITY obviously isn't meant to be taken seriously, despite its expensive production values and surrealistic photography‚Äîboth surprisingly good. But the rest of EDGE OF SANITY (shot mostly in Budapest with some English exteriors) doesn't measure up to its technical proficiency.\\" Leonard Maltin described the film as \\"Tasteless, pointless, and unpleasant\\".

It was won by Mayo who defeated London in a final, which, historically, was the Exiles' first time to reach a provincial decider. London's appearance in the Connacht final followed a remarkable turn of events. Having not won a Connacht championship match since 1977, they first overcame Sligo in their quarter-final meeting. They then secured a draw against Leitrim in the semi-final in Carrick-on-Shannon before winning the replay in Roscommon.

Mayo, on the other hand, had contested the previous year's All-Ireland Final and were extremely convincing on their march to the final. They humiliated their traditional rivals Galway in the quarter-finals, beating them comfortably in their own grounds. Galway had two players sent off and the game ended 4-16 to 0-11. Their next match saw Mayo face Roscommon in the semi-finals, a team who had run them close in the 2011 Connacht final two years earlier. This year, however, Mayo were winners by a much greater margin, beating them 0-21 to 0-09 in McHale Park. In the end Mayo proved too much for London, winning the J. J.

Biography Robert Strong was born on November 23, 1917 in Painseville, Ohio. His father, Robert William Strong Sr., was a member of the class the stars fell on at West Point, who ended his career as a Brigadier General. Strong graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy at Wayne, Pennsylvania and in July 1936 entered the United States Military Academy at West Point. Four years later he graduated from there as a second lieutenant and in October of the same year began flight training at Kelly Field, Texas where he also got his Aircrew Badge in September 1941. In December of the same year he was a bomber aircraft operations officer for the 41st Bombardment Group at Hammer Field, California. Later on, 47th Bombardment Group at Visalia went also under his command. In August 1942, he went to Topeka, Kansas where he trained 333rd Bomb Group and the same year moved to Salina, Kansas where he did the same thing with the 346th Bomb Group. In January 1943 he took command of Salina's 504th Bombardment Group and the same year moved back to Topeka. From March 1943 to February 1944 he served as an operations officer for the 2nd Heavy Bombardment Processing Headquarters and 3rd Heavy Bombardment Processing Headquarters at Topeka's 272nd Base Unit. In June 1944 Strong came back to Salina and became a commander of the 62nd Bombardment Group which played an important strategic role in South West Pacific Theater. Later on he was transferred to command the 39th Bombardment Group which was stationed on the island of Guam. During this time, his B-29s' squadron bombarded Japan for 200 hours. He came back to the United States in October 1945 and served as tactical officer at the U.S. Military Academy till July 1948. In August 1952 Strong became an assistant air attach√© to Canada and then got enrolled into the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island.

He lives in Paso Robles, California with his wife, Celeste Hope. A third generation farmer, Hope moved from Bakersfield to Paso Robles with his family in 1978 when his parents Chuck and Marlyn Hope bought a ranch to plant apple orchards and grape vineyards. The Hope family realized that Paso Robles was better suited for grape growing, which became their signature crop. Hope was eight years old when the grapes came on the line; growing up, he would often play in the vineyards as his father worked. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Hope family grew grapes for various wine producers. In the 1980s, the Wagner family, owners of Napa Valley‚Äôs Caymus Vineyards turned to the Hope family to source Cabernet Sauvignon grapes for their Liberty School label. This began a long-lasting partnership between the two families. While studying fruit science at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Hope spent some time working in Napa Valley under Caymus Winemaker Chuck Wagner. This opportunity solidified his decision to pursue winemaking for his family, which later became Hope Family Wines. After graduating from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science, Hope helped oversee his family‚Äôs transition from growers to winemakers. That year, the Hopes acquired Liberty School from the Wagners. In 1996, they launched Treana Winery ‚Äì Hope helped produce Treana‚Äôs debut 1996 vintage as assistant winemaker under Chris Phelps. Hope became the head winemaker in 1998 and has held the position ever since.

It is a part of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and is a Gram-negative bacterium. B. lusitaniae is tick-borne; he type strain is PotiB2. It can be pathogenic, being involved in cases of Lyme borreliosis. A species of tick, Ixodes ricinus, is the host of B. lusitaniae. It is thought to have originated from Portugal and has since spread to parts of Europe and North Africa. Lizards of the family Lacertidae are now believed to be important reservoir hosts of this bacterium.  Origin and Distribution While B. lusitaniae is distributed throughout countries in Europe and North Africa, it is the sole species of the Lyme borreliosis group in southern Portugal. Lizards of the family Lacertidae are believed to be important reservoir hosts of B. lusitaniae. They were first isolated in Portugal in 1993. These lizards that include the sand lizard and common wall lizard are known to be highly structured phylogeographically. Migration is very limited between the lizard populations from different localities and it has shed light into the evolution and epidemiology of B. lusitaniae. The pronounced population structure of B. lusitaniae over a short geographic distance (southern Portugal) by housekeeping genes indicates that the migration rates of B. lusitaniae are rather low, because the distribution of Mediterranean lizard populations is highly parapatric. Different populations of B. lusitaniae are known. Seven strains of B. lusitaniae sp. nov. have been isolated from Ixodes ricinus ticks in Portugal, the Czech Republic, Moldavia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Local populations have diverged through vicariance, because climate change after the last ice age generated ecological barriers between Mafra and Gr√¢ndola. In more northern or eastern countries, B. lusitaniae has been detected at only a few sites, at which it infects ticks less frequently than it does on the Mediterranean coast, although in Morocco and Tunisia, 96.6-100% of the Borrelia species present were B. lusitaniae.  In lizards Because lizards are considered important reservoir hosts of B. lusitaniae, their limited dispersal affects the migration rates of B. lusitaniae. This results in the fine-scale geographic structure of this tick-borne bacterium. Although I. ricinus ticks infected with B. lusitaniae may be dispersed rapidly over long distances when feeding on mobile hosts, such as migratory birds, this is unlikely to be an important process in the effective dispersal of B. lusitaniae. Feeding tick larvae apparently do not acquire B. lusitaniae from vertebrate species other than lizards. However, B. lusitaniae-infected nymphs that feed on long-distance migrants give rise to hunting adult ticks that subsequently feed on larger animals, such as deer, which are not reservoir-competent for any of the species of the Lyme borreliosis group of spirochetes. Therefore, only larvae and nymphs that feed on lizards maintain the cycles of B. lusitaniae. So, the migration rates of B. lusitaniae are determined by those of lizards.  In humans  To date, the reservoir of B. lusitaniae has not been fully defined, and little is known about the ecology of this genospecies. It is known to cause experimental disease in mouse models, suggesting that some strains could also be connected with human Lyme borreliosis. The first known isolate of Borrelia was in Portugal. A 46-year-old woman from the Lisbon area presented with skin lesions on her left thigh that had persisted about 10 years. Molecular analysis of the patient isolate allowed the classification of the strain to B. lusitaniae, a genospecies previously thought to be nonpathogenic in humans The woman had a weak serological response, which is present in a high percentage of patients with unspecific and long-lasting skin manifestations. This suggests a clinical pattern for B. lusitaniae different from those for other Borrelia spp. in the Portuguese population compared to date . Plasmids  The plasmid profiles of B. lusitaniae strains usually range from 19 to 76 kb. In the case of B. lusitaniae, the number of plasmids is quite low and the species lacks all the small plasmids described for the other Borrelia species with medical importance in Lyme borreliosis. Because most of the Borrelia virulence genes are located on plasmids, including genes that encode for OspC, Erps, and CRASP proteins, the low number of these genetic elements in B. lusitaniae strains could be associated with the lower infectivity reported for this species since only two human isolates have been found so far. Furthermore, the number (0.04/100,000 inhabitants) of reported cases in Portugal is not as high as in other European countries despite a high reported infection prevalence of B. lusitaniae in ticks.

He set up a church and a school and attracted many settlers to the area.The Kelowna Story An Okanagan History, Sharron J. Simpson, 2011, Harbour Publishing Company Limited, He founded the Okanagan Mission which was the first permanent white settlement in the British Columbia Interior aside from the forts for the Hudson's Bay Company and the gold rush boomtowns of the Fraser Canyon.The History of Okanagan Mission A Centennial Retrospect, Primrose Upton, 1958, Okanagan Mission Centennial Committee Background Father Pandosy was born on 21 November 1824 in Marseille, France to Esprit-√âtienne-Charles-Henri Pandosy, a sea captain, and Marguerite-Josephine-Marie Dallest. He was educated at Coll√®ge de Bourbon in Arles. He then decided to enter the Oblate Juniorate of Notre-Dame de Lumi√®res. On 14 August 1844, he entered the novitiate of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.) at Notre-Dame-de-l'Osier and took his vows one year and one day later, on 15 August 1845. After that, he studied philosophy and theology at the seminary in Marseille. Towards the end of 1846, Eug√®ne de Mazenod, the founder of the O.M.I., granted the request of two Pacific Northwest bishops (Augustin-Magloire Blanchet of Walla Walla, Washington and Modeste Demers of Vancouver Island) to send Oblate missionaries from France to serve in their dioceses. Pandosy and 4 other men (one ordained priest, three scholastics, of which Pandosy was one, and one lay brother) left Le Havre on 4 February 1847 when Pandosy was 23 years old. They arrived in New York on 2 April 1847, met Bishop Blanchet in St. Louis and reached Kansas City on 1 May 1847. They then joined a caravan going to Fort Hall in what is now southeastern Idaho. When the party arrived at Fort Hall the Bishop and a few companions went ahead to prepare lodgings and provisions for the winter. Father Pandosy remained with the wagons in Fort Hall and finally arrived in Walla Walla on 5 October 1847, eight months after he had set out from France. Work in Oregon Territory Father Pandosy and the other Oblates began by proselytizing the Yakama people in the lower valley of the Yakima River. While they were there, the Whitman Massacre occurred near Walla Walla. The Bishop decided to immediately ordain two of the Oblates, Pandosy and Father Eugene Chirouse. Pandosy was ordained into the priesthood on 2 January 1848. Father Pandosy then returned to the Yakama Indians, and convinced them to stay neutral in the Cayuse War which broke out after the massacre. Pandosy and Chirouse befriended Chief Kamiakin of the Yakama people and he protected them for many years. In early 1849 the two priests built the Mission of St. Joseph at Saralpes. In 1851 he was joined by Father Louis-Joseph d'Herbomez and they moved the mission to the Ahtanum Creek. This was near Kamiakin‚Äôs camp. The Yakima War broke out in 1855. Volunteer soldiers went into the field to fight against the Indians. Some of these volunteers took the St. Joseph Mission and uncovered a keg of powder, leading them to believe that the priests were helping the Yakama. The mission was burned and Father Pandosy was forced to flee with the Yakama. He escaped from them and managed to find his way to the Jesuits‚Äô St. Paul's Mission at Kettle Falls. He stayed there until the middle of 1856, then spent the rest of 1856 and 1857 ministering to the Indians and US troops in that area. In 1858, he was transferred to Esquimalt, which was then the headquarters of the Oblates in British Columbia. Okanagan Mission In 1858, Father Pandosy and the missionaries arrived in Esquimalt in the summer. Father Pandosy wanted to start a new colony in the Interior and he chose the Okanagan area. He started looking for people to join him. French- Canadian brothers, Theodor and Cyprienne Laurence, Cyprienne's wife Therese who was a member of the Flathead tribe and an unnamed Flathead man joined Father Pandosy and set off for the Okanagan. In the fall of 1859 they arrived in the Okanagan and settled down. However, in the spring it became too marshy so they moved to a spot near modern-day Mission Creek that summer. They built a small log home with a church on the ground floor and they slept upstairs. They called it Mission of the Immaculate Conception and it was located on the site they called L'Anse au Sable (Sandy Cove). Father Pandosy's Mission is commonly called Okanagan Mission. The site was not established for fur or gold but rather as a religious site and community settlement. Father Pandosy was just as much a farmer as he was a priest. Okanagan Mission had hogs, sheep, oats, barley, wheat, tobacco and potatoes. Father Pandosy's Mission was the first cemetery,British Columbia Ghost Town Series Okanagan-Similikimeen, T.W. Paterson, 1983, Sunfire Publications the first place of worship and the first school in the Southern Interior. Two years after it was founded, 121 people were baptized at Okanagan Mission. In 1865, a brother's house was added to the site to house the many priests that stayed there as they were passing through as well as travelers who needed a place to stay. In 1866, a log barn was added to the site. Father Pandosy farmed and found ways to irrigate the land so a root cellar was also built. In 1882, a new sawn lumber church was added. This new church had five Gothic style windows and a bell tower. A bell that was given to Father Pandosy by Joseph Christien hung in the tower of the new church. father Pandosy was sent on missions across British Columbia and sometimes he would stay away for years at a time but he always came back to Okanagan Mission. Okanagan Mission became the Catholic Church's headquarters for the area. However, in 1885, after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway's new transcontinental line, the oblates switched their headquarters to St. Louis Mission in Kamloops. During his service in British Columbia, he established other missions, including one on Harbledown Island in 1863 which was later closed by Bishop D'Herbomez in 1874.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Harbledown Island\\" Louis d'Herbomez built mission with him in 1847, in Washington near Yakima, which was named Sainte Croix. Location was main summer camp for Chief Kamiakin Death In February 1891, Father Pandosy was called to Keremeos. He was 67 years old and in tentative health. Returning from Keremeos, he made it as far as Penticton and was very ill. Chief Fran√ßoise of the Penticton Indian Band noticed Father Pandosy's illness and took him in. Thomas Ellis' wife was called because of her nursing skills. Little could be done for Father Pandosy and he died on February 6, 1891. His body was sent back to Okanagan Mission on the steamer Penticton. He was buried across the street from the site he founded. The Pandosy Mission Cemetery containing Father Pandosy's grave was discovered by a team of archeologists from Vancouver in 1983. The dig also discovered the graves of several early settlers pre-1900. The site is marked by a granite boulder with a commemorative brass plaque and is located on a working farm about 400 metres north-west from the mission.https://www.kelowna.ca/our-community/arts-culture- heritage/heritage/heritage-register/pandosy-mission-cemetery Legacy In 1896, Okanagan Mission was sold to Father Eumelin. Father Eumelin ran the Mission until 1902. Father Pandosy's Mission closed in 1902 and the land was purchased by the Kelowna Land and Orchard Company. Father Pandosy's Mission had been a place of worship for forty-four years. 1947 saw the property sold again and it was slated for demolition but a group of volunteers rescued and restored the three original buildings on the site. Father Pandosy's original sawn wood church was sold to a local congregation and they moved the church to their site in Rutland where it was later destroyed by fire. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate bought the two acres that held the original buildings in 1954. In 1983, the site was designated as a B.C. Heritage Site. Father Pandosy's Mission is now four acres and other historic buildings have been put on site.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic on convoy protection duty during the Second World War. She was named for Amherst, Nova Scotia. Following the war, the corvette was sold to the Venezuelan Navy and renamed Federacion. The ship was discarded in 1956. Background Flower-class corvettes like Amherst serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War differed from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction and career Ordered from Saint John Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Saint John, New Brunswick as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program, Amherst was laid down on 23 May 1940 and launched on 3 December later that year. She was commissioned on 5 August 1941 in Saint John. During her service life, her forecastle was extended at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on 1 November 1943 during her first refit. She had a second refit in September 1944 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. =War service= After her commissioning she was sent on convoy duty from 22 August 1941 until her first refit in November 1943. While escorting convoy SC 107 Amherst engaged several U-boats. During his first encounter the commanding officer, Lieutenant Louis Audette, went up to the crowsnest to direct fire down on the surfaced U-boat. The next night during her attempt to sink another submarine her ASDIC lost power and she lost contact. During the same convoy, a member of the crew earned a British Empire Medal for helping save three stranded crew from a burning vessel. She later joined MOEF Group C-4 as a replacement. After her first refit she was worked up at Pictou, Nova Scotia and returned to the defence of the Atlantic until her second refit in September 1944. After work was completed she was worked up in Bermuda and lent to Escort Group C-7 for one more round trip to the United Kingdom. =Post-war service= She was paid off on 16 July 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia. She was placed in reserve at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold to the Venezuelan navy in 1946 and renamed Federacion. As Federacion she served until 1956. She was then broken up.

The abbey was founded in 1222 by the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º. The religious complex was built for religious reasons as well as for prestige. It was the largest and most impressive church in medieval Poland after Wawel Cathedral, and served as the OdrowƒÖ≈º family's burial place until the 16th century. The architectural complex includes the stuccoed Polish Gothic church, the Basilica of the Holy Cross (), which serves as the Parish Church of St. Bartholomew the Apostle as well as the abbey church for the monks. There is also the Polish Renaissance-style abbot's palace, built around 1569, as well as the red-brick monastery, with a broad inner courtyard, outbuildings, vegetable garden, greenhouse, etc. History Under the reign of Henry I the Bearded, the Duke of Silesia, a community of monks was brought in from LubiƒÖ≈º Abbey to Mogi≈Ça by OdrowƒÖ≈º around 1219, to commence the construction of the brand new church in his diocese. He granted them a village by the Vistula River, close to his residence in the capital. The monastic community, consisting of the 13 professed monks mandatory for an independent monastery, moved in around 1225, although the expansion of the abbey continued for years to come. The Mogi≈Ça Abbey was confirmed by the Roman Curia through a papal bull signed by Pope Gregory IX on 9 June 1228. In Latin, the monastery still retains its name of Clara Tumba (Bright Tomb), a name derived from two local toponyms. There is an ancient barrow, called Wanda Mound, within a mile of the monastery site; and the name of the site of the monastery, originally the village of Mogi≈Ça, translates as \\"tomb\\" in Polish. In 1241 the abbey was ransacked in the course of the Mongol invasion of Poland. It was rebuilt and the abbey church was consecrated in 1266 by Bishop Jan Prandota. It was later consumed by fire in 1447. It was ravaged again in the 17th century by the invading Swedish army. The abbey was destroyed and its entire resident population was killed by the Swedes, except for two monks whose lives were spared. The structure was renovated numerous times. The Baroque fa√ßade of the monastery church was added in 1779‚Äì80, based on a design by Franz Moser. The abbey church was promoted in 1970 by Pope Paul VI to the rank of a Minor Basilica, and visited by Pope John Paul II, who celebrated Mass for 200,000 people in a nearby open field in 1979. Notable individuals Under the reign of Abbot Erazm Cio≈Çek (a relative of the noted scholar, Bishop Erazm Cio≈Çek of P≈Çock), who was elected as abbot in 1522, the abbey was restored to its former glory, with a greatly expanded collection of rare books. He died two years after being appointed the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Krak√≥w in 1544, and was buried in the abbey cemetery. This abbot employed the services of the Polish Renaissance painter Stanis≈Çaw Samostrzelnik, known also as Stanis≈Çaw z Mogi≈Çy (c. 1490-1541), who spent his final years working at the abbey, where he died. His frescoes are featured in the right-hand transept and in one of the chapels of the monastery church, including his painting on the forward wall of the chancel from c. 1530.

The broad class of materials often contain sensing abilities that are intended to reproduce the capabilities of human skin to respond to environmental factors such as changes in heat and pressure. Advances in electronic skin research focuses on designing materials that are stretchy, robust, and flexible. Research in the individual fields of flexible electronics and tactile sensing has progressed greatly; however, electronic skin design attempts to bring together advances in many areas of materials research without sacrificing individual benefits from each field. The successful combination of flexible and stretchable mechanical properties with sensors and the ability to self- heal would open the door to many possible applications including soft robotics, prosthetics, artificial intelligence and health monitoring. Recent advances in the field of electronic skin have focused on incorporating green materials ideals and environmental awareness into the design process. As one of the main challenges facing electronic skin development is the ability of the material to withstand mechanical strain and maintain sensing ability or electronic properties, recyclability and self-healing properties are especially critical in the future design of new electronic skins. Rehealable electronic skin Self-healing abilities of electronic skin are critical to potential applications of electronic skin in fields such as soft robotics. Proper design of self-healing electronic skin requires not only healing of the base substrate but also the reestablishment of any sensing functions such as tactile sensing or electrical conductivity. Ideally, the self-healing process of electronic skin does not rely upon outside stimulation such as increased temperature, pressure, or solvation. Self-healing, or rehealable, electronic skin is often achieved through a polymer-based material or a hybrid material. =Polymer-based materials= In 2018, Zou et al. published work on electronic skin that is able to reform covalent bonds when damaged. The group looked at a polyimine-based crosslinked network, synthesized as seen in Figure 1. The e-skin is considered rehealable because of ‚Äúreversible bond exchange,‚Äù meaning that the bonds holding the network together are able to break and reform under certain conditions such as solvation and heating. The rehealable and reusable aspect of such a thermoset material is unique because many thermoset materials irreversibly form crosslinked networks through covalent bonds. In the polymer network the bonds formed during the healing process are indistinguishable from the original polymer network. Figure 1. Polymerization scheme for formation of polyimine-based self-healing electronic skin. Dynamic non-covalent crosslinking has also been shown to form a polymer network that is rehealable. In 2016, Oh et al. looked specifically at semiconducting polymers for organic transistors. They found that incorporating 2,6-pyridine dicarboxamide (PDCA) into the polymer backbone could impart self-healing abilities based on the network of hydrogen bonds formed between groups. With incorporation of PDCA in the polymer backbone, the materials was able to withstand up to 100% strain without showing signs of microscale cracking. In this example, the hydrogen bonds are available for energy dissipation as the strain increases. =Hybrid materials= Polymer networks are able to facilitate dynamic healing processes through hydrogen bonds or dynamic covalent chemistry. However, the incorporation of inorganic particles can greatly expand the functionality of polymer-based materials for electronic skin applications. The incorporation of micro-structured nickel particles into a polymer network (Figure 2) has been shown to maintain self-healing properties based on the reformation of hydrogen bonding networks around the inorganic particles. The material is able to regain its conductivity within 15 seconds of breakage, and the mechanical properties are regained after 10 minutes at room temperature without added stimulus. This material relies on hydrogen bonds formed between urea groups when they align. The hydrogen atoms of urea functional groups are ideally situated to form a hydrogen-bonding network because they are near an electron- withdrawing carbonyl group. This polymer network with embedded nickel particles demonstrates the possibility of using polymers as supramolecular hosts to develop self-healing conductive composites. Figure 2. Self-healing material based on hydrogen bonding and interactions with micro-structured nickel particles. Flexible and porous graphene foams that are interconnected in a 3D manner have also been shown to have self-healing properties. Thin film with poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PDMAA) and reduced graphene oxide have shown high electrical conductivity and self-healing properties. The healing abilities of the hybrid composite are suspected to be due to the hydrogen bonds between the PDMAA chains, and the healing process is able to restore initial length and recover conductive properties.  Recyclable electronic skin  Zou et al. presents an interesting advance in the field of electronic skin that can be used in robotics, prosthetics, and many other applications in the form of a fully recyclable electronic skin material. The e-skin developed by the group consists of a network of covalently bound polymers that are thermoset, meaning cured at a specific temperature. However, the material is also recyclable and reusable. Because the polymer network is thermoset, it is chemically and thermally stable. However, at room temperature, the polyimine material, with or without silver nanoparticles, can be dissolved on the timescale of a few hours. The recycling process allows devices, which are damaged beyond self-healing capabilities, to be dissolved and formed into new devices (Figure 3). This advance opens the door for lower cost production and greener approaches to e-skin development. Figure 3. Recycling process for conductive polyimine-based e-skin.  Flexible and stretchy electronic skin  The ability of electronic skin to withstand mechanical deformation including stretching and flexing without losing functionality is crucial for its applications as prosthetics, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, health monitoring, biocompatibility, and communication devices. Flexible electronics are often designed by depositing electronic materials on flexible polymer substrates, thereby relying on an organic substrate to impart favorable mechanical properties. Stretchable e-skin materials have been approached from two directions. Hybrid materials can rely on an organic network for stretchiness while embedding inorganic particles or sensors, which are not inherently stretchable. Other research has focused on developing stretchable materials that also have favorable electronic or sensing capabilities. Zou et al. studied the inclusion of linkers that are described as ‚Äúserpentine‚Äù in their polyimine matrix. These linkers make the e-skin sensors able to flex with movement and distortion. The incorporation of alkyl spacers in polymer-based materials has also been shown to increase flexibility without decreasing charge transfer mobility. Oh et al. developed a stretchable and flexible material based on 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and non-conjugated 2,6-pyridine dicarboxamide (PDCA) as a source of hydrogen bonds (Figure 4). Figure 4. A stretchable and self-healing semiconducting polymer- based material. Graphene has also been show to be a suitable material for electronic skin applications as well due to its stiffness and tensile strength. Graphene is an appealing material because its synthesis to flexible substrates is scalable and cost-efficient.  Conductive electronic skin  The development of conductive electronic skin is of interest for many electrical applications. Research into conductive electronic skin has taken two routes: conductive self-healing polymers or embedding conductive inorganic materials in non-conductive polymer networks. The self-healing conductive composite synthesized by Tee et al. (Figure 2) investigated the incorporation of micro-structured nickel particles into a polymer host. The nickel particles adhere to the network though favorable interactions between the native oxide layer on the surface of the particles and the hydrogen-bonding polymer. Nanoparticles have also been studied for their ability to impart conductivity on electronic skin materials. Zou et al. embedded silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into a polymer matrix, making the e-skin conductive. The healing process for this material is noteworthy because it not only restores the mechanical properties of the polymer network, but also restores the conductive properties when silver nanoparticles have been embedded in the polymer network.  Sensing ability of electronic skin  Some of the challenges that face electronic skin sensing abilities include the fragility of sensors, the recovery time of sensors, repeatability, overcoming mechanical strain, and long-term stability. =Tactile sensors= Applied pressure can be measured by monitoring changes in resistance or capacitance. Coplanar interdigitated electrodes embedded on single-layer graphene have been shown to provide pressure sensitivity for applied pressure as low as 0.11 kPa through measuring changes in capacitance. Piezoresistive sensors have also shown high levels of sensitivity. Ultrathin molybdenum disulfide sensing arrays integrated with graphene have demonstrated promising mechanical properties capable of pressure sensing. Modifications of organic field effect transistors (OFETs) have shown promise in electronic ski applications. Microstructured polydimethylsiloxane thin films can elastically deform when pressure is applied. The deformation of the thin film allows for storage and release of energy. Visual representation of applied pressure has been one area of interest in development of tactile sensors. The Bao Group at Stanford University have designed an electrochromically active electronic skin that changes color with different amounts of applied pressure. Applied pressure can also be visualized by incorporation of active-matrix organic light-emitting diode displays which emit light when pressure is applied. =Other sensing applications= Humidity sensors have been incorporated in electronic skin design with sulfurized tungsten films. The conductivity of the film changes with different levels of humidity. Silicon nanoribbons have also been studied for their application as temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors.

The Soviet Census conducted in January 1970 was the first census held in Soviet Union (USSR) in eleven years (since January 1959). Summary The Soviet population in 1970 was recorded as being 241,720,134 people, an increase of over 15% from the 208,826,650 people recorded in the Soviet Union in the 1959 Soviet census. While there was speculation that ethnic Russians would become a minority in the Soviet Union in 1970, the 1970 census recorded 53% (a bare majority) of the Soviet population as being ethnic Russians. In terms of total numbers, there were 129,015,140 ethnic Russians in the Soviet Union in 1970. Meanwhile, the largest ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union in 1970 were Ukrainians (40,753,246 in total), Uzbeks (9,195,093 in total), Belarusians (9,051,755 in total), Tatars (5,783,111 in total), Kazakhs (5,298,818 in total), and Azeris (4,379,937 in total). The Jewish population in the Soviet Union unexpectedly declined (by about 5%; from about 2,279,000 to about 2,167,000) between 1959 and 1970, in part due to strong assimilation (especially in the Russian SSR and in the Ukrainian SSR, where three-fourths of all Soviet Jews lived back then). The Muslim population in the Central Asian SSRs increased at a faster rate than the ethnic Russian population between 1959 and 1970 due to its higher birth rate. Indeed, the Muslim population grew by 52% between 1959 and 1970 whereas the ethnic Russian population grew by only 13% during the same time period. In addition, the number of certain ethnic minorities originally from China (especially the Uyghurs) increased in the U.S.S.R. between 1959 and 1970 due to many of them fleeing China during this time period. The ethnic Russian population in the Latvian SSR and in the Estonian SSR rapidly increased between 1959 and 1970 (in total numbers and as a percentage of their populations), while the ethnic Russian population increase in the mostly Roman Catholic Lithuanian SSR during this time period was much smaller. In addition, the ethnic German population in the Soviet Union grew by 14% between 1959 and 1970, from 1.6 million to 1.8 million.

He is the only university coach to achieve 350 men's wins coupled with 250 women's wins and maintains the unique honor of having been the youngest head coach hired in the history of USA collegiate sports. Mello is a recipient of the NSCAA Letter of Commendation. He holds the NCAA Division III record for most consecutive conference wins (42) with his former squad, Luther College. In his first season as a professional coach in 1995, Mello was awarded Co-Coach Of The Year honors while at the helm of the Des Moines Menace of the USISL Premier League. Currently, Mello is head coach of the newly formed men's soccer team at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. Coaching career In 1978, Mello began his coaching career as the youngest head coach in the history of collegiate sports. At age 20, he was hired by Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. At Aquinas, Mello earned All- Conference Honors, and the team became NAIA District 23 champions, allowing them entry to the NAIA regional tournament. In 1983 and 1985, Mello became coach of the men's and women's soccer programs respectively at Siena Heights University. In their first year, the men's team was regionally ranked. Shortly thereafter, the squad made the national tournament. Two years after starting the men's team, Mello also started up the women's program at Siena Heights. Again, his team was immediately successful. In their first year, the women's team was ranked in the top 10 nationally for NAIA schools. By the 3rd year, the squad was ranked #1 in the nation throughout a regular season which saw them defeat NCAA Division I foes Michigan State, Michigan, Ohio State, Wright State and Dayton. The team entered the NAIA national tournament with a 23‚Äì1 record. Despite playing without five starters who suffered season ending injuries in the lead-up to nationals, the Saints managed to complete the season as the 3rd best NAIA team in the country after defeating Berry College. While Mello was at Siena Heights, both programs produced numerous All- Americans. For his role, Mello was named District Coach of the Year a combined five times, and Regional Coach of the Year a combined three times. Mello compiled an 81‚Äì35‚Äì12 record with the men and 53‚Äì10‚Äì6 with the women. In 2002, Siena Heights University inducted Mello into its Hall of Fame. =University of the Southwest= In 1989, Mello spent a single season at University of the Southwest in Hobbs, NM, before moving to Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. His lone season at University of the Southwest was a solid one. He led the men's team to the district finals while also leading the women's team to the district championship trophy. =Carroll College= Mello resigned from Hendrix College upon being offered the opportunity to be the first coach of the Carroll College Fighting Saints men's soccer team.http://helenair.com/sports/college/carroll-college/soccer/carroll-names- mello-first-men-s-soccer- coach/article_3ffb0302-b935-11e3-a648-001a4bcf887a.html Already having a cabin in Montana, being an avid fly fisherman and recognizing the special opportunity Carroll College offered him were primary factors in his decision. In his first year at the helm of the Saints, Mello led Carroll to a 6‚Äì11‚Äì1 record. A year and an additional recruiting class later, the Saints flipped the wins and losses and ended the season at 11‚Äì6‚Äì2. That win-loss-tie record saw the Saints finish 5th place in the 14 team Cascade Conference and earned them a trip to the newly formed conference's postseason tournament. =Professional coaching career= In addition to his collegiate duties, Mello also served as head coach of the Des Moines Menace during the 1995 USISL Premier League season. He was co-Coach of the Year with fellow Menace head coach Blair Reid. They took the Menace to the Sizzlin‚Äô Four Tournament where they finished fourth. In 1996, Mello was sole head coach of the Sioux City Breeze. In 1997 and 1998, he moved indoors with the Tallahassee Scorpions of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League. At present, over 60 of Coach Mello's former players have given back to the game in the form of coaching at the collegiate level. Additionally, many of his former players have served as high school and club coaches. Specially, two of his former players, Miriam Kronienberg Hickey and Michael Kim, have represented their respected countries as national team coaches. Kronienberg Hickey was a women's national team coach for the Netherlands. Kim was a men's national team coach for South Korea.

It is today used in a variant for the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. Its basic appearance is based on the coat of arms of the √Årp√°d dynasty. History Painting of Dubrovnik (17th century) - arms in upper corner During the intermittent administration of Dubrovnik by Byzantine Empire, which lasted until 1205, the use of heraldic symbols such as coat of arms was not in practice. The city used Byzantine imperial flags until 1171.Milan Re≈°etar, Dubrovaƒçka numizmatika I, page 619 When Dubrovnik passed to the Republic of Venice the official symbol became the Lion of Saint Mark. With the end of the Venetian rule all the symbols of the previous government were removed, with only one stone tablet remaining showing the Venetian lion.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 343 =Coat of arms with red and white bars= With the Treaty of Zadar the Republic of Venice relinquished its claims on the eastern coast of the Adriatic in favour of the Hungarian king Louis I and the Venetians left Dubrovnik for good. With the Treaty of Visegr√°d in 1358, between Dubrovnik and Louis I., they have committed to use his flag or coat of arms which contained the mentioned arms of √Årp√°d dynasty (red and white bars). In 1359 they ordered flags to be made from Venice containing the arms of Kingdom of Hungary and in 1362 they also ordered flags with Saint Blaise.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 344 According to some sources the use of the Hungarian arms depended on various foreign policy conditions and so the government of the Republic of Ragusa issued an order to all ship captains that they should not assert any other symbols except those of the Republic (with Saint Blaise) and those of the Hungarian kingdom.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 345 In Dubrovnik the coat of arms with the red and white bars became widely accepted as the arms of the Republic and as such the Republic kept its use even after the Republic of Ragusa became independent from the affairs of the Kingdom of Hungary. Although it was recognized as a sign of submission to the King, the arms were now generally accepted as a sign of sovereignty of the Dubrovnik Republic.Zdenka Janekoviƒá-R√∂mer, Okvir slobode, page 364 However, unlike the Hungarian coat of arms, which begins with a red bar at the top, the Ragusan coat of arms was inverted so that it began with a white bar, and that version eventually prevailed.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 345 One of the rare (and possibly the only) trace of the arms description in written form is mentioned in a book about voting customs and regulations of the Republic called Copioso ristretto degli annali di Rausa by Jakov Lukariƒá (Giacomo Di Pietro Luccari) published in Venice 1605. On page 155 of the book, while describing the electoral procedure, Lukariƒá mentions the ballot boxes with the arms of the Republic - four white bars on a red shield. Jakov Lukariƒá - Copioso ristretto degli annali di Rausa, page 155 Accessed 24 June 2013 These arms were in use until the dissolution of the Republic in 1808.Frane ƒåizmiƒá, Dr≈æavni grb Dubrovaƒçke Republike, page 32 There are numerous examples of the arms: * Rector's Palace - painting of Saint Blaise from 15th century. The arms can be observed in the upper corner of the painting. * Rector's Palace - memorial painting of Vladislav Buƒçiƒá (de Bucchia) from 17th century, by the side of the memorial there are arms of the republic with white and red bars. * Rector's Palace - painting of Dubrovnik from the 17th century before the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake showing the arms in the upper left corner. * Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá - Stematographia sive armorum illiricorum delineatio, descriptio et restitutio (published in Vienna, 1701).

The arms are identical in appearance to the official arms of city of Dubrovnik in use today, but with blue and red bars.Pomorski muzej Accessed 1 August 2013 Today the original √Årp√°d version of arms (red and white bars) are the official arms of the city of Dubrovnik. =Coat of arms with blue and red bars= Arms of other colors, predominantly blue and red bars, also appear on several historical documents, and some researchers believe that these arms mostly varied in color due to the personal interpretation of the authors who made them.Frane ƒåizmiƒá, Dr≈æavni grb Dubrovaƒçke Republike, page 22 Due to different interpretations of the arms, white (silver) bars started to be replaced by blue bars somewhere at the end of the 18th century. Beginning with the 18th century some arms interpretations started to show white bars being decorated with blue template lines within them until the end of the 18th century when arms with fully blue bars started to appear.Frane ƒåizmiƒá, Dr≈æavni grb Dubrovaƒçke Republike, page 32 In the State Archive of Dubrovnik there is a map of the Republic of Ragusa (1747) made by Mihajlo Pe≈°iƒá. On the lower end of the map the arms of the Republic are visible showing white and red bars, with the white bars being richly decorated with blue template lines within them. One of the most significant Armorials for Dubrovnik heraldic legacy is the one by Ivo Saraka. It can also be seen in the transcription book of Dubrovnik law codes, most likely compiled around the year 1746. It contains several pages of colored arms of Dubrovnik nobility with the arms of the Republic on top. It shows the arms with blue and red lines, however blue lines are interlaced with decorative templates - wavy lines of different shades of blue. Vito Galzinski (who wrote on the heraldry of the Republic) considers that the author's intention was to emphasize the silver coating of the bars.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 347 That same manuscript was also used for the procedure of confirming one's noble status and also as a base for the restoration of the mentioned armorial. During the restoration, which was finished in Split in 1956, the darkened silver-coated lines were completely colored blue. At that time there was no serious and systematic research of the history of the Ragusan coat of arms and it was widely believed that the colors were blue and red.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, pages 346-347 The restored armorial is today kept in the Rector's Palace.

He has been described as a \\"visionary\\" and the \\"legendary\\" \\"engineering father\\" of non-linear video editing, and has been recognized for his contributions to a range of technologies important to the advancement of television and video as well as several other accomplishments.  Early life  Ettlinger was born on January 26, 1925, and studied Electrical Engineering at Purdue University, graduating in 1944. Family Adrian Ettlinger's parents were Eli and Ruth Ettlinger, his sister Geraldine. He was married to Carol Burns Ettlinger and had two children: Michael and Amanda. He was also the nephew of Hyman Ettlinger who served on the Math faculty and as a football coach at the University of Texas for many years and authored notable math text books.  Work at CBS  Ettlinger entered the world of television engineering when he joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as an electrical engineer. While at CBS, among other innovations, he: * Led the development of the first computerized on-air television switching control system. * Conceptualized and was the project coordinator for the first practical stop- action instant replay system. He accepted the Emmy award for this invention at the 1966 ceremonies. * Developed the first advanced computer-controlled theater lighting system which was the first to use a video display. \\\\- . \\\\- \\\\- * Conceived and led the development of the first non-linear video editing system: the Emmy Award-winning CMX 600. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- \\\\-  Post-CBS Video Editing and Lighting Control Work  After leaving CBS in 1970, Ettlinger worked as a consultant and with several technology companies. Skirpan Lighting Control marketed the lighting system that he had developed while at CBS after CBS chose not to pursue commercial applications. Installations of the system included Wolf Trap Farm Park outside Washington DC, all three of the major television networks of the time, as well as other theatrical installations. He also participated in the development of the \\"CBS- Sony\\" editing system. He then developed the \\"Ediflex\\" video editing system and co-founded the company Cinedco to market it. This system received an Emmy award in 1986, was widely used in both television and film productions, and was important to the broadening acceptance and use of non-linear video editing. Awards and recognition Ettlinger was the 1976 recipient of the David Sarnoff Medal from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. The Sarnoff medal is awarded annually for contributions to television engineering. He was given the award ‚Äù[f]or his important contributions to the application of computers to on-air television station switching control, for conceiving of the application of video disc stop-action systems to sports broadcasts, and for contributions to computer control of studio lighting systems and videotape editing systems.‚Äù In 1996 Videography magazine, in its 20th anniversary publication The Age of Videography, named Ettlinger as one of the 18, then-living, \\"People Who Made a Difference\\" in video production technology, calling him \\"[t]he father of modern video post [production].\\" He was profiled in Post: The Magazine for Post Production Professionals as \\"The Father of Electronic Editing.\\" To Every U.S. County and other accomplishments After retiring from the television industry Ettlinger engaged in a number of other projects of note. In July 1993 he completed a decades-long effort of visiting every county in the United States, with the last being Blanco County, TX. In honor of this accomplishment Ettlinger and his wife, Carol Burns Ettlinger, were made honorary citizens of the county by Judge Charles Scott. Ettlinger had also walked every street in Manhattan end-to-end in the 1950s into the early 1960s. Another earlier activity was running as the Democratic candidate for mayor of Hastings-on- Hudson, New York, in 1971, advocating for a local fair housing ordinance. He also served as chairman of the Hastings-on-Hudson, New York Democratic Committee. = AniMap = In connection with his interest in counties, Ettlinger developed the program AniMap which allows the user to see the county outline map of any state in any year. This has proved useful for those studying genealogy. = FreeCell-related Research and Development = Another post-career project was co-authoring of an enhanced FreeCell implementation called FreeCell Pro.

Rintel was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the time that his father, Rev. Myer Rintel, was minister of the Hebrew congregation. Moses was the first duly authorised Jewish clergyman to come out to the colony. Rintel arrived in Sydney in 1844, where he established the Sydney Hebrew Academy, of which he became the principal. In 1849 he accepted the office of minister of the newly established Jewish congregation of Melbourne, subject to the approval of the Rev. Chief Rabbi, Dr. Adler, which was soon after obtained. He married, the same year, a Miss Elvina Hart, and had had a family of nine children. Circumstances compelled him to resign his charge following a split in the congregation that led to the formation of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, where he was appointed minister. In the year 1864, mainly through his exertions, a duly constituted Beth Din, the only one out of London, was established, of which he acted as the chairman; and in 1868 the Chief Rabbi of Great Britain and its dependencies assigned to him the position and title of Senior Minister of the Melbourne Hebrew community. For many years he took a deep interest in the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society, in which he has not only held all the various offices, but has, on more than one occasion, been elected its president. Through his efforts this society was allowed to participate in the Government grant in aid of charitable institutions, and for which the members voted him a very handsome testimonial. He, with a few others, founded the United Friends' Jewish Benefit Society in 1856, of which he became the first president. His sphere of usefulness was not limited to matters in connection with his own faith; he has been for many years past and still continues to be connected with various societies and institutions. He was one of the founders of the Benevolent Asylum, and acted as Grand Chaplain from 1850. Rintel died in Melbourne on 9 May 1880.

Likely introduced to Naples from the northern Italian city of Genoa during the Renaissance, it has since become famous in Campania and forgotten elsewhere. The sauce is unusual for the long preparation time used to soften and flavor the onions. History Despite its name, which means \\"in the style of Genoa,\\" Genovese sauce is a principal pasta sauce of Naples and an important part of its culinary history, having been introduced to the city in the 15th or 16th centuries. The sauce may have been brought by Genovese immigrants or merchants, at a time when Genoa and Naples were two of Italy's most important ports. It could also be referring to its inventor's name, since Genovese is a widespread surname in Campania. Genovese sauce is now unknown beyond Campania. The sauce's use of onions may reflect a French influence, and resembles Boeuf √† la mode. During the mid 19th century, ‚ÄòSalmon in Hollandaise and Genovese sauce‚Äô was served in the Grand V√©four restaurant of the Palais- Royal in Paris as a luxury dish. Genovese sauce is not to be confused with Pesto from Genoa and Liguria, nor with Salsa Genovese, a red wine and vegetable condiment for fish, nor with the sauce g√©nevoise from Lake Geneva, again served with fish. Preparation Genovese sauce is prepared by saut√©ing either beef or veal in a large number of onions, for at least two but as many as ten hours. The onions are typically accompanied by minced carrots and celery in what is known as a soffritto. The slow cooking of the onions is especially important for the sauce's flavor, and is facilitated by incremental additions of white wine, stock, or both. The sauce and accompanying pasta can be served with the meat from the sauce or separately, garnished with tomatoes, and topped with pecorino. Large, cylindrical pasta like rigatoni, ziti or candele are favored because they can hold the rich sauce. =Ingredients for 4 plates= Meat 600 g, golden onions 1 kg, carrots 60 g, celery 60 g, olive oil.

It has been known to escape cultivation and become naturalized in areas of appropriate climate; it can be found growing wild in parts of New Zealand and Australia. It favours a Mediterranean climate, often coastal, typically colonizing disturbed soil. It is an annual herb producing a single, erect, branching stem which grows to a height 1 to 1.5 metres tall.

He began his activism as one of the \\"Kaho‚Äòolawe Nine,\\" a group of activists who were the first to land on the island of Kaho‚Äòolawe in January 1976 in opposition to the military bombing that was then taking place on the island. Other occupations took place and Ritte, along with Richard Sawyer, occupied and stayed hidden on the island for 35 days, an act which led to his arrest and brief imprisonment. The island was eventually returned to the State of Hawai‚Äòi. Ritte remains an activist, focusing his opposition on overdevelopment and GMOs. He is also a Hawaiian practitioner and educator. He is married to Loretta Ritte, a fellow activist and a former Miss Hawai‚Äòi (1966).  Birth and early life Walter was born on April 12, 1945, on the island of Maui. His father is also named Walter Ritte Jr. and his mother is Hi'iaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele (n√©e Purdy). Ritte attended Kamehameha Schools beginning from the 7th grade. He graduated from Kamehameha Schools (Kapalama Campus) in 1963. He attended the University of Hawai‚Äòi at Manoa and then returned to Moloka‚Äòi.  Activism  The effort to regain Kaho‚Äòolawe from the U.S. Navy began in the early 1970s with the Protect Kaho ªolawe  ªOhana, who began protesting on the island of Moloka ªi, which inspired a new political awareness and activism within the Hawaiian community. Kahu Charles Maxwell and other community leaders began to plan a coordinated effort to land on the island, which was then under Navy control. The effort for the \\"first landing\\" began in Waikapu (Maui) on January 5, 1976. Over 50 people from across the Hawaiian islands, including a range of cultural leaders, gathered on Maui with the goal of \\"invading\\" Kahoolawe on January 6, 1976. The date was selected because of its association with the United States' bicentennial anniversary. As the larger group headed towards the island, they were intercepted by military crafts. \\"The Kaho‚Äòolawe Nine\\" continued and successfully landed on the island. They were Walter Ritte, Emmett Aluli, George Helm, Gail Kawaipuna Prejean, Stephen K. Morse, Kimo Aluli, Aunty Ellen Miles, Ian Lind, and Karla Villalba of the Puyallup/Muckleshoot tribe (Washington State). The effort to retake Kaho‚Äòolawe would eventually claims the lives of George Helm and Kimo Mitchell. In an effort to reach Kaho‚Äòolawe, Helm and Mitchell (who were also accompanied by Billy Mitchell, no relation) ran into severe weather and were unable to reach the island. Despite extensive rescue and recovery efforts, they were never recovered. Ritte became a leader in the Hawaiian community, coordinating community efforts including for water rights, opposition to land development, and the protection of marine animals and ocean resources. He currently leads the effort to create state legislation requiring the labeling of GMOs in Hawai‚Äòi. In July 2019, Ritte was arrested while protesting the construction of a giant telescope on Mauna Kea.

Christianity Die Bibel in Bildern (Revelation) engraving. Enlightenment motto \\"Sapere aude\\" is tattooed in the upper back. Christian couple with matching cross symbol tattoos to associate with their faith Some Christians take issue with tattooing, upholding the Hebrew prohibition (see below). The Hebrew prohibition is based on interpreting Leviticus 19:28‚Äî\\"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you\\"‚Äîso as to prohibit tattoos, and perhaps even makeup. Interpretations of the passage vary, however. Some believe that it refers specifically to, and exclusively prohibits, an ancient form of self-mutilation during mourning (as discussed in the Judaism section). Under this interpretation, tattooing is permitted to Jews and Christians. Others hold that the prohibition of Leviticus 19:28, regardless of its interpretation, is not binding upon Christians‚Äîjust as prohibitions like \\"nor shall there come upon you a garment of cloth made of two kinds of stuff\\" (Lev. 19:19) are not binding‚Äîbecause it is part of the Jewish ceremonial law, binding only upon the Jewish people (see ). Some Christian groups, such as the Knights of St. John of Malta, sported tattoos to show their allegiance. A decline often occurred in other cultures following European efforts to convert aboriginal and indigenous people to Western religious and cultural practices that held tribal tattooing to be a \\"pagan\\" or \\"heathen\\" activity. Within some traditional indigenous cultures, tattooing takes place within the context of a rite of passage between adolescence and adulthood (without any explicit religious subtext). Christian Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina started tattooing, especially of children, for perceived protection against forced conversion to Islam and enslavement during the Ottoman occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (see Christian tattooing in Bosnia and Herzegovina). This form of tattooing continued long past its original motivation. Tattooing was performed during springtime or during special religious celebrations such as the Feast of St. Joseph, and consisted mostly of Christian crosses on hands, fingers, forearms, and below the neck and on the chest.Customs and folkways of Jewish life, Theodor Herzl Gaster Orthodox Coptic Christians who live in Egypt commonly tattoo themselves with the symbols of Coptic crosses on their right wrists, the history of this custom is similar to that of the Christian Croat tattoos. Among Mormons, getting a tattoo is not considered sinful, but it is discouraged as it is altering the creation of God. Christianity-related tattoos are highly common among military veterans and born-again Christians (people that lived difficult lives and rediscovered spirituality). Many Christians with tattoos will have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body although some people will still have tattoos from the Bible despite not being Christian. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalm 23. Islam Woman applying a henna temporary tattoo in Morocco. Scholars who claim that tattooing is a sin support their view by pointing to hadiths such as one in Sahih al-Bukhari narrated by Abu Juhayfah that declares \\"The Prophet cursed the one who does tattoos and the one who has a tattoo done.\\" These scholars generally do not hold the view that non-permanent tattoos such as henna are sinful; nor do they claim that converts to Islam who had tattoos prior to conversion need to get those tattoos removed. Turkish professor of religious studies Remzi Kuscular states that tattoos are sinful but that they do not violate a Muslim's wu·∏ç≈´ æ. Canadian Islamic scholar Sheikh Ahmad Kutty states that tattooing prohibitions exist in Islam to protect Muslims from HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other diseases that can be transferred to people through tattoos.. There is no direct mention of \\"al-washm\\" or \\"tattooing\\" in the Qur'an. = History = G√∂ran Larsson, a Swedish professor in religious studies, states that there are \\"both historical and contemporary examples indicating that, at different times and in different places, [tattooing] was practiced by certain Islamic groups.\\" Al-Tabari mentions in History of the Prophets and Kings that the hands of Asma bint Umais were tattooed. Muslims in Africa, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran and West Pakistan have used tattoos for beautification, prophylaxis, and the prevention of diseases. Edward William Lane described the tattooing customs of Egyptian Muslim women in his 1836 book, An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians. In a 1909 trip to Persia, Percy Sykes observed Shia Muslim women had \\"birds, owers, or gazelles tattooed, but occasionally verses from the Koran\\" and that victorious male wrestlers and gymnasts were honored with the tattooing of a lion on the arm. In a 1965 article published in the journal Man: A Record of Anthropological Science, author John Carswell documented that Sunni and Shia Muslims in Lebanon would get tattoos of the swords of Abu Bakr and Ali, respectively, to distinguish themselves from one another. According to historians Shoshana-Rose Marzel and Guy Stiebel, face tattoos were common among Muslim women until the 1950s but have since fallen out of fashion. Traditional Tunisian tattoos include eagles, the sun, the moon, and stars. Tattoos were also used in the Ottoman Empire due to the influx of Algerian sailors in the 17th century. Bedouin and Kurdish women have a long tradition of tattooed bodies. Margo DeMello, a cultural anthropologist and professor at Canisius College, notes that tattoos are still common in some parts of the Muslim world such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. Underground tattoos have also been gaining popularity among Iranian youth. Some Turkish youth get tattoos as a form of resistance, fashion, or as part of a counterculture. Tattoos are also gaining popularity among young Muslims in the West. = Sunni Islam = The majority of Sunni Muslims believe tattooing is a sin, because it involves changing the natural creation of God, inflicting unnecessary pain in the process. Tattoos are classified as dirty things, which is prohibited from the Islam religion. They believe that a dirty body will directly lead to a dirty mind and will destroy their wudhu, ritual ablution. Some Shafi'i scholars such as Amjad Rasheed argue that tattooing causes impurity and that tattoos were prohibited by the Prophet Muhammad. They also claim that those who are decorated with tattoos are contaminated with najas, due to potential mixture of blood and coloured pigment that remains upon the surface of the skin. But, blood is viewed as being filthy so a person with a tattoo is not appropriate to practice the religion. However, in the present day, it is possible to get a tattoo without mixing dye with blood after it exits onto the outer surface of the body, leaving a possibility for a Muslim to wear a tattoo and perform a valid prayer. Scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi states that tattoos are sinful because they are an expression of vanity and they alter the physical creation of God. According to the online South African Deobandi fatwa service called Ask-the-Imam, Muslims should remove any tattoos they have if possible or cover them in some way. Even though Indonesia is the biggest Sunni Islam base in the world, there are hundreds of tattoo studios and shops that are currently operating. The majority of the customers are the younger generations who are involved in the punk community. Unlike the religious perspective, Islam‚Äôs lay population history, tattoo has been viewed as a source of healing and medicinal usage. Larsson, G. (2011). Islam and tattooing: an old question, a new research topic. Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis, 23, 237-256. https://doi.org/10.30674/scripta.67390 = Shia Islam = Shia Ayatollahs Ali al-Sistani and Ali Khamenei believe there are no authoritative Islamic prohibitions on tattoos. The Quran does not mention tattoos or tattooing at all. Grand Ayatollah Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi ruled: \\"Tattoos are considered Makruh (disliked and discouraged). However, it is not permissible to have Quranic verses, names of Ahlulbayt (a.s), drawings of Imams (a.s), Hadiths, unislamic and inappropriate images or the likes tattooed onto the body. And if the ink was the type that remains above the skin, then it would be considered prohibited. However, if it was of the type to go beneath the skin, it would be considered permissible but Makruh.\\" = Punk Muslim = The Punk Muslim community is open about the concept of tattoos because they view it as an identity for punks. The gradual integration of tattoo in the community helped to comprehend the social norms in the Muslim population; tattoos brought a natural bond amounts the group. For example, the punk society has always been viewed as not meeting the standard norm of the Islamic religion. As a result, when someone sees another person with a tattoo, he or she will recognize that they are affiliated in the same group. Even though the practice of tattooing leads to formulating a personal identity, it mainly created a social identity in the community. The community feels indifferent about the negative perspectives that they receive and actually views it as a challenge from the norm society. Even though the Punk Muslim members are not accepted and welcomed in the general society, there are certain locations where tattoos will be a sign of confidence and pride. A popular setting where this is true are music performances and festivals. Furthermore, The Punk community does not neglect or hide their tattoos during religious practices as well. During simple religious acts such as praying and reading the Quran, they openly show the tattoos both in private or public spaces. As a result, Punk Muslim life style is not following the norm of the Islam practice, but taking a innovative route instead. They chose to express and practice their religion in different methods.  Judaism  Famous Jewish American NFL player Igor Olshansky has many tattoos, including two Stars of David on his neck.\\"San Francisco 49Eers Select Jewish Safety Taylor Mays \\". San Francisco Sentinel. April 30, 2010. Retrieved May 13, 2010 He is regularly featured in Jewish news publications. Tattoos are generally forbidden in Judaism based on the Torah (Leviticus 19:28): \\"You shall not make gashes in your flesh for the dead, or incise any marks on yourselves: I am the Lord.\\" The prohibition is explained by contemporary rabbis as part of a general prohibition on body modification (with the exception of circumcision) that does not serve a medical purpose (such as to correct a deformity). Maimonides, a leading 12th-century scholar of Jewish law and thought, explains that one of the reasons for the prohibition against tattoos is a Jewish response to paganism. Orthodox Jews, in application of Halakha (Jewish Law), reveal Leviticus 19:28 prohibits getting tattoos: \\"Do not make gashes in your skin for the dead. Do not make any marks on your skin. I am God.\\" One reading of Leviticus is to apply it only to the specific ancient practice of rubbing the ashes of the dead into wounds; but modern tattooing is included in other religious interpretations. Orthodox/Traditional Jews also point to Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 180:1, that elucidates the biblical passage above as a prohibition against markings beyond the ancient practice, including tattoos. Maimonides concluded that regardless of intent, the act of tattooing is prohibited (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Idolatry 12:11). Conservative Jews point to the next verse of the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 180:2): \\"If it [the tattoo] was done in the flesh of another, the one to whom it was done is blameless\\" - this is used by them to say that tattooing yourself is different from obtaining a tattoo, and that the latter may be acceptable. Orthodox Jews disagree, and read the text as referring to forced tattooing‚Äîas was done during the Holocaust‚Äîwhich is not considered a violation of Jewish Law on the part of the victim. In another vein, cutting into the skin to perform surgery and temporary tattooing used for surgical purposes (e.g.: to mark the lines of an incision) are permitted in the Shulhan Arukh 180:3. In most sectors of the religious Jewish community, having a tattoo does not prohibit participation, and one may be buried in a Jewish cemetery and participate fully in all synagogue ritual. Reform Jews and Reconstructionist Jews forbid tattooing. In modern times, the association of tattoos with Nazi concentration camps and the Holocaust has added another level of revulsion to the practice of tattooing, even among many otherwise fairly secular Jews. It is a common misconception that anyone bearing a tattoo is not permitted to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. Neopagan Neopagans can use the process and the outcome of tattooing as an expression or representation of their beliefs. Many tattooists' websites offer pagan images as examples of the kinds of provided artwork. At least one Wiccan Tradition uses a tattoo as a mark of Initiation, although it is an entitlement, not a requirement. Buddhism Southeast Asia has a tradition of protective tattoos known as sak yant or yantra tattoos that incorporate Buddhist symbols and images, as well as protective mantras or sutra verses in antique Khmer script. These tattoos are sometimes applied by Buddhist monks or practitioners of indigenous spiritual traditions. Traditionally, tattoos that included images of the Buddha or other religious figures were only applied to certain parts of the body, and sometimes required commitment on the part of the recipient to observe the Five Precepts or other traditional customs. Incorporation of images of the Buddha into tattoos that do not comply with traditional norms for respectful display have been a cause of controversy in a number of traditional Buddhist countries, where the display of images of this type by Westerners may be regarded as appropriation and has resulted in barred entry or deportation of individuals displaying tattoos of this type. Hinduism Tattoos are allowed culturally and religiously; contemporary tattoos are common among traditional Hindus. Historical roots date back to the practice of Mehndi using Henna.

Category:Tattooing and religion ","title":"Religious perspectives on tattooing"},{"id":"40055691","text":"Modern tattoo machine in use: here outfitted with a 5-needle setup, but number of needles depends on size and shading desired.The process or technique of tattooing, creating a tattoo, involves the insertion of pigment into the skin's dermis. Traditionally, tattooing often involved rubbing pigment into cuts. Modern tattooing almost always requires the use of a tattoo machine and often procedures and accessories to reduce the risk to human health. Physiological process of tattooing Man getting a tattoo Tattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.Tattoo lasers / Histology, Suzanne Kilmer, eMedicine Traditional tattooing Traditional tattooing among the Dayak people of West Borneo, c. 1927 Some tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand- tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles. Traditional Japanese tattoos (irezumi) are still \\"hand-poked,\\" that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and hand held tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. This method is known as tebori. Traditional Hawaiian hand-tapped tattoos are experiencing a renaissance, after the practice was nearly extinguished in the years following Western contact. The process involves lengthy protocols and prayers and is considered a sacred rite more than an application of artwork. The tattooist chooses the design, rather than the wearer, based on genealogical information. Each design is symbolic of the wearer's personal responsibility and role in the community. Tools are hand-carved from bone or tusk without the use of metal.\\"Marked\\" Article by Shannon Wianecki in Maui No Ka 'Oi Magazine, Vol.15 No. 4 July 2011 Modern tattooing Traditional two coil tattoo machine The most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. This modern procedure is ordinarily sanitary. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. The equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. Prices for this service vary widely globally and locally, depending on the complexity of the tattoo, the skill and expertise of the artist, the attitude of the customer, the costs of running a business, the economics of supply and demand, etc. The time it takes to get a tattoo is in proportion with its size and complexity. A small one of simple design might take 15 minutes, whereas an elaborate sleeve tattoo or back piece requires multiple sessions that may consist of several hours at a time ranging over months or even years. In 1891 the first electric tattoo needle was invented in New York City by modifying Thomas Edison's electric engraving pen. This made the process cheaper and faster; it was taken up by the poor and abandoned by the rich. O'Reilly's machine was based on the rotary technology of the electric engraving device invented by Thomas Edison. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils. The first coil machine was patented by Thomas Riley in London in 1891, using a single coil. The first twin-coil machine, the predecessor of the modern configuration, was invented by another Englishman, Alfred Charles South of London, in 1899. Another tattoo machine was developed 1970-1978 by the German tattoo artists Horst Heinrich Streckenbach (1929‚Äì2001) and Manfred Kohrs.Vgl. Marcel Feige, Das Tattoo-und Piercing Lexikon, S. 282, = Permanent Make-up = Permanent Makeup or Semi-Permanent Makeup tattoos are cosmetic tattoos that are meant to alter pigmentation in the facial features. Some types of permanent makeup are used for medical conditions, such as to cover up scars or vitiligo, while other types are simply for aesthetic reasons like tattooing eyeliner, lip color or eyebrows. The pigment is inserted into the surface of the skin in patterns to be able to cover the desired areas. Permanent Makeup is typically done with some form of tattoo machine. There are machines now that are needle-less which should result in less painful procedures. These needle-free devices are considered safer and more sterile to use than traditional tattoo machines. They are designed to create a more comforting experience during the application process and eliminate the possibility of spreading disease like HIV, hepatitis and other healthcare issues. The needle- less device is also capable of inserting the pigment deeper into the skin than machines that use needles. There are several different ways to get rid of these tattoos, the most common being laser removals. It is suggested that different color pigments should be removed with different lasers in order to reduce the risk of scarring and ink retention. The needle-free machines also have the capability of removing or lightening the pigment from the skin as well by adding in a removal solution into the skin. Permanent Makeup or micropigmentation is much like any tattoo and can have side effects over time. Infections, fading, scarring, inflammation, and allergic reactions are just a few of the side effects that have been reported from patients who received permanent makeup procedures. = Nipple-Areola Tattoos = Tattoos have also made an entrance into the medical field. Nipple-areola tattoos are a form of medical tattoos that can be done for those who lost their nipple during a mastectomy and had breast reconstruction surgery. The tattoo artist tries to recreate the same pigment and shape as the original nipple and areola, although it may not always result in an exact replica as the patient‚Äôs old nipple. The tattoo may not be the exact or desired shade of the nipple that the patient originally had because the artist may make the tattoo a bit darker in order for the tattoo to lighten up over time, ultimately resulting in the correct shade. The machine that is used during the procedure will also affect the color that the tattoo has and how the pigment will react with the skin. Not all nipple-areola tattoos are successful. There is a chance that the tattoo could get infected just as any tattoo can. In a study from 1988‚Äî1993 of 103 patients who received nipple-areola tattoos, 5 patients reported getting an infection, 1 patient reported getting a rash, one reported getting slough, and 19 patients had to have their tattoo touched up due to the pigment diminishing from the tattoo through the healing process. Nipple-areola tattoos tend to be one of the final steps to breast reconstruction surgery. In the study of those who received the tattoos, 86% said that they would get the procedure done again if they needed to. =Dyes and pigments= A variety of inks at a station in a tattoo shop. The small paper cups on the counter are used for mixing inks. Early tattoo inks were obtained directly from nature and were extremely limited in pigment variety. In ancient Hawaii, for example, kukui nut ash was blended with coconut oil to produce an ebony ink. Today, an almost unlimited number of colors and shades of tattoo ink are mass-produced and sold to parlors worldwide. Tattoo artists commonly mix these inks to create their own unique pigments. A wide range of dyes and pigments can be used in tattoos, from inorganic materials like titanium dioxide and iron oxides to carbon black, azo dyes, and acridine, quinoline, phthalocyanine and naphthol derivatives, dyes made from ash, and other mixtures. Iron oxide pigments are used in greater extent in cosmetic tattooing. Modern tattooing inks are carbon-based pigments that have uses outside of commercial tattoo applications. Concern has been expressed over the interaction between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and tattoo pigments, some of which contain trace metals. The magnetic fields produced by MRI machines interact with these metals, including nonferrous metal particles, and while rare, are capable of causing first-degree or second-degree burns or distortions in the image. The type and density of the ink as well as shape of the tattoo may increase the risk, particularly if the shape approximates an RF pick-up loop. The television show MythBusters tested the hypothesis, and found a slight interaction between commonly used tattoo inks and MRI. The interaction was stronger with inks containing high levels of iron oxide. =Studio hygiene= Procedures Tattoo artist drawing a design on a client before permanent tattooing. Disposable gloves are used in modern tattooing for hygiene. The properly equipped tattoo studio will use biohazard containers for objects that have come into contact with blood or bodily fluids, sharps containers for old needles, and an autoclave for sterilizing tools. Certain jurisdictions also require studios by law to have a sink in the work area supplied with both hot and cold water. Proper hygiene requires a body modification artist to wash his or her hands before starting to prepare a client for the stencil, between clients, and at any other time when cross contamination can occur. The use of single use gloves is also mandatory and disposed after each stage of tattooing. The same gloves should not be used to clean the tattoo station, tattoo the client, and clean the tattoo. In some states and countries it is illegal to tattoo a minor even with parental consent, and (except in the case of medical tattoos) it is forbidden to tattoo impaired persons, people with contraindicated skin conditions, those who are pregnant or nursing, those incapable of consent due to mental incapacity, or those under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Before the tattooing begins the client is asked to approve the final position of the applied stencil. After approval is given the artist will open new, sterile needle packages in front of the client, and always use new, sterile, or sterile disposable instruments and supplies, and fresh ink for each session (loaded into disposable ink caps which are discarded after each client). Also, all areas which may be touched with contaminated gloves will be wrapped in clear plastic to prevent cross- contamination. Equipment that cannot be autoclaved (such as counter tops, machines, and furniture) will be wiped with an approved disinfectant. Incentives for continuing education Membership in professional organizations or certificates of appreciation/achievement generally help artists to be aware of the latest trends. Most tattooists do not belong to any association. Training and certification requirements While specific requirements to become a tattooist vary between jurisdictions, many mandate only formal training in blood borne pathogens and cross contamination. The local department of health regulates tattoo studios in many jurisdictions. For example, according to the health departments in Oregon and Hawaii, tattoo artists in these states are required to take and pass a test ascertaining their knowledge of health and safety precautions as well as the current state regulations. Performing a tattoo in Oregon without a proper and current license or in an unlicensed facility is a felony offense. Tattooing was legalized in New York City in 1997, in Massachusetts in 2000 and Oklahoma between 2002 and 2006. =Aftercare= Tattoo specific salves have become widespread in recent years. Tattoo artists and people with tattoos vary widely in their preferred methods of caring for new tattoos. Some artists recommend keeping a new tattoo wrapped for the first 24 hours while others suggest removing temporary bandaging after two hours or less to allow the skin to breathe. Many tattooists advise against allowing too much contact with hot tub, pool water or soaking in a tub for the first two weeks to prevent the tattoo ink from washing out. In contrast other artists suggest that a new tattoo be bathed in very hot water early. General consensus for care advises against removing the flakes or scab that may form on a new tattoo, and avoiding exposing a new tattoo to the sun for extended periods for at least three weeks; both of these can contribute to fading of the image. It is agreed that a new tattoo needs to be kept clean. Various products may be recommended for application to the skin, ranging from those intended for the treatment of cuts, burns and scrapes, to panthenol, cocoa butter, A&D;, hemp, lanolin, or salves. Oil based ointments are almost always recommended for use on very thin layers due to their inability to evaporate and therefore over-hydrate the already perforated skin. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that wounds that are kept moist heal faster than wounds healing under dry conditions. In recent years specific commercial products have been developed for tattoo aftercare. Although opinions about these products vary, soap and warm water work well to keep a tattoo clean and free from infection. It is advised that fragrance-free soaps and soaps that contain alcohol not be used to clean the tattoo to avoid burning or drying out the tattoo too quickly. Try to avoid loofahs and unwashed clothes which both can contain bacteria that could get into the tattoo and cause an infection. The best way to dry your tattoo is to use a paper towel as regular towels may also contain bacteria, even if they are just washed. The amount of ink that remains in the skin throughout the healing process determines how the final tattoo will look. If a tattoo becomes infected or the flakes fall off too soon (e.g., if it absorbs too much water and sloughs off early or is picked or scraped off) then the ink will not be properly fixed in the skin and the final image will be negatively affected.

Previously, he was the 11th Secretary-General of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) from 2012 to 2014. From May 2015 to February 2020 he served as High Commissioner of Maldives to Pakistan and non-resident Ambassador accredited to Nepal.  Early years and education  Saleem was educated in Mal√©, Maldives and in New Delhi, India.  Diplomatic career  Saleem joined the Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1968. He had a distinguished career spanning for more than 30 years, during which he served in various capacities in the Ministry, such as Controller of Immigration & Emigration, Chief of Protocol, Under-Secretary (Head of the Multilateral Department) and Secretary. As a career diplomat, Saleem served at the Maldives‚Äô High Commission in Sri Lanka and Permanent Mission in New York, two of only few diplomatic missions Maldives had at the time. During his deputation to the Ministry of Finance for one year in 1977, he became his Government's first Alternate Governor for the World Bank, International Development Association (IDA) and Asian Development Bank (ADB). From 1990 to 1993, he served as the first Director from Maldives at the SAARC Secretariat, Kathmandu, Nepal. Mr Saleem presented credentials to the President of Pakistan as Maldives High Commissioner in Pakistan on 12 June 2015. Subsequently, he presented credentials to the President of Nepal on 29 February 2016 as Non- Resident Maldivian Ambassador to Nepal. Since February 2020, Mr. Saleem is Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Maldives.  Democracy and human rights  Saleem has been a strong advocate of democracy and human rights. During his Presidency of the Human Rights Commission of Maldives (HRCM) from 2007 to 2010, Saleem played a crucial role in raising awareness about the values of democracy and human rights in the country, which became a democracy in 2008. Saleem was one of the original nine members when the HRCM was first established by the Presidential decree on 10 December 2003, five years before the first democratic constitution came into force in 2008 in the Maldives. Subsequently in 2006, Saleem was appointed by the Maldivian Parliament as the President of the newly constituted HRCM, a fully autonomous body under the Maldivian law and in full conformity with the Paris Principles. He served in that capacity until August 2010. Members of the first fully autonomous Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, constituted on 27 November 2006 Having contributed many writings both in Dhivehi and English, Saleem's role in the promotion of democracy and human rights in the Maldives is widely recognized. The fact that the first HRCM was established five years before democracy came to the country, made it extremely difficult for the HRCM to carry out its mandatory functions. Maldives, a country that has never ever experienced democracy in its entire history, was not quite ready to embrace democracy and therefore criticizing or condemning the Government on any issue was tantamount to committing a crime that prompted verbal and physical attacks and threats on members of the HRCM. Partly as a result, most of the members of the HRCM resigned on one pretext or the other. However, Saleem was one of the two members, who refused to quit and remained until the HRCM became an autonomous body in November 2006. It was the HRCM which taught the Maldivians that they had a right to free speech and also criticize the Government. Meetings held by the HRCM for advocating human rights and the rule of law and for creating a culture of dialogue among the newly created political parties, were welcomed by the opposition, while the Government resisted them. HRCM also played a crucial role in internationalizing the human rights atrocities that had taken place in jails. An uprising by convicts in the major jail close to the capital of Mal√© in 2004, which resulted in the brutal killing of one of the inmates by the police, prompted the anti-government demonstrations, paving the way for the Maldives to turn into a democratic country in 2008.Hassan Evan Naseem2003 Maldives civil unrest  Secretary-General of SAARC  Established in December 1985, SAARC is the regional grouping of eight member states in South Asia. Its primary objective is to promote the welfare of its peoples and to improve their quality of life through regional cooperation. A strong believer of regional cooperation, Saleem took over as the Secretary-General of SAARC in March 2012. Saleem firmly believes that SAARC is the best thing to have happened to South Asia. He holds the conviction that SAARC is the only vehicle that can contribute to peace and harmony in the region through effective economic integration. It was during Saleem's tenure as Secretary- General of SAARC that, for the first time in the history of SAARC, a comprehensive study to strengthen SAARC mechanisms, including the Secretariat, 11 regional centres and SAARC socialized bodies, was conducted.  Career highlights  There are several firsts to Saleem's credit. Following Maldives‚Äô independence in 1965, Saleem was one among the first batch of diplomats to have joined the Maldivian Foreign Ministry. In 1977, he was the first Alternative Governor of Maldives for the World Bank, International Development Association (IDA) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) during his deputation to the Ministry of Finance in 1977. He was the first Director from Maldives to have served the SAARC Secretariat from 1990 to 1993. He was also the first ever member approved by the Maldivian Parliament for an independent commission in the Maldives.  Personal life  Saleem was born on 26 May 1949 in Male, the capital of Maldives. He is married to Ayesha Saleem. They have two daughters and two sons. He has been a keen sportsman throughout his life. At national level, he played competitions in football, tennis and cricket. Even today, he follows these sports and plays tennis regularly. A prolific writer, he has contributed many articles on regional and international affairs.

Kibble Literary Awards (the Kibble Awards) for Australian women writers are named in her honour. Early life Nita Bernice Kibble was born on 8 June 1879 at Denman, New South Wales, the younger daughter of George Augustus Frederick Kibble, Scottish postmaster, and his wife Eliza, n√©e McDermott. Nita was educated at Denman Public School and St Vincent's College, Potts Point, Sydney. Career The first female librarian to be appointed to the State Library of New South Wales, Nita began her career at the library on probation as a junior attendant in the lending branch on November 20, 1899. In an era when women in Australia did not often receive equal pay for equal work and were excluded from some professional opportunities, the library offered a career path for women. H.C.L. Anderson recruited educated women to work as reading room attendants and from there they could progress into the clerical and professional divisions of the Public Service Board. Nita progressed through the ranks and passed the Public Service Board examinations, eventually establishing the Library's first research department in 1918. Nita was described by Mr Ifould, the State Librarian as \\"a fine example of patience, imagination and wide knowledge combined.\\" Nita studied courses at Sydney University in economics, philosophy, psychology and sociology which equipped her for her work in the Research Department. In 1919 she was appointed Principal Research Officer, and retained the position until her retirement in 1943. She was a foundation member of the Australian Institute of Librarians and a staunch advocate for the recognition of the profession. Nita's papers are held in the collection of the State Library of New South Wales. Awards and memorials Kibble raised her niece, Nita May Dobbie, from birth.

The film stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jonathan Pryce, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Douglas Henshall and Michael Raymond-James. Plot Following the Second Schleswig War in 1864, Jon and his brother Peter emigrate to the United States from Denmark and settle somewhere between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Seven years later, Jon‚Äôs wife, Marie and his 10-year-old son, Kresten, arrive. After they all meet, Jon and his family board a stagecoach bound for their small residence while Peter stays behind. Their coach is also boarded by recently released criminals, Paul and Lester. Following a tense struggle, the criminals throw Jon out of the moving coach after which they rape and kill Jon's wife. They also kill his son and the stagecoach driver and guard. With great effort, Jon catches up to the coach to find his family murdered. Enraged, he kills the two convicts. Unbeknownst to Jon, Paul is the brother of Henry Delarue, a notorious gang leader and land baron. Upon hearing the news, Delarue kills three innocent citizens of Black Creek, the town that reports the deaths to him. He also forces the townspeople to cooperate and find his brother's killer. Delarue was once an Army Colonel who fought Native Americans. At one point, he is stated to have once been a good man before he became twisted by war. After burying his wife and son, Jon decides to leave the town with Peter and sells his land to Keane, Black Creek's mayor and undertaker. Before they can leave, Jon and Peter are captured by the town Sheriff and minister, Mallick. As Jon sits in his cell, Mallick tells him that his death will buy the town more time while he tries to inform higher authorities of Delarue's actions. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Delarue is working with the Standard Atlantic Oil Company and, with the help of Mayor Keane, had been acquiring Black Creek and its surrounding land, which is rich with untapped crude oil. Unknown to Mallick, the company managed to intercept his message for help and prevent it from reaching the authorities. Delarue's now widowed sister-in-law Madelaine, who is mute, acts as his accountant and suffers sexual and physical abuse from him. The next morning, Jon is escorted to Delarue's base, an abandoned town, and is tied to a post and left in the sun. In Black Creek, Peter breaks out of jail and kills several of Delarue's henchmen. He cuts Jon free, and the pair ride off while being pursued by Delarue and his remaining men. Realizing Jon is too weak to carry on, Peter conceals him and leads the gang away, and is eventually caught and killed. Taking advantage of Delarue's absence, Madelaine steals his cash and boards a train. However, the train is intercepted, and she is captured. Delarue tells his men to kill Madelaine after they are done raping her. Jon roams the countryside, looking for water and shelter. He stumbles across a small residence belonging to Mrs. Whistler, whose husband was killed by Delarue. Jon takes shelter in her house to recover from his wounds while Mrs. Whistler and her children flee. After returning to town, he confronts and kills Mayor Keane for his deception. At the general store, he arms himself and reluctantly accepts the help of Voichek, the young storekeeper whose grandmother was killed by Delarue. Jon uses diversions and guerrilla tactics to kill Delarue's henchmen one at a time. Voichek is killed and inadvertently sets fire to the hotel where Madelaine is being held, enabling her to escape. Delarue finds and wounds Jon. Just as he is about to kill Jon, Madelaine shoots Delarue twice, and Jon finishes him with a shot to the head. Sheriff Mallick and his deputies arrive at the scene and thank Jon. When they try to arrest Madelaine, Jon orders them to leave and states that he will be taking her with him. The pair leave to start their new life together, and the film then reveals that the land is ultimately taken over by the oil company.

Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Salvation has a rating of 72% rating based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It's all but impossible to add anything new or fresh to the traditional Western, but ‚Äì thanks in no small part to Mads Mikkelson's performance ‚Äì The Salvation comes close.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of a 100 based on 19 critics, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In The Observer, Jonathan Romney found that the film \\"tips its Stetson to John Ford and Sergio Leone with bold widescreen visuals ‚Äì daytime shots in which even the sun looks sunbaked, prairie nightscapes resembling ink-soaked denim\\", but added \\"it never transcends reverent pastiche, down to the hackneyed sounds of Morricone-style guitars\\". Romney concluded, \\"Best reason to see The Salvation: its chief varmint, played with ornery glint and bristling whiskers by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who has the sleepy-eyed malignity of vintage western heavy Jack Elam\\".

The total distance from Copenhagen City Hall Square to Algade in Roskilde is about 31 km. History The road was constructed as a replacement for the old Via Regia between Copenhagen and Roskilde. Construction began at the Roskilde end in 1770 and was completed in Copenhagen in 1776. The project was led by the French road engineer Jean Marmillod who had been called to Copenhagen by Prime Minister Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff in 1753 to improve the road. Glostrup and Hedehusene remained the only towns along the road until the 1960s.

John Gooch Robberds Life Robberds was born in Norwich on 18 May 1789; his mother, whose maiden name was Harrell, was from a Huguenot family. John Warden Robberds, the biographer of William Taylor of Norwich, was his second cousin. He was educated at Norwich grammar school. In September 1805 Robberds entered Manchester College, then at York to study for the Unitarian ministry. His fellow student Joseph Hunter says that Robberds parried the tag De mortuis nil nisi bonum, as a plea for reverence to antiquity, by translating it \\"Of dead things nothing is left but bones\\". In 1809 Robberds acted as assistant tutor in classics. He began to preach at Filby, Norfolk, during the summer vacation of 1809. Leaving York at midsummer 1810, he preached for a few months at the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, and was invited to settle there as colleague to Theophilus Browne; but on 19 December 1810 he was called to Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, in succession to Ralph Harrison, and as colleague to John Grundy. Robberds began his ministry in Manchester in April 1811, where he remained for over 40 years. His colleagues were, from 1825, John Hugh Worthington (1804‚Äì1827), the betrothed of Harriet Martineau, and from 1828 William Gaskell. For some years Robberds kept a school. In Manchester College he held the offices of secretary (1814‚Äì22), and public examiner (1822‚Äì40); and on the return of the college from York to Manchester he filled the chairs of Hebrew and Syriac (1840‚Äì5) and pastoral theology (1840‚Äì52). His friend Edward Holme left him (1847) an estate in Westmorland. Robberds was a conciliatory figure in his denomination. He died at 35 Acomb Street, Greenheys, Manchester, on 21 April 1854, and was buried on 26 April in the Rusholme Road cemetery; there was a brass to his memory in Cross Street chapel. Works Robberds published sixteen single sermons (1820‚Äì1850), tracts and lectures, and a memorial Sketch prefixed to the posthumous Sermons (1825, 2 vols.) of Pendlebury Houghton (1758‚Äì1824). Posthumous was his Christian Festivals and Natural Seasons, a volume of sermons, with memoir, 1855. Family Robberds married, on 31 December 1811, Mary (b. 24 February 1786; d. 10 January 1869), eldest daughter of William Turner of Newcastle upon Tyne. His eldest son was Charles William Robberds, who retired from the ministry in 1869; his second son was John Robberds (1814‚Äì92), minister from 1840 to 1866 of Toxteth Park chapel, Liverpool.

From the outside the reworked front grill and the extra lights incorporated in it are the most obvious changes. The Ford Taunus TC is a range of large family cars that were built by Ford Germany from 1970 until 1982. The Taunus TC was based on the same basic construction as the Ford UK's Cortina range, with the \\"TC\\" badge standing for Taunus Cortina. Taunus TC (1970-1975) In September 1970 a new Taunus, the \\"Taunus Cortina\\" (TC), was introduced by Ford Germany. Ford offered a two- or four-door sedan/saloon and a five-door station wagon/estate (identified as with previous Taunus station wagons, as the Taunus Turnier). Between 1970 and 1975, when the Taunus TC gave way to the Taunus TC2, a fashionable fast-back coup√© was also included in the Ford Taunus range. Unlike in Britain, Ford Germany saw a niche in the market for a more \\"sensible\\" coup√© model than the Capri, which also meant that care was taken to retain as much as possible of the sedan's luggage and rear seat accommodations.Auto-Universum 1971, p. 28 =Origins= The Ford Taunus TC series was conceived in the late 1960s to be a \\"world car\\" alongside its technical sibling the Cortina Mk III, with development and design work taking place on both sides of the Atlantic. The car was developed under the supervision of Semon E. \\"Bunkie\\" Knudsen, till February 1968 a high profile General Motors executive and from early 1968 till Autumn/Fall 1969 Ford's Dearborn-based Chairman. The car is often nicknamed \\"Barock 2\\" (recalling the Taunus P2 series of the late 1950s, commonly known as the \\"Barock-Taunus\\") or \\"Knudsen-Taunus\\" in Germany, because of the prominent hood/bonnet scoop that, as the legend has it, was put there on direct order from Knudsen. Otherwise the major design work is rumoured to have been done by German car designer Luigi Colani, who later supplied design concepts for BMW's motorcycle division in the late 1970s. =The car= The lower end of the market segment previously occupied in Germany by the Ford Taunus P6 being targeted, since 1968, by the smaller Escort, the Taunus TC was presented as a slightly upmarket replacement for the P6 which ceased production in August 1970.Oswald, p. 404 The wheelbase of the new car was longer than that of the P6 but the Taunus TC had shorter overhangs, so that overall it was slightly shorter. Nevertheless, it was noted that the TC appeared from the outside to be larger than it was, which many buyers appreciated. The interior was no longer free of a transmission tunnel, since with the Anglo-German design of the Taunus TC, Ford Germany abandoned, for the time being, front-wheel drive for this class of car, asserting that rear wheel drive was less expensive and simpler to produce and to maintain.Oswald, pp. 404 & 406 (The obvious benchmark in the market place for the TC, the Opel Ascona, would also retain a \\"conventional\\" rear wheel drive configuration till 1981.) =Packaging up the options list= Ford Taunus Turnier (estate) Rather than specify optional extras from a long list of possibilities as might have happened a few years earlier, customers were now encouraged to select from a range of \\"equipment packages\\", identified by suffix letters. The standard Taunus was identified in sales material as the \\"Taunus N\\", while progressively more extensive or sporty packages of extras were identified in 1970 with the suffixes \\"L\\", \\"XL\\", \\"GT\\", and \\"GXL\\". The base version was not destined to be produced in large numbers, with Ford hoping that most customers would select one of the packages.Auto-Universum 1971, pp. 32-33 A similar approach with \\"options packages\\" was being introduced in Germany by Opel at this time. The L was a more comfortably equipped base version, with the XL adding certain luxuries such as height adjustable front seats, a clock, and larger headlights. The sporty GT (not available as a 1.3, as for the GXL) received bucket seats with built-in headrests, full instrumentation, a leather steering wheel, and twin headlamps amongst other equipment. Lastly, the top-of-the-line GXL added all the comforts of the XL with the sporty equipment of the GT and additional extras such as a vinyl roof, a dual-tone horn, and deeper carpeting. The view from behind =The British sibling= This model also formed the basis of the Cortina Mk III, but with different door skins and rear wing pressings from the \\"coke-bottle\\" styling of the Cortina. In addition, there was never a Cortina III equivalent to the fast-back bodied Taunus TC coup√©. The unification of Ford Europe's model range had started with the Escort and Capri and was continued (albeit to a lesser degree) with the Taunus and Cortina. The Taunus TC and Cortina Mk III were thus both developed under the auspices of Ford of Europe, and most major components, including the entire floorpan, were identical.Auto-Universum 1971, p. 25 =Technical progress= Significant advances were made with the rear suspension. The previous large Taunus had featured a rigid rear axle, suspended using traditional leaf-springs, but with the TC Ford used a rear suspension configuration involving coil springs, with the axle located using two longitudinal and two lateral linkages. The front wheels, no longer driven, were suspended with a conventional wishbone suspension, which eschewed shock absorbers and gave the car a soft 'freeway' ride and, with the heavier 6-cylinder engines, a tendency to excessive understeer. Press criticism of the trade-off between the car's road-holding and ride-comfort soon evolved into a more general critique, not convincingly addressed by the manufacturer for several years, that Ford had launched the Taunus TC before they had finished developing it. A telescopic steering column designed to collapse in the event of a frontal collision (rather than penetrate the driver's chest) had been mainstream in competitor models from Opel and Volkswagen for some time, and with the TC Ford now also incorporated this safety feature on their new mid- size range for Germany and mainland Europe. =Engines= Despite obvious US- management pressure to maximize commonality under the skin, the range of engines fitted on the Taunus TC differed from that on contemporary Cortinas in respect of the less powerful cars, and the UK company's venerable ohv Kent engine never found its way into the Belgian assembled Ford Germany version of the car.Auto-Universum 1971, p. 26 The rather lumpy V4 engine that had powered the Taunus P6 models in the 1960s (and which, in enlarged and more powerful form, would live on to power Ford Germany's Transit vans and full-size Granada model through much of the 1970s) was also passed over for the Taunus TC. The less powerful Taunus TCs were powered by a new four-cylinder OHC engine that was shared with the newly introduced American Ford Pinto and was offered, at this stage, with 1294 cc or 1593 cc: a 1993 cc version of the four-cylinder engine would be added from 1976 in the Taunus TC2.Oswald, pp. 406, 407, 411 In the meantime, signalling a move away from the strategy followed with the Taunus P6, customers willing to pay for more power could now specify one of the compact V6 units carried over from the top range P7 models, the six- cylinder engines offering a choice between 1999 cc and 2294 cc engine displacements.Oswald, pp. 404, 407, 408 =Transmission options= All the Taunus engines except the smallest 1.3 litre unit could be specified in combination with a Borg-Warner B35 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the standard four speed manual box. =1973 facelift= The Taunus TC received its only significant facelift in September 1973. Through the 1960s rival manufacturer Opel had set the pace in terms of frequent model changes and facelifts, reflecting North American practice and the deep pockets of its General Motors parent. The mainstream German owned auto-makers that had survived till 1970 had not attempted to follow Opel down this path, but Ford had settled into a pattern of generally four-yearly model changes. From production statistics between 1970 and 1973 the Taunus TC was evidently a commercial success, but in 1974 sales were dipping alarmingly, as customers waited for a new Ford Taunus. A new Taunus was not yet ready for launch, but in September 1973 the existing model received a facelift with various changes in respect of trim package and engine combinations. The Taunus TC also received a new grill, now incorporating a second pair of front lights: rectangular headlights, reflecting contemporary styling trends, but hitherto restricted to the \\"XL\\" (and more exalted) trim packages, now became standard across the Taunus range.Oswald, pp. 404, 405, 408 Ford Germany's Taunus output, which had slumped from 245,955 cars in 1973 to 138,357 in 1974, recovered to 181,530 in 1975.Oswald, p. 357 On manual transmission 1593 cc four-cylinder engined cars September 1973 also saw small changes to the gear ratios for second and third gear. At this time lateral stabilizer bars were also fitted front and back which provided a belated answer to widespread criticism of the original car's propensity to wallow when changing direction or driving on irregular road surfaces.Oswald, pp. 406-407 =Commercial= Ford Taunus TC production (units): :::* 1970 59,821 :::* 1971 253,283 :::* 1972 233,366 :::* 1973 245,955 :::* 1974 138,357 :::* 1975 181,530 (from end Nov, TC2) :This data covers the Ford Taunus TC cars produced by Ford Germany. It does not include Ford Cortinas which were assembled in Dagenham The Ford Taunus TC was more visually striking that its predecessor and was welcomed on account of its good looks. Overall evaluation of the car's commercial success should perhaps combine data for both the Taunus TC and the Cortina Mk III which got off to a slow start thanks to a lengthy plant shut down resulting from a succession of strikes in 1970. Nevertheless, separating out figures for the Ford Taunus TC, produced under the auspices of Ford Germany at their Belgian plant, an hour down the road from their German head office, approximately 250,000 cars were produced during each of the three years 1971, 1972 and 1973, and in each of these years the Taunus TC was Ford Germany's top seller. Year by year output data for the rival Opel Ascona have not been located, but between 1970 and 1975 Opel produced 691,438 Ascona As,Oswald, p. 251 confirming that during its first three full years of production the Taunus TC was in the till now unusual position, for a German Ford, of outselling its Opel rival. World auto-sales were badly hit by the 1973 oil crisis. Ford Germany output in 1974 was down by slightly under 40% on the previous year. (Opel output was down by 33% over the same period.Oswald, p. 171) Even in 1974 the Taunus was Ford Germany's top model, beating the smaller cheaper Escort if only by a small margin. In 1975 Taunus output recovered to 181,530, although by now the Taunus was no longer Ford Germany's top performer, with 215,760 Escorts produced by Ford German in 1975, the Escort having belatedly gained wider appeal with German buyers, following the launch in December 1974 of the less cramped Mk II version. Taunus TC2 (1976‚Äì1979) Ford Taunus TC2 4-door (1976‚Äì1979) Ford Taunus TC2 2-door (1976‚Äì1979) Ford Cortina Mk IV 4-door (1976-1979): after 1976 the Fords Taunus and Cortina were virtually identical. At the end of November 1975, in time for the 1976 model year, production began of the Taunus series \\"GBTS\\", also known as the \\"Ford Taunus TC2\\". =Cortina comparisons= Ford of Britain continued to sell the Cortina Mark III, the Dagenham produced version of the earlier Taunus TC, for more than half a year following the launch of the Taunus TC2, but in September 1976 the Cortina Mark IV was introduced in Britain, after which the Taunus TC2 and Cortina Mk IV were almost identical, apart from regional variations in terms of specification changes and trim levels. Internally, they were for the most part differentiated by the driving position: LHD (left-hand drive) cars were badged Taunus while RHD (right-hand drive) cars were badged Cortina, generally regardless of the country of assembly. However, where the German \\"Ford Taunus\\" name had no significant positive presence the \\"Ford Cortina\\" name was used in certain smaller LHD markets such as Greece, South Korea, Philippines, Israel (which took most of its LHD cars as Cortinas, sourced from the UK plant, till 1981) and Taiwan. The Taunus TC2 was essentially a \\"reskin\\" of the Taunus TC, and was in most markets presented as such. For Ford's Cortina buyers the reskin was a little more extensive, with the loss of the \\"coke-bottle\\" line which distinguished the Cortina Mk III from the 1976 Mk IV model, and promotional material in respect of the Cortina played up the differences between the Cortinas Mark III and IV. =Updated bodywork= The Taunus TC2 retained an overall silhouette very similar to that of the Taunus TC, though actually all the principal outer body panels were newly shaped as were the rear window and side windows. Parking became a little easier now that the rear corners of the car were visible from the driver's seat.Oswald, p. 409 From outside the car the most obvious change was the loss at the front of the \\"Knudsen Nose\\" which made for a less eye-catchingly individualistic look, but resulted in a more harmonious body shape. =Under the TC2 \\"reskin\\" little changed= The suspension set-up was unchanged from that on the Taunus TC (as improved in September 1973). The twin circuit hydraulic braking system still operated on disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, their diameters unchanged. However, where in 1970 a buyer of the entry level 1294 cc would have found a brake servo only on the options list, servo-assisted brakes for the Taunus TC2 were standard across the range.Oswald, pp. 410 - 411 On the six-cylinder cars, which had heavier engine blocks, it also became possible from August 1977 to specify as an option power assisted steering.Oswald, p. 411 The range of engine sizes was the same apart from one important addition: buyers could specify an enlarged 1993 cc version of the \\"Pinto\\" OHC engine. It was therefore now possible to buy a 2-litre Taunus with either 4 or 6 cylinders. The four-cylinder powered car came with an advertised maximum output of while the six-cylinder version offered only . The more recently designed four-cylinder unit also came with more torque. Nevertheless, the six-cylinder car achieved its maxima at lower engine speeds and some commentators found it more relaxing to drive. As before, all but the 1294 cc-engined car could be ordered, at extra cost, with a three-speed automatic transmission. The automatic box offered was no longer a Borg Warner system, but Ford's own C3 transmission produced at the manufacturer's transmission plant in Bordeaux which had opened in 1973. =Commercial (TC2/TC3)= Ford Taunus TC production (units): :::* 1975 181,530 (from end Nov, TC2) :::* 1976 284,527 :::* 1977 285,384 :::* 1978 264,774 :::* 1979 256,884 (from Sep, TC3) :::* 1980 173,295 :::* 1981 201,409 :::* 1982 117,426 :This data covers the Ford Taunus TC2 and TC3 produced by Ford Germany. It does not include Ford Cortinas which were assembled in Dagenham Since 1970 the Taunus TC had competed head-on for market-share with the Opel Ascona, and in 1973 the two were joined in what was now a three-way tussle by the Volkswagen Passat. Strictly comparable production data for the three cars are not easily accessible, but if one leaves out Opels assembled in Britain as Vauxhall Cavaliers, then in volume terms the three-way tussle was narrowly won between 1976 and 1982 by the Ford Taunus TC2/TC3, with 1,583,699 cars produced. Between 1975 and 1981 Opel produced 1,316,459 Ascona Bs.Oswald, pp. 272 & 273 The Opel figures would rise above those for the Taunus if one added the 196,512 Vauxhall Cavaliers built, on behalf of Vauxhall at Opel‚Äôs Antwerp plant, and be boosted further if one added the 534,634 mechanically similar Opel Mantas that shared the Ascona‚Äôs production line. During the six years between 1976 and 1982 Volkswagen produced 1,360,312 Passats.Oswald, pp. 146 & 147 To make the Volkswagen group the convincing winner in this contest it would be necessary to add the 1,290,164 mechanically similar Audi 80s to the figure given here for the Volkswagen Passat. Despite its strong performance in the market place, by 1980, with new contenders from Volkswagen and Opel arriving, the output data suggest that the age of the Taunus TC's basic design was beginning to count against it. In a sector which gained in significance during the increasingly cash-strapped 1970s, as many buyers traded down from larger cars such as the Opel Rekord, the Taunus TC2/TC3 (like the TC before it) achieved market place success through a combination of good looks and aggressive pricing. The mechanically conservative car was widely regarded as dependable, despite never entirely ridding itself of irritating defects and weaknesses which a more rigorous development process should have prevented. Taunus TC3 (1979-1982) Ford Taunus Ghia TC3 4-door (1979‚Äì1982) Ford Taunus TC3 2-door (1979‚Äì1982) Ford Taunus TC3 4-door (1979‚Äì1982) highlighting the enlarged rear lights When, in 1979, the Taunus TC3 (also known as the Taunus series \\"GBFS\\") replaced the Taunus TC2 the major components remained basically the same. In the UK Ford presented the facelifted car as the \\"Cortina Model 80\\", although it quickly became known, if only informally, as the Cortina Mk 5. Again, the 1979 differences tended to be played up more in respect of the Cortina badged car assembled in Dagenham than in respect of Ford Germany's Belgian assembled Taunus badged cars. Innovations in the engine compartment with the 1979 TC3 model included a new \\"Economy carburetor\\", manufactured in- house by Ford, which gave rise to many complaints. Minor bodywork modifications affected the base of the side windows which was very slightly lowered. Other changes visible from the outside included bumpers that now wrapped round along the sides of the car as far as the wheel arches. The front and rear light clusters were reshaped and also wrapped around the corners of the car sufficiently to be visible from the sides. At the top of the range the choice of 2274 cc engined cars was reduced with the delisting of the Ford Taunus Sport, but across the range it now became possible to specify an \\"S\\" options package which in essence comprised a stronger anti-roll bar and firmer suspension. =The end of European production= In July 1982 European production of the Taunus TC3/Cortina 80 ceased; it was replaced in October by the Ford Sierra. The Sierra carried over the Cortina/Taunus OHC Pinto engines and \\"conventional\\" rear-wheel drive configuration but was otherwise an all new car with independent suspension all round. Taunus production continued in Argentina until 1984. Here the fastback coup√© version, discontinued from the European model line-up in 1975, remained in the Taunus range right until the end. Taunus production also continued at Otosan in Turkey, where a version of the TC3 with remoulded ends continued in production until 1994. =Forty years on= The Taunus and Cortina models are very easy to service and share many mechanical components with the other European Ford cars of the period (excluding the Ford Fiesta), making them extremely easy to fix, although they are now a rare sight even in the markets where they were most popular. For example, the British Cortinas of this generation sold more than 1,000,000 units, but little more than 2,000 were in circulation by 2006. The Taunus, however, still can be seen in circulation, in places such as Spain, Germany and Scandinavia and there is an active owners club.  Living on in Argentina and Turkey  The Taunus TC was produced in Argentina from 1974 up until the end of 1984 and in Turkey, by Otosan, from 1984 till 1994. =Argentina= The Argentina-exclusive Taunus 2300GT \\"fastback coup√©,\\" built from 1974 up until the end of 1984. Before the launch of Argentinian production, the Taunus TC1 underwent a year of testing. Various critical chassis components were replaced with more robust equivalents due to the harsher roads of rural Argentina. Other components were re-sourced locally for reasons of availability, but most components for the Argentinian assembled cars still had to be imported from European Ford plants. One of the most significant technical differences is that the Argentine Taunus cars used Dana \\"Type 30\\" rear axles rather than the Atlas or Salisbury (according to engine size/torque) rear axles used by the European Taunus/Cortina. The Argentine models produced from 1974 were the \\"TC1\\" in four-door saloon versions (2000L, 2000GXL and 2300GXL) and the two- door fastback coup√® (2300GT and 2300GT/SP) from 1974 to 1980. No Taunus TC estates or two-door saloons were produced in South America. The \\"TC2\\"/1976-79 Taunus/Cortina was never produced in Argentina. Production switched directly in 1980 from the Taunus TC to the \\"TC3\\"/\\"Cortina 80\\". Both saloon (2.0L, 2.3 Ghia and 2.3 Ghia S) and Coup√® (2.3 GT, 2.3 SP and 2.3 SP5) were produced, though again the station wagon bodied cars and the two-door saloons were excluded from the Argentinian line-up. As part of the 1980 upgrade, Ford introduced a face-lifted version of the \\"TC1\\" fastback coupe, since 1975 produced only in Argentina, and now with the \\"TC3\\" nose and its own unique taillights lay-out. These post-1980 Argentine Taunus fast-back coup√®s also featured improved performance and a refashioned interior: they used the name \\"Taunus SP\\" or \\"Taunus SP 5\\", the \\"5\\" referring to the five-speed manual gearbox now available as an option. Apart from the five speed option, the transmission choice, as for the European Taunus TCs, lay between a four speed manual and, for larger engined cars, a three speed automatic gear box. The Argentine Taunus TC models did not share the European engine range, instead using the similar \\"Lima\\" engine - for Argentina with 2.0 as well as 2.3 litres displacement. This was derived from the \\"Pinto\\" engine but differed in several respects. The most powerful engine available in the Argentine Taunus was an updated version of the \\"Lima\\" with an upgraded camshaft, new exhaust headers and a twin barrel 36/36mm Solex carburetor. None of the Argentine Taunus models came with six-cylinder engines. In total, 197,031 Taunuses were built in Argentina. Even though the Taunus/Cortina is not a usual sight any more in European countries where it used to be a best-seller, plenty of the cars survive in Argentina, where a number of Clubs keep the cars in top condition, while many are still used as for regular family transport, especially in rural areas, such as the Club Taunus Argentina =Turkey= OTOSAN's Ford Taunus, which had the same trim as European versions Ford Taunus, last edition produced in Turkey until 1994 In 1984 the Argentinian Taunus production line was sold to Otosan in Turkey where the manufacture of the Otosan Taunus now took place. The Otosan factory also came to take over the tools for manufacturing the previously South African-built Cortina Mk V-based Ford P100 pick-up truck, although Otosan did not use the South African load-bed structure, preferring their own design which featured foldable sides (reminiscent of the Peugeot U10). The Otosan Taunus was also differentiated from Taunus TC3s previously built in Europe and Argentina by its distinctive sculpted front panel with rectangular or dual square headlights and a colour matched grille. Notable media appearances A black 1976 model Taunus was driven by henchman chasing James Bond (Roger Moore) - in his Lotus Esprit - in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me on the roads of Sardinia. A notable passenger of the Taunus was the iconic Jaws (Richard Kiel), who was presumably the only survivor when Bond managed to shake off the pursuing car and cause it to overshoot a cliff and plough into the roof of a barn. A blue 1948 model Taunus was driven by Steve Forrest in the very first episode of the 1965 TV series The Baron. A 1979 Ford Taunus is a main feature of the Swedish classic television show Ronny and Ragge. Modified Taunus TCs are used as the Omega forces patrol vehicles in the Italian Mad Max clone Warrior of the Lost World.

Murder-suicide at Laguna Beach Toward the end of the 1920s Ritchie became director of the amateur theatre group, Community Players, at Laguna Beach in Southern California. During this time she became friends with Doris Miller, a set designer at the Laguna Beach Playhouse. Miller, who was some 23 years Ritchie's junior, came from a prominent Waukegan, Illinois, family and was the former wife of Chicago dentist Dr. Clinton Foster Palmer. For a time the two were often seen together at social events involving the Laguna Beach artist colony, but this began to change when Ritchie was replaced as the group's director after clashes with some of the actors.

These chains utilize a bush made of an oil-impregnated sintered metal or plastic to provide continuous lubrication to the chain during drive, eliminating the need for further lubrication.so that the bearing requires no further lubrication during the whole life of the machine in which it is used, according to  History  While some of the earliest self- lubricating bearings were developed by Chrysler\\"Chrysler engineers developed bearings that were made of metal powders forced together under high pressure and heat (a process known as sintering). The ingredients were pure virgin copper (88.5%), tin (10%), and graphite (1.5%). The sintered bearings were so impregnated with oil ‚Äî with around one third of their volume being oil ‚Äî that, in most cases, they needed no service attention after installation, although they were seemingly solid. The bearings were dubbed Oilite ¬Æ; Oilite bearings would be used in distributors, generators, starters, and ball joints as well as water pump and clutch pilots,\\" according to the earliest self-lubricating chains were bushed chains, which consisted of pins, plates, and sintered bushes. The loss in strength of the bush required it to be made extra thick. This made the outer diameter so large that it did not allow enough room for a roller. These bushed chains suffer from the drawback of lower allowable load and tensile strength compared to regular roller chain, and the outer diameter of the bushes do not rotate when engaging a sprocket and may suffer faster wear and damage. While various chain manufacturers offered self-lubricating bushed chain designs based on sintered-bush technology since the 1950s, the world's first self-lubricating roller chain was developed and launched by a Japanese chain manufacturer in 1988. After they made further improvements to the oil impregnation and sintering technologies, they received a patent for their lube-free roller chain, as evidenced by Patent #JP20070237969. In the new design, advancements in powder metal bush technology allowed engineers to design a bush that had a smaller diameter yet was stronger, which allowed room for rollers. These rollers improved performance by allowing the chain to articulate more smoothly into sprockets and protect the sintered bushes. Because of these advancements, the self-lubrication style chains achieved strength on par with regular roller chain, with the added benefit of being lube-free. Powdered metal sintered bearings (in the case of roller chain, the bushes) are self-lubricating because their porosity is impregnated with lubricants during the manufacturing process. In use, frictional heat causes the lubricant to expand and flow out of the pores, forming a film between mating parts. Low coefficients of friction, minimal maintenance and trouble- free service life, low cost, and simple installation are the chief advantages of powdered metal bearings.  Construction  An expanded view of a self- lubricating roller chain link As with standard roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, pins, bushes, and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal, produced using powder metallurgy. Self-lubricating chains can be manufactured cheaply, quickly, and to precision tolerances.They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances, according to To form the bushings, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, compacted, and sintered. The initial compaction to a large degree dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.To a large degree, the initial compaction dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part, according to Sintered materials have inherent porosity, and the pores have both beneficial and detrimental effects on part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce mechanical strength and ductility. However, the pores also reduce noise and vibration and serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility, according to It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply increases with temperature and therefore with increasing speeds of rotation, improving performance.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface, according to  Applications  Self-lubrication is ideal in situations where normal lubrication is difficult, troublesome, or impossible. For example, in paper and food processing, lubrication is undesirable due to product contamination. (Chain companies like Tsubaki and Renold PLC also offer sintered bushes impregnated with food grade lubricant.) Self-lubricating bushes are used in conveyor chains as well as roller chains for a variety of conveyance applications. These could include not only RS attachment roller chain, but small size conveyor chains and a wide variety of top chains as well.

He gained attention as reliable sideman of the singer-songwriter Delbert McClinton from Lubbock, Texas, for more than 20 years. Wise played with many artists and in venues all over the globe in his more than 50-year musical career. He released four CDs under his own name before retiring from the music business in 2008. Wise is married and lives with his family in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Development and musical career  At the beginning of his musical life cycle Wise learned to play clarinet. At age 12 he moved to the saxophone, initially alto sax and a year later settled on the tenor sax. He was inspired by the rhythm and blues of the 1950s; however, he also played country, swing, and big band music. He joined his first band in 1957. It was at the birth of rock 'n' roll, and they called themselves the Rhythm Rockers. Early saxophone influences were Red Prysock, Sam \\"The Man\\" Taylor, Earl Bostic, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, and a little later, King Curtis, Sam Butera, and Junior Walker. With these musical inspirations, over the years he developed his versatility and his own signature sound and became a sought-after session musician. Wise toured with various bands across the U.S. in the 1970s and '80s and has performed with Jeffrey Osborne, Ruben Ramos, Chuck Jackson, Maxine Brown, Taj Mahal, Willie Nelson, Marcia Ball, Rickey Godfrey, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tower of Power, Huey Lewis, Hal Ketchum, Teresa James and Joe Ely. A milestone was the invitation from Ray Charles to back him on a nationally broadcast TV appearance for the ESPYs in New York City in 1997. Wise was also member of the \\"Allstar Band\\" performing the Inaugural-Concert for George H. W. Bush in 1989. While recording in 1985 with Radio Zebra, a Texas rock group with whom he had toured Germany a month prior, he received a call from Delbert McClinton to fill the position as saxophonist in his band. Wise took the opportunity and remained a pillar of the group for 23 years. He served as instrumentalist and co-producer of McClinton's Grammy-nominated album Live from Austin in 1989 and as musician of Grammy winner Cost of Living in 2005. After more tours in Central Europe and Scandinavia, a large fan base grew outside the U.S. and led to Wise' increased recognition and the popularity of his music. His eclectic skills brought various honors, from Country Sax Player of the Year at the Oklahoma Country Music Awards in 1980, to 2002 when he earned the Best Instrumentalist Cammy Award from the Beach Music Association. His playing style is written about in John Laughter's Contemporary Saxophone, with four of his solos from the Live from Austin CD featured on the book's companion disc.John Laughter: Contemporary Saxophone. Publisher: Music Sales, 1999, . Reviewers in a variety of journals, magazines, and e-zines describe his soulful solos and just-right backup playing. In 1997 he produced the first CD of his own, which garnered excellent reviews and led to three more discs over the next eight years. Colleagues including Delbert McClinton, Marcia Ball, Gary Bunton, Britt Johansen, Robin Griffin, Bugs Henderson, Big Joe Maher, Teresa James and Steve Williams helped get his ideas heard and appreciated. Friend and co-producer, Wally Moyers, owner of Studio 84 in Lubbock, was invaluable in achieving the sound Wise wanted. Besides featuring his friends' and colleagues' talents, Wise complemented these projects with his own musicianship as a sax pro, as well as his gifts as a composer, lyricist, producer, and singer. In 2008, after an acclaimed tour of Finland and Norway, Wise exited the Delbert McClinton band to devote his time to his family and hobbies. Sometimes he still plays as a guest with various artists, such as Mingo Fishtrap from Austin, Texas, or on Delbert McClinton's annual Sandy Beaches Cruise. Instruments Wise' \\"The martin tenor\\" saxophones Wise plays \\"The Martin Tenor\\" built in 1951 with the Otto Link 7S, metal mouthpiece (adapted By \\"Doc\\" Tenney in Cedar Falls, Iowa). In addition, he has a Martin silver tenor saxophone (which he acquired in trade for a black Keilwerth tenor with golden flaps), a Martin alto, and a Conn soprano sax.

She was commissioned by the White House during the Nixon administration to produce a series of paintings of Tricia Nixon Cox's wedding, also from photographs. She moved to Manhattan in late 1971. On her website Wolf states that she established the Adult Art Program at George Washington University. Also during this period Wolf was a regular attendee of the Studio 54 nightclub. By 1973, her work was widely published, including commercial work for record covers and calendars, and magazine commissions, such as depictions of indigenous peoples for National Geographic. In 1973 Wolf moved to New York to focus on fine art, where she began painting large-scale photorealistic pictures depicting scenes and characters from contemporary New York high society. In 1979 she explained that her work was intended as a form of social commentary and criticism, such as Label Lady, a self-portrait showing Wolf as a fashion victim in head-to-toe designer wear. A lithograph of this painting is now in the Museum of the City of New York. In 1983, when the Albright-Knox Art Gallery acquired Wolf's self-portrait showing her in her studio, it was the gallery's first acquisition of contemporary American realist painting. In the mid-1980s, until 2006, Wolf stepped back from public life to focus on her family and to bring up her two daughters. During this period she launched a jewelry line in 1994, but with the launch of her handbag line in 2006, Wolf completely reentered the public eye. During Christmas 2009 Wolf's daughter Chelsea died following an adverse reaction to a date rape drug, and as a result of the tragedy, Wolf withdrew from her handbag business for two years, and ceased painting for four years. Wolf resumed painting after one of her long-time patrons and fans, the Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, introduced her to the art dealer Leisa Austin, who hosted Wolf's comeback exhibition in March 2014. As fashion designer Alongside, and in addition to her painting career, Wolf has designed jewelry and fashion accessories. She launched a line of scarves in 1978 which she described as \\"half scarf, half jewelry,\\" designed with practical pockets (sometimes shaped like hands) or whimsical appliqu√©s of koalas and hearts. Her designs were sold through department stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. In 1994, whilst bringing up her family, Wolf designed a range of jewelry featuring interchangeable charms that was sold exclusively through Neiman Marcus. In 2006 Wolf launched a line of handbags sold through Bergdorf Goodman, Saks, and Bloomingdales. Following her daughter's death in 2009, the handbag line went on hiatus for two years. Since relaunching her handbag line in 2011, Wolf has dedicated a bag each season to her daughter's memory, donating all profits from its sale to Bereaved Parents of the USA.

Life The son of Thomas Holme, farmer and mercer, he was born at Kendal in Westmorland. After attending Sedbergh School, he spent two years at the Manchester Academy, and then studied at the University of G√∂ttingen and University of Edinburgh. He graduated MD at the University of Leyden in December 1793. Early in 1794 Holme began practice in Manchester, and was shortly afterwards elected one of the physicians to the infirmary there. He joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and was one of its Vice-Presidents from 1797 to 1844, when he succeeded John Dalton as President. He was one of the founders of the Portico Library, and its President for twenty-eight years. He was also a founder and first President of both the Manchester Natural History Society and the Chetham Society (from 1843). He was the first president of the medical section of the British Association at its inaugural meeting at York (1831), and presided over the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association in 1836. He became a member of the Linnean Society in 1799. He was for many years, particularly after the death of John Ferriar, a leader in the medical profession in Manchester, and in the local literary and scientific societies. Holme died unmarried, on 28 November 1847, at Manchester, leaving property worth over ¬£50,000. Most of it he bequeathed, together with his library, to the medical department of University College, London. Works Holme's Leyden dissertation De Structura et Usu Vasorum Absorbentium ran to 61 pages. Of fourteen essays contributed to the Literary and Philosophical Society, he only published a short Note on a Roman inscription found at Manchester (Manchester Memoirs, vol. v.).

A total of four tropical cyclones were observed during the season, three of which strengthened into hurricanes. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Additionally, documentation by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz included a fifth tropical cyclone near Port Isabel, Texas; this storm has since been removed from HURDAT as it was likely the same system as the fourth tropical cyclone. The first storm was tracked beginning on June 30 offshore North Carolina. It moved eastward and was last noted on the following day. However, no tropical cyclones were reported in the remainder of July or August. Activity resume when another tropical storm was located southeast of the Bahamas on September 6\\\\. It intensified into a hurricane before making landfall in North Carolina and was last noted over the north Atlantic Ocean on September 17\\\\. The SS Central America sank offshore, drowning 424 passengers and crew members. Another hurricane may have existed east of South Carolina between September 22 and October 26, though little information is available. The final documented tropical cyclone was initially observed east of Lesser Antilles on September 24\\\\. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, striking the Yucat√°n Peninsula and later Port Isabel, Texas. The storm dissipated on September 30\\\\. In Texas, damage was reported in several towns near the mouth of the Rio Grande River. The season's activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 43. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1857 till:01/11/1857 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1857 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:30/06/1857 till:01/07/1857 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:06/09/1857 till:17/09/1857 color:C2 text:\\"Two (C2)\\" from:22/09/1857 till:26/09/1857 color:C1 text:\\"Three (C1)\\" from:24/09/1857 till:30/09/1857 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1857 till:01/07/1857 text:June from:01/07/1857 till:01/08/1857 text:July from:01/08/1857 till:01/09/1857 text:August from:01/09/1857 till:01/10/1857 text:September from:01/10/1857 till:01/11/1857 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Tropical Storm One= The ship Star of the South experienced heavy gales offshore the East Coast of the United States on June 30.

The storm moved slightly north of due east with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It was last noted about 265 miles (425 km) north-northwest of Bermuda by the bark Virginia late on July 1. =Hurricane Two= The S.S. Central America Disaster Hurricane of 1857 A tropical storm was first observed east of the Bahamas on September 6\\\\. It moved slowly northwestward towards the coast of the United States and attained hurricane strength early on September 9\\\\. The cyclone continued travelling northwest along the US coast, becoming a Category 2 hurricane whilst off the coast of Georgia on September 11. On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but then quickly weakened to a tropical storm and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September 14\\\\. Throughout September 15, whilst over water, the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September 17\\\\. The hurricane caused much coastal damage particularly in the Cape Hatteras area during September 9 and September 10 and then to other parts of the North Carolina coast. Flooding was reported at New Bern. Considerable wind damage also occurred. An article from the Wilmington Journal reported that, \\"It looked as though everything that could be blown down, was down. Fences were prostrated in all directions, and the streets filled with the limbs and bodies of trees up-rooted or twisted off.\\". Several ships were caught in rough seas of the East Coast of the United States. The Norfolk was abandoned in pieces ten miles south of Chincoteague early on the morning of September 14. Further south, on September 11, the hurricane struck the steamer Central America which sprung a leak and eventually sank on the night of September 12 with the loss of 424 passengers and crew. Also on board the ship were 30,000 pounds of gold, the loss of which contributed to the financial Panic of 1857. Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 134-135 =Hurricane Three= Based on reports bark Aeronaut and the schooner Alabama indicating a severe gale, Partagas and Diaz identified a Category 1 hurricane about 405 miles (650 km) east of Charleston, South Carolina between September 22 and September 26. Sustained wind speeds of 80 mph (130 km/h) were observed. No evidence was found for a storm track so the hurricane was assigned a stationary position, at latitude 32.5¬∞N, 3.5¬∞W. Among the ships which encountered the hurricane was the brig Jerome Knight, which sprung a leak and sunk on the night of September 22. =Hurricane Four= The final tropical cyclone was first observed at 0000 UTC on September 24, while located about east of Guadeloupe. Initially a tropical storm, it strengthened slightly before crossing the Leeward Islands on September 25\\\\. In Guadeloupe, several ships at the port in Basseterre were swept out to sea. Continuing eastward, the storm soon entered the Caribbean Sea. Early on September 26, the system strengthened into a hurricane. By September 28, it was west of the Cayman Islands and had reached Category 2 strength. The storm weakened to a tropical storm after passing Canc√∫n early on September 29 and impacted the Gulf coastline, near the United States-Mexico border, at that strength the next day before dissipating. At Port Isabel, Texas, several hundred homes were swept away, and several towns near the mouth of the Rio Grande also sustained damage.

Not accepting the inactivity of the Yesha Council, the settlers organization, he placed an advertisement in a weekly newsletter looking for lawyers who would volunteer to oppose the Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip, to which he says forty lawyers responded, forming the bases for the Legal Forum. Supporting the human rights of the Jewish settlers evacuated from the Gaza Strip and parts of Samaria, the Legal Forum submitted a petition to the High Court of Justice against the forced relocation and dispossession of Jewish Israeli citizens, participated in Knesset committees drafting the law without being able to bring about any changes, and filed several suits with the Supreme Court to improve the financial situation of former Gush Katif residents, costing the state an estimated NIS 2 billion, according to Eyal, thus establishing itself as an advocacy group working for change through the Israeli court system.

These coatings consist of a mixture of zinc and aluminium flakes, which are bonded together by an inorganic matrix. The specifications for zinc flake coatings are defined in international standard ISO 10683 and also in European standard EN 13858. ISO 10683 sets out the requirements for zinc flake coatings for threaded fasteners and EN 13858 describes the requirements for zinc flake coatings for fasteners with no thread and for other parts as well. There are three groups of zinc flake coatings: * Zinc flake coatings containing Cr(VI) (hexavalent chromium): surfaces containing Cr(VI) provide greater anti-corrosion protection with a thinner coating, but Cr(VI) is carcinogenic and poses a potential risk to the environment. New European decrees prohibit the use of surfaces containing Cr(VI). These include the Vehicle End-of-Life Directive EC 2000/53 as of 1 July 2007 and directive EC 2002/95 on electrical and electronic equipment (the RoHS Directive). For applications outside of the automotive and electrical industries these coatings are still valid. * Solvent-based Cr(VI)-free zinc flake coatings. * Water-based Cr(VI)-free zinc flake coatings. Cr(VI)-free coatings are more environmentally friendly than surfaces with a Cr(VI) content. No zinc flake coatings used in the automotive industry nowadays contain this substance. Various manufacturers, such as car companies and their suppliers, have produced their own specifications and supply rules in order to define the requirements for these coating systems. Zinc flake coating is a generic term for the coating technology and this is marketed by the different suppliers under their respective brand names. The companies such as SBILLP, ASAMA GIKEN, Anocote, Cadon, Sundram, generally act as licensors for the individual coating businesses.  History  Because electrolytically zinc- plated surfaces provide comparatively little corrosion protection, and in the case of galvanic zinc coatings on high-strength steel (e.g. category 10.9 and 12.9 high-strength bolts) there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement, the industry needed a better corrosion protection system. High-strength steel parts (such as bolts of strength category > 10.9 and nuts of > 9) and components with tensile strength of > 1000 N/mm2 or > 320 HV are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Galvanic coating processes and pickling with acids have a major influence on the development of hydrogen-induced brittle fractures. In the 1970s, a new coating system was developed in the United States: zinc flake coating (patent number 1376067). By virtue of a thin coat thickness of typically 8-12 Œºm this system produced a high level of protection against corrosion and made it possible to avoid hydrogen embrittlement. In the 1980s and 1990s, the use of these coating systems spread, e.g. within the automotive industry. This industry needs coating systems offering a high level of corrosion resistance. As zinc flake coatings do not create any hydrogen in the process, they were used for critical applications as an alternative to electroplating.  Characteristics  Today, these are the preferred coatings for fasteners and other parts in the automotive industry, as they offer various advantages: * Good appearance (colouring) * Very good protection against corrosion (240 - 1,500 hours, depending on specification and coating thickness) * Resistant to extreme temperatures * Good chemical resistance * Environmentally friendly * Good friction characteristics (on bolts and nuts) * No warm-loosening torque * No risk for high-strength fasteners of any hydrogen embrittlement * Electric conductivity * Other assembly properties The requirements of the automotive industry have set new objectives. Corrosion protection and appearance are no longer the only and most important characteristics. In addition to the applications in the automotive industry, these coating systems are also found in wind power systems, the construction industry, electrical equipment (plant construction), trucks and other markets as well. Zinc flake coatings create what is known as cathodic protection: the less noble zinc 'sacrifices' itself in order to protect the underlying metal. Steel can be protected in this way. The coating thickness is often between 5 Œºm and 15 Œºm, with thicker layers also possible where there are special requirements. When coating metric threaded parts it is necessary to keep to the tolerances defined in ISO 965 so that the bolt's thread does not get gummed up and the coefficient of friction can be set accordingly. Hot-dip galvanised fasteners with a typical coating thickness of 80-200 Œºm have to be grooved again retrospectively in order to expose the thread. In contrast to paints where the risk of sub-surface corrosion creep exists, this phenomenon is avoided through the sacrificial effect of the zinc. In salt spray test¬≠s zinc flake coatings demonstrate better protection against corrosion than a typical galvanic zinc coating, which in the tests (generally run in accordance with ISO 9227) often achieve only 96 to 200 hours.  Coating technique  The material for the zinc flake coatings gets supplied in liquid form and needs to be prepared to the desired conditions before application. The viscosity, temperature and stirring time prior to application all play an important role here. The material can be applied using the following application techniques: * Spraying. The coating material is applied to the parts' surface using a spray gun. This can be done manually or in a fully automated spraying facility (this process is used for larger or unwieldy parts, also termed rack parts, as they are brought into the coating process on a rack). * Dip-spinning. The parts get loaded into a basket. The coating is done by dipping the basket into a container filled with the prepared coating material. After the dipping, the basket gets spun around in order to remove the residue of the coating material (this process is used for smaller high-volume / bulk parts, also called drum parts). * Rack-mounted dip-spinning. Parts that are positioned or otherwise fixed in baskets are dipped, spun and passed through the furnace with the rack. * Dip-drain coating. Dipping the part into the coating material and drawing it out in a set manner enables the inside and outside of, for example, pipes to be coated in a single process. The parts should, however, have sufficient openings that the material can drain away again, otherwise flawless coating is not possible, as the accumulations of the material cause air bubbles to form. Prior to coating, the parts' surface needs to be pre-treated. Pickling with acids (e.g. sulfuric or hydrochloric acid) produces atomic hydrogen and can penetrate into the steel structure and make it brittle. In order to avoid pickling procedures, other pre-treatment processes are required. The typical cleaning processes are removal with an alkaline aqueous solution and then blasting with very small steel balls (shot). Cleaning solutions remove grease, oil and dirt from the metal surface. Blasting removes scaling and rust through the mechanical action of the steel balls, which are fired at the parts inside a chamber using a turbine. Neither process produces any hydrogen, so there is no danger of any hydrogen embrittlement when pre- treating high-strength steels in this way. After the pre-treatment then comes the coating process. Mounted on a rack the parts get sprayed with the zinc flake material (spraying process) or, placed inside a container, they get dipped and spun (dip-spinning). The coating material forms a liquid, uniform layer on the parts' surface. In order to develop the excellent properties of zinc flake coatings, an annealing process is required. The coated parts have to be cured inside an oven at a controlled temperature for a set period. This temperature/time configuration is dependent on the coating material and the product manufacturer, as each manufacturer of zinc flake products has its patented formula. Typical curing temperatures are 200 ¬∞C, 240 ¬∞C and 320 ¬∞C. After the curing, a uniform, thin, firmly bonded and dry layer is produced.  Applications  Zinc flake coatings are used as cathodic protective layers against corrosion all over the world in the automotive and construction industries. Combined with cured, thin, organic or inorganic coatings, these can also provide colour (black, silver, green, blue, etc.), chemical resistance, low electrical conductivity (due to the influence of the organic layer) and assembly properties. If required, re-lubrication or a thread lock (patch) is also possible. Steel parts that can be coated with zinc flake coatings include, for example, bolts, nuts, springs, panels and structural parts. In the case of wind turbines these coatings are frequently used for threaded fastening elements. Good systems are certified by, among others, the GL Group with the certificate \\"Germanischer Lloyd\\". Zinc flake coatings are particularly well suited to high-strength bolts (strength category 10.9 and above), high-strength nuts (strength category 10 and above) and structural parts with tensile strength of > 1000 N/mm2 or > 320 HV because hydrogen embrittlement is avoided.

He played with the 1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team, and represented New Zealand in 1893, and once in 1896 when he captained the side. Gage was born in Kihikihi to Annie (daughter of Joseph Jenner Merrett and Rangitetaea Koa) and John Gage (son of George Gage and Waana Pororua). After an early education in Auckland, he was awarded a scholarship to attend Te Aute College in the Hawke's Bay. After joining the Poneke Football Club of fellow Te Aute old-boy Thomas Ellison in 1887, he made his provincial debut for Wellington in that same year. It was probably at Ellison's suggestion that he was selected for Joe Warbrick's Native Football team that toured New Zealand, Australia, and Britain in 1888 and 1889. Gage played in 68 of the Natives side's 74 matches when in Britain, and appeared in their fixtures against Ireland, Wales, and England. The 74 British Isles matches were played over a period of six months, averaging a match every 2.3 days, and the Natives' team often struggled to field a fit side. He could play anywhere in the backs, and ended up appearing in every back-line position despite originally being selected as a fullback. When the Natives toured Australia after the British Isles leg of their tour, Gage returned to New Zealand due to an ill relative. He did turn out for the team once they returned to New Zealand however, when he played a further five matches. After returning to Wellington, Gage continued playing for Poneke, and represented Wellington in 1889. The following season, the Wellington Rugby Union (WRU)‚Äîwhich administered the sport in the city‚Äîdecided that Gage was ineligible for selection in the provincial team. Poneke responded by withdrawing from the club competition, and the exclusion of any Poneke players weakened the Wellington side considerably. Hawke's Bay hosted Wellington that season, and Gage was eligible for the Bay side after playing several club games in the region; despite the opportunity to \\"get even\\" with the Wellington authorities, he declined to play for Hawke's Bay. 1891 and 1892 saw Gage return to the Wellington side, and he was then selected for the first representative New Zealand side organised under the authority of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. The New Zealand team toured Australia in 1893, and was captained by Gage's Poneke and Wellington teammate Ellison. He was again selected for New Zealand in 1896, this time captaining the team against Queensland in Wellington. During his rugby career, which ended in 1901, Gage amassed 131 first-class appearances, an enormous number for the time. Gage worked as both a MƒÅori interpreter, and later for the Wellington City Council. Following Gage's death from tuberculosis at age 48, the Poneke Club raised money to pay for his headstone in Karori Cemetery, and support his widow and six children.

Robert Graves, 1835 mezzotint by John Richardson Jackson, his only pupil, after Robert William Buss Life He was born in Tottenham Court Road on 7 May 1798; his father and grandfather, both Robert Graves, were printsellers in London. He became in 1812 a pupil of John Romney, the line engraver, and at the same time studied in the life school in Ship Yard, Temple Bar. He executed in pen and ink facsimiles of rare prints on commissions from collectors. Before long he decided to concentrate on engraving. In 1836 Graves was elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy, in succession to James Fittler. He presented as his diploma work a portrait of Lord Byron, after Thomas Phillips. Graves died of paralysis at 20 Grove Terrace, Highgate Road, London, on 28 February 1873, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Works Among Graves's earliest works were some of the plates in James Caulfield's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons from the Revolution in 1688 to the end of the Reign of George II, London, 1819‚Äì20. These were followed by portraits and vignettes for J. F. Dove's English Classics and other works. His first exhibited work, a medallion portrait of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes, after Peter Rouw, appeared in 1824 in the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists, where other small plates by him appeared until 1830. He engraved some of the portraits of the deans of Westminster for John Preston Neale's History and Antiquities of the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, 1818‚Äì23, and the portraits for Gilbert Burnet's History of the Reformation, 1838 edition. Robert Graves, lithograph by Thomas Fairland Between 1831 and 1834 Graves executed the three plates of The Enthusiast and Mathematical Abstraction after Theodore Lane, and The Musical Bore, after Robert William Buss. For the author's edition of the Waverley Novels he engraved plates after David Wilkie, Edwin Landseer, William Mulready, and others. He also worked for the Literary Souvenir, Iris, Amulet, Forget-Me-Not, and Keepsake Fran√ßais on plates, after Murillo, Wilkie, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Simon Jacques Rochard, and other painters. After his election A.R.A., works which Graves sent to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy included: * The Abbotsford Family, after David Wilkie, in 1837; * The Examination of Shakespeare before Sir Thomas Lucy on a charge of Deer-stealing, and A Castaway, both after George Harvey, in 1839 and 1841; * The Highland Whiskey Still, after Edwin Landseer, in 1842; * The First Reading of the Bible in the Crypt of Old St. Paul's, after George Harvey, in 1846; * Lord Nelson, after Lemuel Francis Abbott, in 1847; * The Baron's Charger, after John Frederick Herring, and The Highland Cradle, after Edwin Landseer, in 1850; * Cromwell resolving to refuse the Crown, after Charles Lucy, in 1858; * The Slide, after Thomas Webster, in 1861; * The Good Shepherd and The Immaculate Conception, both after Murillo, in 1863 and 1865; * The Hon. Mrs. Graham, after Thomas Gainsborough, in 1866; * The Blue Boy (Master Burrell), after Gainsborough, and Mrs. Lloyd, after Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1868; * Via Dolorosa, after Raphael (or Cima da Conegliano?), in 1869; * Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, and Mrs. Beaufoy, both after Gainsborough, in 1870 and 1872. Graves also exhibited plates engraved for the Art Journal, including: * Haidee, a Greek Girl, and The Sisters, after Charles Eastlake; * The Princess Amelia, after Sir Thomas Lawrence; * The Princess Victoria Gouramma of Coorg, after Franz Xaver Winterhalter; * The Princesses Mary, Sophia, and Amelia, daughters of George III, after John Singleton Copley; * The Origin of the Harp, after Daniel Maclise; and * Paolo and Francesca da Rimini, after Joseph Noel Paton. His last finished plate was a portrait of Charles Dickens, after William Powell Frith, for John Forster's Life of the novelist. He left unfinished a plate after Gainsborough's portrait of Lady Bowater, which was completed by James Stephenson. Family Graves's son Frederick Percy Graves was a landscape artist. Another son, Robert Edmund Graves, worked at the British Museum. The printseller Henry Graves was Robert Graves's brother, and Algernon Graves was son of Henry.

Career Wykes turned professional in 1991 and achieved a career highest ranking of 56 in 1999, twice reaching the final qualifying round of the World Championship. He enjoyed victories over top names such as Paul Hunter, Joe Johnson, Neal Foulds and Willie Thorne and in 1999 reached the last 16 of the UK Championship in his home town, Bournemouth, where Stephen Hendry made a 147 on the way to beating him 9‚Äì3. In the 2000s, snooker took second place to Wykes's business interests and family, mostly due to the various financial cutbacks afflicting the game at the time. After winning just two matches during the 2006‚Äì07 season he fell to 95th place on the world rankings and decided to retire from snooker. \\"I thought I was off the tour last year and decided to carry on this season when I found out I was safe,\\" he said. \\"Looking back, that was probably the wrong decision because I‚Äôve just been going through the motions really\\". Wykes however continued to keep his WPBSA membership, and thus was eligible to enter the preliminary qualifying for the World Championship. He returned to action in 2010, defeating David Taylor and Les Dodd to get through to the first qualifying round, where he lost 6‚Äì10 to James Wattana. Wykes came back in 2013, the last year when non-tour professionals could enter the World Championship, following a victory in the local Dorset Open tournament and a family discussion: \\"It has always been a dream of mine to play at the Crucible. I know it is a long shot but I am going to give it my best\\". He beat Robin Hull and Lucky Vatnani but lost to Justin Astley. Wykes then entered Q School and came close to regaining his tour place in Event 2, where he went all the way to the quarter finals, only to be whitewashed by Alexander Ursenbacher. Personal life Wykes resides with his family in Tuckton, Bournemouth. He has two sons, Lewis and Samuel. He currently runs his own wealth management company.

In the diagram, castles are tan color; the river is blue. Initial positions: giraffes (a-file), monkeys (b-file), elephants (c- and e-files), lions (d-file), crocodiles (f-file), and zebras (g-file). Pawns fill each player's second . Congo is a chess variant invented by Demian Freeling in 1982 when he was nearly 8 years old. His father (Dutch abstract games designer Christian Freeling) encouraged him to design a variant using a 7√ó7 gameboard. Demian was already familiar with chess and xiangqi, and the result blends some features from both. Congo became the second-most popular chess variant at the Fanaat games club in Enschede, the Netherlands. For his Congo engine, Ed van Zon won \\"Best of the Zillions\\" First Contest, Best Chess-Related Category in March 2001.\\"Best of Zillions\\" Board The play is on the squares of a 7√ó7 gameboard. The board has two 3√ó3 castles to house the lions. A river divides the board horizontally across the center. Game rules The starting setup is as shown. White (brown pieces in the diagram) moves first. Players alternate turns; there is no passing. The game is won by capturing the opponent's lion. The game immediately ends when a lion has been captured. There is no check in Congo, so a lion may move to an attacked square (but the opponent wins immediately by simply capturing it). Consequently, Congo also has no draw by stalemate-stalemate is simply an extreme form of zugzwang, resulting in a loss for the stalemated player. =Lion= The lion moves and captures one step orthogonally or diagonally in any direction‚Äîthe same as a king in chess. It may not leave its 3√ó3 castle. The lion also has the special power to capture the enemy lion by moving as a chess queen across the river along an unobstructed or diagonal‚Äîlike the special \\"flying general\\" move of a xiangqi general. =Zebra= The zebra moves and captures the same as a chess knight. =Elephant= An elephant can move [to] and capture [on] a square one or two orthogonal steps away. If two steps away, the move or capture must be in a straight line, and the intervening square is jumped (whether occupied or not, unlike the xiangqi elephant which is blocked by a diagonally adjacent piece). Unlike the xiangqi elephant, it may cross the river. =Giraffe= The giraffe moves (but does not capture) one step in any direction. It can also move [to] and capture [on] a square two steps away in any direction in a straight line. The intervening square is jumped (whether occupied or not). =Monkey= The monkey moves (but does not capture) one step in any direction. It can also capture an enemy man on an adjacent square (orthogonally or diagonally) by jumping over it to the vacant square immediately beyond. As in international draughts, multiple captures are permitted with the same piece in the same turn. In a multi- capture move: * successive jumps can be in different directions; * a given man may be jumped only once; * a given square may be visited more than once; * all men jumped are removed from play only after the entire multi-capture move has completed. Unlike draughts, a capturing move is never mandatory in Congo. =Crocodile= The crocodile moves and captures one step in any direction. It can also move and capture as a chess rook toward the river along a file (including entering the river), as well as down the river () when in the river. =Pawn= A pawn moves and captures one step straight or diagonally forward. When past the river, it can also move (but not capture) one or two steps straight backward (without jumping). A pawn promotes to superpawn when reaching the last rank. A superpawn has the same move/capture as a pawn, but in addition can move and capture one step straight sideways, and move (but not capture) one or two steps straight or diagonally backward (without jumping). A superpawn's powers are not dependent on its position on the board. =Drowning= Except for the crocodile, any piece ending its move in the river must leave the river the next turn or it drowns. A drowned piece is removed from play at the end of the turn. A monkey may enter and leave the river during a multi-capture move without consequence; it drowns if and only if it ends two consecutive turns in the river. If the monkey drowns after completing a multi-capture move, the captures it made are still legal.

She lives in London, England. Early life Louise Wallis was born in 1964, into a musical family in Birmingham, England. She was raised by her mother and maternal grandparents. Her grandfather Syd had his own band, notorious in the post-war years for raucous all-night parties, and her great grandmother Kitty was a celebrated pianist who played pubs and clubs into her 90s. At age six, Wallis acquired a step-father and a new brother; she also acquired a kitten, to soften the blow of a sudden move to Southampton. Four years later she gained a sister. She sought solace in the company of animals, developing a particular passion for horses. By the age of 18 she was a fully-fledged animal activist and vegan. Animal advocacy In 1988, as a Regional Campaigns Officer for the National Anti-Vivisection Society, she organised one of the largest national anti- vivisection marches ever held (25,000 people). She then carried out undercover investigations in 1990. Seeing a job advert titled 'An Important Role working with Animals', she soon found herself working as a trainee animal technician with the drug company SmithKline Beecham. She applied for a job at a second animal research laboratory St Bartholomew's Medical School where she worked for several months before being sacked after, in all likelihood, a police tip off. In a bizarre twist of fate, Louise had moved into a flat on Burgoyne Road in north London, which had been vacated by another activist, John Barker, who was later unmasked as an undercover police spy. Nevertheless, Wallis's story made national press, and she was dubbed \\"Britain's No 1 Animals Rights Campaigner\\" by the Sunday Sport newspaper. With the National Anti-Vivisection Society she launched a 'Free the Beagles' campaign calling for the release of 24 dogs for whom she had cared at SmithKline Beecham; the company refused, and all 24 dogs were destroyed. In November 1991 Wallis was elected president of the Vegan Society. She commissioned and produced the charity's first film, Truth or Dairy, starring Benjamin Zephaniah and directed by Franny Armstrong. In 1994 Wallis, then President and Chair of the Vegan Society, founded World Vegan Day to commemorate the society's 50th anniversary. Vegans around the world now join together to celebrate animal rights every World Vegan Day, held annually on 1 November. However, the actual founding of the Vegan Society is thought to have been either 5 or 12 November 1944. On 29 March 1995 she gave evidence on animal welfare at the infamous 'McLibel' trial, the longest- running case in English history, which involved two activists sued by McDonald's for distributing a leaflet called \\"What's Wrong with McDonald's?\\" In 2013, it emerged that this leaflet had been co-written by another undercover police spy, Bob Lambert. On 2 October 2010, Wallis gave a speech at the national 'March for Farmed Animals,' marking World Farm Animals Day. She briefly returned to the Vegan Society as a director in November 2010, before resigning in June 2011. She continues to write for the Society's magazine The Vegan. Music Under the pseudonym Luminous, Wallis DJs and sings in the band Luminous Frenzy, a collaboration with her guitarist / composer partner Frank Frenzy. Reviewers have compared her haunting, siren-like vocals to Sia, Alison Moyet and Portishead's Beth Gibbons. Luminous Frenzy performed at the first Bestival in 2004, and the Big Chill Festival 2005. Big Chill founder Pete Lawrence later cited the band as one of several that year that he considered to be \\"at the cutting edge of musical progression\\". Luminous Frenzy's debut album, 'Violence Ambience,' (Freeport Records) was released in 2006, and launched at the Big Chill Bar. It included the track 'McEmotion', written for and featured in McLibel, a film directed by Franny Armstrong and later selected by the British Film Institute for their series \\"Ten Documentaries That Shook the World\\". The critically acclaimed single 'Three Cliffs Bay' followed in 2007, recorded with Adam Thomas. Expanding to a five- piece, Luminous Frenzy went on to develop a heavier rock-driven sound. This led them to record their next single, ‚ÄòMomentary/Random Generator,‚Äô with producer Paul Sampson, whose credits include Catatonia and \\"Crash,\\" a Top 3 US hit by The Primitives. Wallis was voted one of the World's 'Top 100 Female DJs', in a comprehensive worldwide listing in the first, and so far only, poll of its kind. She was ranked 68 (19 in the UK), between Radio 1 DJs Annie Mac and Annie Nightingale. For many years she had a monthly DJ residency at the legendary venue The Foundry where she also appeared as a guest on Tracey Moberly's The Late, Late Breakfast Show with comedian Mark Thomas. A French house music fan and francophile, Wallis has performed twice at the French Institute's 12-hour extravaganza 'My Night With Philosophers'. Combining her love of DJing and veganism, Wallis has created two popular vegan-themed DJ mixes. ‚ÄòVegan Anthems‚Äô in 2010 was described by the award-winning blog Our Hen House as \\"an eclectic, moving, unexpectedly genius set.\\" In 2011, Luminous created 'Vegan Artists ‚Äì from Sigur R√≥s to Black Sabbath' in what she described as \\"an odyssey.\\" Author Wallis writes for various health and lifestyle magazines including Get Fresh!, Your Healthy Living, Vegetarian Living and The Vegan. She has interviewed musicians Johnny Marr, Moby and Geezer Butler, the dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah, and comedian Richard Herring, as well as vegan chefs Mimi Kirk and Mel Baker (aka the Kind Cook).

The assassination eventually sparked the Russo‚ÄìSwedish War of 1741‚Äì1743 and also inspired the so-called \\"Sinclairvisan\\", a song about Sinclair by Anders Odel. The Swedish National Portrait Gallery at the Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred includes a painting by Johan Henrik Scheffel of Sinclair wearing uniform and armor from 1728 that is currently deposited in Ulriksdal Palace.  Biography  Sinclair was born in 1690 to a family of Scottish immigrants who settled in Sweden in the 17th century. He chose a military career and became a second lieutenant in the Life Guards in 1708. In late 1707 he took part in Charles XII invasion of the Russian heartland where was captured as a prisoner of war after the army's surrender at Perevolochna. Sinclair was imprisoned in the city of Kazan till 1722 when he returned to Sweden and was consequently promoted to the military rank of lieutenant. In 1737 Sinclair was dispatched to the Ottoman Empire to gather intelligence on the ongoing Austro-Russian‚ÄìTurkish war. In July 1738 Sinclair, by then the major of the Uppland Regiment and a member of the Secret Committee, undertook a second trip with the aim of trying to arrange a safer way of diplomatic communications between Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. Sinclair brought an extra copy of a letter that was also sent with another courier. The letter was intended for the Swedish ministers in Constantinople on the subject of negotiations with the Ottoman Empire on a possible alliance against Russia. Although the diplomatic mission was kept in high secrecy the Russian Minister Plenipotentiary in Stockholm, Bestuzhev-Ryumin, became aware of it and forwarded the information, including a portrait of Sinclair to the Russian government. Bestuzhev-Ryumin also suggested to intercept the envoy on his way and blame the haidamakas for the assassination to prevent an anti-Russian alliance. Sinclair's departure went well, he accomplished his mission and at the beginning of April 1739 left Constantinople with letters from the Sultan, the Grand Vizier and the Swedish envoy. He also carried the bonds that Charles XII left to the Turkish government during his stay in the Ottoman Empire. Because of the suspicions that the Russians could be looking for him Sinclair traveled first with the Ottoman, then Polish escort until he reached the territory of Austria. However, on 17 June, a few miles to the north of Breslau in Silesia, between Gr√ºneberg (Zielona G√≥ra) and Neustadt (Prudnik), he was overtaken by two Russian officers, captain K√ºtler and lieutenant Lewitzki, who were dispatched by M√ºnnich with an order to \\"catch up\\" the envoy. The officers took away from Sinclair his diplomatic papers, pulled him out of the coach and took him aside to a forest where he was killed and looted.  Political effects of the murder  The story was reported by a French merchant Couturier, who had traveled in the company of Sinclair. He was first taken to Dresden, where the Russian Minister held him for some time captive. Eventually he was released and received 500 ducats in compensation and went to Stockholm to testify about the murder. The Russian government however denied the responsibility for the assassination in official letters to the courts of Europe. The officers who carried out the assassination were exiled to Siberia but later during the Elizabeth's rule were promoted and moved to the city of Kazan. In Sweden the assassination brought tremendous resentment around the country and hatred towards Russia that spurred the war of 1741. Great part in inducing these emotions among the commoners belongs to \\"Sinclairvisan\\", a song about Sinclair by Anders Odel that in more than 95 stanzas depicts how Major Sinclair \\"on the other side\\" meets Charles XII, describes his fate and urges Swedes to revenge against Russia. At the site of the murder in 1909 the Swedish government erected a memorial. The text on the pedestal marble painting reads: \\"Hier fiel durch M√∂rderhand d. Schwed. Gesandte Baron v. Sinclair 17. VI. 1739\\" (eng.

He remained there until 1992 when he was sent to St Aidan's Parish, Wishaw as well as serving as chaplain to St Aidan's High School, Wishaw and chaplain to Our Lady's High School, Motherwell. =Diplomatic career= In 1994 Cushley was summoned to the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, studying diplomacy at the same time as studying for a doctorate in canon law (JCD) at the Pontifical Gregorian University, which he earned in 1997. He formally entered the Diplomatic Service of the Holy See on 1 July 1997. Cushley has served in the nunciatures of Egypt, Burundi, Portugal and the United Nations in New York and South Africa. From 2009 until 2013, Cushley was head of the English-language section of the Vatican Secretariat of State. In that capacity, he was responsible for accompanying the pope during all his visits to English speaking countries, such as the visits by Benedict XVI to Malta, Cyprus and the United Kingdom in 2010. In 2012, he took on an additional role in the Vatican when he was appointed to the ceremonial position of \\"prelate of the anticamera\\", with duties that include assisting when the pope receives visits from prominent dignitaries such as heads of state. Episcopal appointment On 24 July 2013 Cushley was appointed as the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, less than a year after Cardinal O'Brien resigned over sexual misconduct. On appointment, Cushley stated: Cushley was consecrated and installed on 21 September,Monsignor Leo Cushley installed as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh the Feast of Saint Matthew, where the principal consecrators were Cardinal James Michael Harvey of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls; the Papal Nuncio, Antonio Mennini; and Archbishop Philip Tartaglia of Glasgow.

The document's stated aim was to \\"respond to the mission entrusted to him [Cushley] by Pope Francis: to bring the joy of the Gospel to contemporary society.\\" Following the publication of the letter, Cushley embarked upon 32 public meetings across the Archdiocese to discuss his ideas, which include the possibility of creating larger parish units through either mergers or closures.Archbishop urges faithful to resist pessimism ahead of parish closures Cushley planned to restart a dormant office dealing with poor and marginalised people. He noted that Francis wants more done for poor people. Cushley wanted to find out fast what the archdiocese does for destitute people, unemployed people, drug addicts and others who are traditionally helped. Cushley wanted to see if improvements were possible.Archbishop vows helping the needy will be his priority In February 2015 Cushley came under attack in an op-ed article published in the Observer newspaper which noted that the Catholic Church in Scotland had not corporately joined Churches' Mutual Credit Union, a new credit union co-founded by other Scottish Christian denominations. It also called upon Cushley to sell his official residence, St Benet‚Äôs, to provide funds for poor people.Why has the Catholic church yet to play any part in the credit union established by the Church of Scotland? Keith O'Brien Keith O'Brien stood down as archbishop after three priests and a former priest accused him of predatory and unwelcome sexual contact in the 1980s. In September 2013 \\"Cushley...suggested that O‚ÄôBrien will not be permitted to return to Scotland and is likely to spend his remaining years in exile.\\"Leo Cushley: O‚ÄôBrien will not return to Scotland according to The Scotsman. By contrast the BBC claimed \\"Cushley conceded it was \\"not impossible\\" that the cardinal would one day return. But he made it clear he did not believe that possibility was likely or desirable.\\"Monsignor Leo Cushley says Cardinal Keith O'Brien should not return to Scotland Cushley also said he did not believe an independent investigation into O'Brien was necessary. Talking about the situation with O'Brien, Cushley denied that the church was at its lowest ebb though the church and had taken a battering. Cushley said that the people of the Archdiocese wished to leave the matter behind.O'Brien successor in talks with Pope over scandal-hit diocese He also said, \\"Cardinal O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs behaviour distressed many, demoralised faithful Catholics and made the church less credible to those who are not Catholic.\\" but called for forgiveness.Pope Francis accepts Scottish cardinal Keith O‚ÄôBrien's resignation References Category:1961 births Category:20th- century Roman Catholic priests Category:21st-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Archbishops of St. Andrews and Edinburgh Category:Living people Category:People from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire Category:Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy alumni Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni Category:Scottish Roman Catholics ","title":"Leo Cushley"},{"id":"40057284","text":"The village of Bani Saleh is one of the villages of the center Fashn Beni Suef Arab Republic of Egypt.

She is best known for writing Eyes of Dawn (1991) and Sandglass (1995), two of the most influential and highly rated Korean dramas of all time. Career =1980s: Early works= Song Ji-na began her career as a writer for the radio program Starry Night on MBC Radio. She made her television writing debut in 1982 on the children's show Tiger Teacher, while writing the scripts of a social documentary TV series. She then met TV director Kim Jong-hak, with whom she would famously collaborate on eight television dramas. Their first work together was The Last Station (1987), one of MBC's early experiments with the miniseries format. Adapted from a manhwa by Huh Young-man, the eight-episode series was set in the 1970s and starred Jung Dong-hwan and Kang Moon-young. Song and Kim's second drama was Teacher, Teacher, Our Teacher (1988). Their third collaboration, Human Market (1988) was based on Kim Hong-shin's bestselling novel and became one of the classics of 1980s Korean television (SBS would later remake it in 2004). =1990s: Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass= To celebrate MBC's 30th anniversary, Song and Kim adapted Kim Seong-jong's 10-volume novel (published in 1981), embarking on a drama that would make Korean television history. Eyes of Dawn began filming in advance in June 1990, with overseas shoots in the Philippines and Harbin (despite the fact that Korea and China hadn't yet established diplomatic relations), a budget of (five- to ten-times the cost of an average drama at the time), over 270 actors and 21,000 extras. Starring Choi Jae-sung, Park Sang-won and Chae Shi-ra, the series spanned Korea's painful modern history from the Japanese colonial period to the Korean War. When it aired from 1991 to 1992, it reached a peak viewership rating of 58.4%. In 1992, Song and Kim co-founded the production company Jcom (predecessor to Kim Jong-hak Production, which was founded by Kim in 1999). Three years later, they moved to then-newly launched broadcasting station SBS, and their next drama would be equally popular and critically acclaimed. Set during the politically tumultuous period of 1970s through 1980s Korea (including a reenactment of the Gwangju Massacre interspersed with archival video footage), Sandglass (1995) recorded a peak rating of 64.5%, the third highest of all time, and launched Choi Min-soo, Go Hyun-jung, Park Sang- won and Lee Jung-jae into stardom. Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass were so phenomenally popular that while they were airing, streets were reportedly deserted because people were in their homes watching. Critics and viewers praised the dramas' outstanding production values (editing, cinematography, acting, writing), and for their realistic portrayal of individual lives amidst dark political times. They are currently still considered iconic masterpieces of Korean TV. Though Song and Kim would collaborate again, their subsequent series would not reach the same heights of success. =1997 to 2003= Song was also the screenwriter for two films -- 3pm Paradise (1997) directed by Kwak Kyung-taek, and the melodrama Love (1999) starring Jung Woo-sung and Ko So-young. Later that year, she returned to television and co-wrote Love Story, a 16-episode anthology drama that aired from December 1999 to January 2000 featuring eight different stories with two episodes per story. Among its star- studded cast were Lee Byung-hun, Lee Seung-yeon, Kim Sun-a, Choi Ji-woo, Song Seung-heon, Cha Seung-won, Lee Na-young, Lee Beom-soo, Song Yun-ah, Yoo Ji- tae, Lee Mi-yeon, Lee Geung-young, Bae Doona, So Ji-sub, Kim Hyun-joo, and Kim Tae-woo. Her 2002 Joseon period drama Daemang (also known as Great Ambition) was again directed by Kim Jong-hak and starred Jang Hyuk and Lee Yo-won. This was followed in 2003 by Rosemary, which featured Yoo Ho-jeong, Kim Seung-woo, Bae Doona and Yeon Jung-hoon in a story about a terminally ill wife. =2007: The Legend= Song then moved to New Zealand and went on hiatus for four years. She made her comeback in 2007 with another Kim Jong-hak project, the big-budget historical-fantasy-epic The Legend (also known as Taewangsasingi, or \\"The Four Guardian Gods of the King\\"). Highly anticipated for being Korean Wave superstar Bae Yong-joon's first TV series in five years, the series also starred Lee Ji-ah, Moon So-ri, Choi Min-soo, Park Sang-won and Lee Phillip. But despite excellent ratings (its peak was 35.7%) and solid overseas sales, The Legend wasn't able to recoup its huge budget, so it became (in terms of profit) the biggest flop in Korean drama history. =2009: The Slingshot= Her 2009 action thriller Story of a Man (also known as The Slingshot) starred Park Yong-ha, Kim Kang-woo and Park Si-yeon, and focused on a man forming a \\"dream team\\" to face off against a sociopathic businessman and the money- driven world he represents. Despite low ratings in the single digits (it shared the same timeslot as hit period drama Queen Seondeok), The Slingshot won Best Drama Series at the 2009 Seoul International Drama Awards. =2011: What's Up= For her next project, Song returned to the genre of campus drama; she had previously written KAIST in 1999, about students attending the titular premier science university, and the series boosted the careers of young stars such as Chae Rim. In What's Up, an ensemble cast composed of Im Joo-hwan, Daesung, Lim Ju-eun, Oh Man-seok, Jang Hee-jin, Kim Ji-won, Lee Soo-hyuk and Jo Jung-suk portray students and teachers of a university's musical theatre department. Song was highly involved in the production process, including the open auditions for the supporting roles through micro-blogging service me2day. The drama was filmed in its entirety in 2010, but later encountered problems finding a timeslot among the three major broadcast networks. It eventually aired a year later on cable channel MBN. =2012: Faith= Faith (also known as The Great Doctor, 2012) was Song's eighth and last collaboration with Kim Jong-hak. A fantasy epic about a 21st-century plastic surgeon who time travels to the Goryeo era and falls for royal bodyguard Choe Yeong, the series initially cast Lee Joon-gi and Kim Hee-sun as the protagonists. But Lee was drafted for mandatory military service, and he was replaced by Kang Ji-hwan, who then became embroiled in a legal dispute with his agency, and the role eventually went to Lee Min-ho. Over three years of stalled pre-production, the story itself underwent major changes, becoming less dark and less fantastical. Given its budget and low ratings (around the 10% range), Faith was considered a financial failure. Members of the cast and crew later sued Kim Jong-hak for unpaid wages, and while being investigated for fraud and embezzlement, he committed suicide in July 2013. Song wrote in her blog about seeing the various actors who'd previously starred in Kim's past series at the director's wake, saying, \\"It was like a scene from a dream. Perhaps he wanted us all to come together like this and dine... Was that it?\\" =2014: Healer= In 2014, Song cast Ji Chang-wook as the titular character in Healer, about a not-so- ordinary errand guy who becomes embroiled in a decades-long mystery involving two reporters (played by Park Min-young and Yoo Ji-tae). Despite lackluster ratings, Healer drew a cult following among domestic and international viewers. =2017: The King in Love= In 2017, Song took the lead as the main writer for another drama, The King in Love. Set in the Goryeo dynasty, it tells the story of a young and ambitious crown prince, Won (Im Si-wan), and two people who shape his destiny: his childhood friend Rin (Hong Jong-hyun) and a beautiful woman named San (Im Yoon- ah).https://www.soompi.com/2017/06/19/king-loves-revealed-written-song-ji-na- writer-healer/ Personal life Song is married to Jin Ki-woong, a director for KBS1's long-running investigative news program In Depth 60 Minutes.https://m.blog.naver.com/yskh924/13989738 They have a son, Jin Han-sae (Gin Han-sai), who is also a drama screenwriter.

Early life Park Yong-woo's father was an engineering professor and his mother was a music teacher. As a child he was shy and expressed himself poorly. Instead, he nurtured his imagination. When he first chose to become an actor, Park felt hampered by the fact that he didn't have any childhood or family trauma to draw from, but later realized that a vivid imagination was the key to his acting process because it didn't require him to show his \\"naked face.\\" Career =Supporting actor= Park failed the college entrance exams twice before he was accepted to the prestigious Theater and Film department at Chung-Ang University in 1991. He failed twice more when he joined MBC's actor's auditions, then finally passed in 1995. Park spent a decade playing minor and supporting roles on television and film, notably in Shiri (1999), Ditto (2000) and Age of Warriors (2003). He later said those ten years of experience enabled him to have greater freedom and control with his acting, and that he believes a person is not just born a good actor, but rather good acting requires much preparation and work, with some luck thrown in. Park said, \\"I guess every actor dreams of playing a main character and I'm not an exception. But for me, it is more important to become a good actor regardless of how big my roles are.\\" =2005-2006: Career breakthrough= In 2005, Park drew critical notice with his much-praised portrayal of the influential son of a paper mill owner in Kim Dae-seung's period thriller Blood Rain (2005). He won Best Supporting Actor honors at the Chunsa Film Art Awards and the Korean Film Awards, as well as nominations at the Grand Bell Awards and Blue Dragon Film Awards. But his career breakthrough would come in his first leading role, in dark romantic comedy My Scary Girl (2006) opposite Choi Kang-hee. Titled \\"Sweet, Bloodthirsty Lover\\" in Korean, Park played a timid college lecturer in his late 20s who finally finds his first girlfriend, only he begins to suspect that she may be a serial killer. With a relatively low budget and lead actors who were not particularly famous at the time, Son Jae-gon's debut film was a sleeper hit and became the tenth top-selling domestic film of the year with 2,286,745 tickets sold. After its release, witty dialogue from the film were continuously quoted and parodied, and their performances made Park and Choi stars. =Leading roles= Park spent the next several years acting in various genres. He played a kindly handyman with a crush on a piano teacher in For Horowitz (2006), a world-weary cop investigating the murders of orphaned girls in The World of Silence (2006), a detective who sacrifices his ethics to pay for his wife's medical bills in Beautiful Sunday (2007), one husband of two partner-swapping married couples in Love Now (2007), and a suave con artist out to steal treasure in Once Upon a Time (2008). At the press conference of Kim Han-min's 2009 thriller Handphone, Park said he hoped viewers wouldn't interpret the two characters as simply good and evil, but as real people with understandable motivations within the context of their situations. =2010: Return to television= 2010 marked Park's return to television for the first time in six years in the period medical drama Jejungwon, about the establishment of Gwanghyewon (later renamed Jejungwon) in 1885, the nation's first \\"modern\\" Western hospital which historical records show treated sick people regardless of their economic status despite the hierarchical society of the era. Loosely based on a real-life person, the protagonist Park played is born a poor butcher's son and becomes Joseon's first surgeon and an independence fighter. Park said he didn't hesitate to take the role, describing his character as someone who \\"doesn't stop trying to achieve his goals and starts thinking not only about saving people's lives but also his country. Although he seems somewhat unsophisticated, for ordinary people he is a humane and caring doctor, and I tried to portray those qualities so that viewers would empathize with him.\\" He added that he liked the social message imparted by the drama which resonates in the present day, and that he felt his character's story reflects his own journey toward becoming an actor. =2011-present= In the mystery suspense film Children... (2011), Park played a documentary filmmaker who delves into the unsolved Frog Boys case. Initially driven by ambition and opportunism, he later becomes sincerely attached to it. Multicultural comedy Papa followed in 2012, in which his character is an entertainment manager who becomes an adoptive father to six children in the United States, and encourages the eldest daughter to join an audition program. In drama series My Lover, Madame Butterfly, Park played the white knight to a divorced, has-been actress. He next appeared in Song Il- gon's Forest of Time (2012), which blurs the boundary between documentary and narrative filmmaking, as Park and Japanese actress Rina Takagi spend ten days searching for the reportedly 7,200-year-old J≈çmon Sugi, a cryptomeria tree in the renowned forest of Yakushima, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that inspired the Hayao Miyazaki animated film Princess Mononoke. In 2014, he played a genius sculptor who suffers from a progressive muscular paralysis after the Korean War in Late Spring. Park said in a 2007 interview, \\"Although I am not completely devoted to acting, it may look that way because I am not lucky enough to be able to enjoy my life fully. Although I usually get bored doing something for a long time, acting makes me feel alive and changes me; even though it entails pain. I want to be an extraordinary actor while being an ordinary person.\\" In 2018, he stars in the medical exorcism drama Priest.

Aesopica site However, the story goes back before Aesop‚Äôs time and an alternative variant may even be of Asian origin. The story and its spread The story relates how animals meet after the death of the lion to choose a new king and are so impressed by the capering of an ape that they crown him. The fox had been one of the contestants and now plays the part of courtier. Taking the ape aside, he says that he has found something to whet the royal appetite and leads him to a baited trap. Caught in the trap, the ape accuses the fox of treachery. The latter replies that someone so gullible and greedy is unfit to rule. Some versions provide the moral that those who aspire to rule must first learn to govern themselves. The fable is very old and may predate Aesop, since it seems to have been used by the 7th century BCE poet Archilochos.G.J.Van Dijk, Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi, Leiden NL 1997, pp.144-47 In Europe it was for a long time restricted to Greek sources but it was one of those that also travelled eastwards into Central Asia from about the 8th century CE. Papyrus fragments of the fable from this era have been discovered in both Sogdian and Uyghur.Matteo Compareti, \\"Aesop's fables in Central Asia\\", Academia edu The fable of the ape and the fox began to appear in other European countries during the 17th century. Hieronymus Osius devoted a Neo-Latin poem to it,Phryx Aesopus Habitu Poetico, 1673, Simius Rex p.132 as did Gabriele Faerno. The latter ends with the moral that \\"desert must be proved by deeds\\" (ostendit comissus honos, quam quisque probandus).Fabulae Centum (1563), Fable 81, pp.187-9 The French version of the fable by La Fontaine ends with a similar reflection as the fox chides the monkey, \\"Do you aspire to govern us, unable to control yourself?\\"Fables (1668), Le renard, le singe et les animaux, VI.6 The commentary that follows the telling by Roger L'Estrange condemns all the participants: the electors for their unthinking choice, the unqualified monkey for accepting the office and the envious fox for its malice.Fables of Aesop (1699), \\"An Ape and a Fox\\", Fable 116 Samuel Croxall too deplores the choice,Fables of Aesop and Others, (1722), Fable 93, \\"The Fox and the Ape\\" while Thomas Bewick's edition reflects that \\"when Apes are in power, Foxes will never be wanting to play upon them\\", criticising the self-serving courtier and the foolishness that exposes authority to scorn.The Fables of Aesop and Others (1818), ‚ÄúThe Ape Chosen King‚Äù, pp.195-6 There was also a poem by John Byrom, subtitled \\"The fruits of greediness and credulity\\" and designed for school recitation, that was close in wording to Croxall‚Äôs account.Miscellaneous Poems by John Byrom (first published 1773), pp.36-7 A 19th-century Japanese netsuke in the form of a dancing monkey The dancing monkeys An alternative fable with the same implication that one's basic nature will ultimately betray itself was translated under the title \\"The Dancing Monkeys\\" by George Fyler Townsend in 1867. A prince has trained a troop of dancing monkeys to perform at court, \\"arrayed in their rich clothes and masks\\". However, a courtier disrupts their human pretence by scattering nuts on the stage, for which the monkeys immediately scramble.Aesop‚Äôs Fables: a new revised version Formerly this had formed part of the oldest collection of Aesop‚Äôs fables, the lost Aisopeia of Demetrius of Phalerum, and may have been of Oriental origin.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco- Latin Fable, Brill 1999, vol.2, p.103 The fable was versified by John Ogilby as \\"An Aegyptian King and his Apes\\"Fables of Aesop paraphrased in verse (1668), pp.135-8 and told by Roger L'Estrange with the reflection that \\"it is not in the Power of Study and Discipline to extinguish Natural Inclinations\\".Fable 375 \\"The Dancing Apes\\", Fables of Aesop (1692), p.343 That moral was put more directly in the German version set by Andre Asriel as the last of his Sechs Fabeln nach √Ñsop (1922): \\"Ape is always ape, even when taught to dance\\" (Das Affen bleiben immer Affen, auch wenn man sie das Tanzen lehrt).Andre Ariel, Das AffenballetA performance on YouTube Art Illustrations of the fable begin with the fine Medici manuscript of 1480, which collects Greek versions of Aesop's fables. The illumination accompanying the story is often a composite of incidents there. In the case of \\"The Ape and the Fox\\" these portray the ape dancing before an audience of animals on the left and on the right the crowned ape caught in a snare and attended by the fox.The illuminated Medici Manuscript These key incidents are interpreted differently over the centuries. La Fontaine‚Äôs fable featured a scene in which various creatures unsuccessfully try on the dead lion‚Äôs crown until the ape pleases them with its capering. 19th century prints by Gustave Dor√©Dor√©‚Äôs print at Getty Images and GrandvilleGrandville‚Äôs print at the Biblioth√®ques de Nancy picture this moment, in which the ape is balancing an impossibly large crown on its shoulders. In the previous century, Jean-Baptiste Oudry chose the final incident in which the ape‚Äôs leg is caught in a mechanical trap, Oudry‚Äôs print from the 1755 edition of the Fables a scene varied by Thomas Bewick to show the ape caught by the arm.Bewick‚Äôs illustration of 1818 at the British Museum] A more novel approach to illustrating the fable‚Äôs message was taken by Johann Elias Ridinger in his Instructive Fables from the Animal Kingdom for the Improvement of Manners and especially the Instruction of Youth (1744). There the fox has just raised the crown in a coronation ceremony before the assembled beasts, when the ape causes consternation by diving from the throne in pursuit of a platter of fruit. The print is accompanied by the explanation that \\"a high social position is not always matched by intelligence\\".\\"The fable of the Monkey King\\", Plate XIII at the British Museum Although such a sentiment matches the commentary in several fable collections, the actual scenario comes closer to that of \\"The Dancing Monkeys\\".

It was built on the orders of Prince Amr Ibrahim (1903-1977), member of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, in 1921. The architecture of the building was Garo Balyan, the youngest member of the Balyan family. The cost of the construction was about 200 million euros ($257 million). The palace was used by the Prince as a summer residence. Style and layout The architectural style of the palace is of neo-Ottoman and of the neo-Islam. It also reflects dominant styles of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in terms of its architectural and decorative style. There are also Moroccan and Andalusian influences in the architecture of the palace. Total area of the building is 850 square meters. It is made of a basement and two floors. In the entrance hall there is a marble fountain decorated with blue ceramics. The palace is surrounded by a 2,800 square metre garden. Current usage The palace became a state property on 9 November 1953 following the coup in Egypt. It was first employed as a club by the Arab Socialist Union until 1971. From 1971 the building was employed by the Ministry of Culture as an exhibition gallery for the paintings endowed by Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil.

Later, the pre-mRNA is bound by the spliceosome containing exon and intron definition complexes and proteins and RNA that catalyze the chemical reactions of splicing.

Neurodegenerative diseases in RNP granules caused by genetic mutations. RNP granules store specific types of mRNAs under tight translational control while forming deferent types. Neuronal RNP granules that are connected to RNA binding proteins show signs of causing neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration or neuropsychiatric disorders. An example of one of these diseases would be spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) which affect the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Although it is still unknown, increasing evidence ties neurodegeneration diseases will altered RNP granule homeostasis creating a concept of hypo and hyper-assembly diseases of RNPs. Hyper-assembly of RNP granule can be caused by two effects, one by mutations in the RNA binding protein while the other being an expansion of nucleotide repeats in the RNA. Another neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which is affected by the hyper assemble of RNP granule components. Even though neuronal cells are more susceptible to hypo- or hyper- assembly of RNP components there is still much unknown in terms of the full mutation process. Neuronal RNP granules assembly and regulation with flexible spatio-temporal that compartmentalize gene expression. The advanced technology that is present today helps uncover the behavior of neuronal RNP granules. It was recently discovered in a vitro study that the dynamic properties and structure of these RNP granules is fluid and generated through liquid-liquid phase separation. Post-translational modification (PTM) of granule components have the means to modulate binding affinities that can do both condensation and dissolution.

To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame.Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Cubist Works, 1910‚Äì1921, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press. p. 43.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger, At the Center of Cubism, in Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe. Rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest from multiple angles. The dynamic role is played by the artist rather than the subject. By moving around the subject the artist captures several important features at once; such as the profile and frontal view. And because motion involves time, several intervals or moments are captured simultaneously (a process coined by Metzinger called simultaneity or multiplicity). Moods and expressions within each facet may be different, reflecting change over time. The result, according to Metzinger is a more complete representation of the subject matter (a 'total image') than would otherwise have resulted from one image taken at one instant. Each facet reveals something new and different about the subject. Sutured together, these facets would form a more complete image than an otherwise static representation seen from one point of view; what Metzinger called a \\"total image\\".Alex Mittelmann, State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time, 2011 In addition to the inequality of parts being granted as a prime condition of Metzinger Cubism, there are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas. Both methods, according to Metzinger and Gleizes (1912)Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Du \\"Cubisme\\", published by Eug√®ne Figui√®re √âditeurs, Paris, 1912, pp. 9-11, 13-14, 17-21, 25-32.

According to the second method, in order that the > spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements > in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each > portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken > into a thousand surprises of light and shade. [...] Every inflection of form > is accompanied by a modification of colour, and every modification of colour > gives birth to a form. (Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Du \\"Cubisme\\", 1912) Background The success of the 1913 Armory Show in New York can be seen by the influence of modern art on fashion design, home decoration and advertising that appeared during and after the exhibition. Store windows began displaying gowns styled after Cubist paintings. Women painted their faces and wore brightly colored wigs. Fashion design became a way of integrating modern art into daily life. Walt Kuhn, a painter and an organizer of the Armory Show welcomed the union between art and popular culture. The Armory Show according to Kuhn benefited everyone: > The late President Coolidge once said, \\"America's business is business.\\" > Therein lies the answer. We naive artists, we wanted to see what was going > on in the world of art, we wanted to open up the mind of the public to the > need of art. Did we do it? We did more than that. The Armory Show affected > the entire culture of America. Business caught on immediately, even if the > artists did not at once do so. The outer appearance of industry absorbed the > lesson like a sponge. Drabness, awkwardness began to disappear from American > life, and color and grace stepped in. Industry certainly took notice. The > decorative elements of Matisse and the Cubists were immediately taken on as > models for the creation of a brighter, more lively America. (Walt Kuhn)Walt > Khun, The story of the Armory show, 1938 Jean Metzinger, Portrait of an American Smoking, Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures, catalogue cover, Boggs & Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913 Department stores became hosts to modern art, holding the first exhibitions of Cubist paintings after the Armory Show, becoming perhaps the first corporate sponsors of an exhibition. After the Armory Show closed in Boston (April 1913), the American department store Gimbel Brothers (Gimbels) began organizing a Cubist exhibition that would travel to five different cities, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Philadelphia, over the course of one year. The Milwaukee exhibition of Cubist works‚Äîincluding paintings by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L√©ger and Jacques Villon‚Äîopened 11 May and lasted approximately six weeks, until late June 1913.Elizabeth Carlson, Cubist Fashion: Mainstreaming Modernism after the Armory, Winterthur Portfolio, Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring 2014), pp. 1-28. The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc. Article DOI: 10.1086/675687 Gimbels sponsored the show in Milwaukee, New York, and Philadelphia. In Cleveland, William Taylor Son & Co. continued the exhibition, inviting customers to view \\"original Cubist paintings by masters of the style\\" (Aaron Sheon, 93). Boggs and Buhl's hosted the show in Pittsburgh, enticing customers with a painting by Metzinger, Portrait of an American Smoker on the cover of its catalogue, and a balladry by Arthur Burgoyne published in the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph: > Aesthetical highbrows these days are aflame. With zeal for the Cubist or > Futurist game. The painters began it. Van Gogh and Matisse And some others > intent on disturbing the peace Of the art-loving public came right to the > fore With such puzzles in color as caused an uproar. But they rightfully > banked on the constant demand For things that the populace can't understand > And they found that all classes, both highbrows and rubes, Would fall for > their curious futurist cubes. :‚ÄîArthur Burgoyne, 1913 Burgoyne's poem indicates his recognition of Cubism's appeal as an anti- bourgeois art form, essential to creating a market for the new art. Just as the Cubists at the Armory show in New York, Chicago and Boston, this traveling exhibition created an uproar in other major U.S. cities. Neither the public nor the critics minced their words. Metzinger's American Smoker was singled out in an article published in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, titled New Cubist Pictures, Latest From Paris Fail to Satisfy Art Enthusiasts in Cleveland, O.: > Cubists' paintings, imported direct from Paris, now are being shown in the > store in Cleveland, Ohio, says the Cleveland Plain Dealer, but the hundreds > of art enthusiasts who are thronging to the place have difficulty in > understanding the pictures, owing to the meagerness of details in the > catalogue. For instance: Exhibit F shows an \\"American Smoker,\\" by Jean > Metzinger. Who is the American? Where is the rest of his face? Was it carved > off in a duel at one of the foreign universities or did he dislike it and > have it remodeled? Such are some of the questions being asked by those most > interested‚Äîand the catalogue merely says \\"American Smoking.\\"New Cubist > Pictures. Latest From Paris Fail to Satisfy Art Enthusiasts in Cleveland, > O., The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York), Saturday 26 July 1913, p. > 4 Of Albert Gleizes's monumental Femmes cousant (Women Sewing), Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum,Albert Gleizes, Study for Femmes cousant (Women Sewing), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a. The Kr√∂ller-M√ºller version measures 185.5 x 126 cm the anonymous author of the article writes: > Then there is Exhibit H‚Äî\\"Harmony of Colors,\\" which the catalogue describes > as follows: \\"Subject three women sewing beside the road; to the right a > large tree; in the background a landscape is seen through the arch of the > viaduct.\\" Where are the women? Only one mouth is visible. Where are the > others? Have they combined their identities and do they use only one mouth > between them? Such are the questions but there are no answers. That Gimbels and other department stores exhibited Cubist works to attract customers exemplifies the extent to which the exhibition of French Paintings and Sculpture in Gallery 1 of the Armory Show (dubbed the \\"chamber of horrors\\") attracted the attention of those outside the art world. Corporate sponsorship of modern art continued after the initial 1913 department store shows, with Wanamaker's, Macy's and Lord and Taylor's participating in exhibiting modern art during the 1920s. \\"Now that the new art movement has found its way to a department store,\\" writes Aaron Sheon, \\"there ought to be no further doubt of its establishment as part of our American daily life, and its ultimate acceptance must be considered only as a question of time\\". Cubism, far from institutionalized, had become accepted into a wider market, illustrating the reliance of early 20th-century art on massive commercial venues.

It is used in rescues as well as marine operations. A line thrower may employ a variety of launching methods including guns, rockets, and pneumatics. History The parts of the Harpax Roman general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa created the harpax, a ship-based grapnel that could be fired by a ballista. The harpax allowed an enemy vessel to be harpooned and then winched alongside for boarding. Appian explains the device as \\"a piece of wood, five cubits long bound with iron and having rings at the extremities. To one of these rings was attached the grip itself, an iron claw, to the other numerous ropes, which drew it by machine power after it had been thrown by a catapult and had seized the enemy's ships.\\". The harpax had a distinct advantage over the corvus, the traditional naval boarding bridge, in that it was much lighter; the corvus boarding bridge is estimated to have weighed a ton. The harpax could be thrown long distances due its light weight and could be discharged by a ballista as if it were a heavy dart. Furthermore, the harpax was composed of iron bands that could not be cut, and the ropes could not be cut due to the length of the iron grapple. It was first deployed by Agrippa in 36 BC during the naval battles of the Sicilian revolt against the fleet of Sextus Pompey,Southworth, John V. The Ancient Fleets: The Story of Naval Warfare Under Oars, 2600 B.C. - 1597 A.D. New York: Twayne Inc, 1968.

Wallinga \\"Ancient Navies\\" The Oxford Encyclopedia of Maritime History. Ed. John B. Hattendorf. Oxford University Press, 2007. Appian notes that \\"as this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy had not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles.\\" In 1791, John Bell proposed a system to launch a line from a ship in distress to the shore, but this does not seems to have ever been implemented.Parl. Papers, 1810‚Äì11 vol. xi, No. 215, 1814 xi.417‚Äì51Trans. Soc. of Arts, 1807, vol. xxv Manby mortar, 1842 drawing Following the 1807 grounding of HMS Snipe, in which 67 lives were lost despite being just 50 yards from shore, George William Manby developed the Manby mortar that same year.Gilly Pickup, What the British Invented: From the Great to the Downright Bonkers, Amberley Publishing Limited, 2015 . His device was a line fastened to a barbed shot which was fired from a mortar on the shore. By means of this line a hawser was drawn out from the shore to the ship, and along it was run a cradle in which the shipwrecked persons were landed.Parl. Papers, new ser. 1816, xix.193‚Äì227 It was used in a rescue in 1808, making it the first successful line thrower.\\"Manby, George William\\", The New International Encyclop√¶dia, vo. 14, New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917. In 1814, it was installed at 59 British rescue stations in the next two years. In 1808, Henry Trengrouse designed a rocket-based system which was similar to Manby's in the use of the line and hawser, but instead of a mortar he suggested a rocket, and a chair was used instead of a cradle. The distinctive features of the apparatus consisted of ‚Äòa section of a cylinder, which is fitted to the barrel of a musket by a bayonet socket; a rocket with a line attached to its stick is so placed in it that its priming receives fire immediately from the barrel‚Äô.Parl. Papers, 1825, xxi.361 The advantages were that the rocket was much lighter and more portable than the mortar; that the cost was much smaller; that there was little risk of the line breaking, because the velocity of a rocket increases gradually, whereas that of a shot fired from a mortar was so great and sudden that the line was frequently broken; the whole of Trengrouse's apparatus could, moreover, be packed in a chest four feet three inches by one foot six inches, and carried by vessels of every size, while Manby contemplated the use of the mortar only on shore, and the safety of the vessel depended therefore on the presence of an apparatus in the vicinity of the wreck.Trans. Soc. of Arts, xxxviii.161‚Äì5 Lyle gun being fired In 1877, David A. Lyle, a first lieutenant in the United States Army, was engaged by the Sumner Increase Kimball, the only superintendent of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, and developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes to be used as line throwers. The gun became the standard line-throwing gun and came to be known as the Lyle gun.Shanks, York, and Shanks, U.S. Life Saving Service, at pages 67‚Äì69\\"David Lyle and his Life Saving Gun\\", Springfield Armory National Historic Site In 1855, the Boxer rocket was developed, a two-stage rocket used in rescue line applications until World War II. Modern systems Modern rocket-based systems are a common choice for vessels that require a line- throwing apparatus to meet SOLAS requirements, but in the late 1980s, pneumatic line throwers were invented and are preferred in many instances. Shoulder-fired line-throwing guns are available, and there are also slingshot- based systems.

Sir Mark Masterman-Sykes Life He was eldest son of Sir Christopher Sykes, 2nd Baronet of Sledmere House, Yorkshire, by his wife Elizabeth (d. 1803), daughter of William Tatton of Withenshaw, Cheshire. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 10 May 1788. In 1795 he served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire, and in September 1801 succeeded on the death of his father to the baronetcy and estates. On 14 May 1807 Sykes was returned Member of Parliament for the city of York, and retained his seat until 1820, when he retired on account of ill health. He died without issue at Weymouth, and was succeeded by his brother, Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet. Collector Sykes was famous as a bibliophile, and possessed a major private library, rich in editiones principes, incunabula, and Elizabethan poetry. There were manuscripts, including a copy of William Dugdale's Heraldic Visitation of York, 1665‚Äì1666. The editio princeps of Livy, by Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim (Rome, 1469), with painted arms of the Borgia family, is the only copy on vellum extant, and after Sykes's death passed to Thomas Grenville who bequeathed it to the British Museum. A catalogue of the library was prepared by Henry John Todd. Sykes was a member of the Roxburghe Club, to which he presented a reprint of some of John Lydgate's poems in 1818. He also collected pictures, bronzes, coins, medals, and prints (with a complete set of Francesco Bartolozzi's engravings, comprising his proofs and etchings). All his collections were dispersed by sale in 1824. His library fetched nearly ¬£10,000, and his pictures nearly ¬£6,000. Family Sykes was twice married: firstly, on 11 November 1795, to Henrietta, daughter and heiress of Henry Masterman of Settrington, Yorkshire, on which occasion he took the additional name of Masterman; she died in July 1813. On 2 August 1814 he married, secondly, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of William Tatton Egerton and sister of Wilbraham Tatton Egerton of Tatton Park; she survived him, dying in October 1846.

South Korea's Conscription Law applies to males, aged between 18 and 35, although women are allowed to enroll in the ROTC as of 2010. Applicants to the ROTC program go through a screening process; a written exam, an interview and health examination, and a background check. Once accepted, members undergo physical and military education throughout the semester; they are also required to undergo actual military training during school holidays. After commissioning, they serve for two and a half years; an individual may choose to extend his or her service past the required period in pursuit of an active military career. Impact on South Korean society It was estimated by a Library of Congress research in 1990 that approximately 40% of new second lieutenants were commissioned from the ROTC program after two years of training and two years and three months of obligatory service; most would leave the service after the obligatory period. The Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon produced another 40% of new second lieutenants; 5% were graduates of various military academies and 15% were directly-commissioned specialists in the medical corps, judge advocates and chaplains. It has been postulated that the ROTC program in South Korea has contributed to national integration and cultural homogeneity, where military training had become a common cultural and organizational reference point; military officers became business managers and military conscripts became factory workers. A case in point would be Hyundai, which systematically preferred workers who had undergone ROTC training. In 2011, South Korea had 9,063 ROTC cadets from 109 universities.  Evaluation  Until the establishment of ROTC, the military training program lacked consistency in its implementation plans, the lack of operational constraints and administrative support of senior officers, and the purpose of receiving indifference and military training by students with a higher degree of service and expense. However, the establishment of a ROTC was able to solve all problems, efficiently carry out the training procedures of junior officers, and smoothly fill up the junior officers. Ties with United States ROTC Cadets of the United States Reserve Officers' Training Corps routinely collaborate with their South Korean counterparts in cultural exchanges such as the Cultural Understanding and Language Proficiency (CULP) program.

Publication history  Dark Sun Creature Catalog, by Richard Baker and Bruce R. Cordell, was published on August 17, 2010. Baker also led the design team for the 4th edition Dark Sun products. The book was mistakenly printed as a hardcover rather than a softcover as advertised. Despite the mistake, Wizards of the Coast sold the book at the originally advertised lower softcover price. Appelcline wrote that \\"in previous years, Wizards had released a 'Campaign Guide', a 'Player's Guide', and a standalone adventure for each setting, but by 2010 things were changing for the 4e line. One of those changes impacted the schedule for setting releases. Though Dark Sun still got three books, the 'Campaign Guide' and 'Player's Guide' were combined into the Dark Sun Campaign Setting. This made room for a standalone Creature Catalog ‚Äî something that was particularly important for the unique world of Athas. The adventure Marauders of the Dune Sea (2010) closed out the trilogy\\". On August 19, 2014, Dark Sun Creature Catalog was re-released as a PDF. Reception The book was reviewed in Black Gate #15. Appelcline wrote that the \\"Creature Catalog doesn't add much to the world of Athas, but it is respectful of the setting's long history\\" and that the book \\"shows off D&D; 4e's graphic design at its best. Many of the monsters are laid out as two-page spreads, providing lots of room for details and for variants\\". Appelcline highlighted that the book followed \\"in the footsteps of Dark Sun Monstrous Compendium Appendix II: Terrors beyond Tyr\\" and the inclusion of monster stats for player character races \\"was once more a well-received idea that helped to convey the evocative feel of the setting\\". Neuroglyph Games gave the book an A rating and highlighted that \\"in many respects, the Dark Sun Creature Catalog is also a bit of a Dark Sun Dungeon Masters Guide, given the wealth of lore in the monster listings, the notable NPC villains, and the monster themes. And given the amount of content packed into this book, the retail price for the Dark Sun Creature Catalog is quite reasonable, and a must-have book for any Dungeon Master who plans on running a campaign on Athas\\".

Overall, Newstead won ten gold, four silver and four bronze medals in three different sports. She was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. Career Isabel Barr was born in Glasgow, Scotland. At the age of nineteen her spinal cord was damaged by a flu virus, which would eventually lead to tetraplegia, partial or complete paralysis of all four limbs. Newstead had already competed at regional level before her illness and as part of her rehabilitation continued swimming. Whilst swimming with the Port Glasgow Otters Swimming Club she was noticed by the British paraplegic swimming team. Newstead moved to Harlow, Essex in the late seventies to work as a systems analyst with Rank Hovis McDougall. At her first 1980 Summer Paralympics in Arnhem, Newstead won three gold medals in the swimming pool. At the 1984 Summer Paralympics in Stoke Mandeville she won three golds and a silver medal in the pool. Most notably, Newstead also won a gold in the air pistol shooting event as well as silver medals in the shot put and discus events. Newstead did not compete in the swimming events at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul due to health challenges. However, she did win a silver medal in the shot put and two bronzes in the air pistol and javelin events. She married John Newstead after the Seoul games, having previously competed as Isabel Barr. Newstead competed at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona and the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, though she did not win any medals. In Barcelona, an error by her coach led to her missing the final of one event, when she was in the lead after the preliminary rounds. In Atlanta, on the eve of the opening ceremony, Newstead fell from her wheelchair and required surgery on a broken hip. Undeterred, she completed her event but finished outside the medals. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Newstead won Gold in the air pistol SH1 category. She defended her title four years later at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, setting a world-record score. In The New Year Honours 2001 Newstead was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to Disabled Sport. In 2006 Newstead was diagnosed with cancer and died in January 2007.

Critical response The New York Times reviewer called the play \\"absorbing, unblinking and sharply funny\\" and wrote: \\"The artificiality of the acting games just emphasizes the naturalness of the characters‚Äô real lives and feelings. Group members pose as trees, beds and baseball gloves. They perform emotional scenes using only the words goulash and ak-mak. They pretend to be one another, telling their life stories. They write deep, dark secrets (anonymously) on scraps of paper and listen, sitting in a circle on the floor, as the confessions are read aloud.\\"Gates, Anita. \\"At Peter J.

I found myself admiring Baker's sensitivity while hungering for a bit more theatrical attack... All this emerges with a good deal of subtlety through the students' enactment of each other's situations. But, while Baker tells us a lot about her characters, we learn little about Vermont...

Oil was first found in the Norte de Santander department near the border with Venezuela in 1905, but development did not start until 1936. A joint venture between the Texas Corporation and Socony-Vacuum (now Texaco and Mobil) sank the wells and built a pipeline across the mountains and through swampy jungle to the Caribbean coast at Cove√±as. Workers were harassed by Motilone Indians defending their territory, and several died. The concession began operation in 1939 and continued into the 1960s, when it began to be depleted. Other fields in the region are still productive. Location Maracaibo Basin. The Barco concession lies in the southwest portion within Colombia. The oilfield lies in the Norte de Santander department, in the east of the country, in the Catatumbo River basin. The oilfield is part of the Maracaibo Basin, which spans Colombia and Venezuela. To the west it is bounded by the Santander Massif and the Sierra de Perija, parts of the Cordillera Oriental, a northern extension of the Andes. To the south and southeast, it is bounded by the M√©rida Andes, and to the east, by the Venezuelan border. The Venezuelan part of the oilfield has produced several billion barrels of oil. By 2007 the different fields in the Catatumbo sub-basin had produced more than 800 million barrels of oil. The Barco concession is estimated to have held between 250 and 300 million barrels. The Catatumbo River is long, of which the first is in Colombia. About 63% of the river basin lies in Colombian territory. The Catatumbo provides 70% of Lake Maracaibo's fresh water. By the early 2000s the river had become highly polluted, with sewage and industrial waste dumped into the river in Colombia, and pesticides and chemical fertilizers washed into the river further down in Venezuela. Guerilla groups in Colombia had also blown up sections of the oil pipeline, and despite containment efforts, some of the spilled oil had also contaminated the river. Early years Virgilio Barco Martinez was granted the concession on 16 October 1905 in the Catatumbo region of the Norte de Santander department. Colonel Barco had led victorious forces in the recent Thousand Days civil war, and was given the concession in return. He planned to use it for cattle, until he found that oil was seeping out of the ground. World War I caused delays in developing the field. In 1918 Barco sold the concession to the Carib Syndicate, a concern owned by Americans, who sold 75% of their interest to the Colombian Petroleum Company the next year. This was a subsidiary of Edward L. Doheny's Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company. Doheny was also interested in plans to develop the oil industry in Venezuela, and in building a pipeline from Colombia to Venezuela to make it more economical to export the Barco oil. The Colombian Petroleum Company, now a subsidiary of Cities Service, failed to develop the concession and sold out to Gulf Oil in 1926. That year the government of Pedro Nel Ospina V√°zquez revoked the concession. In early 1928 new petroleum regulations came into force that required proof of ownership from private concession holders. The United States Department of State interpreted these changes as a move to let British companies acquire oil concessions in Colombia. They had reason, since between 1926 and 1927 the Colombian government had been discussing the Barco Concession with H. Yates of the British Petroleum Company. The State Department sent John Stabler to Bogota to sort out the problem. His tactless criticism of Colombian policy stirred up public hostility. Stabler left the country in mid-1928, having achieved less than nothing. Gulf Oil was still interested in getting its title reestablished, but the market was temporarily saturated so Gulf wanted to hold the concession in reserve, while Colombia wanted it developed. In 1930 the State Department facilitated discussions between the oil companies and newly elected Liberal president Enrique Olaya Herrera. An agreement was made in early 1931. Under the new arrangement, Gulf regained the concession on condition that it build a pipeline to the sea, and pay royalties on any oil delivered of 6% to the government and 3.5% to colonel Barco's successors. Gulf found oil but was not able to undertake construction. Torkild Rieber of the Texas Corporation, now Texaco, bought the concession in 1936 for $14,550,000. He sold a half interest to Socony-Vacuum, now Mobil. The combined area of the Texaco and Socony Vacuum concessions was . Construction Concession region and pipeline The Colombian government would not allow the pipeline to take the easier route to Lake Maracaibo, since about would pass through Venezuelan territory. Instead the crude oil had to be pumped over the Cordillera Oriental via the Rieber Pass, named after Torkild Rieber. From there the line ran west through the Magdalena River valley, in three places running under the river or one of its tributaries. The pipeline terminated at the Caribbean port of Cove√±as in the Sucre department. It was designed to be able to carry 28,000 barrels per day from the La Petr√≥lea and Tib√∫ fields. South American Gulf Oil, a subsidiary, built the pipeline. Charley Atwell was in charge of construction. Little was known of the difficult terrain through which the pipeline was to run. Most of the equipment and supplies were carried by air, a total of , landed on airstrips hacked out of the jungle. This included a suspension bridge as well as vehicles, power plants, plumbing and food. The welded pipe was wrapped in heavy paper, covered with hot asphalt and then buried. At its peak, 5,000 local workers were employed, supervised by 400 Americans. Eight employees of the oil companies were killed by Motilone Indians defending their territory. The oil companies built a road to the concession through the rugged country, which they handed over to the government. 62 wells were operational when the pipeline was opened. The crude was gold-green in color and yielded 49% gasoline on straight-run refining, a very high value. The last weld in the pipe was made by Gladys Crosby Whitney, wife of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Total costs to develop the field and the pipeline were $40,000,000. The pipeline alone cost $18 million. Operation Oil started flowing on 15 October 1939, and at the start of November began to be pumped into Texaco and Socony Vacuum tankers at Covenas at a rate of 25,000 barrels a day. In July 1940 the oil was flowing at 11,000 barrels a day, at which rate the investment would be recovered within five years. In 1954 there were 2,000 oil workers in Tib√∫, including 110 Americans, and 200 in R√≠o de Oro. 25,000 barrels per day were being pumped from 200 wells. The operating company was Colpet. Colpet airplanes flew a regular schedule from C√∫cuta to company airstrips at the Covenas terminal and the Tib√∫ and R√≠o de Oro camps, with less frequent trips to Bogota and to Petrolia, once the main base. Conditions were tough. A 1954 article in Flying Magazine called the Motilone Indians \\"the world's most unfriendly citizens\\" and said they \\"have pin- cushioned more than 120 oilfield hands since 1936.\\" Victims of Motilone arrows would be flown out for emergency treatment. The concession passed back to the Colombian government in 1955. The government-owned Empresa Colombiana de Petr√≥leos (Ecopetrol) took over control, but by the 1960s the concession's wells were depleted. However, oil continues to be extracted in the area. In 2007 PetroSouth Energy Corporation announced it had acquired a 6% working interest in the Carbonera concession. The announcement described some of the oilfields in the region: \\"Immediately adjacent to the Carbonera Block lie fields such as Tibu, found in 1940 and with 260 million barrels produced to date, Petrolea, discovered in 1934 with 38 million barrels produced to date, and Rio Zulia, dating from 1962 and with 137 million barrels recovered to date.\\" References Notes Citations Sources     * Category:Oil fields of Colombia ","title":"Barco oil concession"},{"id":"40057892","text":"Remember Me is a 1985 Australian television film directed by Lex Marinos.

Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914.Violinman.com, FIORILLO, Federigo (1755-1825) Life and career Fiorillo's father was Ignazio Fiorillo, a Neapolitan, who also played mandolin. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Ignazio was appointed conductor at the Court Opera House at Brunswick and settled there, where his son, Federigo, was born. Federigo's early musical education was superintended by his father. He inherited his parent's love of the mandolin and obtained complete mastery over it, able to show mastery of delicate nuances of tone of which it was capable. As a mandolinist he performed at most of the royal courts of Europe, but the resources of the instrument at this period were limited, as was also the demand for mandolin players. He was compelled to devote his attention to other stringed instruments, principally the violin and viola. In 1780 he travelled to Poland, and in 1783 he was conductor of the band at Riga for two years. Two years later he was playing the violin with success at the Concerts Spirituels in Paris. While in Paris, he published some of his first compositions, which were well received. In 1788 he made a visit to London, where he played the viola in Saloman's quartet. Fiorillo made his last public appearance in London in 1794, when he performed a concerto for the viola at the Antient Concert. After leaving London he went to Amsterdam, and from there to Paris in 1823. Music historian Philip J. Bone felt that the \\"thirty-six caprices for the violin, rank equally with the classical studies of [Rodolphe ] Kreutzer and [Pierre] Rode, and, apart from their usefulness, are not without merit as compositions...they have been edited by innumerable violinists of repute, and [Louis] Spohr wrote and published an accompanying violin part to them.\\" Fiorillo's other compositions include concertos, duos, trios, quartets, and quintets, for stringed instruments.

If you're going to the trouble of embedding audio and video, then go > the whole hog and make it integral to the plot. Also writing in The Guardian, Kate Pullinger found The Kills to be \\"a gripping, hallucinogenic ‚Äì and enormous ‚Äì novel\\", and that, \\"The digital edition is far and away the better way to read this novel; the first two books in particular are augmented by a series of short films embedded on the page, often with text overlaid, as well as animations and audio clips. For example, listening to the phone messages left by one character's mother as she tries to cajole him into contacting her, before she understands that he is in danger, adds an emotional jolt to the text. Throughout, the simple yet elegant enhancements work to take us beyond the page, adding depth and texture to the story. This is the first time I've read a digital edition of a primarily text- based novel where I've thought: yes, this works\\". Pullinger judged that the first two parts, Sutler and The Massive, \\"provide a wholly original view of our involvement in the Iraq conflict\\", but was less convinced by the third, The Kill, saying, \\"House has a great ability to create vivid characters, and the novel teems with them. But the writing in this third book is too abundant ‚Äì there is simply too much story\\". Jake Kerridge, reviewing the entire book in UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, found: \\"For all its bulk The Kills proves easily digestible, as it is not so much a novel as four shortish, tangentially connected novels in one\\". He added that it is, \\"a hugely convoluted work in which dozens of characters execute a dance that has obviously been minutely choreographed, although one that to the reader increasingly seems to appear dizzyingly random. Motives get more shadowy and the lines between fantasy and reality are blurred; ambiguity becomes the key note. The House method of storytelling is to create brilliantly realised characters, focus on them for a brief, intense period, and then abandon them, often leaving their fates obscure\\". Kerridge concluded, \\"[‚Ä¶] it is well worth ejecting five or six conventional thrillers from your holiday luggage and devoting yourself to The Kills for a few days. Like all the best thrillers, it takes you on a hell of a ride, even if by the end you‚Äôre not quite sure where exactly it is you‚Äôve arrived at\\". In The Independent, Jonathan Gibbs wrote that, \\"Richard House‚Äôs Man Booker-longlisted novel stands out from the pile, and not just for its length: 1,003 pages. It is a ‚Äònovel in four books‚Äô, also available as separate e-books, with additional multimedia content online or embedded, although there is more than enough going on between the covers. As a whole, The Kills is an ambitious and complex meta-thriller that spins its many stories like plates, tantalising you at every turn with the thought that it might all be one big story, if only you could see through the noise to the pattern behind\\". He added that, \\"The whole book is written with this slightly reserved attention to detail, as if the author can‚Äôt quite bring himself to be either fully thriller-ish, or fully poetic. You feel the tug of John le Carr√© in one direction, and Don DeLillo in the other. The commentary on the iniquities of the occupation of Iraq, too, is worn lightly. The fourth book, The Hit, picks up plot lines from the first and second, but it‚Äôs Book Three, The Kill that really threatens to turn the whole novel into a kind of M√∂bius strip, albeit one with frayed edges\\". Gibbs concluded by saying, \\"It all gets very confusing, and for those who enjoy readerly confusion this is a real treat. The Kills is a page-turner, but the pages turn back as much as forwards, as you chase up echoes and repetitions ‚Äì long-forgotten names and places, but also wasps, the smell of jasmine, the gesture of pulling a handbag strap over a shoulder ‚Äì that might be clues, might be red herrings, might be the product of my own fevered mind. It‚Äôs a book that seems built to inspire internet forums devoted to its marginalia and ‚Äòtrue meaning‚Äô, and a book absolutely to be read twice over. But there‚Äôs always the risk, isn‚Äôt there, that the red herrings were more fun than the bare, revealed truth?\\" References External links Category:2013 British novels Category:Novels by Richard House Category:Picador (imprint) books ","title":"The Kills (novel)"},{"id":"40058074","title":"List of places of worship in Mole Valley"},{"id":"40058084","text":"Ripkin is a 1978 Australian television film directed by Frank Arnold and starring David Nettheim, Olivia Hamnett, Vince Martin, and Belinda Giblin.

Early life  Madlanga was born in 1962 in Njijini village, Mount Frere, to a family of the amaBhaca. He attended Mariazell High School in Matatiele. His father, a teacher, encouraged him to apply for a bursary to read law at the University of Transkei, where he completed a BJuris in 1981 in an atmosphere of growing unrest. During his final year he began working in a magistrate's office, though he was close friends with African National Congress activists under investigation by his colleagues. In 1985 he moved to Grahamstown, then in a state of \\"complete chaos\\", and completed an LLB at Rhodes University the following year. From 1987 to 1989 he worked as a law lecturer at the University of Transkei, teaching customary law, the law of delict and the law of contract. He won a scholarship to attend the University of Notre Dame and completed his LLM there in 1990. For the next six months he worked in the Washington, D.C. office of Amnesty International, where he briefly met Nelson Mandela after his release from prison.  Legal career  In 1991, Madlanga returned to South Africa, now a much freer place, and began practice as an advocate in Mthatha. His admission to the Bar was moved by his close friend and mentor Tholie Madala; Sandile Ngcobo, with whom Madlanga would also later work at the Constitutional Court of South Africa, was a colleague and friend of both. On 1 September 1996, Madlanga was appointed to the bench of the Transkei Division of the High Court (now the Mthatha seat of the Eastern Cape Division). He later became its acting Judge President. From 1998 to 1999, he was an acting judge on the Supreme Court of Appeal. The following year he became an acting judge of the Constitutional Court upon Arthur Chaskalson's invitation. He was on the bench in Mohamed v President of the Republic of South Africa, which held that the South African government may not extradite a suspect who may face the death penalty unless it receives an assurance it will not be imposed; Prince v President, Cape Law Society, which upheld a law criminalising the use of marijuana, even for religious reasons; Carmichele v Minister of Safety and Security; Minister of Public Works v Kyalami Ridge Environmental Association; and S v Mamabolo. Madlanga authored S v Steyn, which declared unconstitutional provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 that removed an accused person's automatic right of appeal against a magistrate's court conviction. The main facade of the Constitutional Court of South Africa. In 2001, Madlanga resigned from the bench, saying the salary was insufficient to support his family, and returned to private practice. He appeared for South Africa at the International Court of Justice in the case regarding the Israeli West Bank barrier. He also served as evidence leader at the commission of inquiry into the fitness of Bheki Cele to hold office as national police commissioner, and at the Farlam Commission investigating the Marikana miners' strike. = Constitutional Court appointment = On 1 August 2013, Madlanga was appointed permanently to the Constitutional Court, replacing Zak Yacoob. His appointment had been widely expected, especially after he impressed at his interview before the JSC (on which Madlanga had served since 2010), though some felt a woman ought to have been appointed. He was questioned on his 1998 judgment in Bangindawo v Head of the Nyanda Regional Authority, in which he had held controversially that there was \\"no reason whatsoever for the imposition of the western conception of the notions of judicial impartiality and independence in the African customary law setting\\". Madlanga admitted at the interview that this judgment was wrong. Madlanga's first judgment for the Constitutional Court was Gaertner v Minister of Finance, on the right to privacy and search and seizure.Gaertner and Others v Minister of Finance and Others [2013] ZACC 38; 2014 (1) SA 442 (CC). In March 2014, he wrote a 94-paragraph judgment dismissing Uruguayan businessman Gaston Savoi's challenge to his prosecution on charges of corruptly procuring a contract from the KwaZulu-Natal government.Savoi and Others v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Another [2014] ZACC 5; 2014 (5) SA 317 (CC). A year later, Madlanga delivered the controversial main judgment in Paulsen v SlipKnot Investments 777 (Pty) Ltd, which removes an exception to the in duplum rule.Paulsen and Another v Slip Knot Investments 777 (Pty) Limited [2015] ZACC 5; 2015 (3) SA 479 (CC). This judgment was described as \\"consumer friendly\\", but marked a \\"sea change\\" for South African banking practice, and was strongly criticised extra-curially by Malcolm Wallis. Madlanga's next judgment for the Court was DE v RH, which abrogated the action for adultery.DE v RH (2015) ZACC 18. Madlanga was one of the authors of the majority judgment in the 2015 My Vote Counts v Speaker, National Assembly, which was widely condemned. The majority refused to hear an application by an NGO to compel Parliament to enact legislation requiring the disclosure of political parties' private funding.  Personal life  Madlanga's wife is Nkosisi Monica Madlanga (n√©e Nkenkana). He has six children.

Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet Life A younger brother of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes, he was educated from 1784 at Westminster School. Matriculating at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 10 May 1788, he spent several terms there. For some years he was an articled clerk to Atkinson & Farrar, attorneys in Lincoln's Inn Fields; and then was employed for a period in a banking-house in Kingston upon Hull. Sheep farmer In 1803 Sykes began sheep farming and breeding by purchasing ten pure Bakewells from Mr. Sanday's flock at Holmepierrepoint. These sheep he kept at Barton, near Malton, where he soon became a ram-letter. At one of Robert Colling's sales he gave 156 guineas for the shearling Ajax. Until nearly eighty he took an annual June ride into the midlands to attend Burgess's, Buckley's, and Stone's sales of stock. In September 1861 he held his own fifty-eighth and last annual sale of sheep. Blood-stock While in London Sykes walked from London to Epsom to see Eager's Derby win in 1791; and next year he rode down to see John Bull win. His name first appears in the Racing Calendar as an owner of racehorses in 1803, when his Telemachus ran at Middleham, Yorkshire. In 1805 he rode his own horse Hudibras at Malton, Yorkshire, in a sweepstakes, and won the race. In 1808 he matched his mare Theresa over a four-mile course at Doncaster for five hundred guineas, owners riding, and won. For twenty years after this he from time to time kept a few horses in training at Malton, mainly for the purpose of mounting them himself in races for gentlemen riders. His colours were orange and purple, and the last time he wore them on a winning horse of his own was in 1829, when on All Heart and No Peel he won the Welham Cup at Malton. Sykes was one of the largest breeders of blood-stock in the kingdom. For some of his stock he gave large prices; for Colsterdale he paid thirteen hundred guineas, and for Fandango at Doncaster in 1860 ¬£3,000. His stud numbered two hundred horses and mares: he bred Grey Momus, The Lawyer, St. Giles, Gaspard, Elcho, Dalby, and Lecturer. His annual sales were well attended, and his stock fetched high prices. Baronet On the death of his elder brother on 16 February 1823, Sykes succeeded him as the fourth baronet, and took up his residence at Sledmere House, near Malton. He devoted his time to agriculture, stock- breeding, and fox-hunting. By applying bones as manure he improved the value of the Wold estates belonging to his family, feeding sheep and growing corn where it had been impossible before. Other interests For 40 years Sykes was a master of foxhounds, hunting the country from Spurn Point to Coxwold, and paying all the kennel expenses. He was also an expert boxer, coached by Gentleman Jackson and Jem Belcher. Last years Sir Tatton Sykes the horse is led in by his human namesake the 4th Baronet, after the 1846 St Leger Stakes Sykes was 74 in 1846 when he led in William Scott's horse‚Äîcalled after him, Sir Tatton Sykes‚Äîa winner of the St. Leger Stakes. His last visit to Doncaster was in 1862, to see his seventy-fourth St. Leger. He died at Sledmere on 21 March 1863, and was buried on 27 March in the presence of three thousand persons. A portrait of him was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1805, and another by Sir Francis Grant in 1848.

Medieval manuscripts often used red-orange minium pigment in the letters of the text and for small illustrations, called miniatures. Minium, also known as red lead, is a bright orange red pigment that was widely used in the Middle Ages for the decoration of manuscripts and for painting. It was made by roasting white lead pigment in the air; the white lead would gradually turn yellow, then into an orange lead tetroxide. The color varied depending upon how long the mineral was roasted.Daniel V. Thompson, The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, pg. 100 During the Roman Empire, the term minium could refer either to the pigment made from ground cinnabar or to the less expensive red lead. The name came from the river Minius in Iberia (now forming part of the Spanish- Portuguese border and known as Mi√±o or Minho), located near the main Roman cinnabar mines. Pliny the Elder referred to it as flammeus, or flame color. The minium of red lead was easy to make and less expensive than the pigment made from the mineral cinnabar, and it was bright and cheerful, so it became the most commonly used bright red in Medieval painting despite being poisonous, and sometimes turning black in impure air. The use of red lead phased out with the introduction of vermilion from the 11th century.Daniel Thompson,The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, pg. 101 The color was used in particular for the paragraph signs, versals, capitals, and headings which were colored red in medieval manuscripts. The Latin verb for this kind of work was miniare, to apply minium, and a person who did this was known as a miniator. These medieval artists also made small illustrations and decorative drawings in the manuscripts, which became known as miniatures, the source of the English word for small works of art.Daniel Thompson, The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, pg. 102 There was (and is) considerable confusion among the names of ancient and medieval pigments. As noted above, the term minium was used for cinnabar, vermilion, and for red lead. Minium of red lead was sometimes called stupium in classical Latin, adding to the confusion.Daniel Thompson, The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, pg. 102 Minium may have been manufactured in China as early as 300 B.C. It was known in the Han Dynasty (200 BC-200 AD) under the name \\"cinnabar of lead\\" (ch'ien tan), The process of manufacturing it was described in a Chinese manuscript of the 5th century. Minium was widely used for Persian miniature painting and Indian miniature painting.Philip Ball (2001), Bright Earth - Art and the Invention of Colour, Hazan (French edition).

He was said to have become resentful when he lost the latter position, because he and his wife Hao Jinfang (ÈÉùÈáëËä≥) did not adhere to the family planning policy. Wang, who was also a member of the Communist Party of China, was a follower of Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, advocated their policies and criticized the leaders of the Communist Party after the third plenum of the Central Committee in 1978.Ê≥ïÂæãÂ∏∏ËØÜËµÑÊñôÂèäÊ°à‰æãÈÄâ; ÊµãÁªòÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 1986.

Shooting In the evening of November 17, 1980, just days before the upcoming trials of the members of the Gang of Four, Wang broke into the office of deputy director Song Tiefa (ÂÆãÈìÅÊ≥ï) and director Li Qingsheng (ÊùéÂ∫ÜÁîü), pried open a drawer and stole a pistol, 25 rounds of ammunition, CN¬•200, and 300 pounds of ration stamps. The 32-year-old policeman then destroyed a ceramics bust of Mao Zedong, as well as portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De by firing eleven rounds. Subsequently, Wang broke into the armory of the second brigade in the north of Handan, where he armed himself with a light machine gun, eight rifles, 28 hand grenades, and a total of 2,700 rounds of ammunition. For the next six hours he paced through the streets of Handan, shooting people and throwing grenades, and repeatedly returned to the armory in between to restock his arms supply. When he was finally arrested Wang had spent 460 rounds and detonated 26 grenades, leaving six people dead at the scene, one more fatally wounded, and twelve others injured, five of them seriously. He had also killed two pigs and damaged two television sets, as well as a transformer.Ê≤≥ÂåóÁúÅÂú∞ÊñπÂøóÁºñÁ∫ÇÂßîÂëò‰ºö: Ê≤≥ÂåóÁúÅÂøó: ÂÆ°Âà§Âøó; Ê≤≥Âåó‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ.

Prosecution began on January 21, but due to insufficient evidence the case was returned to the Handan Procuratorate on February 20. After an additional investigation the case was again transferred to the Handan Prefectural Intermediate People's Court on March 26, and on April 9, 1981 Wang was sentenced to death for counterrevolutionary activities and deprived of his political rights for life. Wang filed an appeal against the verdict, claiming that he had been insane at the time, and so the case was transferred to the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court on April 21, which sent Wang to a psychiatric hospital in Baoding for examination, where he was eventually found to be legally sane. On May 9 the judicial committee decided to maintain Wang's conviction, and on May 13 the case was transferred to the Supreme People's Court to review the verdict, which was approved on May 26. The conviction was thus upheld by the Handan Prefectural Intermediate People's Court, as well as the Handan Municipal People's Court in a public trial at the Handan Municipal Stadium on June 10.

Atriplex pleiantha). It is known by the common names Four-corners orach and Mancos shadscale. It occurs in the Navajo Basin of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Description Proatriplex pleiantha is an annual plant of 5‚Äì17 cm, glabrous, sometimes slightly farinose. The erect stems are branched from base with white-yellow or reddish ascending branches. The alternate or sometimes nearly opposite leaves are petiolate. The succulent, bright green leaf blades of 5‚Äì28 mm length and width are ovate to suborbiculate with entire margins. The leaf anatomy is of the \\"normal\\" (non-Kranz) type of C3-plants. The plants are monoecious. The inflorescences either contain mixed male and female flowers, or consist of interrupted, terminal spikes of glomerulated male flowers, and female flowers standing in the leaf axils. Male flowers (without bracteoles) consist of 5 perianth lobes, ca. 1‚Äì1.5 mm long, united in the lower half, with cucullate tips, and 5 exserting stamens inserting on a disc. Female flowers are sitting in groups of 2‚Äì6 within 2 opposite bracteoles, they consist of a hyaline perianth of 5 scale-like, lanceolate to ovate tepals of 1‚Äì1.5 mm, and an ovary with 2 filiform, slightly exserted stigmas. In fruit, the bracteoles enclosing the fruits become accrescent, 3‚Äì7 mm long and broad, slightly connate in the lower half. Their shape is triangular-ovate to orbiculate, with sessile or shortly stipitate bases and entire margins. Their surface is glabrous, without tubercles. The suborbicular to obovoid, laterally compressed fruit (utricle) is nearly equal in length to perianth and falls at maturity. The membranous pericarp adheres to the seed. The vertically orientated seed has a black, smooth and shining, crustaceous seed coat. The annular embryo surrounds the copious farinaceous perisperm. Proatriplex pleiantha is flowering from May to June. The chromosome numbers are n = 9 (haploid) and 2n = 18 (diploid). Distribution Proatriplex pleiantha is endemic to the Navajo Basin of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. It is very common in desert badlands, and occurs often in pure stands on saline clay soils of depressions, or together with other halophytes in salt desert shrubs. It grows at altitudes of 1400‚Äì1500 m. Systematics Proatriplex belongs to the tribe Atripliceae in the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae. Proatriplex has been first described in 1950 by William Alfred Weber at the rank of a subgenus of Atriplex (in: Madro√±o 10(6): p. 188‚Äì189). In 1990, it was raised to genus level by Howard Coombs Stutz & Ge Lin Chu (in: American Journal of Botany 77(3), p. 364). The genus is monotypic, comprising only Proatriplex pleiantha (W.A. Weber) Stutz & G.L. Chu.. This species was later again included in genus Atriplex. Phylogenetic research revealed it to be distinct from most Atriplex species, being more closely related to other endemic North American genera of Atripliceae. References Stanley L.

Executed in an advanced Proto-Cubist style, the work was exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1910 (no. 2160), the following year Gleizes chose to exhibit this work at the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La Bo√©tie, 1912 (no. 34), and Manes Moderni Umeni, S.V.U., Vystava, Prague, 1914 (no. 33). The painting was again shown at the Grand Palais, Salon des Ind√©pendants, Trente ans d'art ind√©pendant, in 1926. L'Arbre, an important work of 1910, appeared at the decisive Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1911, where Cubism emerged as a group manifestation and spread across the globe, at times shocking the general public.Anne Varichon, Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, Catalogue raisonn√©, volume I, Paris, 1998, no. 345 (illustrated p. 127). Description L'Arbre (The Tree) is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 92 √ó 73.2 cm ( by inches), signed and dated Albert Gleizes 10, lower right. Gleizes practically subjugates The Tree in the foreground‚Äîits thin trunk slightly off-center and foliage cropped at the top‚Äîto a secondary role within a meticulously geometric World landscape. Here, the receding landscape marked by protruding hills and steep cliff-like formations, is perhaps more naturalistic than the core group of Gleizes' subsequent 1911‚Äì12 landscapes (e.g., Le Chemin (Paysage √† Meudon), 1911, and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers), 1912) yet does not replicate any other known painting (or specific location) in any of its parts. This fact strongly points towards it being an invention born out of Gleizes' studio. Gleizes' method was fundamentally synthetic. Although the landscape seems persuasively realistic (with its foreground, background and village in between), it is not an existing place somewhere between Paris and his studio at Courbevoie, consistent with Gleizes' method of bringing together various elements from different locations anteriorly observed in nature. The superposition of hills with a succession of brown, grey and white planes throughout this painting‚Äîproviding a sense of temporal duration and spatial extension to the immense vista‚Äîalong with the cubic architectural structures cutting through the center of the canvas, each with its own perspective, are very typical of the core group of Gleizes' landscapes. The divers elements are combined in such a way that avoids symmetry; a characteristic found in several of the artists landscapes, painted before and after L'Arbre, each a unique creation. Daniel Robbins writes of The Tree (L'Arbre) and related works in the catalogue of the Gleizes Retrospective at the Guggenheim, New York (1964): > In this work, one of Gleizes' most important paintings of the crucial year > 1910, we see the artist's volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful > union of a broad field of vision with a flat picture plane. Earlier studies, > such as By the Seine (Bord de la Seine, Meudon) of 1909, and Road, Trees and > Houses (Environs de Meudon) of 1910 (both in the collection of Walter > Firpo), clearly anticipate this development.Albert Gleizes 1881‚Äì1953, a > retrospective exhibition, Daniel Robbins. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, > New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e national d'art moderne, Paris; Museum > am Ostwall, Dortmund, published 1964 During his trip to Bagn√®res sur Bigorre, Gascony, in 1909 Gleizes concentrated exclusively on landscapes, reducing natural forms to primary shapes. His effort to portray the complex rhythms of a panorama resulted in \\"a comprehensive geometry of intersecting and overlapping forms which created a new and more dynamic quality of movement\\". His 1911 Paysage √† Meudon followed, in which \\"Man is reintroduced, but subordinated to the heroic concept of landscape which simultaneously comprehends the close and the distant, the earth's curve, the sun, even the force of wind against trees\\". (Robbins, 1964) 1910 in brief Gleizes writes in his SouvenirsAlbert Gleizes, Souvenirs - Le Cubisme, 1908-1914, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957. Reprinted, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Ampuis, 1997. Translation and notes by Peter Brooke of the crucial year 1910: > After painting a series of pictures, some of which are still in existence > today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that > would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the > Salon des Ind√©pendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, > where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a > full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet Ren√© Arcos, as well as two > landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in > restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my > researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. > So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage > which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all > in the second half of that year, when I painted the canvasses which would > appear in the Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1911. Gleizes met Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay in 1910, through Alexandre Mercereau, but had only vague knowledge of the work they showed at the Salon des Ind√©pendants that same year. Gleizes too had exhibited at the same salon. Most importantly, Gleizes had read an article which had struck him, written by Jean Metzinger for the young literary review, Pan,Jean Metzinger, Note sur la peinture, Pan (Paris), October‚ÄìNovember 1910 run by two young poets, [Marcel Rieu] and Jean Clary. The anti-Hellenic concept of representing a subject from multiple points of view was a central idea of Jean Metzinger's Note sur la Peinture article of 1910. It was at the Ind√©pendants of 1910 that Metzinger showed a portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire which Apollinaire in his book The Cubist Painters, 1913, claimed was the first Cubist portrait.Guillaume Apollinaire, M√©ditations esth√©tiques. Les peintres cubistes (The Cubist Painters), Edition Figui√®re, Paris, 1913 Gleizes continues writing in his Souvenirs: > 1910 was the year in which, in its last months, a more or less coherent > group began to form from certain tendencies which were quite clearly present > in our generation but had previously been scattered. Painters saw what they > had in common, poets joined them, feelings of sympathy were established, a > general atmosphere began to form which would soon produce an action whose > effects were to be quickly felt in the surrounding world. Painters and > writers would support each other, moved as they all were by a single faith. > (Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs) Exhibitions * Salon des Ind√©pendants, Paris, 1910, no. 2160Soci√©t√© des artistes ind√©pendants, 26, Catalogue de la 26e exposition, 1910, Albert Gleizes, numbers 2159-2164, Gallica, biblioth√®que num√©rique de France * Salon des Ind√©pendants, Paris, 1911, not mentioned in the catalogue * Salon de la Section d'Or, Paris, 1912, no. 34 * Moderni Umeni, S.V.U.

Smith primarily photographed with a 35mm Leica M4 before he transitioned to a 120/6x6 (medium format) Hasselblad with an 80mm lens. He preferred natural light to illuminate his subjects, but occasionally used continuous lighting. Smith shot predominantly in black and white, until 2002, when he first began to experiment with color film. His work is commonly referred to as classic, minimalistic, and whimsical.  Early life  Rodney Smith was born December 24, 1947 in Manhattan, New York. His father, Sanford Smith, was president of fashion industry giant. Smith recalls, \\"A sense of style, a sense of proportion and a sense of beauty and a sense of grace ‚Äì all of those things were very important in my upbringing.\\"  Education  After he studied English Literature and Religious Studies at University of Virginia in 1970, Smith went for his graduate degree in Theology at Yale University in 1973. Smith said in an interview with Kodak, \\"I absolutely knew I wanted to be a photographer, but I didn't feel that studying in an art school or a photography department full time was the way to address the issues that were interesting to me ‚Äì so I sort of entwined the two.\\" While at Yale, he also studied under photographer, Walker Evans  Jerusalem  In 1976 Mr. Smith spent 100 days photographing the people of the Holy Land, in Jerusalem. From the 88 Rolls of film shot, Smith ended up compiling two portfolios, which later became his first book: ‚ÄúIn the Land of the Light: Israel, a Portrait of Its People (1983). Published by Houghton Mifflin Company in Israel.  Career  After returning from Jerusalem, Smith spent a short time as an adjunct professor of photography at Yale University. As Smith continued his career into the nineties he slowly shifted from corporate executives to fashion photography. \\"My feelings about photography are exactly the same today as when I was 20. That is, I have a love/hate relationship with making pictures.\\" Looking at pictures is one thing, he qualifies, \\"But making pictures ‚Äì making pictures for me is hard, hard work.\\" Rodney Smith's work has been featured in the Wall Street Journal to Martha Stewart, from Time to Bloomingdales. In addition to his work as a photographer, Smith lectured and gave workshops.  Personal life  Rodney Smith lived and worked in New York City, with his wife, Leslie Smolan, and daughter, Savannah, and son Jonah Smith. His wife, Leslie, is co-founder of graphic design and branding firm, Carbone Smolan Agency. He is currently represented by a number of galleries both in the US and internationally; acte2galerie of Paris, France, The PhotoGallery AB of Halmstad, Sweden, FOST Gallery of Singapore, Fahey Klein Gallery of Los Angeles, California, Galerie Greenwich of Greenwich, Connecticut, Galerie Sono of Norwalk, Connecticut, and Gilman Contemporary of Ketchum, Idaho. In the past 25 years, Smith received 50+ awards including First Prize for his book \\"The End\\" from International Photography Awards (IPA). He has also received several Communication Arts and Photo District News (PDN) awards. Smith died in his sleep on December 5, 2016 at the age of 68.  Photographic books  * 1980. \\"Portfolio I\\".

Although an alternative location for skateboarding and other activities was proposed by Southbank Centre, under Hungerford Bridge, this was considered by users of the Undercroft to be a quite different space and lack the unique character and heritage of the Undercroft. On 18 September 2014, Long Live Southbank signed a Section 106 agreement with the Southbank Centre guaranteeing the space's long- term future. https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/18/skaters- southbank-centre-undercroft-london-remains-open and the Festival Wing proposals were withdrawn by Southbank Centre. The Southbank Undercroft The area has been continually used by skateboarders, BMXers and other creative urban art forms since the early seventies and remains an important landmark for urban culture. The campaign seeks to protect a dynamic space that has been utilised for creativity and self-expression for decades, independently building a culture and community that continues to attract visitors from all over the world. LLSB volunteer, Henry Edwards-Wood, says of the motivation for the campaign; \\"This space has empowered generations of physical, visual and collaborative expression and informed and directed the lives of people from all walks of life. This world famous landmark and cultural icon must be preserved for future generations to flourish.\\" History The Undercroft skateboarding area was an unused space appropriated as a cultural and recreational facility within the South Bank complex that has been used consistently for over 40 years. Skateboarders initially appropriated the area but it soon became used by BMXers, inline skaters, graffiti artists and many other creatives including street dancers, musicians, videographers and more. The space is unique as it grew organically into what is now widely recognised as the home of British skateboarding. As an import from California, skateboarding in Britain was difficult due to the weather. The Undercroft space provided the perfect environment for skating as it was covered from the rain, smooth, flat with unusual architectural features resembling the ramps Californians skated, but most importantly disused. In London, the concrete banks below the Southbank Centre's Hayward Gallery proved ideal for early surf-related moves, : A large paved area sweeps into a three-sided bank and a seemingly endless stream of kids : were hurtling up to the bank, riding it, and turning back down and away...others were riding : along the top edge of the bank, crouched down holding on to their boards (‚Äòcarving‚Äô).\\"Borden, Iain, Skateboarding, Space, and the City: Architecture and the Body, Berg, 2001, p.32; Stan Hey, Wheelers and Dealers, Time Out, no. 381 (15‚Äì21 July 1977), p.13 In late 2003 the Southbank Centre reduced the skate area by two thirds without consulting any users of the undercroft space and destroyed the small banks and driveway ramp that was in that area, this area was then used as extra storage space. In August 2004 Rich \\"Badger\\" Holland of Side Effects of Urethane designed and installed new pieces of street furniture into the Undercroft space This project was entitled 'Moving Units', later in 2006 more stone street furniture was provided as part of another project by the TSEOU entitled Units Moved. Finally, in 2010 a railing was placed around the site and this now serves as a vantage point for spectators. Since April 2013 the LLSB campaign has been working to protect the legal status of the Undercroft. LLSB‚Äôs application for the area to be awarded the status of an Asset of Community Value was granted in July 2013. An application, now withdrawn as part of the Section 106 agreement, has also been lodged for the area to be granted village green status under the Commons Act 2006 as an area of recognised community value that is regularly enjoyed by local residents. The Southbank Centre released a response to the decision to list the Undercroft as an 'Asset of Community Value' advising that they have no intention of selling the space and the outcome makes no difference to their intended development. Reception to the Festival Wing scheme of 2013-14 The campaign increased the awareness of the Southbank Centre‚Äôs Festival Wing redevelopment proposals and established a growing support base of those opposed. =English Heritage= English Heritage originally welcomed the Festival Wing proposals, believing that it would provide \\"new facilities and opportunities for the Southbank Centre to cement its position as the leading arts complex in Britain\\". However, their concerns about the scale of the development plans led Simon Hickman, English Heritage's Inspector of Historic Buildings and Areas, to submit a letter to Lambeth council on 5 July. He advised that English Heritage was aware of the \\"volume of representations from the skateboard community in regards to this application, who value the Undercroft and feel it is part of their cultural identity\\". He added that, \\"as it is their primary role to assess the physical effects of proposed development on a historic environment, further analysis was needed to find out the communal value of the Undercroft is necessary to ascertain the impact on recent cultural heritage\\". In September 2013 English Heritage published the following statement on its website. \\"In 2012 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport granted the Southbank Centre a Certificate of Immunity from listing. This Certificate is valid for five years and during this period the building cannot be considered for listing. The decision cannot be challenged until this time has elapsed which, in this case, means June 2017. We appreciate the community value of the skate park and welcome the Southbank Centre‚Äôs commitment to providing a new one not far from the present location.\\" =Kate Hoey, MP= Kate Hoey, MP for Vauxhall, was initially in favour of the development and was quoted in the March press release as saying \\"Southbank Centre has played a leading role in helping to transform the Southbank into London's top destination and this project will make the South Bank one of the world's most vibrant areas\\". Kate Hoey has since become an active MP in the movement against the plans. On 27 June Hoey presented the 40,000-signature petition (which was later replaced by a preservation statement with 150,000 signatures) to save the Southbank skate area to the House of Commons. She spoke to the House and advised that the Undercroft is a ‚Äòculturally and historically important area of the South Bank‚Äô. Hoey has also become active on her Twitter site in support of the campaign. =The Twentieth Century Society= The Twentieth Century Society initially welcomed the development and was pleased by the Southbank Centre‚Äôs enthusiasm for redevelopment of the existing buildings. However, they felt frustrated that neither Southbank Centre nor their architects addressed the society's concerns regarding the size of the building in the pre-application meetings. Director Catherine Croft wrote that the Twentieth Century Society were \\"deeply disappointed\\" that they cannot support the Southbank Centre‚Äôs scheme. The organisation feels that the proposals are \\"too big and over ambitious\\" and will dwarf the neighbouring National Theatre‚Äôs Howarth Tomkins scheme. Furthermore, the society recognise the \\"immense interest and opposition\\" that has been generated by the plans to relocate the skateboarders. They feel that the skateboarders \\"bring a unique visual and cultural interest\\" to the South Bank and feel that the Southbank Centre has not \\"fully appreciated\\" the \\"communal value\\". =Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment= Paul Finch, Chair of Design Council CABE, is quoted in the Southbank Centre‚Äôs initial press release as being in favour of the development as the design \\"respects and upgrades the past while introducing bold additions, which will be unmistakably of their time\\". Later they released a review that argued that the \\"complex and challenging proposal would benefit from an extended pre-planning phase\\" as the proposal should reflect the \\"aspirations and aesthetic tendencies of our time\\". =Lambeth Council= Lambeth Council received the planning application from the Southbank Centre in May 2013 and due to the high level of interest in the development set up a page on their website with the aim to clarify \\"the facts\\" of the proposals. The page informs that the plans will double the size of the arts centre and will include new rehearsal space, educational facilities, restaurants and shops and includes that these retail spaces will be situated in \\"the 'Undercroft', part of which is currently the home of the skate park\\". The council recognised that the space is being used by skaters, BMXers and graffiti artists and \\"is renowned internationally by the skateboard community. It is a 'destination' on the South Bank.\\" The page also states that these plans are proposals that will be confirmed by themselves as a local planning authority, \\"subject to a final direction from the Mayor of London. The plans are not proposed by Lambeth council but the Southbank Centre\\". Councillor Lib Peck, head of Lambeth Council, is quoted, \\"The Southbank Centre is an important asset to the borough, and the skate park has become an established part of it. Although there is already a commitment from Southbank Centre that skateboarding will be kept on the South Bank, we would like to see further discussions take place and are confident that a satisfactory solution can be found.\\" The website advises that Lambeth Council and the Southbank Centre agreed to extend the deadline for a decision on the planning application in order to allow discussions to take place. The Section 106 settlement between the Southbank Centre and Long Live Southbank, guaranteeing the long-term future of the Undercroft will be upheld by Lambeth Council. Cllr Lib Peck, Leader of Lambeth Council said; \\"I'm pleased that Lambeth Council was able to work with both sides and find an imaginative solution to resolve this. Shared public space in London is precious and Southbank Centre is a great asset to the country‚Äôs cultural life. This agreement is a sensible way of protecting both and we can all now look forward.\\"http://www.llsb.com/blog/#sthash.sazfRfq7.dpuf Success Lambeth Council accepted LLSB's application for the Southbank Undercroft to be listed as an \\"Asset of Community Value\\" under the Localism Act 2011 on 12 July 2013. In January 2014, the last of 33,000 planning permission objections (distinct from the 150,000 statements of support gathered by LLSB) were delivered to Lambeth Council. This included a formal objection written by Nick Hytner, the artistic director of the National Theatre, which was published on the Southbank Centre's planning application on Lambeth Council's website. The Twentieth Century Society released information advising that they are no longer in support of the plans. In September 2013 English Heritage issued a statement in support of Southbank Centre's plans. On 16 January 2014, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson came out in support of Long Live Southbank. This was highly significant as he had power of veto over any planning application in London. The Mayor said \\"The skate park is the epicentre of UK skateboarding and is part of the cultural fabric of London. This much-loved community space has been used by thousands of young people over the years. It attracts tourists from across the world and undoubtedly adds to the vibrancy of the area ‚Äì it helps to make London the great city it is\\" http://www.llsb.com/press-release-mayor-of-london-boris-johnson-speaks-out-in- support-of-preserving-londons-iconic-skate-spot/ This forced the Southbank Centre to drop their planning application for a period of reconsideration. After months of negotiations, the Southbank Centre and Long Live Southbank signed a binding deal with Lambeth Council to guarantee the long-term future of the skate spot on 18 September 2014. The joint press release said \\"Following talks that have taken place over the last three months, Long Live Southbank and Southbank Centre are delighted to have reached an agreement that secures the Queen Elizabeth Hall undercroft as the long-term home of British skateboarding and the other urban activities for which it is famous.\\"http://www.llsb.com/category/press-release/#sthash.0sbp3aJh.dpuf LLSB community work Since the September 2014 agreement with the Southbank Centre, Long Live Southbank have remained a highly active organisation. They have worked with a wide variety of groups aiming to protect creative spaces and communities, both in the UK and abroad. Most significant is the assistance provided to the skateboarding communities of Norwich and Kettering in England, as well as the Friends of Stockwell campaign, who are aiming to safeguard Stockwell Skatepark, also in South London. Long Live Southbank continue to be involved in resolving ongoing issues at the Undercroft, organizing maintenance, resolving disputes and taking part in talks and workshops to raise awareness about the importance of free creative spaces. LLSB restoration campaign 2017 onward In June 2017 Southbank Centre and Long Live Southbank (LLSB) launched a ¬£790,000 joint crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to restore the skate space. The vibrant development will include new space for skateboarding, graffiti and other free creative pursuits. Also included is a new space for children and young people to engage in learning and creative activities, organised by Southbank Centre. The development will extend the existing skate space, with improvements to lighting as well as a restoration of original 1960s banks and concrete paving. It will also create a new learning and education hub for children and young people, a go-to place for young people looking for opportunities in the arts and creative industries. This hub will host interactive new learning and participation events and programmes that will welcome hundreds of school-children and local people to creative projects every day.

Nominations are accepted from anyone, and winners and honorable mentions are chosen by the Sustainable Transport Award Steering Committee. Since 2005, the award has been given out annually to a city or major jurisdiction that has implemented innovative transportation strategies, especially in several different areas of sustainable transportation. The award rewards cities for such accomplishments as improving mobility for all residents, reducing transportation greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions, and improving safety and access for bicyclists and pedestrians. Finalists are invited to an award ceremony during the Transportation Research Board‚Äôs annual conference in Washington, DC in January, where the winner and honorable mentions are announced at the ceremony. The STA directs international attention to cities on the cutting edge of transportation policy. By highlighting successful completed programs and emphasizing transferability, the award helps disseminate new ideas and best practices, while encouraging cities worldwide to improve their own livability. Noteworthy projects include the construction or expansion of BRT or LRT systems, bike shares or bike lanes, attention to low-income access to transportation, reform of parking or zoning regulations, and linking transportation and development practices (TOD).  Process  = Criteria = Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard accepts the 2013 Sustainable Transport Award STAs are awarded to cities that have demonstrated significant progress in using transportation to create a more sustainable, livable city. The Sustainable Transport Award looks for cities working in several of the following policy areas: *Improvements to public transportation, such as implementing a new mass transit system (e.g. bus rapid transit), expanding the existing systems to increase accessibility and coverage, or improving customer service. *Improvements to non-motorized travel, such as the implementation or expansion of bike share programs and bike lanes, creation of pedestrian walkways and improvements to street crossings and sidewalks. *Expansion or improvement to public space often includes creation of open plazas, creating pedestrian only zones, installing street lamps or trees along sidewalks, and pedestrian safety measures. *Implementation of travel demand management programs to reduce private car use, which can include car-free days or zones, changes to parking requirements or availability, the implementation or expansion of car share systems, congestion charging and structured tolls and fees. *Reduction of urban sprawl by linking transportation to development (TOD) can be done through changes to zoning laws and providing incentives to developers. *Reduction of transport related air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, by creating pollution laws, mandating air quality controls, restricting vehicle access, and creating an air advisory system. To be eligible for an STA, cities must have made significant progress in the past year addressing sustainable transit. Awards are presented for projects implemented in the previous year, rather than for planned activity or simply beginning construction. = Nominations = Cities must be nominated to be considered for the award. Nominations can come from government agencies, including the Mayor's office, NGOs, consultants, academics, or anyone else with a close working knowledge of the city's projects. Applicants are asked to provide program details, impact, significant, and outcomes, transferability, and images. = Steering Committee = Final selection of the award recipient and honorable mentions is conducted by a steering committee, composed of experts and organizations working internationally on sustainable transportation.http://staward.org/committee/ The committee includes the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), EMBARQ, World Bank, GIZ, Clean Air Institute, Clean Air Asia,http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/index.php ICLEI‚Äôs EcoMobility, Transportation Research Laboratory (TRL), and Despacio The committee looks for projects completed in the previous year that demonstrate innovation and success in improving sustainable transportation.  Past winners  = Bogot√°, Colombia = 2005: The first annual Sustainable Transport Award was presented to Bogot√° in recognition of the city‚Äôs success in implementing the TransMilenio BRT, integrating bicycle infrastructure with mass transit, and redefining and reclaiming public space for its citizens. Mayor Enrique Pe√±alosa‚Äôs vision and implementation helped transform Bogot√° into a model livable city and set a precedent for subsequent years‚Äô STA cities. = Seoul, South Korea = 2006: Under the leadership of Mayor Myung Bak Lee, a four-mile elevated highway that once covered the Cheonggyecheon River in the city center was replaced with a riverfront park, high quality walkways, and public squares. Exclusive bus lanes were constructed along 36 miles of congested streets, and the city government initiated plans for additional bus lanes as part of a broader initiative to improve all aspects of the city's bus system. = Guayaquil, Ecuador = 2007: The 2007 launch of the first 15 kilometers of Guayaquil‚Äôs new bus rapid transit system, Metrovia, brought cleaner, higher quality service and reduced trip times in key travel corridors to city residents. Further improvements to the city included the refurbishment of previously deteriorated public spaces, such as the waterfront and Santa Ana district, which encouraged pedestrian use and increased development in the city. = Paris, France and London, United Kingdom = 2008: In recognition of Paris and London‚Äôs exemplary programs in bike share and congestion pricing, respectively, the two cities shared the 2008 award. The Paris bike share program, V√©lib (‚ÄúFreedom Bikes‚Äù), revolutionized bike sharing. By the end of 2007, V√©lib had more than 1,200 stations and 15,000 bikes. This enormously successful bike share system complements other aspects of Paris‚Äô new mobility plan, such as renovating public squares and plazas, widening sidewalks, and opening a new BRT system. These improvements led to a decrease in private vehicle traffic by 20 percent and a nine percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. London is the largest city to adopt congestion pricing, and its success has inspired cities around the globe. In 2007, London expanded on the success of its groundbreaking 2003 congestion pricing plan with a doubling of the congestion zone, increased fees for motor vehicles, and new citywide emission-based tolls that are spurring more rapid adoption of cleaner, fuel efficient vehicles. The new pricing causes a 21 perfect drop in congestion, 70,000 fewer vehicles entering the extended congestion pricing zone daily, a 45 percent increase in bus ridership, and a 42 percent increase in bike use from 2007. = New York City, United States = 2009: New York City demonstrated that political will, bold leadership, and citizen engagement can lead to sweeping transportation reforms. In 2008, the city implemented key parts of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's long-term sustainability vision, PlaNYC 2030. The laudable changes made throughout 2008 have reshaped the experience of walking on New York City streets. The city changed 49 acres of road space, traffic lanes and parking spots into bike lanes, pedestrian areas and public plazas and advocated biking and walking as investment-worthy transportation alternatives. = Ahmedabad, India = 2010: In only a few months of operation, Ahmedabad's Janmarg BRT transformed transit in South Asia and became a model for the future of transportation in India and the world. The cutting-edge BRT is India's first with median stations, pre-paid tickets, sheltered, attractive stations, and at-level boarding. The system is projected to save 288,000 metric tons of CO2 each year. Beyond the bus system, the city has taken measures to incorporate high quality pedestrian facilities and bike lanes, demonstrating continued leadership in sustainable transport. = Guangzhou, China = 2011: With the opening of the Guangzhou BRT in February 2010, the city asserted its leadership in mass transit planning. In its first year, the BRT began carrying more daily passengers than all the city's five metro lines, logging 800,000 daily passenger-trips. The system has more than triple the peak passenger flows of any other BRT system in Asia, and carries more passengers than most metros in mainland China. Furthermore, the BRT system integrates well with Guangzhou's newly launched bike share program (June 2010), providing 5,500 bike parking stations at the BRT stations, and dedicated bike lanes along the BRT route. = Medellin, Colombia and San Francisco, US = 2012: As National Geographic notes, ‚Äútwo cities renowned for the cable cars that traverse their hilly terrains‚Äù share the 2012 STA. Medell√≠n, Colombia: During the previous year, Medell√≠n expanded on its significant investments in sustainable transportation. The city's introduction of EnCicla, Latin America's first bike sharing program, increasing BRT transit, and using progressive techniques such as ridesharing programs and intelligent mobility system (SIMM) have helped make the city more accessible, cleaner and safer. In addition, Medell√≠n has leveraged social media and web content supplement and add value to the city's various transportation options. San Francisco, US: San Francisco's recent successes in managing and reducing parking demonstrated innovative planning techniques and strong leadership. Working with local businesses and communities, the city implemented SFpark, a parking management system that factors time of day and real time availability into the pricing. Combined with programs replacing parking spaces with parks, slower speed limits near schools, and working to increase biking opportunities, San Francisco lead the field in taking action to address sustainable transportation. = Mexico City, Mexico = 2013: Mexico City has made significant progress in many different areas of sustainable transportation. From expanding its successful Bike Share program, Ecobici, to revitalizing public spaces, to implementing on-street parking reform, the city has taken many steps to improve mobility and quality of life for its residents. The expansion of Metrob√∫s, the city's BRT system, from the airport to the historic center, has revitalized the downtown area and demonstrated that even old narrow streets can be converted into avenues for better transportation.http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/its-not-just- nice-to-share-its-the-future/?_r=1 = Buenos Aires, Argentina = 2014: During the previous year, Buenos Aires implemented several major sustainable transport projects. The city launched two new corridors of its bus rapid transit system, Metrobus: the 23 km corridor of Metrobus Sur and the 2.5 km corridor of 9 de Julio.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1603956-el-mapa-del- recorrido-del-metrobus-de-la-9-de-julio In addition, the city converted dozens of blocks in the city center into a pedestrian-friendly environment with pedestrian walkways, expanded sidewalks, and new protected cycle lanes.

Towards the end of the medieval age it was left to Republic of Venice by the emperor John V Palaiologos as a ransom. In 1381 however, following Venetian Genoese War it was evacuated by the Venetians according to the Peace of Turin.Nicolae Jorga: Geschichte des Osmanischen Vol I, translated by Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli, Yeditepe, yayƒ±nlarƒ±, istanbul, 2009 , p. 236 In 1455 it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Mehmet II. Although the Venetians tried to regain the island, in 1464 the Ottoman control was secured by Mahmut Pasha. As a result of the former evacuation, the island was uninhabited during the early years of Ottoman administration and the Ottoman Empire populated the present Bozcaada district by using tax exemption.

The 18,000-strong Teutonic army captured four Lithuanian fortresses and besieged Medvƒógalis. The fortress surrendered and as many as 6,000 locals were baptized in the Catholic rite. The campaign, which lasted a little more than a week, was cut short by a Polish attack on Prussia in the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1326‚Äì32). As soon as the Teutonic army returned to Prussia the Lithuanians returned to their pagan practices and beliefs. Background Knightly portrait of King John of Bohemia Medvƒógalis was one of the strongest and most important Lithuanian fortresses in Samogitia. First mentioned in written sources in 1316, over the course of its history it was attacked about 20 times by the Teutonic Knights. After the victorious Battle of Medininkai in 1320, Lithuania concluded a truce with the Knights. The Teutons resumed military incursions into Lithuania in 1328. On 1 January 1329, King John of Bohemia arrived at Toru≈Ñ wishing to engage in the holy crusade against pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Back in 1325 he had promised Pope John XXII to launch another crusade and received permission to collect papal income tax for three years to finance the crusade. He brought many noblemen, including Walter VI, Count of Brienne, and Boles≈Çaw III the Generous with his brothers, and soldiers from Silesia, Germany, England. The king also brought poet Guillaume de Machaut so that his exploits could be memorialized in poems and songs (the campaign was described in Confort d'ami written in 1357). According to Peter von Dusburg, the Teutonic army which marched towards Medvƒógalis Castle numbered 350 knights and 18,000-foot soldiers. Teutonic ambitions were high as parallels were drawn with King Ottokar II of Bohemia and his 1255 campaign which resulted in the conquest of the Sambians. Campaign According to Jean d'Outremeuse, the vanguard of the Teutonic army first raided and appropriated livestock of Gelindƒónai Hillfort in the present-day Plungƒó District Municipality perhaps in an attempt to provoke a pitched battle. Lithuanians, led by Margiris, pursued the robbers and engaged in a battle. However, soon the Teutonic vanguard was joined by the main forces and the Lithuanians faced a slaughter. Recognizing King John, who had a reputation for participating in tournaments, Margiris challenged him to a face-to-face duel. King John agreed and they met next morning. However, Margiris' men attempted to interfere, which was strictly against the rules of chivalry. Margiris surrendered to John and promised to pay a ransom, which was paid with coins stolen during the 1326 raid into Brandenburg. On 1 February, the Teutonic army surrounded Medvƒógalis. After the wooden fortress caught fire, Medvƒógalis was captured and defenders were taken captive. Chronicler Wigand of Marburg mentioned that the Grand Master Werner von Orseln wanted to kill them all or at least resettle them in Prussia, but King John insisted that the captives be baptized and allowed to remain in Medvƒógalis. About 6,000 Lithuanian men, women, and children were baptized in the Roman Catholic rite. According to Machaut, the Teutons also captured four other fortresses ‚Äì ≈†iauduva (location is debated), Gediminas Castle (located in Kvƒódarna), Gegu≈æƒó, and Aukaimis (Xedeytain, Gedemine, Geguse, Aukaham). Aftermath At the same time King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I of Poland, who was allied with Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, took advantage of the fact that the main Teutonic force was in Lithuania and attacked Che≈Çmno Land (Kulmerland). Plans for a further military campaign in Samogitia were scrapped and the Teutonic army returned home to deal with the war with Poland. The entire campaign in Lithuania lasted a little more than a week. Once the main army left, the Lithuanians rebelled, retook their fortress, and returned to their pagan beliefs. King John returned to Prussia to crusade against Lithuania twice, in 1337 and 1345. The siege was fictionalized by Lithuanian writer Antanas Vienuolis in 1956.

Klyosov (born 20 November 1946) is a Russian scientist who worked in the fields of physical chemistry, enzyme catalysis, and industrial biochemistry. In 1989 Klyosov immigrated to the US. He spent most of his career developing ways to use enzymes to convert agricultural waste products into useful products ‚Äî first to convert cotton waste to glucose in the USSR, and later in the US, turning paper mill waste into useful products. He later helped found a company, and later joined it as CSO, that was founded to use enzymes to alter existing anticancer drugs via glycosylation. In 2008 he began publishing work on DNA genealogy that has been dismissed as pseudoscience.  Career  Klyosov earned Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees in physical chemistry, and an M.S. degree in enzyme kinetics, from Moscow State University. In the late 1970s he worked at Harvard University; he was offered a contract to keep working there but the USSR government would not allow him to take it and he remained in the USSR. From 1979 to 1981 he was professor in the department of chemical enzymology at Moscow State University. From 1981 to 1990, he was professor and head of the Carbohydrates Research Laboratory at the A.N. Bach Institute of Biochemistry, USSR Academy of Sciences. In the winter of 1982/1983 he became the first person behind the Iron Curtain who was allowed by the government of the USSR to use the computer network that later became the Internet, in order for him to represent the USSR in a conference hosted on the network; he used an x.25-connected computer at a Moscow institute called VNIIPAS. He said that he developed methods to use enzymes to convert cotton plant waste products into glucose and by 1983 a pilot plant had been built in the USSR to test these methods. He was awarded top Russian prizes in science and technology field: the Lenin Komsomol Prize in 1978 and the USSR State Prize in 1984. In 1989 he was made a fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science. In 2014 he became Foreign Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Georgia. Klyosov immigrated to the US in 1989 after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, and from 1990 to 1998 he was a visiting professor of biochemistry at the Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences at Harvard Medical School. In 1991 he started a consulting business called MIR International. From 1996 to 2006 Klyosov worked at a subsidiary of Kadant, where he applied enzymology to processing of waste products from the paper-making industry, and following advice from a friend in the plastics industry, helped create a business that used cellulose granules as filler material for plastic composite products. In 2001 he helped found Pro- Pharmaceuticals, a company that was formed to use enzymes to add carbodydrates to existing cancer drugs to make them work better, and was caught up in scandal in 2004 when the company's investors accused its CEO of misrepresenting his role in the company. He joined the company as Chief Scientific Officer in 2006. Pro-Pharmaceuticals named a new CEO in March 2011, and gave Klyosov a one-year contract to continue as CSO the same month. See 8-K index page The company was renamed as Galectin Therapeutics in May 2011. He then became a member of the company's scientific advisory board. From 2008 Klyosov is also known as the author of what he calls \\"DNA genealogy\\" and \\"new science\\", aimed to synthesize biology, anthropology, archaeology and linguistics and to implement methods of chemical kinetics in genetics. Klyosov described his \\"DNA genealogy\\" as a \\"patriotic science\\" and between 2010 and 2016 published 10 books in this field. In some of his writings Klyosov tried to refute the Out of Africa hypothesis and proposed his alternative Into Africa theory with \\"outlandish claims\\" that the human species originated in Northern Russia. According to scientists from various fields, \\"DNA genealogy\\" is pseudoscience, and they have characterized it as \\"DNA demagoguery‚Äù. Klyosov is the founder and president of the Academy of DNA Genealogy and self- publishes its proceedings via Lulu. In 2013 Klyosov became editor-in-chief of the journal Advances in Anthropology, published by Scientific Research Publishing.

It was released in June 2013 for Android, PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. The game criticises the ongoing War on Drugs and more specifically the Mexican Drug War which the developer claims ‚Ä≥...is a challenging and tactical newsgame that puts you on the frontline of one of the most dangerous conflicts ever; the War on Drugs. NarcoGuerra looks at the ongoing conflict from the perspective of the Mexican authorities trying to stamp out the drug trade within that embattled country.‚Ä≥  Gameplay  Game main screen NarcoGuerra is a turn-based strategy game with Risk like elements that takes place over a map of Mexico. The map is divided into a number of regions, most consisting of a single state, which are either controlled by the Police or one of the cartels. Each region has a number of units stationed in it, the more units the easier it is to hold, and attack from. Some regions also bestow bonuses when held such as increased income or defense. Each turn is split between two main phases, the Support Phase and Attack Phase. The player wins when they have removed all other opponents from the game. The game is lost if they lose all their regions to the opposing sides. There are 3 different game modes; Story, Skirmish and Local Multiplayer. Skirmish mode is unlocked once the player has completed Story mode. = Story Mode = In Story mode the player takes on the position of Mexico's Chief of Police with the main aim of tackling the countries drug problems by destroying the various cartels. The game aims to show the link between the street price of drugs and policing, so as the policing succeeds, so it constricts the supply of drugs and pushes the price up. As the price goes up, so new cartels enter the market as it becomes more profitable. At the beginning of the players turn there is a chance of a randomized event occurring, these are displayed as 'Activity Reports'. These provide insight into the actual situation in Mexico as well as missions for the player to achieve for increased income.  Support Phase  During the Support Phase the player will spend their budget on distributing units over the parts of the map they control to prepare for the following Attack Phase. 4 Abilities are available to the player; Hire Officer (purchase units), Redeploy (move units between controlled neighbouring regions), Intel (reveal the number of units stationed in regions not bordering your own), and Internal Affairs (lowers corruption). 3 important values also appear on the main game screen; Budget, Corruption and Street Price. The Police's income is a set amount per region held and is where the majority of their budget comes from. The cartels income is based on the regions they hold and the current street price . The street price will rise as the cartels lose territory, with the drugs being harder to come by, and fall when the market is saturated. Each turn the Polices' corruption rating will rise by a random amount. As this gets higher there is an ever increasing chance that units will defect to the other side. To compensate for this the player must spend money on the \\"Internal Affairs\\" ability.  Attack Phase  A faction can attack from a controlled region to a neighbouring enemy region. Similar to Risk the attacking occurs in bouts where the attacker matches 3 six sided dice against the defenders 2 dice (each dice representing a unit). The two highest rolls from each side are compared and the highest roll wins (defenders win on a draw), the losing units are destroyed and this continues until either the attacker takes the region or runs out of troops to attack with. Consecutive attacks by the same faction on the same turn cost increasingly more effectively limiting the number of attacks you can make per turn. If an attack is successful the attacker may then decide how to redistribute the remaining units between the two regions.  Elections  Every 5 turns there is an election during which the player is able to pledge money to one of the two candidates. 'Arturo Herrera' the pro-war candidate and is initially stronger in the polls, he provides an attack bonus on winning. 'Miguel Moralas' intends to instigate legalization of the drugs market, the game's dynamic changes dramatically when he comes into power as the street price will consistently drop meaning the cartels can no longer make as much money from the drugs trade. Elections screen = Skirmish Mode = Skirmish Mode is identical to Story Mode except that any game dynamics relating to the elections and street price are removed. This allows players to have a more balanced game without being so concerned with the economic/political factors the Story Mode is trying to draw attention to. This mode is locked until Story Mode has been completed at least once. = Multiplayer = This is a local multiplayer mode that allows players to take turns by passing a single device between them. As opposed to playing as the Police players now play as different cartels. They no longer have to combat corruption and so the 'Internal Affairs' ability is replaced with 'Bribe', this allows a player to effectively buy off units from enemy territory that is anywhere on the map for an inflated price. = Newsgaming and educational aspects = The game has a number of devices it uses to inform the player about the current war on drugs. *Each region has a blurb about how the area is effected by the ongoing war when it is selected. *The Corruption dynamic is designed to emphasize the problems Mexico has with the player constantly having to spend money to keep their units faithful to the cause. \\"NarcoGuerra simulates this effect with a rising meter that shows the spread of corruption throughout your police force. If it gets too high, you'll start losing units as they defect to the cartels.\\" *The missions and events given to the player are based on real news articles and information gathered from a number of sources including the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. *The AI of the cartels becomes more aggressive when they are in need of resources and will ignore the Police if they do not interfere with their operations. *The street price dynamic is key to the message of the game. By destroying the cartels and lowering the territory they control the street price naturally rises as illegal narcotics become more scarce and people are willing to pay a higher premium to acquire them, or take larger risks in supplying them. This results in the cartels being able to fight back harder and stronger whenever they are beaten back and a stalemate naturally arises. Development NarcoGuerra is Game the News first release. Tomas Rawlings, the lead designer, said: \\"The game is the biggest newsgame we've created, which has taken a lot of time effort and expense\\". \\"We've built a simulation based on our research about the reality of the War on Drugs, [the game shows] how corruption and street price ebb and flow with police actions.\\" The developers claim that basing the game on Risk was a deliberate attempt to draw attention to how one can not solve a social problem through militaristic means. \\"The gamer way to understand war is through games like Risk. You're presented with something that seems like a strategy game that you can charge ahead and win at. And of course, you find out it's a bit harder than you thought it was going to be. Because actually, it isn't a war on drugs. And that's the point.\\"  Reception  The reception was positive for the game. The Guardian stated: \\"Game the News is one of the more interesting indie game developers working at the moment\\" and ABC news reported \\"This gives users an idea of what the real drug war is like.\\" GGSGamer considered it to be \\"an interesting, illuminating and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì fun game. I can honestly say I walked away with a new understanding of the conflict and an appreciation for the dire situation facing anyone charged with combating the cartels.\\"  References   External links  * Category:Strategy video games Category:Mexican drug war Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in Mexico Category:Windows games ","title":"NarcoGuerra"},{"id":"40058692","text":"Lomidze () is a Georgian surname.

The film stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Michael Pe√±a, Dougray Scott, Djimon Hounsou, Peter Andersson, Kathleen Robertson, and John Patrick Amedori, and was released on July 24, 2015, by Lionsgate. Plot In the Vatican, Vicar Imani (Djimon Hounsou) shows Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson) the case of Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor Dudley), a young American woman who is suspected of harboring an evil spirit. Three months earlier in the United States, Angela is given a surprise birthday party by her father, Roger (Dougray Scott), and boyfriend, Peter \\"Pete\\" Smith (John Patrick Amedori). She accidentally cuts herself and is rushed to the hospital, where she briefly meets Father Lozano (Michael Pe√±a). She is injected with a serum that causes an infection; at home, she experiences a seizure and is placed under care at a hospital. A few days later, she is released, but in the taxi on the way home, she violently grabs the wheel, causing an accident that puts her in a coma for 40 days. Just as her life support is about to be switched off, she comes round, seemingly in perfect health. However, Angela begins to show symptoms of demonic possession when she almost drowns a baby, followed by forcing a detective to commit suicide. Lozano sends her to a psychiatric hospital. A distraught Roger confesses that Angela's mother was a prostitute; she was pregnant just a few months after Roger met her before she abruptly left, implying that Roger merely adopted Angela. Angela's possession becomes worse; she taunts her psychiatrist, Dr. Richards (Kathleen Robertson), eventually culminating in her speaking in Aramaic that induces hysteria and mass suicide in her fellow patients. Deciding that nothing can save her, the hospital releases her. The movie returns to present day. Bruun concludes that Angela is possessed by the Antichrist due to the presence of the crows around her, which are agents of Satan, and instructs Imani to stay back while he heads to the United States to cure her. An exorcism he plans involves a Eucharist, where Angela reacts by vomiting blood and spitting three eggs, meant to symbolize a perverted Trinity. Bruun also comments that her birth from a prostitute perverts the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Bruun then realizes that the Antichrist is already a part of Angela; killing him would mean Angela's death as well. Just after Bruun kills Angela, she rises up as the resurrected Antichrist, mirroring the Resurrection of Jesus, and kills Bruun, Roger, and Pete. She spares Lozano and tells him to inform the Vatican that the Antichrist is roaming the Earth. Three months later, Lozano, having been released from the hospital, visits the Vatican and is allowed access to the archives by Imani. He is shown footage of what has happened since: Angela returns as the only \\"survivor\\" of the exorcism besides Lozano and is now performing miracles to gather followers. The film ends with her entering a large room to greet her followers by stretching out her arms.

Cohen Jr. (born September 30, 1789, in Richmond, Virginia; died April 6, 1869, in Baltimore, Maryland) was a banker, railroad executive, and civic leader who helped win for Jews the right to hold public office in Maryland. Biography Sources differ on some details of his early life. The 1912 History of the Jews in America says his father was \\"Jacob J. Cohen\\", who emigrated from Rhenish Prussia to the American colonies in 1773, fought in the Revolutionary War, and died in 1808. The Maryland State Archives gives his father's name as \\"Israel I. Cohen\\", who died in 1803. The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia says that the elder Jacob was the older brother of Israel, who followed him from Oberdorf, near N√∂rdlingen, Bavaria, to Richmond in 1787, and there became the father of Jacob I. Cohen Jr. All agree that after the elder Cohen died, his widow, Judith Solomon Cohen (1766-1837), moved her six surviving children, all sons, from Richmond to Baltimore, where the family came to have sizeable influence. Jacob and at least one of his brothers served with distinction in the defense of the city during the War of 1812. In 1812, Cohen and his brothers founded Cohen's Lottery and Exchange Office, which became one of Baltimore's foremost lottery brokers, with branches in several other East Coast cities. Cohen brought each of his five brothers into business with him, and the arrest of two of them, Philip J. Cohen and Mendes J. Cohen, on charges of selling National Lottery tickets in Virginia led to a major U.S Supreme Court decision in Cohens v. Virginia.Jean Edward Smith, John Marshall: Definer Of A Nation, New York: Henry Holt & Company, 1996, pp. 456-459 In 1820, Cohen's house on North Charles Street became the first private house in Baltimore to be lit with gas. In the early 1820s, Cohen and Solomon Etting (1764-1847) led the fight for the \\"Jew Bill,\\" which, when passed in 1825 by Maryland's General Assembly, altered the state's Test Act to allow members of the Jewish faith to hold public office upon swearing to a belief in \\"the doctrine of reward and punishment\\" rather than the generally required declaration of belief in Christianity. After the bill was passed, Cohen and Etting both ran successfully for Baltimore City Council in 1826, becoming the first Jews to hold elected office in Maryland. In 1830, he helped establish the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, serving as its secretary and treasurer for eight years. He was also a member of the Baltimore City Commissioners of Finance. Also in 1830, Cohen and his brothers partners established J. I. Cohen Jr. & Brothers' Banking House, which would be one of the few banks to survive the Panic of 1837. In the mid-1830s, Cohen became a director of the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad (on October 12, 1835) and of the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, two companies chartered by the state of Maryland to build a railroad that would link Baltimore with cities to the northeast. On January 22, 1838, he succeeded Lewis Brantz as president of the B&PD; after Brantz's sudden death. Within months, both railroads merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, which thenceforth operated the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (This main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) Cohen became a vice- president of the PW&B; on February 20, 1838. He resigned the position on January 1, 1842, to reduce company expenses, and later in the month took a position on the southernmost of three new executive committees set up to manage the railroad. Cohen's service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Unmarried and leaving no children, Cohen died in Baltimore on April 6, 1869.

He was as a senior features writer for the New Musical Express from 1975 to 1981 where under tutelage of editor Neil Spencer he and other journalists were said to have re-written the book on music journalism. The period Chris spent at NME is regarded by some as a 'Golden Age of Music Journalism', where, fuelled by the punk rock explosion the whole genre changed into a complex revolutionary socio economic critique rather than the fan club style journalism of the previous decades. Along with other NME alumni (Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill) of that period, Chris's work soon found its way into serious mainstream publications the Sunday Times, the Independent, the Daily Telegraph, Conde Nast Traveller, Q, Mojo and Time Out, he also wrote for The Face magazine. Salewicz's time at the NME helped him forge a unique relationship and friendship with two men who would reshape music in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: Joe Strummer (of the Clash) and Bob Marley. His journeys with these two men from Trenchtown Ghetto, Jamaican Gun Court to Zimbabwean independence, from Maida Vale Squat to Groucho Club to the search for Garcia Lorca's bones in Andaluc√≠a, continued to redefine music journalism. As his subjects influence expanded beyond musical spheres Salewicz's writing and subsequent books on Joe Strummer (Redemption Song) and Bob Marley (The Untold Story) would also expand beyond the music into what made Joe and Bob political and cultural icons. 1995 he and film director Don Letts moved to Jamaica for two years to develop film ideas. Drawing on extensive research, Salewicz embarked on the writing of Third World Cop the most successful film ever in the Caribbean when it was released in 1999. Salewicz is the author of fifteen books, including the acclaimed Rude Boy: Once Upon a Time in Jamaica; Redemption Song: the Definitive Biography of Joe Strummer,www.nytimes.com an exhaustive, epic biography of the Clash frontman, and Bob Marley: The Untold Story.

In 2013, she qualified for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships, selected for the T38 100m and 200m. She took the gold in the 100m sprint, setting a new world record. In 2018, she won the gold medal in the T38 100 metres for women at the Commonwealth Games; in doing so she became the first female track and field athlete to hold gold medals in the same event from the World Championships, Paralympic Games, European Championships and Commonwealth Games, mirroring in parasports the achievements of fellow Paralympian Dan Greaves, and Olympic champions Daley Thompson, Linford Christie, Sally Gunnell, Jonathan Edwards and Greg Rutherford from BBC.co.uk/sport Career history Hahn, who has cerebral palsy, came into athletics at the age of 15. Enthused by the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, her older brother, knowing of her pace as a runner encouraged her to seek an athletics club. Her mother got in touch with her nearest club and Hahn was called in for trials and accepted by coach Joseph McDonnell. Her first competitive races occurred in 2013, and in the Charnwood Athletics warm up she took the 100m and 200m races. After entering several tournaments in June, she broke onto the British sprinting scene by taking first place at the England Athletics Senior Disability Championships, winning both 100m (13.27s) and 200m (27.88s). Selected for the IPC World Championships in Lyon in the T38, Hahn was entered in both the 100m and 200m in the T38 classification. On 21 July, she won her qualifying heat of the 200m with a time of 27.56. In the final she was beaten by Brazil's Ver√¥nica Hip√≥lito, but held on to take the silver medal. On 23 July she qualified for the 100m sprint, this time coming in second. The next day, on the final, Hahn ran a world record time of 13.10s, beating Hipolito into second place. Hahn won the 100m as the only athlete starting from a standing position. In May 2014, Hahn's world record was broken by Russia's Margarita Goncharova. However, just 24 hours later, Hahn broke it back in Loughborough taking her personal best down to 13.04 in the process. In her first ever IPC European Championships, Hahn won three silver medals in Swansea. The Loughborough-based athlete finished narrowly behind Goncharova in the 100m and the 400m ‚Äì only her second run over the distance. The quartet of Olivia Breen, Bethany Woodward, Hahn and Jenny McLoughlin were narrowly edged out by the Russian team in the T35-38 4 √ó 100 m, but set a national record of 53.84 in the process. In 2018, Hahn had her impairment classification questioned by the father of a rival, Olivia Breen. At a Parliamentary select committee, Michael Breen claimed Hahn had been misclassified and was getting an unfair advantage.
