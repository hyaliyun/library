The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 89 but while this differentiated Chechens from their neighbors more recently, it was not the case in the Middle Ages when Simsir existed. In the Middle Ages, Chechen societies such as Simsir had a hierarchical and pyramidal structure. The Principality of Simsir's prince (the eela) sat at the top, followed by nobility and vassals (uzden), followed by free commoners (halxoi), followed by servants (yalxoi, including gharbashash, i.e. bond women), followed by serfs (lesh, lai in the singular), with only slaves and war captives (yiisarsh) beneath them; additionally, clerics were placed in the uzden nobility class.Akhmadov, Ya.

The Chechens. Page 34. The time of tribute to the Golden Horde is thought by Amjad Jaimoukha to be the origin of the custom of \`amanat, whereby the children of nobles were given as pledged hostages. Such children were sent to the Khanate's court, where they learned the Mongol language, and they could be put to death or enslaved if the Golden Horde desired. This custom later became associated with the giving of hostages to cement pledges across the North Caucasus.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 137  Destruction by Timurlane  In the reign of its last ruler, Gayur Khan, the Principality of Simsir was destroyed by Timurlane in 1390 as part of his campaign against the Golden Horde. Its population fled south, into the mountains, in order to escape the attacks of the Mongols.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens.

Biography Marion Clinch Calkins was born on July 15, 1895, in Evansville, Wisconsin, the daughter of Julia Clinch and Judson Wells Calkins. After graduation from the University of Wisconsin in 1918, Calkins worked in a Milwaukee artillery shell packing plant, before returning to her alma mater to teach English and art history. Around this time, Calkins entered the annual poetry competition held by the Nation, submitting her poem ¬ìI Was a Maiden¬î under the name of Clinch Calkins because she wanted her authorship to be gender neutral. Oswald Garrison Villard, the editor, awarded the poem third prize but did not publish it for fear that its content was too avant garde and would cost the magazine its mailing privileges. The poem was eventually published together with Calkins¬í early collected verse in Poems (1928). Calkins¬í poetry, as well as humorous rhymes under the name Majollica Wattles, was published in The New Yorker; and her short stories appeared in Town and Country Magazine. During the mid-twenties, Calkins lived in New York City working as a vocational counselor and social worker at Lillian Wald¬ís Henry Street Settlement. In 1927, Calkins worked with art historian Richard Offner (1889-1965) in Florence, Italy, on what would become his magnum opus the Critical and Historical Corpus of Florentine Painting. Although Calkins considered poetry to be her favorite literary medium, her most critically acclaimed book was Some Folks Won¬ít Work (1930), a seminal document on the Depression, based on 300 individual case histories of the effects of unemployment. Published a year following the Wall Street Crash, the book received accolades on the front page of the New York Times Book Review, and brought Calkins national attention along with an invitation from Harry Hopkins to work with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Calkins traveled across country reporting on socio-economic conditions and ghost- writing for Hopkins. In 1936, Calkins worked for Senator Robert La Follette¬í's Civil Liberties Committee which investigated workers¬í union civil rights. Calkins wrote the committee¬ís report and expanded her observations in Spy Overhead (1937), the first book to examine labor movement sabotage and industrial espionage. During the thirties, Calkins also became friends and worked closely with Henry Alsberg, director of the Federal Writers¬í Project. Other works of social commentary included the verse drama, State Occasion written in 1939 in response to American fascism. The play was optioned in 1943 by Broadway producer Lee Simonson, but was not performed until 1946, when it was produced and directed by Alan Schneider at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. Following the Second World War, Calkins devoted much of her time assisting on a biography of the wireless and telegraph inventor Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), authored by his daughter Degna. Calkins¬í poetry continued to be published in the Botteghe di Oscure, and in a second collection, Strife of Love in a Dream (1965). She also published two novels satirizing the local Washington pastime of fox-hunting and socialite lifestyle: Lady on the Hunt (1950), and Calendar of Love (1952). In 1929, Clinch Calkins married Charles Marquis Merrell, the grandson of Jacob Spencer Merrell, founder of J.S. Merrell Drug Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The business was later operated by the latter¬ís son George until it was sold to McKesson and Robbins. Mark Merrell headed the drug industry division of the National Recovery Act (NRA). Calkins resided in McLean, Virginia, until her death on December 26, 1968.

Later, he moved to Oil City, Pennsylvania, where with Capt. J. J. Vandergrift, he established the Oil City Trust Co., of which Forman was president for a time.\\"Manufacturer's & Traders National Bank\\" on the left and \\"Fidelity Trust Company\\" on the right, 1916 Business career While a resident of Olean, New York, and a member of the Exchange National Bank of Olean, Forman organized the Eastern Oil Co. incorporated in West Virginia. He then came to Buffalo, New York, to be president of the company. In May 1893, Forman, along with John J. Albright, John Satterfield, and Franklin D. Locke, founded the Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company of Buffalo, New York, of which he became president. In 1909, E. B. Green was commissioned to build the Fidelity Trust Building, today known as Swan Tower and owned by Ellicott Development Co., located at 284 Main Street in Buffalo. Forman, a very punctual man, according to Anson Goodyear, \\"every morning left his house at a certain hour and met George Williams at his house just above North Street, to walk to the Fidelity Building together. Mr. Forman boasted a very prominent corporation and leaned backward to achieve his balance. Mr. Williams was emaciated and bent forward to achieve his. It was a procession on which people checked their watches.\\" In December 1925, a few years after his death in 1922, the Fidelity Trust Company, with $35 million in assets, merged with Manufacturers and Traders Bank, founded in 1856, with $64 million in assets, under the new name Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. The $100-million company was headed by Fidelity's president, 36-year-old Lewis G. Harriman. Harriman and a group of investors including A. H. Schoellkopf, from the founding family of the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company, and James Forrestal, who would become the first United States Secretary of Defense, owned enough shares to control both Fidelity and M&T.; Personal life Forman was married to Martha Carter (1849‚Äì1931), also from New Jersey, with whom he had three children. *Howard Arter Forman (1870‚Äì1931), who married Georgia M. Green (1871‚Äì1955), daughter of George C. Greene, was the general counsel for the Lake Shore Railroad. Howard served as vice president of Eastern Petroleum, and during World War I, he was the federal fuel administrator for Buffalo. After the war, Georgia and he separated, and by the early 1920s, he had moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he died in 1931. Georgia served for more than a decade on the board of managers of Children's Hospital and was a contributor to the Room of Contemporary Art at the Albright Art Gallery. *George Alfred Forman (1875‚Äì1923), who married Lucie Hatter (b. 1883), was the founder, president, and principal stockholder of Southwestern Petroleum Company, a West Virginia corporation with offices in Buffalo; he was reportedly worth $5 million () when he died about the steamer Berengaria as the liner was about to dock at Plymouth, England, in 1925. After George's death, his widow remarried Harry Blanchard Spaulding (1881‚Äì1955), grandson of Elbridge G. Spaulding. *Mary Martha Forman married Anson Goodyear (1877‚Äì1964), the son of Charles W. Goodyear, on June 29, 1904. He was president of the Great Southern Lumber Company, vice president of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, and helped establish the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, of which he was the first president (1929‚Äì39), as well as a member of the board of trustees. The marriage ended in divorce. Forman died on October 22, 1922, and is buried at Mount View Cemetery in Olean, New York. =Residence= Forman Residence on Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, New YorkForman Residence on Delaware Avenue (when it was owned by Oliver Cabana Jr.) In 1893, Forman built the beaux arts classical mansion, now known as the Forman-Cabana House, for his family at 824 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo in the present day Delaware Avenue Historic District. The home was designed by Green & Wicks with E. B. Green serving as the principal designer. The home is fronted by prominent columns and features yellow Roman brick, and the round arched front entrance has flanking paired fluted Ionic pilasters. Today, the residence is home to Child and Family Services and the Stanley G. Falk School, which is located in the carriage house.

It is a widespread marine phytoplankton and can function at a wide range of temperatures (eurythermal) and salinities (euryhaline). Members of this genus live in the open ocean, as well as in sea ice. It has a polymorphic life cycle, ranging from free-living cells to large colonies. The ability to form a floating colony is one of the unique attributes of Phaeocystis - hundreds of cells are embedded in a polysaccharide gel matrix, which can increase massively in size during blooms. The largest Phaeocystis blooms form in the polar seas: P. pouchetii in the north and P. antarctica in the south. This intense Phaeocystis productivity generally persists for about a three-month period, spanning most of the summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Phaeocystis-abundant ecosystems are generally associated with commercially important stocks of crustaceans, molluscs, fish and mammals. Phaeocystis may have negative effects on higher trophic levels in the marine ecosystem, and consequent impacts on human activities (such as fish farming and coastal tourism), by forming odorous foams on beaches during the wane of a bloom. The ability to form large blooms and its ubiquity make Phaeocystis an important contributor to the ocean carbon cycle. In addition, Phaeocystis produces dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a key player in the sulfur cycle.Stefels, J., Van Boekel, W.H.M., 1993.

Red fluorescence is chlorophyll autofluorescence and allows observation of the altered morphology of Phaeocystis chloroplasts. Green fluorescence corresponds to LysoTracker dye, which stains digestive compartments. Symbionts are not being digested. Free- living forms of Phaeocystis are globally distributed and occur in a variety of marine habitats, including coastal oceans, open oceans, polar seas and sea ice.Thomsen, H.A., Buck, K.R., Chavez, F.P., 1994. Haptophytes as components of marine phytoplankton., In: Green, J.C., Leadbeater, B.S.C. (Eds.), The Haptophyte Algae. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK, pp. 187‚Äì 208. Seven species are currently assigned to the genus: P. antarctica, P. jahnii, P. globosa, P. pouchetti, P. scrobiculata (not in culture), P. cordata, and P. rex. Three species (P. globosa, P. pouchetii, and P. antarctica) are associated with bloom formation in nutrient-rich areas,Lancelot, C., Keller, M.D., Rousseau, V., Smith Jr., W.O., Mathot, S., 1998. Autecology of the marine haptophyte Phaeocystis sp., In: Anderson, D.M., Cembella, A.D., Hallagraeff, G.M. (Eds.), Physiological Ecology of Harmful Algal blooms, vol. 41. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 209‚Äì224. which can occur either naturally (e.g. in the Ross Sea, Greenland Sea or the Barents Sea) or due to anthropogenic inputs (e.g. in the Southern Bight of the North Sea or the Persian Gulf). Generally, P. globosa blooms in temperate and tropical waters, whereas P. pouchetii and P. antarctica are better adjusted to the cold temperatures prevailing in Arctic and Antarctic waters, respectively. However, P. pouchetii also tolerates warmer temperatures and has been seen in temperate waters. Genome comparison has shown that the RUBISCO spacer region (located in the plastid DNA, between two subunits of the enzyme 1,5 -bisphosphate carboxylase) is highly conserved among closely related colonial Phaeocystis species and identical in P. antarctica, P. pouchetii and two warm-temperate strains of P. globosa, with a single base substitution in two cold-temperate strains of P. globosa. Phaeocystis can exist as either free-living cells or colonies. Free-living cells can show a variety of morphologies, depending on the species. All species can exist as scaled flagellates, and this is the only form that has been observed for P. scrobiculata and P. cordata. Three species have been observed as colonies (P. globosa, P. pouchetii and P. antarctica) and these can also exist as a flagellate devoid of scales and filaments. In colonies of Phaeocystis, the colony skin may provide protection against smaller zooplankton grazers and viruses. While suspected in other species (P. pouchetii and P. antarctica), a haploid-diploid life cycle has only been observed in P. globosa. In this cycle, sexual reproduction is dominant in colony bloom formation/termination, and two types of vegetative reproduction exist.  Impacts on global ocean  The genus Phaeocystis is a major producer of 3-dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Biogenic DMS contributes approximately 1.5√ó1013 g sulfur to the atmosphere annually and plays a major part in the global sulfur cycle, which can affect cloud formation and, potentially, climate regulation.  Symbiosis  Phaeocystis species are endosymbionts to acantharian radiolarians. Acantharians collected in different ocean basins host different species of Phaeocystis has their dominant symbionts: P. antarctica is found as the primary symbiont to acantharians in the Southern Ocean and P. cordata and P. jahnii are among the dominant symbionts found in acantharians collected in warm oligotrophic regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans. In addition to the described Phaeocystis species, sequences belonging to the molecular clade Phaeo02 often make up a majority of symbiotic sequences recovered from acantharians in warm-water regions. Whether or not this symbiosis represents a true mutualism with both partners benefiting, is debated. Extreme cellular remodeling is observed in symbiotic Phaeocystis, including a drastic increase in chloroplast number and an enlarged central vacuole. This phenotypic change is probably induced by the host to increase photosynthetic output by symbionts, but if it renders symbiotic cells incapable of future cell- division, the symbiosis is a dead end for Phaeocystis. The symbiosis is ecologically relevant because it creates primary production hot spots in low- nutrient regions, but it remains to be determined how the symbiosis has affected Phaeocystis evolution.

She has performed internationally in many of the world's great opera houses. Life and career A native of Fort Collins, Colorado, Davidson is a graduate of Fort Collins High School. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Occidental College in 1959. She worked briefly as an elementary school music teacher before pursuing graduate studies in opera at Florida State University with Elena Nikolaidi. She attended the UCLA Summer Opera Program where she was a student of Jan Popper. She later studied with Irma McDaniels and Daniel Harris in Miami. Davidson made her professional opera debut in 1965 in the title role of Rossini's La Cenerentola with the Miami Opera. That same year she was engaged by the Metropolitan Opera National Company with whom she toured the United States in performances for the next two years. Among the roles she portrayed with the company was the title role in Benjamin Britten's The Rape of Lucretia. In 1967 Davidson won first prize in the Sofia International Opera Singers Competition. In 1969 she made her debut at the New York City Opera as Kontschakowna in Borodin's Prince Igor and made her first appearance at the San Francisco Opera as The Secretary in Menotti's The Consul. That same year she portrayed Sister Jeanne in the United States premiere of The Devils of Loudun at the Santa Fe Opera. In 1970 she returned to San Francisco to portray the title heroine in Bizet's Carmen (with Pl√°cido Domingo), and appeared at Philharmonic Hall as the First Angel in Mendelssohn's Elijah with the New York Philharmonic under conductor Lukas Foss. In 1971 Davidson made her debut at La Scala as Delilah to Pier Miranda Ferraro's Samson in Samson and Delilah. That same year she returned to the NYCO to portray Carmen to Michele Molese's Don Jos√© under conductor Julius Rudel in Tito Capobianco's production. She portrayed The Secretary again for her debuts at the Festival dei Due Mondi and the Spoleto Festival USA in 1972. In 1974 she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera as Carmen and was also seen at that house as Preziosilla in La forza del destino. In 1976 Davidson created the role of Hannah Bilby in the world premiere of Carlisle Floyd's Bilby's Doll at the Houston Grand Opera. That same year she made her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Clarice in The Love for Three Oranges and her debut with the Metropolitan Opera as Adalgisa in Norma (opposite Shirley Verrett). She returned to Chicago in 1978 to create the role of Sin in the world premiere of Penderecki's Paradise Lost, which was subsequently seen at La Scala. In 1979 she created the title role in Garland Anderson's Soyazhe at the Central City Opera. Engagements in leading roles with opera houses internationally followed, including the Baltimore Opera, the Bavarian State Opera, Dallas Opera, the Dutch National Opera, the Edmonton Opera, the Fort Worth Opera, Opera Guild of Greater Miami (Carmen, opposite Franco Corelli and Norman Treigle in his last Escamillo, 1973), the Liceu, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (Agnese di Hohenstaufen, with Leyla Gencer, conducted by Riccardo Muti, 1974), the New Orleans Opera (Carmen), the Sofia National Opera, the Op√©ra National de Lyon, the Seattle Opera, the Teatro di San Carlo, the Teatro Regio Turino, the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos, Tulsa Opera, and the Welsh National Opera among others.

After testing and prototyping in the North Sea they deployed their first full-scale prototype in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It ran into difficulty after two months and was towed to Hawaii for inspection and repair. In June 2019, their second prototype system was deployed. The organization conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic pollution. It was founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and Dutch origin who serves as its CEO. It has conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre, the Mega Expedition and the Aerial Expedition, and continues to publish scientific papers. Their ocean system consists of a floating barrier at the surface of the water in the oceanic gyres, that collects marine debris as the system is pushed by wind, waves and current, and slowed down by a sea anchor. The project aims to launch a total of 60 such systems, and they predict this capability could clean up 50% of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years from full scale deployment. In late October 2019, The Ocean Cleanup announced a new initiative, the Interceptor, to attack the trash problem closer to the source, with plans to prevent 80% of riverine trash coming from 1000 rivers worldwide.  History  Slat proposed the cleanup project and supporting system in 2012. In October, Slat outlined the project in a TED-talk. The initial design consisted of long, floating barriers fixed to the seabed, attached to a central platform shaped like a manta ray for stability. The barriers would direct the floating plastic to the central platform, which would remove the plastic from the water. Slat did not specify the dimensions of this system in the talk. = 2014 ‚Äì revisions = In 2014, the design was revised, replacing the central platform with a tower detached from the floating barriers. This platform would collect the plastic using a conveyor belt. The floating barrier was proposed to be 100 km long. In 2015, this design won the London Design Museum Design of the Year, and the INDEX: Award. = 2015 ‚Äì scale model tests = In 2015, scale model tests were conducted in controlled environments. Tests took place in wave pools at Deltares and MARIN. The purpose was to test the dynamics and load of the barrier, when exposed to currents and waves, and to gather data for continued computational modeling. = 2016 ‚Äì open sea tests = A 100-metre segment went through a test in the North Sea, off the coast of the Netherlands in the summer of 2016. The purpose was to test the endurance of the materials chosen and the connections between elements. The test indicated that conventional oil containment booms could not endure the harsh environments the system would face. They changed the floater material to a hard-walled HDPE pipe, which is flexible enough to follow the waves, and rigid enough to maintain its open U-shape. More prototypes were deployed to test component endurance. On May 11, 2017, The Ocean Cleanup announced the next step is to test their new drifting system in the North Pacific in 2017. = 2017 = In May 2017, significant changes to the design were made: * The dimensions were drastically reduced, from 100 km to . The Ocean Cleanup suggested using a fleet of approximately 60 such systems. * The seabed anchors were replaced with sea anchors, allowing it to drift with the currents, but moving more slowly. This allowed the plastic to \\"catch up\\" with the cleanup system. The lines to the anchor would keep the system in a U-shape. This design allows the system to drift to locations with the highest concentration of debris. * An automatic system for collecting the plastic was dropped. Instead, the system would concentrate the plastic before removal by support vessels. = 2018 = The Ocean Cleanup performed more scale model tests in 2018. The sea anchors were removed because the wind moved the system faster than the plastic. The opening of the U would face the direction of travel, which would be achieved by having the underwater screen deeper in the middle of the system, creating more drag. On September 9, 2018, System 001 (nicknamed Wilson in reference to the floating volleyball in the 2000 film Cast Away) deployed from San Francisco. The ship Maersk Launcher towed the system to a position 240 nautical miles off the coast, where it was put through a series of sea trials. When the tests were complete, it was towed to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch for real-world duty. It arrived on October 16, 2018, and was deployed in operational configuration. System 001 encountered difficulties retaining the plastic collected. The system collected debris, but soon lost it because the barrier traveled too slowly. In November, the project attempted to widen the mouth of the U by 60-70m but failed. In late December, mechanical stress caused an 18-meter section to detach. Shortly thereafter, the rig began its journey to Hawaii for inspection and repair. During the two months of operation, the system had captured some 2,000 kg of plastic. = 2019 = In mid-January 2019, the Wilson system completed its 800-mile journey and arrived in Hilo Bay, Hawaii. Ocean Cleanup planned to return the repaired system to duty by summer. In mid-June, after four months of work, the revamped system (001/B) was redeployed. This too failed. In August, the team announced that after trying multiple alternatives, a water- borne parachute attached to slow the boom and expanding the cork line used to hold the screen in place would be tested. In October it became clear that the new system successfully holds plastic, and even microplastics. The model is also more efficient and smaller, making offshore adjustments possible. Design thumbSide view of floating barrier thumbTop view of floating barrier (There are also nine lanterns situated every 100 metres along the barrier to provide visibility.) The system uses passive floating structures localized in the ocean gyres, where marine debris tends to accumulate. These structures act as a containment boom. The boom drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine debris. A solid screen underneath the floating pipe catches subsurface debris. The system requires no external energy. The first deployment, System 001, consisted of a long barrier with a wide skirt that hangs beneath it. It is made from HDPE, and consists of 50x12 m sections joined together. It was unmanned and incorporates solar-powered monitoring and navigation systems, including GPS, cameras, lanterns and AIS. The barrier and the screen mounting were produced in Austria by an Austrian supplier. In 2019 a string of inflatable buoys was installed across the system's opening, to increase its speed. This edition used simpler connections between the barrier and skirt, eliminated stabilizing structures and reduced the barrier size by two-thirds. Research = Oceanic expeditions = In August 2015, The Ocean Cleanup conducted its so-called Mega Expedition, in which a fleet of approximately 30 vessels, including lead ship R/V Ocean Starr, crossed the Great Pacific garbage patch and mapped an area of 3.5 million square kilometers. The expedition collected data on the size, concentration and total mass of the plastic in the patch. According to the organization, this expedition collected more data on oceanic plastic pollution than the last 40 years combined.Mega Expedition, Theoceancleanup.com. Vittu mit√§ paskaa. In September and October 2016, The Ocean Cleanup launched its Aerial Expedition, in which a C-130 Hercules aircraft conducted a series of aerial surveys of the Great Pacific garbage patch. The goal was specifically to quantify the amount of large debris, including ghosts nets in the patch. Slat stated that the crew saw a lot more debris than expected. The project released an app called The Ocean Cleanup Survey App, which enables others to survey the ocean for plastic, and report their observations to The Ocean Cleanup. = Scientific findings = In February 2015, the research team published a study in Biogeosciences about the vertical distribution of plastic, based on samples collected in the North Atlantic Gyre. They found that the plastic concentration decreases exponentially with depth, with the highest concentration at the surface, and approaching zero just a few meters deeper. A follow-up paper was published in Scientific Reports in October 2016. In June 2017, researchers published a paper in Nature Communications, with a model of the river plastic input into the ocean. Their model estimates that between 1.15 and 2.41 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the world's oceans every year, with 86% of the input stemming from rivers in Asia. In December 2017, they published a paper in Environmental Science & Technology about pollutants in oceanic plastic, based upon data from the Mega Expedition. They found that 84% of their plastic samples had at least one persistent organic pollutant in them exceeding safe levels. Furthermore, they found 180 times more plastic than naturally occurring biomass on the surface in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. On March 22, 2018, The Ocean Cleanup published a paper in Scientific Reports, summarizing the combined findings from the Mega- and Aerial Expedition. They estimate that the Patch contains 1.8 trillion pieces of floating plastic, with a total mass of 79,000 metric tonnes. Microplastics (< 0.5 cm) make up 94% of the pieces, accounting for 8% of the mass. The study suggests that the amount of plastic in the patch increased exponentially since 1970. In October 2019, when research revealed most ocean plastic pollution comes from Chinese cargo ships, an Ocean Cleanup spokesperson said: \\"Everyone talks about saving the oceans by stopping using plastic bags, straws and single use packaging. That's important, but when we head out on the ocean, that's not necessarily what we find.\\"  Funding  The Ocean Cleanup is mainly funded by donations and sponsors. As of November 2019 it has made a little over $35 million from sponsors including Salesforce.com chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter Thiel, Julius Baer Foundation and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup raised over 2 million USD with the help of a crowdfunding campaign in 2014.  Criticism  Criticisms and doubts about method, feasibility, efficiency and return on investment have been raised in the scientific community about the project. These include: * Devices closer to shore are easier to maintain, and would likely recover more plastic per dollar spent overall. * Cleanup on land is more efficient and less costly than cleanup in the ocean. * The device may not be robust enough to survive in the open sea. * The device could imperil sea life. *The approach by itself cannot solve the whole problem. Plastic in the oceans is spread far beyond the gyres; experts estimate that less than 5% of all the plastic pollution which enters the oceans makes its way into any of the garbage patches. Much of the plastic that does is not floating at the surface. * Marcus Eriksen et al. (2014) reported that 92% of marine plastic (by count) is smaller than microplastics and would escape the system.  Interceptor river clean-up  In late October 2019, The Ocean Cleanup introduced its new river Interceptor initiative to help clean oceans by reducing trash pollution input closer to the source ‚Äì rivers. Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating arms to direct floating waste into the collection conveyor, which dumps trash into dumpsters on a detachable barge below. When full, the collection stops until the barge is removed, emptied and returned to the Interceptor. The Interceptor project is similar to a smaller-scale local project called Mr. Trash Wheel developed in Maryland's Baltimore harbor. The first two Interceptor systems have been operating in Indonesia and Malaysia, with the next planned for Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. Contracts have been signed for Thailand, Honduras, Los Angeles County, expected to be deployed in 2020.

It is currently in the 9th arrondissement of Lyon and is part of the first belt of forts protecting Lyon. The fort is a sister fort to Fort de Caluire and Fort Duch√®re (both since demolished) and Fort Saint-Jean.  History  The fort of Loyasse on a postcard at the beginning of the 20th century. Built in 1836-1840 as a result of the July Revolution and resulting fears of an invasion of France by Austria, the fort of Loyasse was intended to protect the city from invaders from the east. This fort and the Fort de Vaise are located on the site of the former walled area of the Py. The invention in 1858 of rifled bores replaced Smooth-bore rifles, and extended the reach of projectiles to 2,500m. Then melinite replaced gunpowder in 1885, which increased the blast of explosions, and forts of the Loyasse generation become obsolete. The fort was used in World War I to house prisoners of war; during the Second World War it was occupied by the Germans. The fort was completely decommissioned by the military on October 15, 1947. Lyon acquired the land of the fort in 1949 at auction for 1,200,000 francs and used it as a roads department warehouse, a glacis, and allotment gardens still being cultivated today. The fort's underground galleries temporarily served as a mushroom farm. A barracks of the fort was demolished in the 1960s to expand the mont√©e de l'Observance, a city street; the trenchwork of the fort allowed construction of a boulevard linking the new district of l'Observance to the Vaise neighborhood in 1961.  Architecture  Unlike many other forts of the first belt, Loyasse is designed as a mountain fort: the glacis around the fort are very inclined. The fort consisted of two superimposed platforms along the slope: * on the lower part, the working face is composed of three bastions * on the upper part, there are two bastions and a cavalier * between the two levels were two barracks, storerooms, wells, latrines and a gunpowder magazine . The functional range of the Fort de Loyasse smooth-bore guns was 1,200m.

The cathedral is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, and it has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gozo since the formation of the diocese in 1864.  History  The Cittadella was initially a pre-historic settlement and later a Roman temple dedicated to Juno was developed, and the remains of this temple existed until the present day as part of the cathedral.\\"In Malta and Gozo\\". p. 96. Following the Christianization of Malta and Gozo, the temple was converted into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Later on, Byzantine church was probably built on the site of the temple, until it was destroyed while Malta was under Arab rule. The cathedral's fa√ßade Following the expulsion of the Arabs, another church was built. The earliest reference of a parish church within the Cittadella dates back to 1299, and it was enlarged over the course of the 15th and 16th centuries. The church was sacked by the Ottomans during the invasion of 1551, but was reopened by September 1554. It was damaged once again in the earthquake of 1693, and the decision was taken to demolish the old building and construct a new church instead. The nobleman Felice Axac was a major benefactor in the church's reconstruction. The foundation stone of the present church was laid down on 21 September 1697, and the building was designed by the Maltese architect Lorenzo Gaf√†. It was inaugurated on 14 August 1711, and was dedicated on 11 October 1716. The church was elevated to a cathedral when it became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gozo, which was established on 16 September 1864. The building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

This became the first environments recording, \\"The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore.\\" The record was unique for its extremely long playback times‚Äî30 minutes per side at 33 rpm‚Äîand could be played at any speed from 16 up to 45 rpm. \\"The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore\\" was one of the first commercially available releases edited with a mainframe computer and one of the earlier examples of commercial quadraphonic sound. In 1970, Teibel created an environmental sound installation for the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and in 1971, he began teaching a class in experimental recording techniques at The New School. In 1973, to demonstrate how magnetic tape could be manipulated, Teibel edited Richard Nixon‚Äôs August 15th speech to reveal that the president, in fact, had ‚Äúprior knowledge‚Äù of the Watergate break-in. In the subsequent years, Teibel performed as an expert witness for magnetic tape technology. In 1981, Teibel moved to Austin, Texas with his then-wife Rosanne. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Dara. In Austin, Teibel was involved in the local Jewish community. He lived there for 29 years until his death on October 28, 2010 at age 72. His brother Phil was a violinist with the Buffalo Philharmonic. Influence Over the years, Teibel's recordings attracted significant national and international attention from publications like The New York Times. Teibel claimed environments 6 was excerpted in the ‚ÄúSounds of Earth‚Äù audio collage aboard the Voyager Spacecraft‚Äôs Golden Record (this is still unverified). His work also appears in Terrence Malick‚Äôs Days of Heaven, credited as \\"special environmental sound recording,\\" and Errol Morris' Gates of Heaven as \\"environmental sound.\\" In 2013, his work appeared in Lise Raven's film Kinderwald. Music critic Robert Christgau described Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music as \\"Lou's answer to Environments\\" and Lester Bangs included environments 2 on his list of the \\"Ten Most Ridiculous Records of the Seventies.\\" Musicians Dominick Fernow and Mica Levi have also listed environments LPs of among their favorite recordings. Outside magazine included environments 1 on their list of \\"The Top 10 Field Recordings.\\" The album cover for the drone metal group Earth's album Earth 2 is an homage to the environments 2 CD with its \\"special low frequency version\\" message. Atlas Obscura has described Teibel as \\"a forgotten 1970s-era hippie polymath.\\" They go on to explain his lasting influence: \\"If you flip on a waterfall to fall asleep, if you keep rainymood.com in your bookmarks, if you associate well- being with the sound of streams and crickets or wonder why the beach never quite sounds as tranquil as you imagine, it's because of Teibel.\\" Pitchfork elaborates on the novelty of Teibel's work: \\"Now, Teibel‚Äôs concept‚Äîthe soothing sounds of nature, or at least a synthesized facsimile of it‚Äîis quaint, the wallpaper of therapy waiting rooms and spa foyers. At the time, it was entirely new.\\" They go on to explain the complicated place Teibel's work inhabits in the history of field recording and music: \\"Here was nature not as it is, but as we hope it‚Äôll be, the lullaby of waves without the sand in our trunks.\\" In February 2018, the Chicago reissue label Numero Group re-released Teibel's original recordings as an ambient sound app for iOS devices.

Virginia, which invalidated state laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The film was produced by Big Beach and Raindog Films, and distributed by Focus Features. The film takes inspiration from The Loving Story (2011) by Nancy Buirski, a documentary which follows the Lovings and their landmark case. The film was directed by Jeff Nichols, who also wrote the screenplay. Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton co-star as Mildred (n√©e Jeter; July 22, 1939 ‚Äì May 2, 2008) and Richard Loving (October 29, 1933 ‚Äì June 29, 1975). Marton Csokas, Nick Kroll, and Michael Shannon are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography began in Richmond, Virginia, on September 16, 2015, and ended on November 19. The locations used for Loving were mainly based in Richmond, also in King and Queen County, Caroline County, Central Point, and Bowling Green. Loving began a limited release in the United States on November 4, 2016, before a wide release on November 11, 2016. The film received positive reviews, and was named one of the best films of 2016 by several media outlets. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for numerous awards, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor for Edgerton and Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Negga. Plot Richard Loving, a white construction worker in Caroline County, Virginia, falls in love with a local black woman and family friend, Mildred Jeter. Upon Mildred discovering that she is pregnant, they decide to marry, but knowing that interracial marriage violates Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws, they drive to Washington, D.C. to get married in 1958. Richard makes plans to build a house for Mildred less than a mile from her family home. Soon afterward, sheriff's deputies raid Mildred's home and arrest the Lovings. When Richard points to the marriage license, Sheriff Brooks curtly tells him that it has no validity in Virginia and hauls them both to jail. They plead guilty to breaking the anti-miscegenation law and are sentenced to one year in prison. However, the judge suspends the sentence, on condition that they not return to Virginia together for at least 25 years. The Lovings move to Washington to stay with a friend of Mildred. They briefly return to Caroline County so their first child, Sidney, can be delivered by Richard's mother, a midwife. Arrested again, they are cleared when their lawyer informs the judge he erroneously advised them they could return. Mildred and Richard have two other children together, Donald and Peggy. However, Mildred grows frustrated by being away from the country, and her frustration grows when she watches the March on Washington. She writes to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help. Kennedy refers them to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyer Bernard S. Cohen takes the case and confers with constitutional law expert Phil Hirschkop. They conclude that the Lovings' ordeal has a good chance of going all the way to the Supreme Court ‚Äì and overturning similar anti-miscegenation laws across the nation. After a minor auto accident involving one of their children, the Lovings decide to slip back into Virginia, settling in a remote portion of King and Queen County while their case moves through the courts. Their case gains wide attention, and is profiled in Life magazine by photographer Grey Villet. The state contends that people of different races were never intended to live together, and goes as far as to suggest the Lovings' children are bastards. The state Supreme Court refuses to set aside the Lovings' conviction. Undeterred, Cohen and Hirschkop appeal to the federal Supreme Court. Before going to Washington, Cohen asks Richard if he has a message for the justices. Richard replies, \\"Tell the judge I love my wife.\\" Several weeks later, the Supreme Court unanimously holds that laws prohibiting interracial marriage are unconstitutional. The film ends with the Lovings back in Caroline County, building their dream house which Richard began designing at the opening of the film. Over a wide shot showing family and friends at work, text informs the viewer that Richard was killed in a car accident seven years later; Mildred never remarried and continued to live in the house Richard built for her until her death in 2008. The last line of text is a quote from the widowed Mildred. Cast * Joel Edgerton as Richard Loving :A taciturn, white-blonde Virginian bricklayer, and the husband of Mildred. On the character of Richard, Nichols stated, \\"[Richard] speaks in a clipped manner, then it's the way he holds his head in front of the rest of the body, how self-conscious he seemed in front of the camera. He'd laugh and quickly cover his lips over his [tobacco-stained] teeth. He's a bricklayer ... they're hunched over all day long, and they turn their bodies into these assembly lines for laying brick. What I gave [Edgerton], in terms of coherent character on the page, he added specificity.\\" When describing Richard, Edgerton stated that he \\"... was a quiet hero, and sometimes quiet dignity speaks louder than the typical movie hero who's all too eager to fight.\\" He spoke of some of the challenges in portraying Richard, such as the Virginian accent, in which he stated, \\"The importance of the story itself, not to treat it with kid gloves but to maintain a reverence for the truth, for the responsibility we felt toward these real people. And conveying so much with so few words was one of the biggest challenges.\\" To capture the physical quality of Richard, Edgerton bleached his hair, adopted a receding hairline, and wore prosthetic teeth. He spoke of the influences in Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (1988), recommended by Nichols, which assisted in his finding of Richard's accent. He was drawn to Nichols' version of the character, as according to him he was: \\"just shut down and emasculated and weathered by this situation\\" while Edgerton noted the version was keeping more in line with the man in Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). Both Nichols and Edgerton felt the main challenge of bringing Richard to the screen was the question of where he fell on the intellectual spectrum, as Richard was not well educated nor naturally gifted, and may not have understood the case's complexities or its social ramifications, with both actor and director holding conversations on the subject. Edgerton spoke of Richard, the difficulty in holding an accent with a taciturn approach, while referring to roles of the past: \\"With a character like John Connolly of Black Mass (2015), you really get to fly on the rhythm of an accent, and the rhythm is so much a part of what an accent is. When you don't have much to say, it's hard to latch onto that cadence.\\" Edgerton also involved himself in bricklaying to prepare for the role, and while speaking of his experience he remarked that he began to fully understand Richard's posture: \\"Suddenly it made sense because of the mechanics of his work ... Here was a man who looked awkward in his own body because he was so used to conserving energy. A man who slumped because he spent his days hunched over a pile of bricks.\\" In an interview with People, Edgerton spoke of Richard and Mildred's daughter Peggy: \\"Peggy is as shy as her father and we were really just hoping for her acceptance and her blessing, which I think we got. One day on set she called me 'Daddy' and it was like the greatest blessing I've ever had.\\" * Ruth Negga as Mildred Loving :A sweet, soft-spoken young woman of black and Native American ancestry, whose marriage to Richard violated the state's anti-miscegenation law. During 2013, while preparing for Midnight Special, casting director Francine Maisler suggested Negga to Jeff Nichols and Sarah Green. Negga was the first person director Nichols auditioned for the role and he revealed that he thought she was too petite when he first met her, but her acting abilities changed his mind, wherein he stated, \\"She spoke in Mildred's voice. She held her mouth like Mildred ... I wasn't looking for star power. I was looking for great actors.\\" After she successfully auditioned for the role of Mildred, Nichols sent Negga excerpts of his yet-to-be-finished screenplay and a copy of Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). Of Negga's audition, Nichols stated, \\"Ruth had the voice, she had the posture, the facial expressions. It wasn't until after we were done and I started to speak with her that I realized she had an Irish accent ... She was Mildred. When she left the room I turned to [Green] and [Maisler] and said, 'Well, do we really have to see anyone else?'\\" On what attracted her to Nichols' film, and the part of Mildred, Negga stated, \\"I've never seen that kind of story told in this manner before. You know, the screenplay is so beautiful and I wanted very much to be part of that. Having become familiar with them, I think their story needs to be told and shared and honored and celebrated.\\" On the character of Mildred, Negga stated, \\"Mildred was the spine of the couple. She saw what maybe Richard didn't want to see, that they weren't going to get out of this by running away or putting their heads in the sand. She was a very astute woman. After those five days in jail, she realized that the fairy tale was over.\\" Negga spoke of the personal connection she felt to the Lovings' story, because of her own background as a mixed-race person. Nichols invited Negga and Edgerton to Virginia for two weeks to visit the various locations, do prep work, and visit special places related to Richard and Mildred, two weeks prior to post- production. Negga deeply identified with Mildred's sense of connection to a place, with her drawing comparisons to Limerick, Ireland and Richmond, Virginia, by her stating that: \\"Virginia isn't that different from Ireland ... Land and home and community are super important. When I was playing her, I tried to imagine I couldn't go home again because of whom I married. It must have drained the lifeblood from her.\\" On the unassuming couple, Negga stated, \\"They were poor, relatively uneducated. Mildred was a bit more educated than he was, but I think everyone else underestimated their tenacity, their belief in themselves, their love for each other, and their respect for each other.\\" In an interview with The Boston Globe, Negga spoke of having \\"already been gifted, personally\\" by playing Mildred and getting to know her surviving family, to which she later remarked, \\"She's my hero. But what's important is that people are coming out of this movie genuinely moved because what they see is kindness. In many ways, [Mildred] would have been uncomfortable [by the attention] but their legacy is important ... I think schoolchildren will know their names.\\" * Marton Csokas as Sheriff Brooks :A powerful local figure whom everybody in Caroline County knew and feared. One of the more difficult roles to cast was that of Sheriff Garnett R. Brooks, with Nichols himself not seeing Brooks as the bad guy of the story or even as a nemesis to the couple, noting that the lawman's beliefs about race and marriage were commonplace. Nichols explains: \\"I see Sheriff Brooks as being part of the equation ... Having grown up in Arkansas, I have family members that are racists. It's not something I'm proud of, but I understand how these attitudes are perpetuated, and that everyone sets, or has set, their own point of view.\\" He explains the beliefs of Brooks, in which he expands, \\"Brooks was quoted as saying 'a robin's a robin, a sparrow is a sparrow,' and he believed that. It was important that Brooks not be played as the slack-jacked and mean Southern sheriff stereotype.\\" Joel Edgerton suggested Marton Csokas for the role of Brooks. After meeting Csokas, Nichols was intrigued by his perspective on the part. He remembers, \\"Marton saw Sheriff Brooks as seeing himself as an adult dealing with wayward children. They were born and raised in a part of the South that didn't necessarily see the lines between color, and his stance was, God put those lines there.\\" For the role of Sheriff Brooks, Csokas pored over published records and spoke to family members, to which he remarked, \\"From the home perspective, here was a husband and father who was a hardworking, loyal, strict human being who loved his family and animals, and was a stickler for the law. The statements Sheriff Brooks makes are indicative of the status quo and what people believed. That was the law at the time. So he was doing his job to the nth degree, which is important to quantify.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Colin Firth spoke of the daughter of Sheriff Garnett Brooks, Betty Cwiklinski, offering her services while post-production took place, in the form of her father's old uniform, but it couldn't be used as it didn't fit Csokas. Firth stated that Cwiklinski said, \\"He was like that, he did say that stuff.\\" He concluded by mentioning her thoughts on her father: \\"She thought he was misguided but he was still a human being. And she made that stipulation. There's a real sense even among the locals to want to address that side of their history.\\" * Nick Kroll as Bernie Cohen :A young ACLU volunteer attorney who represents Richard and Mildred Loving. In 2014, while watching television in New Orleans during the filming of Midnight Special, Nichols was struck by the realization that Nick Kroll looked remarkably like Bernie Cohen, to which Nichols noted, \\"I went online and watched more of [Kroll], and began to envision him as a good fit for Bernie.\\" Nichols furthered his remark on his inspired choice of Kroll, \\"... Then you find out Jules Kroll went to Georgetown Law just like Bernie Cohen did. I don't know. It just started to make sense. He came to Austin to see me and talk about the part. Honestly, I just thought it was an inspired choice.\\" On the quality of Cohen, Nichols stated, \\"Bernie had this quality of performance ... It was like he was performing, but I also felt like it could happen in the scene where he first meets Richard and Mildred. There are no cameras in the room, but he is putting on a performance to persuade them that he is the right lawyer for their case, even if he isn't entirely sure of that himself. At the end of the scene, you see him sort of break character.\\" Kroll was not only familiar with the Lovings' story but also with Nichols' work, with him stating, \\"I'd seen Take Shelter and Mud, and thought they were phenomenal movies. They are quite different from one another and yet you can still feel the larger hand at work; [Nichols] has a very special touch that he brings to his films. It was exciting to get the call that I was being considered for LOVING, because of this filmmaker and this subject.\\" On taking the role of Cohen, Kroll began to remark, \\"The story of Richard and Mildred Loving is such a beautiful, important story about two people who love each other and that want to be together and were brave enough to go through the legal system to make that happen for themselves and in the end for millions of people ... So, in that regard, it seemed like something it would be an honour to be a part of.\\" Kroll highlighted his own numerous ties to the Loving case: \\"Weirdly, my father went to Georgetown Law school almost exactly when Bernie was going there ... And my dad actually worked for Robert F. Kennedy while he was in school: he worked at RFK's office and then actually ran his campaign in Queens when he was running for president. And I went to Georgetown. So I had a number of weird connections to the whole thing, including the fact that I've played a defense lawyer before, a very different kind of defense lawyer, in that Rodney Ruxin represented the worst people in the world.\\" In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kroll spoke of the presidential election, while stating, \\"I think a lot of people see hope in [Richard and Mildred Loving's story]. They see the power of the individual and their ability to make change in the country outside of the system.\\" * Michael Shannon as Grey Villet :A freelance photographer who is commissioned by LIFE Magazine to create a photo essay on the Lovings. Nichols sent Shannon the script, although the two hadn't spoken about what role he was potentially going to play. Nichols also mentioned that he didn't envision Shannon as portraying Richard Loving, to which he states, \\"... When I found these photos of this Life photographer, he was a tall guy‚Äìlike six foot four‚Äì and he kind of looked like Mike. And as you'll see when you see the film, he's kind of gregarious. And I'd seen Mike in this one man play called Mistakes Were Made ... And he was kind of gregarious in this play, and it's a side of him that not a lot of people have seen.\\" Nichols concludes by remarking of Shannon's Grey that \\"... he enters people's lives and very quickly has to ingratiate himself to them. Like he becomes their friend, so that he can take these really delicate photos.\\" Shannon spoke of being on set for one day, and of the fact his scenes were shot in order, wherein he stated, \\"... we shot the scene in the yard first. It was also the hardest to shoot because it started to rain, and then we kept stopping and starting.\\" He later explained that: [Nichols] wasn't sure whether to shoot it in the rain or not. Once we got to the dinner scene, that went fast. We did the couch scene, and I was done.\\" Loving marks the fifth collaboration between Shannon and Nichols. Additionally, Terri Abney is introduced as Garnet Jeter, the sister of Mildred; Alano Miller appears as Raymond Green, the best friend of Richard; Jon Bass appears as Phil Hirschkop, a Virginia civil rights lawyer, and associate of Bernie Cohen; Bill Camp appears as Frank Beazley, a former lawyer to the Lovings; David Jensen appears as Judge Bazile, the Caroline County judge who indicted the Lovings in 1958 for violating Virginia's Racial Integrity Act; Sharon Blackwood appears as Lola Loving, Richard's mother; Christopher Mann appears as Theoliver Jeter, Mildred's father; Winter-Lee Holland appears as Musiel Byrd-Jeter, the mother of Mildred; Michael Abbott Jr. appears as Deputy Cole, one of the law officers charged with arresting the couple; Chris Greene appears as Percy Fortune, a good friend of the Lovings, in particular, Richard; Will Dalton appears as Virgil, a very loyal friend to Richard.  Production  = Development = On April 6, 2009, while filming John Doyle's Main Street (2010) in Durham, North Carolina, Colin Firth had stumbled upon the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, before being introduced to filmmaker Nancy Buirski. Buirski herself had recently read the obituary of Mildred Loving in The New York Times, and spoke to Firth about her plans on making a documentary about the couple. Buirski had been in contact with Firth regarding a feature version of the story after learning of his interest in American politics and social history, to which Firth and herself began to brainstorm a narrative structure as well as beginning work on a screenplay. On January 25, 2011, Firth mentioned to Buirski that he was launching a production company, Raindog Films, with Ged Doherty, and had brought up a narrative version of The Loving Story (2011) to Doherty, to which Doherty remarked, \\"[Firth] was very taken with the simplicity of the story, with how this ordinary couple made a huge difference in the lives of other couples.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Firth spoke of his surprise as to how many had not known of Richard and Mildred's story. He also stated, \\"So I shared the idea with my friend [Doherty], who comes from the music industry, and that's what started us off as producers.\\" On April 29, 2011, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, Buirski's The Loving Story was shown at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, before a release of February 14, 2012, on HBO, to which it received universal acclaim. In June 2012, after watching Take Shelter (2011), producers Colin Firth, Ged Doherty and Nancy Buirski approached director Jeff Nichols, as they believed him to be the perfect writer and director for the project. He had been introduced to Buirski's documentary The Loving Story (2011), to which Nichols himself immediately found emotional and narrative attachments to Richard and Mildred, wherein he stated, \\"I walked away from that documentary with a really clear idea that I wanted to make a film that followed Richard and Mildred and stayed with their point of view.\\" Initially, Nichols was reluctant to write and direct the film, as he had never been commissioned to write a screenplay before. But he eventually agreed to write a script, which would be a strict blueprint for what he wanted to do, to which he later remarked: \\"This was on the heels of The Help (2011) ... There was a different movie to be made out of this story for sure, probably one that would be much more successful commercially.\\" Nichols underwent extensive research for Loving, such as meeting Peggy Loving, who is the only surviving child of the Lovings, going to all the locations relevant to the story, delving through footage including extended interviews, archival footage, and photographs from Buirski. On May 16, 2013, Screen International reported that in conjunction with Nancy Buirski at Augusta Films, Colin Firth's Raindog Films and Silver Reel are developing a feature film on Richard Loving and Mildred Loving, inspired by Buirski's documentary. Firth had initially toyed with the idea of writing the Loving, however, at Martin Scorsese's recommendation, who was eager to see The Loving Story (2011) turned into a feature, both Firth and Buirski hired Nichols. Nichols described Scorsese as \\"a shepherd of this project and wanted to see it made into a narrative film\\", and later laid out his approach in terms of trying to stay with the Lovings as much as possible through the telling of the story, something of which Scorsese was very supportive of. On May 8, 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that Jeff Nichols was boarding the project as director and will write the script, with Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga starring as Richard and Mildred Loving, respectively, the interracial couple at the center of the famous 1967 civil rights case Loving v. Virginia. On May 8, 2015, it was announced that Big Beach and Raindog films are to produce Nichols' piece, with producers including Sarah Green, Colin Firth, Ged Doherty, Nancy Buirski, Marc Turtletaub, and Peter Saraf. Prior to the production of Loving, director Nichols spoke briefly of his influence for the film, such as Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011), to which Nichols stated, \\"I was struck by the simplicity of The Loving Story, and I hope to make this a painfully beautiful film.\\" On September 22, 2015, Variety officially reported that Michael Shannon had been cast to play Grey Villet, the Life Magazine photographer who shot the iconic images of the Lovings in 1965, as well as Nick Kroll in an as-of-yet unnamed role. In addition to Shannon and Kroll, on September 22, 2015, Bill Camp, Marton Csokas, and Jon Bass were cast as Frank Beazley, Sheriff Brooks, and Phil Hirschkop, respectively. On May 16, 2016, Nichols, in an interview with Vox's Gregory Ellwood, spoke of when development on Loving first began four years ago, he thought the film would help influence the Supreme Court's debate over same-sex marriage, in which Nichols stated, \\"[After the verdict came in] there was this idea that it was all going to be taken care of, and of course it's not ... You have religious liberty laws added and you soon realize that the Supreme Court can only do so much. The letter of the law sometimes gets it right. But it takes a long time for society to get it right, and that is what has always been surprising to me. We never got over that hurdle, and maybe we never will.\\" Speaking at the press conference for the film in Cannes, on May 16, 2016, Negga spoke of her hopes that the issue addressed in the film will become part of a broader discussion. On May 20, 2016, during a Q&A; session at Cannes when asked of the film's focus, Nichols speaks of the topics of race and marriage inequality, wherein he states, \\"... the conversation about racism in the US is finally starting to get serious. That made me feel good that just by making this movie people are going to talk about inequality. Had I tried to make a movie that encompasses the civil rights movement, I would feel like a fraud.\\" On September 8, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that due to films like The Birth of a Nation (2016) and Loving (2016) dealing with issues of race at the Toronto International Film Festival, Canadian filmmakers have unveiled plans to promote better representation by 2020. On October 21, 2016, Nichols was interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter, to which he spoke of the film being an important subject matter, as well as stating it to be a \\"foundational part of our American history.\\" On November 5, 2016, in an interview with The Chicago Sun-Times, Edgerton expressed a passion for the film, wherein he stated, \\"I was very emotionally connected to it ... I mean as an audience member. Usually, it's a subjective thing watching your own movies. But this was different. I was standing back, happy about the ultimate Supreme Court decision, but I did feel a very deep anger.\\" He later concluded: \\"This is still happening today. Today, it's about same-sex couples getting married. What business is it of anyone but the two people involved?\\" On December 14, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that although Nichols' screenplay for Loving has been classified as an original screenplay by the Writers Guild of America, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had concluded that Loving should only be eligible to compete within the Best Adapted Screenplay category. =Filming= Principal photography for Loving took place in Richmond, Virginia. Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe announced, on May 14, 2015, that Virginia has been selected as the filming location for Jeff Nichols' Loving. On May 14, 2015, Andy Edmunds, director of the Virginia Film Office, confirmed that filming will take place from Caroline County, Virginia to Dinwiddie County, Virginia. As the piece will film in the central Virginia area, Loving will be eligible for a filming incentive, with the exact amount based on expenditures in Virginia and certain deliverables to promote tourism in the Commonwealth. On June 16, 2015, it was announced that Ged Doherty, Colin Firth, Nancy Buirski, Sarah Green, Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf were holding three casting calls open to people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds on June 25, June 27, and June 28, with over four-thousand people turning out. Principal photography was confirmed to have begun in Richmond, Virginia, with an original shooting schedule occurring from September 16 to October 27, 2015, albeit shooting was altered to finish on November 19, 2015. On September 19, 2015, it was confirmed that Loving would film numerous scenes at Union Hill in October and early November. On September 29, 2015, the Lawrenceville‚ÄìBrunswick Municipal Airport in Lawrenceville, Virginia was converted for drag strip scenes up until the period of September 30. Vintage cars from the 1950s were used and the stars and extras of the movie were dressed in period costumes for the scenes that were filmed, with over 125 people onsite during the two days of filming. On October 9, 2015, Bowling Green's Main Street had been transformed to resemble a scene from the late 1950s, with the production team blocking off Main Street and shooting in front of the original courthouse. On October 12, 2015, filming occurred outside 2201 E. Franklin Street, Richmond between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. On October 15, 2015, vintage vehicles were spotted in the area around Venable Street in Richmond. On October 28, 2015, filming had begun in Petersburg, with the main filming location occurring along Sycamore Street from Washington Street to Bank Street from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. On November 3, 2015, with filming occurring at the Museum District, Richmond, Virginia. On November 19, 2015, the final day of filming, shooting took place at Richmond Dragway in Sandston, Virginia and other locations across Virginia. Filming also took place in Ashland, Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Church Hill, Virginia Historical Society, Supreme Court of Virginia, Old City Hall, Crewe's Place in Charles City County, and Hopewell, Virginia, as well as scenes on private property in the localities of Ruther Glen, Prince George, Tappahannock, Hanover County and King William County. Principal photography was confirmed to have ended in Virginia on October 27, 2015, however, additional periods of shooting were added with filming being push up until November 19, 2015, while with post- production beginning subsequent to filming closure, and on April 1, 2016, still occurring during the press tour for Midnight Special. =Cinematography= Loving was shot on 35mm film with small Panavision Millennium XL2 cameras in a distributed aspect ratio of 2.35:1 by Adam Stone. For lenses, Stone used a specially-made anamorphic type built by Panavision to which he attributes part of the effectiveness for the high shot looking down on Richard, as he proposes to Mildred in a grassy field, to which Stone states, \\"We were a modestly budgeted movie and to have people like Dave Dodson and Dan Sasaki at Panavision reserve and tweak those lenses for us ‚Äì knowing they are in high demand for much bigger movies ‚Äì made all the difference.\\" He concludes by stating, \\"For that scene in particular, whatever you hit was the lens' sweet spot. They are so awesome.\\" Of the anamorphic format, Stone stated, \\"Anamorphic is how we shot Shotgun Stories (2007), it's how we shot Mud (2012), it's how we shot Midnight Special (2016), and now it's how we shot Loving.\\" Cinematographer Stone spoke of one of his favourite scenes in which Richard smuggles Mildred back into Virginia at night, in which she jumps out of one car and into another. Stone spoke of the car headlights and moonlight being the only true source of light on that road, in which he explained, \\"So we used bounced HMI's, and it balanced out nicely. We used some day-for-night driving shots at dusk, and could have benefited from an Alexa for POV's. But shooting with the actors at night [in a process car] on film was so much fun. We only had one Bebee [light].\\" Stone made comparisons to Mud (2012) in which he had at least five film stocks to choose from ‚Äì 50D to 250D, 100 to 500 tungsten and a Fuji 500 Daylight, whereas Loving shot with Vision 3 500T and 250D, in which he states, \\"That's pretty much all that's left nowadays, for better or worse. Of course the Vision stock is so well put together, you could shoot everything on 500T and it would still hold up great.\\" On why he prefers using film, as well as using it on Loving, Stone spoke of the format having a comfortability about it, as well as it feeling \\"like an organic format\\". As well as the Panavision XL2 with G Series anamorphic lenses, Stone employed the usage of a J.L. Fisher 10 dolly, a J.L. Fisher 23 jib arm, and a Mo-Sys Hot Head to put the film camera right over the actors as they moved about, in order to get closer to the actors. Stone remarked that, \\"It took a little adjusting to but over time we got pretty proficient shooting predominantly with that configuration.\\" He later explained, \\"We had to improvise when we got into smaller areas where we couldn't easily operate the camera but the overall effect was being just that much closer to the actors [particularly Negga and Edgerton] and their performances.\\" Stone wished for the camera to be moved, however, not wanting it to be Steadicam, as to be more online with the character. He explains that: \\"If an actor's moving at camera, we wanted to be straight on or [slightly] off axis. We used a dolly with a boom and a hothead for more stability.\\" Of his cinematographer, Nichols praised his artistry and hard work on Loving: \\"So many Southern-set films have an antique-y glow. We work against that. Mildred was in love with this countryside in Virginia, enough to leave her home in D.C. and live in hiding, in risk of arrest.\\" Nichols made mention of the fact that the audience had to feel how beautiful the area of Caroline County, Virginia was, albeit didn't want the film to feel \\"affected or sweetened\\". He concluded by stating, \\"[Stone] has worked on all five of my films, so we communicate via osmosis. But at some point we said, \\"We are not setting out to make a 'beautiful' film, but a film that supports the lives of these characters.\\"\\" =Design= Costume design Costume designer Erin Benach, who worked with Nichols previously on Midnight Special (2016), explained that for Loving she had a large amount of historical imagery, and rich material to sift through, including Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). She also spoke of wanting to extend her research via a regional search of people who were in that location at that time, wherein Benach stated, \\"What did people living there look like? What did they wear? You find all of that by looking through images of the place and the people as they were during that time.\\" Benach acknowledged the difficulties in portraying time passing in a naturalistic, authentic way, though remarks the subtly shift the fashion to which he adheres to as one wouldn't wish for \\"... the audience to be noticing the costume changes as they happen.\\" In preparation for Loving, Benach mapped out the years in the evolution of clothing, to which she states, \\"I wanted to know what the fashion of the time was but also what it would be based on where the characters in Loving ... were at any given moment.\\" For the design of Negga's Mildred, Benach at al pulled from a great many sources, using a photograph of the real Mildred in a black-and-white check dress and little jacket, of which Benach was determined to find, or create it, with her ultimately finding it at American Costume. On Mildred's move to Washington, D.C., Benach was mindful of the fact there would have been a sartorial shift of sorts, ergo, with her using more of the skirts and the little blouses, as opposed to the housedresses. Benach expressed that, \\"We made that shift because it was a natural change in her life. She went from country living to city living in a matter of a day. We thought over time, we would feel the difference between the country and the city.\\" The eventual maternity design was difficult as Benach had to ensure that the bumps looked like the right stages of her pregnancy. Regarding the costume design of Richard, Benach expressed that for finding the essence of this character, for Edgerton, it was in the pants' rise and how the pants fit him to emulate how Richard's pants fit him, and also the way Edgerton's body would move in the clothing, in which she states, \\"[Edgerton] started to kind of feel out Richard's stance in the way he would stand and put his head a little forward, all of that started to happen in those fittings, in those first beginning fittings.\\" Benach spoke of her objective in creating costumes that support the story, not attempting to distract nor take the viewer out of the moment, and she further expresses this sentiment by stating, \\"This story is a story of friendship and love between Richard and Mildred and I'd never wanted to detract from those moments.\\" Production design Production designer Chad Keith, who worked with Nichols previously on Take Shelter (2011) and Midnight Special (2016), commented that the greatest creative challenge was to do justice to the Lovings, while also acknowledging his interest in working on a film about actual living persons. Keith stressed the importance of the location, to which his team an himself tried to match up the locations to where and how the Lovings lived, in which he explained, \\"There are different sorts of income levels represented throughout their whole family that we wanted to show in the film. We bounced around all over Virginia and in D.C.\\" Keith remarked that it was his first period piece, and from the beginning, one of the first things [Nichols] asked was whether he thought we could pull it off, to which he stated, \\"I was certain we could.\\" Nichols himself spoke of how both Keith and costume designer Erin Benach with keeping him \\"period correct.\\" Keith spoke of Adam Stone and his experiences finding existing locations that were shootable, and once found both men spent a lot of time scouting. Keith later explained that: \\"Once you find the perfect location, you have to gut it, and start from scratch, and that experience is fun.\\" He also spoke of his adamant approach of not placing anything that isn't required to be on screen: \\"If it doesn't make sense that the characters would have used it, then to me it makes no sense for it to be there.\\" Some of the original locations, including the Bowling Green jail and courthouse, remained intact, though in other cases, Keith had to improvise: \\"Originally, we thought we could just roll into town, pull up to the perfect house and replicate everything easily.\\" Stone re-fashioned renovated houses to resemble the Lovings' country abodes as a lot of the places were falling apart. He also stuck with the key approach of simplicity within Loving, as he stated, \\"The story was about the Lovings. We did not want to draw attention to their environments. They were very simple people. I wanted to make what came across on screen as simple as possible as well.\\" Keith also noted that because Nichols and Stone always shoot on film, and because there was so little practical lighting in the time period portrayed, he worked hard to keep spaces light and bright \\"to reflect the light Adam could get in there\\", and to avoid the use of dark window coverings so Stone \\"could use as much natural light as possible.\\" On the high shot looking down on Richard, as he proposes to Mildred in a grassy field, Keith described the shot as a \\"perfect use of anamorphic that sums up what the film is about. They just want to be together ...\\", while stating he's learnt a great deal from both Nichols and Stone in the designing for the anamorphic frame to which he concludes, \\"My goal is always to do my very best to give them a 360-degree look if the money allows.\\" The Lovings' actual house in King and Queen County was deemed too small to film in, which resulted in Stone's discovery of a stand-alone farmhouse built in the 1920s south of Richmond. Keith described the process as following, \\"The inside of the house was immediately stripped, the kitchen pulled out, the enclosed porch on the back taken down and rebuilt to match the original one in the photos I liked, and lots and lots of painting and wallpapering action.\\" One of the challenges for the art department was the 1950s grocery store scene and a similar hardware store sequence, in which the stores have to be period correct, as well as the product on the shelves and aisles. Sound design Will Files and Brandon Proctor were the sound engineer for Loving, tasked with sound mixing, while Files, as a sound editor, supervised the process. Jeff Nichols spoke of sound as a narrative construct in Loving, while mentioning the audience looking in one direction when a sound suddenly erupts from the other. Nichols made note of Files' innate understanding of perceived reality, while commenting on his great ability to compress that artifice as much as possible, and make to it resemble reality, to which he remarked afterwards that: \\"We spent so much time on the background crickets for the opening of the film, because we had a few iterations that were too much, and then a few iterations that weren't quite enough. Inevitably one bullfrog would jump in and then we would have to go delete it. You don't want anything to be overt or artificial.\\" Nichols concluded by stating, \\"It's a dance that we do in every department and every facet of the filmmaking ... If sound is done well, no one will ever notice it. They'll just feel it.\\" Music The soundtrack is composed by David Wingo, who worked with Nichols previously on Take Shelter (2011), Mud (2012), and Midnight Special (2016). The original music is by Wingo, along with \\"Loving\\" written and performed by Ben Nichols. Wingo wanted the original music for the film to feel \\"like it could have been from any time.\\" Jeff Nichols wished for the score of Loving it to be orchestral, classical, while not contemporary sounding. Wingo stated that Ennio Morricone's compositions for Days of Heaven (1978), The Battle of Algiers (1966), and The Mission influenced the score of Loving, albeit Wingo didn't listen to them prior to scoring. Using a minimalist approach, when he could, Wingo mostly wished to reflect Richard and Mildred's emotional and psychological stakes. Wingo felt that Loving shouldn't have any big, sweeping themes because both Richard and Mildred were very shy, reserved people but having such a grace and beauty about them. He spoke of Nichols wanting him to watch Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011), as Nichols wanted the movie to feel the same way. Wingo later spoke of [Nichols] wishing to capture what they felt facing this horrible persecution, which results in the music being simple and restrained, albeit with a real beauty to it. Wingo chose the distinctive Americana-type score to establish the musical voice of the film, and managed to gather a 14-piece string ensemble of local musicians at 12th Street Sound for the recording of the soundtrack. In regards to scoring Loving, Wingo remarked that the score for Loving needed to be \\"elemental and simple to a certain degree while avoiding any sentimentality to capture the grace and beauty of Richard and Mildred.\\" He stated that all of his scores for [Nichols] in the past have had elements of an orchestral background, however, he knew that the main themes for Loving needed to contain a traditional orchestral score without any modern elements. He concluded by stating of Nichols that, \\"The other main thing that [Nichols] needed the score to accomplish was to really reflect the always-present anxiety and tension that they were living with all these years. Those pieces don't just operate in a different way than the other themes but are completely different instrumentation as well, with hardly any orchestral elements.\\" Influences Director Jeff Nichols said that influences, such as his thoughts on his own marriage, allowed him the ability to convey the commitment that the Lovings had to one another, with Nichols stating, \\"It's about how you stay committed through hard times, harrowing times, like for the Lovings, but also mundane times and the daily parts of life. When I look at my own marriage, that's where the love is. That's where the real work is.\\" Nichols spoke of influences No Country For Old Men (2007) afforded to him, such as giving him an answer to a question relating to a dolly, by which cinematographer Adam Stone and key grip Rocky Ford used a great rig accompanied with a jib arm and a remote head: an approach used by Roger Deakins. In approaching the story, Nichols referred to Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011), as well as a hard drive given to him by Buirski with all of the archival 16mm black-and-white footage that Hope Ryden shot in the mid-'60s, every interview the Lovings ever gave. Nichols remarked that every interview that Buirski did was all their friends and relatives and people that knew them, with Nichols being in possession of all the outtakes. To prepare for their roles, both Edgerton and Negga watched The Loving Story (2011), as well as Ryden's extensive footage. Grey Villet's LIFE Magazine photography was influential to the body language structuring by Edgerton and Negga, with Edgerton remarking that they would study the postures of the Lovings in Villet's photography. As well as notable influences from Nancy Buirski's documentary, Nichols spoke of Phyl Newbeck's Virginia Hasn't Always Been for Lovers: Interracial Marriage Bans and the Case of Richard and Mildred Loving (2004), in which Nichols draws upon several times in his adaptation, wherein Nichols stated, \\"All through that process it was a different version of that gestational thinking, because I would read a line in Newbeck's book about the Lovings' son being hit by a car, or about Richard drawing blueprints for the home he's going to build her before they get arrested, and for all these things I thought, \\"Well, that could be a scene,\\" and I started lying out the structure for it.\\" Newbeck is thanked in the film's credits. Production designer Chad Keith stated that The Color Purple (1985) influenced Lovings production design: \\"I started researching way before we started prepping which films to watch for research or what photography to check out. I watched The Color Purple which is a great film. I hadn't seen it in ages, and when I watched it I was looking at the detail, but I decided I didn't want to watch anything else for reference.\\" He concluded by stating that: \\"We're making our own film.\\" Cinematographer Adam Stone mentioned that Nichols and he referenced films they saw growing up, specifically that of '80s Steven Spielberg in which the characters are stacked into triangles in the wide and deep anamorphic frame, to which Stone makes a reference to the scene where Richard has been protesting for the release of Mildred at the County courthouse: \\"We do a massive focus rack toward the [Sheriff's voice], and our attention now shifts to the Sheriff, watching Joel over his shoulder in the same frame. I love this compounding of information that anamorphic allows, even in interior dialogue scenes; it makes the world feel more tangible.\\" Stone spoke of the work of Grey Villet as being one of the \\"greatest treasure troves\\", while stating Villet's photography not only influenced the cinematography but the script, production design, and costume design. Themes The film is described an apolitical film, following different emotional arcs about the human condition, including family relationships and love, as such as Nichols' Shotgun Stories (2007), Take Shelter (2011), Mud (2012), and Midnight Special (2016), wherein these themes are also explored. Nichols also mentions the themes of love, human rights, cultural and institutionalized racism, and of overcoming bigotry. Nichols remarked that both Richard and Mildred Loving represent what are important about political debates, whilst remarking that once political or religious debates are engaged then the themes or ideals come about, to which he states, \\"I think people just start thinking about themselves and what they're comfortable with and what they think is right and wrong in their moral compass. According to Ruth Negga, a primary theme of Loving is hope. Negga spoke of how such a theme of the film was interconnected with Mildred: \\"... she was a hopeful person. You're drawn to those people as well, because they inspire hope in you, and I think she was very much the rock of her family, and for Richard. You want to orbit that.\\" Historical accuracy Following a screening of Loving, at the Princeton Garden Theater in Princeton, New Jersey, producer Peter Saraf held an open Q&A; discussion with the audience, in which he touched on such topics as the film's historical authenticity, in which he described the film as true to life: \\"Richard Loving was indeed as stoic as Nichols and Edgerton portray him; the small rural Virginia community in which they lived was (and is) highly racially integrated; Mildred Loving really did write directly to Robert Kennedy, and her letter is still in the Kennedy collection; and the Lovings lawyer really did, per Richard's request, relay his words before the Supreme Court that \\"I love my wife.\\"\\" Edgerton spoke of Nichols' aim to strike a \\"sense of authenticity and truth\\" in Loving, with the actor himself remarking his and Negga's attempt to try to look, sound, and act as close as possible to the way Richard and Mildred really were. He was intent on verisimilitude, to which Nichols began to state, \\"I didn't feel comfortable making things up with this story‚Äîthe jail was the same jail they stayed in. The front shot of the courthouse was the same courthouse.\\" The Lovings' surviving child, Peggy Loving, was a consultant to the production. She visited the set and was struck by how thoroughly the actors had channeled her parents ‚Äì in character and in costume. According to Saraf, both Bernie Cohen and Phil Hirschkop were consulted on the film, despite no longer being on speaking terms with one another. The makers of the film did change some of the details, with Nichols inventing some characters and scenes, however, he sought to stay as true to the Lovings' story as possible. Speaking to Coverage Opinions, Hirschkop expressed his view on Jon Bass' portrayal of himself, with Hirschkop remarking that Bass was too mild mannered and nothing like himself, and while Hirschkop mentions that Loving served its purpose as a film, he also listed several discrepancies between the film and what actually occurred. Mark Loving, the grandson to Mildred Loving, said his grandma is not African American as portrayed by Ruth Negga with Ethiopian blood, but rather Native American as Rappahannock Indian. Marketing On October 23, 2015, TheWrap promoted Loving by releasing the first image of the film, featuring Edgerton's Richard Loving and Negga's Mildred Loving. On July 12, 2016, Loving was promoted by the release of a trailer by Focus Features, was praised by reviewers. The Huffington Post's Zeba Blay described the trailer as \\"breathtaking\\", while noting it to be a beautiful testimony to the concept of love verses racial divide. The New York Times's Mekado Murphy stated that the trailer \\"suggests the film will make a strong case for Oscar consideration a year after the Academy was the subject of blistering criticism for its all-white slate of acting nominees.\\" Time's Eliza Berman wrote that the trailer \\"offers a glimpse of a simple life violently interrupted by a sheriff with a flashlight in the middle of the night.\\"  Release  The ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood, California hosted a limited theatrical showing of Loving. Loving premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, on May 16, 2016 in Cannes, France, where it had been selected to compete for the Palme d'Or, before screening at the Champs-√âlys√©es Film Festival, in which it had been selected to open, on June 7, 2016. On May 16, 2015, it was announced that Mars Distribution had acquired distribution rights to the film in France. On February 13, 2016, Deadline Hollywood announced at the Berlin International Film Festival that Focus Features had acquired distribution rights to the film, including distribution in North America and international territories, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Latin America. Loving began a limited release in the United States on November 4, 2016, in four locations in New York City and Los Angeles, including ArcLight Hollywood and The Landmark, before moving to a wider release on November 11, 2016. Before opening in general release across Europe, on January 17, 2017, it expanded to Australia, ahead of a bow in the United Kingdom and Ireland on February 3. On February 9, it opened in Israel, and then in France on February 15, and Estonia and Sweden on February 17, ahead of its final bow in Germany and the Netherlands on February 23. = Pre-release screenings = Prior to Loving's public release, on September 8, 2016, the film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it opened in the official sidebar section, Gala Presentations.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Loving takes an understated approach to telling a painful‚Äîand still relevant‚Äîreal- life tale, with sensitive performances breathing additional life into a superlative historical drama.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Critics were near unanimous in praise for Ruth Negga's portrayal of Mildred Loving The film received a five- minute standing ovation following its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. The Hollywood Reporter, People, and Essence, among others, pegged it as an Oscar contender. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post heralded the film and its director, Jeff Nichols, by stating: \\"Rather than deliver a rote‚Äîif rousing‚Äîrehearsal of the facts of the Lovings' case, [Nichols] makes the counterintuitive decision to allow them to live in front of the camera\\", with Hornaday continuing by praising him as \\"too astute a filmmaker to be unaware of the analogies \\"Loving\\" invites regarding marriage equality, but he wisely leaves agendas and polemics behind.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time called it \\"beautifully restrained\\" and wrote, \\"Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson.\\" Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail spoke most highly of Edgerton and Negga, with Taylor stating, \\"Negga and Edgerton make these noble people three-dimensional, turning a docile, unambitious couple with neither the self-knowledge nor the words to launch a social revolution into unlikely protagonists in the civil- rights movement.\\" Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair felt that \\"Edgerton is one of the more dynamic movie actors of his generation, and brings true commitment to his zipped-up, laconic portrayal of Richard, a man whose passion for his wife and family ran deep and quiet.\\" Michelle Dean of The New Republic spoke most highly of the performances, writing, \\"Edgerton is likely to get more attention, though it is Negga's incredible performance that makes the film so powerfully subtle.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"Loving honors its subject, its audience and the movie medium.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a three and a half-star rating, and said: \\"The stabbing simplicity of Negga's acting is breathtaking. Jeff Nichols has given us a quietly devastating film that resonates for the here and now and marches to the cadences of history and the heart.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, \\"[Nichols'] most distinct aesthetic choice is the movie's quietness and the hush that envelops its first scene and that eventually defines the Lovings as much as their accents, gestures, manners and battles. =Accolades= Loving has received numerous awards and nominations. It had been selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It received two nominations at the 74th Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor for Edgerton, and Best Actress for Negga. When the SAG-AFTRA announced the nominations honoring the best achievements in film on December 14, many media, including The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Entertainment Weekly, USA Today, TheWrap, and Indiewire, slammed Loving's omission as a \\"snub.\\" In addition to several awards and nominations, Loving has been named as one of the best films of 2016 by various ongoing critics, appearing on several critics' end-of-year lists. * 1st ‚Äì Roger Moore, Movie Nation * 2nd ‚Äì Lawrence Toppman, The Charlotte Observer * 3rd ‚Äì Stephanie Zacharek, Time * 3rd ‚Äì Alex Biese, Asbury Park Press * 3rd ‚Äì Kenneth Turan, The Los Angeles Times * 3rd ‚Äì Tom Shone, These Violent Delights * 3rd ‚Äì Jason Bailey, Flavorwire * 3rd ‚Äì Kaitlyn Booth, Bleeding Cool * 4th ‚Äì Matthew Jacobs, The Huffington Post * 4th ‚Äì Rick Bentley, The Fresno Bee * 6th ‚Äì Seongyong Cho, Rogerebert.com * 6th ‚Äì Christina Newland, Rogerebert.com * 6th ‚Äì Paste * 7th ‚Äì Anne Thompson, Indiewire * 7th ‚Äì Calvin Wilson, St. Louis Post-Dispatch * 7th ‚Äì Sheila Benson, Parallax View * 8th ‚Äì Peter Travers, Rolling Stone * 8th ‚Äì Brian D.

Nakayama abused over 300 children, mostly boys aged 3-20, over the course of 62 years of ministry. Nakayama died in 1995, a year after being charged with immorality by the Bishop of Calgary Barry Curtis and resigning from his position as priest. Nakayama's abuse has been the subject of two books by notable Canadian author Joy Kogawa, who is also the daughter of Nakayama. Church of England There have been many cases of sex abuse in the Church of England.The Anglican Church Investigation Report Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse In the 1970s concern was raised over Jeremy Dowling, a lay preacher and employee of the Anglican Church in the Diocese of Truro, and a member of the general synod from 1977. Dowling was accused of sex abuse at specified schools and of sadistic behaviour. Maurice Key, was bishop of Truro at the time and until 1990; Michael Ball succeeded Key. In 1993 Peter Ball, who had co-founded a monastic community called the Community of the Glorious Ascension with his brother Michael Ball in 1960, was the suffragan Bishop of Lewes in the Diocese of Chichester from 1977 to 1992, and the diocesan Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 to 1993, resigned after admitting to an act of gross indecency with a 19-year-old former novice at the monastery, and accepting a formal police caution for it. Ball continued to serve in churches after that. During Peter Ball's trial in 2015, it emerged that in 1993 Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyers had determined that \\"sufficient admissible, substantial and reliable evidence\\" existed that Ball had committed indecent assault and gross indecency.\\"Peter Ball victims accuse C of E, police and CPS of sexual abuse cover-up\\", The Guardian (London). However, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, had decided not to prosecute Ball, as a member of the royal family, a lord chief justice, JPs, cabinet ministers and public school headmasters‚Äî\\"many dozens\\" of people‚Äîhad campaigned to support him at that time. In 2007 Peter Halliday, a choirmaster in Guildford in Surrey, who had told the church that he had abused children in the 1990s but was allowed to continue working with children, was convicted of three counts of sexual abuse of children, and police were concerned that there had been many more cases. In light of this event and the public airing of the church's bad handling of Halliday, as well as two other high-profile sexual abuse convictions, the House of Bishops decided in May 2007 to ask the Central Safeguarding Liaison Group to hold a review of past cases throughout the Church of England, which was carried out starting in 2008. The Diocese of Chichester and the Sussex Police also began investigating long-standing allegations of sexual abuse in East Sussex. The Chichester diocesan past review cases report was commissioned in 2009 and run by Roger Meekings. In 2008, Colin Pritchard, a vicar in Bexhill-on-Sea was convicted of sexually abusing two boys; The Guardian described it as the \\"breakthrough case\\" for dealing with sexual abuse in the Chichester diocese. Roy Cotton, a priest in the Chichester diocese died in 2006 but allegations of abuse by him emerged shortly thereafter. In 2018, Pritchard, who by then changed his name to Ifor Whittaker, was convicted of further sexual abuse that he had carried out in collaboration with Cotton. In 2010 the Church of England past cases review was published. In 2011 the Diocese of Chichester asked Elizabeth Butler‚ÄêSloss to conduct an independent review of the way the Pritchard and Cotton cases were handled by the Chichester diocese. In December 2011 the Archbishop of Canterbury opened an official inquiry (an archiepiscopal visitation) of the Chichester diocese due to the severity of the sexual abuse problem there; the last time such an inquiry had been established was in the 1890s. The Meekings Chichester past cases review report was made public in February 2012 and the next day, the Church of England issued a rare public apology in response to the report's damning description of the way the Church handled Cotton and Pritchard and failed to protect and care for people abused by them. In March 2012 two retired Chichester vicars, Gordon Rideout and Robert Coles, were arrested based on information from the past cases review and the Butler-Sloss report. In May 2012 the review and historic files about Peter Ball were given to the Sussex Police. Ball and another priest, Vickery House, were arrested in November 2012 and Ball was put on trial in 2014. The Butler-Sloss report on the handling of Cotton and Pritchard published in December 2012 and was severely criticized when it was released. In 2014 the UK government set up an Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse to investigate how the government had handled allegations of sexual abuse and Butler‚ÄêSloss was appointed to lead it. Objections were raised to her participation. The final straw came when Phil Johnson, who by that time was a member of the National Safeguarding Panel for the Church, and who had been abused by Cotton and Pritchard and had given testimony to Butler‚ÄêSloss during her 2011 inquiry, made it public that he had told Butler‚ÄêSloss about abuse by Peter Ball, and that she had chosen to omit that in her report. The inquiry was disbanded and re-established the next year, and in November 2015 the panel said it would be include the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in its investigations. \\"Abuse inquiry: MPs, councils and Churches to be investigated\\", BBC News, 27 November 2015 In July 2015 Dowling was convicted of child sex abuse and sent to prison. Several bishops failed to take action over Dowling possibly because there was not an earlier prosecution. A few days later the Bishop of Durham said at a church synod that the 2003 abolition of defrocking may have been a mistake; it had been abolished over concerns about wrongful convictions. In October 2015 Ball was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment for sexual abuse after admitting the abuse of 18 young men over a period of 15 years from 1977 to 1992. Further charges of indecently assaulting two boys, aged 13 and 15, were allowed to lie on file in a contentious decision by the CPS. Vickery House, was also convicted in October 2015 and was sentenced to serve 6¬Ω years in prison for sex assaults against men and a boy. House worked in the same diocese as Ball. House and Ball collaborated in abusing three victims. If Ball had not pleaded guilty both men would have been tried together.\\"Vickery House: Priest jailed over sex attacks\\", BBC. There was a long delay between the first complaints to the police over House and a proper police investigation.\\"'Nothing done' over priest Vickery House 'sex reports'\\", BBC. The Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth had a number of sexual abuse convictions in the 1980s and 1990s. Timothy Bavin was the bishop between 1985 and 1996 and during this time a number of serious safeguarding issues took place. For example, Bishop Bavin did not report Father Terry Knight to the police when parents raised their concerns to him in 1985. Father Knight was allowed to carry on in his position until he was later convicted for sexually abusing boys in 1996 and again in 2016. Bishop Bavin had also allowed a convicted paedophile priest, Father Michael Gover, to carry on working for the church on his release in 1990. Father Gover was convicted in 1985 at around the same time as parents raised their concerns about Father Knight. Bishop Timothy Bavin stood down in 1995 whilst Father Terry Knight's police investigation and court case was taking place.Dedicates church in his last year In March 2016, the \\"first independent review commissioned by the Church of England into its handling of a sex abuse case\\" issued a 21-page report by Ian Elliott, a safeguarding expert. The Church published only its conclusions and recommendations and \\"acknowledged the report was 'embarrassing and uncomfortable' reading\\". The review centered on the case of \\"Joe\\" ‚Äì described in the report as survivor \\"B\\". In July 2014, Joe had \\"reported the abuse to the church‚Äôs safeguarding officers\\". He sued the church in October 2015. The church paid ¬£35,000 in compensation and called the abuse is \\"a matter of deep shame and regret\\".‚ÄúDamning Report Reveals Church of England's Failure to Act on Abuse‚Äù (15 March 2016).

The review criticised the office of Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. It said that Welby's office failed \\"to respond meaningfully to repeated efforts by the survivor throughout 2015 to bring his case to the church leader‚Äôs attention\\". Speaking on behalf of the Church, Sarah Mullally, bishop of Crediton, said that Welby has made \\"a personal commitment to seeing all the recommendations implemented quickly\\". The eleven recommendations included (1) training clergy (especially those in senior positions) to keep records and take action for those who report abuse and (2) the church should insure that \\"pastoral care of survivors takes precedence over protection of reputation or financial considerations\\".

The surficial geology in its vicinity mostly consists of Wisconsinan Till. Course Kern Glen Creek looking downstream Kern Glen Creek begins to the southeast of Kintner Hill in Lemon Township. It flows south for several tenths of a mile, almost immediately entering Tunkhannock Township, where it passes through one wetland and enters another. The creek goes through this wetland for a few tenths of a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the right before leaving the wetland at its southeastern edge. It continues flowing southeast for a few tenths of a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. After this, the creek turns east and crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 before turning southeast again. After a few tenths of a mile, it passes through a wetland with a lake and continues flowing southeast. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Billings Mill Brook. Kern Glen Creek joins Billings Mill Brook upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Kern Glen Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Kern Glen Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is approximately above sea level. The surficial geology in virtually all of the area in the vicinity of Kern Glen Creek consists of a till known as Wisconsinan Till. However, there are a few patches of wetlands, peat bogs, and lakes in the watershed. There is also a small patch of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale near the creek's lower reaches. Knobs of till cause the valley of Kern Glen Creek to be a beaded valley, with broader and narrower segments. Watershed The watershed of Kern Glen Creek has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Tunkhannock. Its mouth is located at Kern Glen. History Kern Glen Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178398. The stream is also known as Meadow Brook. This variant name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland.

Coke was also an art teacher and as an artist was known for her watercolours, which have a very free, open-air quality to them. Life and work WAAF Instrument Mechanics at Work (1941) (ArtIWM.ART LD 1298) Coke was born in Southend-on-Sea in Essex in 1897, where her father was a tea exporter. When she was seventeen, Coke entered the Slade School of Art, where she continued to study throughout the First World War and where she won a prize for figure composition. In the summer of 1918 Coke submitted some sketches to the British War Memorials Committee for a possible commission. That proposal was rejected but shortly afterwards Muirhead Bone bought two of her watercolours for the Imperial War Museum collection. In 1919 she was elected a member of the New English Art Club. By the start of World War Two Coke was a popular and well known artist. During the War she received a short-term commission from the War Artists Advisory Committee to depict the work being performed by women in various services. To this end she spent time with the Women's Voluntary Service, the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and also with the Red Cross. One of her paintings was included in the Britain at War exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York which opened in May 1941. By the end of the War, WAAC had acquired eight paintings from Coke. During the War, in 1943, she was elected a member of the Royal Watercolour Society, having previously become an Associate member in 1935. After the War, Coke taught art at Brighton College of Art until her retirement in 1967.

Tyson John J. Tyson (born December 12, 1947, in Abington, Pennsylvania) is an American systems biologist and mathematical biologist who serves as University Distinguished Professor of Biology at Virginia Tech, and is the former president of the Society for Mathematical Biology. He is known for his research on biochemical switches in the cell cycle, dynamics of biological networks and on excitable media.  Education and career  Tyson earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Wheaton College, and received his Ph.D in chemical physics from the University of Chicago. After postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, a temporary position teaching mathematics at the University at Buffalo, and another post doctorate at the University of Innsbruck for Biochemistry and Experimental Cancer Research, he joined the Virginia Tech faculty in 1978 and is currently a University Distinguished Professor in Biological Sciences. He was president of the Society for Mathematical Biology for 1993‚Äì1995, and served as co- editor-in-chief of the Journal of Theoretical Biology from 1995 to 2004..  Research  Since receiving his PhD in chemical physics at the University of Chicago in 1973, John Tyson has been studying temporal and spatial organization in chemical, biochemical and biological systems. Recently he has focused on the macro-molecular reaction networks that process information in living cells and initiate appropriate responses in terms of cell growth, division and death. He represents the dynamics of these reaction networks in terms of mathematical equations, using computer simulations to work out the precise behavior to be expected of the network. By comparing simulations with experimental data, the computer models can be tested, refined and developed, eventually, into tools for accurate predictions of the physiological responses of healthy and diseased cells. In John J. Tyson's laboratory they study biological systems from a rigorous mathematical perspective, and build realistic models that help gain a deeper understanding of the physiology. Most of their work is on the mechanism of cell cycle control as seen in budding yeast, fission yeast, Xenopus embryos and egg extracts, Drosophila embryos and mammalian cells. Tyson also worked in chemical kinetics studying oscillations, bistability, traveling' waves, and chaotic behavior in chemical reaction systems. The unifying theme of the research is the problem of spatial and temporal organization in chemical, biochemical and biological systems. What mechanisms keep time in these various domains? How is spatial information communicated and utilized? How do the molecular regulatory mechanisms of living cells process information and initiate appropriate responses in terms of cell growth, division and death? John Tyson has published several dynamical models of cell decision making systems in cancer including Estrogen Receptor Signaling, Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and Autophagy.  Notable Achievements and Recognition  John has worked closely with high-profile individuals within the field of cell biology. Cell Cycle Control by a Minimal Cdk Network was written by John in tandem with Claude Gerard, Damien Coudreuse, and B√©la Nov√°k. The paper has been highly cited and takes a critical look at the possible origin of the eukaryotic cell and how the minimal cdk network can apply to larger complex cells like those found in humans. John has been featured on television for the annual meeting of the society of cell biology in 2013, as well as being featured on the National Institute of General Medical Sciences website.

He was the first person to give an accurate description of pernicious anaemia and to recognise that atrophic gastritis was a feature of the condition.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1850 and served as President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1851‚Äì52. Early life and education Combe came from a family of brewers based in Edinburgh and appears to have been second cousin to George and Andrew Combe, who come from the same brewing family. He was born in Leith on 5 January 1796 to Matthew Combe, a brewer at the Yardheads. After studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, he received his doctorate (MD) in 1815 and was licensed as a surgeon (LRCSEd) in the same year. While taking the MD examination, he was being questioned by Prof Andrew Duncan when the guns of Edinburgh Castle fired to mark the victory at Waterloo and end of the Napoleonic Wars. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) in 1823. Medical career Combe appears to have taken an early interest in diseases of the blood, presenting a case of anaemia to the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1822. In 1824 he published this in detail in a paper entitled History of a Case of Anaemia.Combe JS (1824). History of a case of anaemia. Transcripts of the Medical-Chirurgical Society, Edinburgh 1:193‚Äì98. Combe modestly starts with the statement that the case had already been presented by \\"my distinguished preceptor and friend Dr Kellie\\". He goes on to credit continental writers with earlier descriptions of the condition. Combe then describes a patient with the typical features of a severe anaemia. Despite various treatments including iron, chalybeate (iron- containing) spa water and a nourishing diet, the patient died. At the autopsy, where he was assisted by Kellie, he found the stomach was \\"thin, showing no vessels and transparent\\", a description of atrophic gastritis, which is a distinctive feature of pernicious anaemia, and preceded Dr Thomas Addison‚Äôs admittedly fuller account by 27 years. Although the condition bears Addison's name, Combe's was the first accurate description and the first to link it to atrophic gastritis. In 1828 Combe published a paper in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal entitled \\"On the Poisonous effects of the Mussel, Mytius Edlulis\\", looking at the issue of accumulation of toxins in molluscs. At this time the mussel beds of the Firth of Forth were dangerously close to the sewage outlets of the city of Edinburgh. Around 1829 he travelled to India to treat and study cholera in the city of Calcutta. He returned to the United Kingdom around 1832, just in time to aid in combating a wave of cholera that was sweeping across the country at that time. Back in his home town of Leith, he worked with Dr Thomas Latta on the pioneering use of intravenous infusions of saline to manage the disease. He signed Latta's death certificate when he died prematurely in 1833.Leith Hospital 1848-1988, by D H A Boyd In 1839 he is described as being 17 years in the practice of midwifery, delivering 100 children per year. As part of a debate on survival of premature children, he stated that there was no reason why a child of less than seven months could not survive, but a child of less than five months was not viable.Medico- Chirurgical Review and Journal of Medical Science, Vol. 35, 1839. He moved from 27 Charlotte StreetEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1840-1 (now Queen Charlotte Street) in Leith to York Place, Edinburgh in 1847, probably at the point of becoming a manager of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary which would have required his closer presence. Whilst now absorbed into Edinburgh, the distance between Leith and Edinburgh, though only a few miles, would have presented a significant time problem in the mid-19th century. However he remained consultant physician to Leith Hospital until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1850, his proposer being Robert Christison. He succeeded James Syme as President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1851 and was succeeded in 1853 by Dr Archibald Inglis. Combe died on 14 February 1883 at his home 36 York Place, Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office directory 1880-1 He is buried with his wife in Warriston Cemetery in north Edinburgh. The grave, marked by a tall slim obelisk, lies slightly south of the central vaults. Family Combe married Ann Thomson in 1824. They had one daughter, Margaret, and three sons Matthew, Charles Thomson. One son became an army surgeon.

International concerns also grew over an increase in media censorship, with the government being accused of specifically targeting news outlets known to be close to the G√ºlen Movement such as Kanalt√ºrk and Bug√ºn TV. Safety concerns due to the escalating conflict resulted in the government proposing to merge ballot boxes in affected areas and to transport them to safer locations, though the opposition criticised the move as an attempt to decrease the votes of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which polled strongly in the June 2015 general election. Security concerns Since late 2012, the Turkish government had conducted peace negotiations with the Kurdish separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant organisation in order to end 40 years of ethnic conflict in the predominantly Kurdish south-east of the country. The negotiations, called the solution process led to a relative ceasefire, though critics have claimed that the ceasefire has led to the PKK becoming stronger and their atrocities have gone unnoticed in an attempt by the government to preserve the solution process. =Suru√ß bombing= On 20 July 2015, a suicide bombing in the Turkish-Syrian border town of Suru√ß perpetrated by an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant led to the deaths of 32 activists from the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP) youth wing. The activists were planning to cross the border to help relief efforts in the Kurdish town of Koban√Æ, which had been under siege by ISIL militants before being defeated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). In retaliation, PKK militants killed two police officers in return for what they saw as collaboration between the Turkish government and ISIL, while ISIL militants directly engaged with Turkish military positions in the border town of Elbeyli, killing one soldier. In retaliation, the government authorised airstrikes against both PKK camps in Northern Iraq and ISIL positions in Syria. =2015 PKK rebellion= Turkish Army vehicles in Diyarbakƒ±r following the collapse of the solution process in July 2015 PKK terrorist attack in Diyarbakƒ±r in August 2015 The abandoning of both the solution process with the Kurdish rebels and the policy of inaction against ISIL by the Turkish government led to a resumption of violence in the south-east, with PKK militants resuming attacks on Turkish military and police positions. Over 90 military or police personnel had been killed by 6 September 2015, raising concerns about whether peaceful elections could be held in the region. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) co-leader Selahattin Demirta≈ü claimed that the conditions in the south-east were not adequate to hold peaceful elections, with party officials investigating the region having returned with negative reports. In early September, three Republican People's Party (CHP) MPs visited Van, Hakk√¢ri and the district of Y√ºksekova. Their report, which contained accounts from the Governor of Hakk√¢ri and the Kaymakam of Y√ºksekova, stated that the HDP-run municipalities in the region were openly recruiting militants for the PKK and consulting them before taking decisions. The report also documented cases of PKK youth wing (YDG-H) members attempting to militarise the region, smuggling to finance their operations and forcing individuals to conduct PKK propaganda. =PKK ceasefire= On 11 October 2015, the PKK announced a one-sided ceasefire in order to guarantee peaceful elections. The ceasefire was rejected by the Turkish government, which continued to conduct military operations against PKK positions. Media censorship Despite projections that the AKP's control over the media would decrease after losing their majority in June's elections, the government nevertheless launched controversial crackdowns on pro-opposition media outlets in the lead-up to the vote. In September, international controversy arose over the arrest of 3 Vice News journalists on terrorism charges while covering the surge in unrest in south-eastern Turkey. The members of Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT√úK), which regulates the Turkish media, failed to elect a new President due to a political deadlock, with the AKP, MHP or HDP candidate failing to win enough votes from partisan executive board members. On 3 October, thousands of journalists as well as members from numerous journalism associations held a demonstration at Taksim Square to protest the growing censorship of the press. =Crackdown on pro-G√ºlen media outlets= Koza ƒ∞pek On 1 September, police raids were conducted against 23 different companies belonging to the Koza ƒ∞pek Holding, which is known for its close relations with G√ºlen Movement. Businessman Akƒ±n ƒ∞pek was taken into custody for allegedly being a director of an armed terrorist organisation, a charge that he claimed was nothing more than slander. TV channel Kanalt√ºrk and the newspaper Bug√ºn were among those targeted, with Bug√ºn having issued headlines accusing the government of funding the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) earlier that day. The raids against anti-AKP media outlets were criticised by Reporters Without Borders and several national journalists' associations. In response to the crackdown against opposition media, the pro-opposition S√∂zc√º newspaper carried a headline on their daily edition, stating 'If S√∂zc√º falls silent, so will Turkey.' =Nokta controversy= On 14 September 2015, a prosecutor ordered the impounding of all copies of the magazine Nokta, which had published an issue containing a photoshopped picture of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan taking a selfie in front of a soldier's funeral, on the grounds that it had 'insulted the President' and acted as 'propaganda for an armed terrorist organisation'. The magazine's lawyers argued that the impounding on the magazine without a proper court order was unlawful and stated that the country had taken yet another step back in terms of press freedom. =Attack on Ahmet Hakan= In the early hours of 1 October, H√ºrriyet columnist and the presenter of the political talk show Tarafsƒ±z B√∂lge (Neutral Area), Ahmet Hakan, was attacked by four people outside his home. He was admitted to hospital and was later taken into surgery. It was initially reported that the incident was a result of road rage with no relations to Hakan's journalism, though it later emerged that three of the four attackers were AKP members, who were later suspended from the party. Abdurrahim Boynukalƒ±n, who had previously led a mob of 200 AKP supporters to attack the H√ºrriyet newspaper headquarters, was initially seen as a suspect, but later released a statement denying any link to the attack. Seven people were taken into custody for the attack, with only one being arrested. One of the suspects involved claimed that the police had paid them ‚Ç∫25,000 to carry out the attack, alleging that the National Intelligence Organisation (Mƒ∞T), the police and President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan were all aware of the plot. Political violence =Attack on H√ºrriyet headquarters= Aftermath of the attacks on the H√ºrriyet newspaper headquarters in early September 2015 HDP headquarters after being subject to an arson attack by Turkish nationalists in September 2015 On 6 September, a group of 200 AKP supporters attacked the headquarters of Doƒüan Media Centre, which houses the offices of the newspaper H√ºrriyet. The newspaper had published a news story about an interview with Erdoƒüan by another TV channel shortly after 16 soldiers were killed by roadside bombs in Daƒülƒ±ca. Erdoƒüan's comments, which included a claim that the attacks would have never had happened had the AKP won 400 seats in the June 2015, caused uproar and the newspaper was accused by AKP supporters of misquoting the President. AKP MP and Youth Wing leader Abdurrahim Boynukalƒ±n led the mob against H√ºrriyet, drawing heavy criticism and subsequently being sent to court for inciting hatred and vandalism. Another attack by a group of 100 protestors on H√ºrriyet occurred on 8 September in both their ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara headquarters, this time opening fire on the building. 6 people were arrested for the role in the attacks. =Attack on the HDP central office= After the Turkish military suffered heavy casualties in fights with the PKK in both Daƒülƒ±ca and Iƒüdƒ±r, nationalist protesters staged demonstrations and many attacked HDP office branches in protest at the HDP's links with the PKK. The HDP's headquarters was also subject to an arson attack, though the ensuring fire was quickly put out. Selahattin Demirta≈ü announced on 9 September that 400 HDP branch offices had come under attack in the last two days and accused the AKP's leaders of trying to push the country into civil war. However, the Mayor of Cizre Leyla ƒ∞mret, a member of the HDP's fraternal Democratic Regions Party (DBP), claimed that they would begin a civil war against Turkey from Cizre. Fights between HDP and nationalists resulted in both deaths and injuries, while the workplace of a former HDP candidate was set alight by protestors. =Attacks against the CHP= In addition to the HDP, the offices of CHP branch offices in Sincan and Konya came under attack, with the offices and vehicles outside them being heavily vandalised. It was alleged by the CHP that the perpetrators of the attacks in Sincan included members of the Ottoman Hearths (Osmanlƒ± Ocaklarƒ±). On 26 October, gunmen driving past the CHP headquarters in Ankara fired five rounds at the building, though no-one was killed or injured. The CHP's leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu stated that his party would not be intimidated by the attack while other parties expressed their condemnation. During early voting, a clash took place outside the Turkish embassy in Tokyo in October 2015 between Kurds in Japan and Turks in Japan which began when the Turks assaulted the Kurds after a Kurdish party flag was shown at the embassy. =Ankara bombings= 21 days before polling day on 10 October 2015, two suicide bombers targeted attendants at a peace rally taking place outside Ankara Central railway station, killing 97 people and injuring over 500 others according to some reports. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Turkish modern history, causing waves of public protests accusing the government of implicitly supporting and not doing enough to combat organisations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The government denied the claims and announced three days of public mourning, while the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) blamed the governing AKP for the attack. The bombings also raised concern over how suicide bombers managed to evade security measures to detonate two bombs in the centre of the capital, with the precise location of the attack in close proximity to the National Intelligence Organisation (Mƒ∞T) headquarters. The bombing was followed by a series of gaffs by the AKP leader Ahmet Davutoƒülu, who claimed after the attack that they had caught the perpetrators of previous attacks such as the Suru√ß bombing. This was impossible since the perpetrator at Suru√ß was a suicide bomber who was killed after detonating his explosives. Later, Davutoƒülu claimed that they had a list of suspected suicide bombers but could not make arrests until they actually carried out an attack. Both statements were subject to commotion and ridicule on social media. Safety and distribution of ballot boxes The Ankara'nƒ±n Oylarƒ± (Ankara's Votes) election monitoring organisation giving a presentation to volunteers regarding ballot box safety. The pictured slide shows examples of invalid votes In September 2015, the government allegedly began pressuring the YSK to divert voters living in villages linked to the south-eastern district of Cizre to the town centre instead, citing security concerns. Cizre had been under an 8-day curfew while armed forced carried out a security operation against PKK militants before the government requested the 'merging' of ballot boxes. Such a decision would require villagers living in rural settlements having to make their way to the town centre to cast their vote instead. On 23 September, a decision was taken by the Cizre Electioral Council to not set up polling stations in 23 villages and one hamlet. The decision would affect 48,687 out of around 66,000 registered voters in Cizre, forcing them to vote in different neighbourhoods. The HDP objected to the decision and refuse to recognise its authority, claiming that it was an attempt to reduce the HDP vote by reducing turnout in the party's electoral strongholds. Controversy over the decision grew even more when it emerged that it had been taken by just a single member of the electoral council, with the CHP representative stating that he had not been consulted. Although the HDP renewed their opposition to the move, the CHP admitted that they would have supported the decision had they been consulted, stating that it was practically impossible to enter the affected neighbourhoods due to the unrest. However, both the CHP Supreme Electoral Council representative and the President of the YSK himself stated that the decisions had no legal basis, stating that the YSK had to be consulted before such decisions could be made. Despite the YSK's statement, a similar decision to not set up ballot boxes was taken on 28 September by the Y√ºksekova electoral council in Hakkari Province, requiring all ballot boxes in rural villages to be moved to the town centre. On 3 October, the YSK voted against transferring ballot boxes, drawing heavy criticism from the AKP. On 5 September, the HDP requested that the YSK place cameras to film the vote counting procedures in 126 'high security risk' areas. Their proposal was rejected on 14 September.

The Birmingham neighborhood of Avondale was chosen to be the site of the first mill, hence the naming of the company. Founded in 1897, the mills employed thousands of Alabamians throughout its 109-year history until they closed in 2006. Avondale Mills was founded in 1897 by a consortium of investors including the Trainer family of Chester, Pennsylvania, the future governor of Alabama, Braxton Bragg Comer, and a group of Birmingham civic leaders including Frederick Mitchell Jackson Sr. The mills refined the plentiful cotton from Alabama fields and, at its peak, devoured 20% of the entire state of Alabama's cotton production. The owners and operators of Avondale Mills were noted not only for progressive stances with regards to the overall well being of their workers, but also for conditions of child labor that, while common at the time, are today considered abusive. The mills were operated solely in Alabama until Donald Comer released control of Avondale Mills to his brother-in-law, Craig Smith, who helped expand the mills into both Georgia and South Carolina.. Walton Monroe Mills Inc. purchased Avondale Mills in 1986. In 1995, the owning firm acquired the textile operations of the Graniteville Company. Disaster struck when, on the morning of January 6, 2005, a train accident outside of the Graniteville, South Carolina mill caused a massive chemical explosion that killed 9. In 2006, as a result of the Graniteville disaster and increased competition from overseas, Avondale formally shuttered its operations.  History  = Creation = The Trainer family of Chester, Pennsylvania sought to expand their already successful textile operations into the American South to bring their operations closer to the source of their raw materials. The Birmingham region appealed to them chiefly due to its wide labor pool and proximity to the abundant cotton fields of Alabama, as well as the transportation infrastructure of Birmingham that allowed for easy transport of their refined materials throughout the American south and the United States as a whole. Southern communities, since before the Civil War, had wanted to introduce new manufacturing facilities as a means of resisting economic domination by Northern industrialists. Industry was difficult to develop in Alabama, particularly, however, due to the states deficit of navigable waterways, a relatively unstable banking system which both combined to discourage widespread investment in manufacturing facilities within the state. Alabama was at the bottom of the list in terms of textile production in southern states. In 1852, There were 40 mills in Georgia operating with 80,000 spindles; Tennessee had 30 mills with 36,000 spindles in operation; and Alabama came in last with only 12 mills and a total of 12,580 spindles. Many throughout the south advocated for the region's favorability in the textile manufacturing industries specifically because the south accounted for the vast majority, if not the entirety, of the nation's cotton production. Thus, locating textile refineries near the sources of raw materials made economic sense. The industry gained a foothold prior to the Civil War as mills began opening. In 1860, 1,312 people were employed in textile mills in Alabama. That number plummeted, however, following the war. By 1870, only 744 people were employed in textile mills. B.B. Comer The family contacted the Birmingham Commercial Club, that would later become the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, \\"...which had been organized in 1887 to encourage trade and create more economic diversification...\\" in the extraction focused Birmingham region. The Commercial Club agreed to invest $150,000 (~$4.5 million adjusted for inflation), and civic leader Braxton Bragg \\"B.B.\\" Comer, having been recruited to serve as president of the mill, offered $10,000 (~$300,000 adjusted for inflation) as an investment. B.F. Roden, owner of the Avondale Land Company, provided the land for the mill under the condition that the mill be named \\"Avondale Mills\\". Comer's experience as a banker, miller and cotton farmer made him an ideal candidate for the job. Shortly after he assumed the presidency, The Trainer family abandoned the project before the mills had even opened, and Comer bought out the family's shares and assumed majority control. Through their efforts, they created the first cotton cloth manufacturing plant in Birmingham. Initially, financing the construction of the mills proved troublesome. With high interest rates and scarce available capital, Comer and the Birmingham Commercial Club took out loans from noted Wall Street banker DuMont Clark, and secured funding from J.M. Lewis of Talladega, Alabama who took out $100,000 in bonds for the construction of the mills. = Early years = The early days of the mill were troublesome for Comer and the other principal operators. The first sale of refined materials, placed through a designated selling agency, priced the fabric at 2¬¢ per yard. The program for the sale of refined cloth from the mills allowed for sales to be made through sales agents without approval or permission of the mill president. Comer demanded that the scheme be halted, and mandated that no future sales would be honored without his prior approval. The selling agents balked at his demands and called a meeting of the mills' stockholders to demand Comer's removal from office. The efforts of Frederick Jenks, of Fales and Jenks Machinery Company, kept Comer in office. Comer's staff initially consisted of himself and two other men. Comer wrote his own letters in long-hand script and personally bought, weighed, classified and sold all of the cotton for the mills. By 1898, Avondale Mills employed nearly 400 people as spinners, weavers and mechanics and, additionally, realized a profit of $15,000 (~$450,000 adjusted for inflation). in 1906, Comer was elected Governor of Alabama, however he retained presidency of the mills. By 1907, under the management of Comer's son, Donald Comer, the mills had generated $55,000 (~$1.5 million adjusted for inflation) in profit. The success of the Avondale Mills, and the potential tax revenue that it included, proved critical in passage of the \\"Greater Birmingham\\" movement that incorporated many of the outlying suburbs into the city limits of Birmingham. Following an earlier defeat decades before, the \\"Greater Birmingham\\" initiative came in 1911 before Governor Comer, who subsequently agreed to the majority of its provisions. Birmingham, in one fell swoop, saw its population swell to 132,685 and saw its land area increase to 48 square miles. With the passage of the bill, the city also adopted the commission style of government used until 1963. The improvements to many of the seven outlying suburbs that were incorporated into Birmingham included added transportation infrastructure, better access to social services, and increased sanitation. Donald Comer Avondale Mills had a dramatic effect on the demographic landscape of Birmingham and the surrounding regions. As the price of cotton fell in the latter half of the 19th century, many Alabama farmers found themselves searching for new means of income. Avondale Mills provided steady paychecks and plentiful working hours. While typical farm labor could provide a family with $400 annually (~$10,500 adjusted for inflation), a single person working at the mills could earn up to $700 annually (~$18,500 adjusted for inflation). With the availability of work for all members of the family, income possibilities rose even more. Impoverished black and white workers flocked to the city to work in Comer's mill.  Working and living conditions  Avondale Mill Village, Birmingham Notable among Avondale Mills' achievements were the numerous, uncharacteristic amenities offered to employees and their families. As president of the mills, B. B. Comer continued his tendency towards what has been described as \\"plantation-paternalism\\" by maintaining his involvement in many of the daily, domestic activities of his employees. While many mill owners throughout America provided their workers with housing at that time, the facilities provided by Comer surpassed the standard in terms of both quality and quantity. = Mill village = Avondale Mill Schoolhouse Mill workers generally lived in the Avondale Mill's worker's housing communities, worshiped at the on-site church, and sent their children to the on-site school. B. B. Comer established a kindergarten at the mill, run by his daughters, Mignon, Catherine and Eva. The educational facilities provided by Comer at Avondale Mills far surpassed those offered at other mills throughout America. His schools would often accept children from the surrounding community whose parents did not work at the mills. Comer also established night schools for workers with assistance from the Alabama Department of Education, called Opportunity Schools. Children of employees also received no interest college loans that were generally forgiven if the student graduated. The mill village, consisting of 129 houses in Birmingham, Comer provided was also notable for the quality of its conditions. While most other mill villages in America provided workers with outhouses either behind or between worker houses, Comer introduced interior sanitation facilities. B.B. Comer's son, Bragg Comer, supervised the construction of the Drummond Fraser Hospital, a 35-bed facility, that provided medical care for mill workers. Additionally, workers were charged 75¬¢ each week in rent, while salaries averaged anywhere between $12 to $20 per week. The mill village also included a dairy and a poultry farm for the benefit of the workers. Home ownership in the mill village was available to families. As of 1947, fully 1,100 Avondale employees had bought their own homes, the majority of which owned them without debt of mortgage. Mill workers were paid in cash, but they could also opt to be paid partially in company scrip to be used in the company store. Truly unique for its time, Avondale Mills offered employees $1 of scrip for only 80¬¢. This, effectively, gave employees a 20% discount on all goods bought at the village store as the village store matched its prices with those of stores in downtown Birmingham. = Recreational resorts for mill workers = Cabins at Camp Helen. Panama City, Florida. During the summer, mill workers could enjoy paid vacations at the Panama City, Florida resort purchased by Comer for his employees. Comer closed the mills at different times throughout the summer in order to allow his workers to enjoy the vacation resort at their leisure. In a move truly exceptional for a white business owner in the deeply segregated American south, Comer even provided for his African-American workers to visit the resort, albeit not when white workers were present. Known as Camp Helen, the resort included a large main building and several guest cottages strewn about the property. Avondale Mills also provided Camp Brownie, a recreational facility on the Coosa River for workers to enjoy boating and fishing in their off-time. = Access to amenities = Advertisement from 1948 depicting the equal opportunities afforded to African Americans at Avondale Mills. Avondale Mills was a bright spot in an otherwise dismal landscape of race relations in Birmingham. Out of 8,500 employees in 1947, fully 12%, or about 1,020, were African American, all of whom received equal access to the amenities provided by Comer. The mills' African American workers were noted for being \\"...on exactly the same basis industrially as the white workers...with the same opportunities to share in profits, to own homes and farms, to enjoy recreational and school facilities and to save their money.\\" = Working conditions = Child Workers at Avondale Mills, Birmingham Working conditions at Avondale Mills were generally comparable to other textile mills in America. A product of his time, Comer utilized child labor relatively extensively at Avondale Mills. Alabama state law, at the time, required that no children younger than 12 be employed. Many of the families who moved to Birmingham from more rural, farming communities, were accustomed to children working alongside adults, and they expected their children to do the same at the mills. Conditions at mills, however, were quite different than conditions on a farm. \\"On the farm, children worked hard but at their own pace, with no penalty for stopping. Mill work, however, endangered children because they often did not have the stamina or physical strength to work long hours.\\" Fatigue on a farm could lead to mistakes, but fatigue in a mill could lead to death. Comer argued that it was the parents of the children who wanted them to work, and that he was simply responding to their demands. Comer also actively opposed child labor regulations that would have curbed his ability to employ minors. In 1900, out of a total of 774 employees, 187 were children aged between 8 and 15. Lewis Hines, an American sociologist and photographer studying industrial conditions, visited the mills during 1910 and documented his findings with photographs. Hines' photographs and interviews in 1910 revealed that numerous children were employed at Avondale Mills with \\"mere weeks of education if any.\\" The state law required that children be educated and that none younger than twelve work in factories. At first the children were not \\"officially\\" employed, but were recruited to assist their parents in completing strenuous twelve-hour shifts in the mill. Avondale Mill Band Hines noted numerous examples of child labor and abuse of children at Avondale Mills, including that of the 14 and 15-year-old girls Mary and Miller Gilliam. Their father had removed them from school to work at the mills; he had no job at the time. Hines recorded that \\"none of the children would admit to being younger than 12 years of age \\". He wrote, \\"The Mill bosses...arrived at school anytime during the day to remove children to work at the Mill.\\". When demand for textiles was low, the children were allowed to return to school. The children were a source of cheap labor who could be flexibly employed according to the needs of the mill managers. At 12 years of age, children could begin work at Avondale Mills as bobbin doffers. This was a fast-paced job that required dexterity but little technical skill. The room where the children worked became filled with lint from the operation. This got into their lungs, and the children often later developed brown lung disease as adults. Comer's views would evolve along with national attitudes, however, and he would subsequently support a nationwide ban on child labor in 1934. Having assumed management of Avondale Mills in 1907, Donald Comer embarked on a path of expansion for the mills. He built a new mill in Sylacauga, Alabama in 1913 and named it the Eva Jane in honor of B.B. Comer's wife. The opening of the mill was described as \\"the most important event in the town's history. Donald Comer would later open the Sallie B. No. 1 and Catherine mills in 1919, and the Sallie B. No. 2 in 1926, all in The Mills were generally located in rural areas. Locating the mills so close to the homes of the primary labor pool, that of poor, rural farmers, allowed those farmers to earn higher wages while at the mill than they would otherwise by farming while still maintaining ownership and control of the land.  Mid-20th century  = The Great Depression = Mirroring conditions throughout the United States, worker hours, production and pay rates all saw cuts during the Great Depression. In 1933, labour organizers in Birmingham began unionizing many industries in response to the downturn in conditions. Comer reiterated to Avondale employees the quality of life enjoyed at his mills. Textile workers throughout the state walked off the job 1934 to protest steep declines in wages. In the midst of this larger turmoil, however, only one shift, a night shift in July 1934, walked off the job at any of Comer's plants. Many labor activists considered the Comers, Donald in particular, to be \\"the one shining light\\" amongst Birmingham area business owners. Noted for the \\"very enlightened and benevolent\\" programs available to workers, Avondale Mills escaped much of the labor protests characteristic of textile mills in the 1930s. Many, however, resented the paternalistic nature of the amenities afforded by Avondale. During this time, Comer's views on child labor took on a distinctly more progressive tone. In the early 1930s, he began instituting regulations that prohibited night work for both women and children. In 1934, Comer backed an effort to institute a nationwide ban on child labor.Child Worker at Avondale Mills, Pell City, Alabama. = World War 2 = During World War 2, B.B. Comer was appointed to the War Labor Board to help avoid work stoppages. As companies saw dramatically increased profits during the wartime manufacturing boom, workers throughout the United States began demanding higher wages, and, on occasion, walked off the job. To avoid this situation at his own plants, Comer instituted a profit sharing agreement with his employees wherein, by 1950, over $12 million had been shared with his 7,000 or so workers. = Profit sharing = Profit sharing incentives were introduced to nearly all employees in 1941. Employees were paid a standard wage, on top of which their share of the company's profits were added. In 1947, fully 19.7%, on average, of every employees pay check was from profit sharing income. Profits were split between the company and employees on a 50/50 share basis. A Look magazine article in 1949 described the mills as \\"The Plant That Runs on Happiness.\\" = Post-war years = Donald Comer released management control of Avondale Mills to James Craig Smith, Jr., who expanded the company's production facilities in Georgia and South Carolina.  Later years  Avondale Mills continued throughout much of the 20th century on a path of success. In the early 1980s, the company realized a record $300 million in sales. The company endured turbulent times shortly thereafter, however, and lost $14 million as sales declined 20%. Over the course of 5 years, 4 CEO's came and went until the company was sold to Walton Monroe Mills, Inc. in 1986 for $165 million. Following its sale to Walton Monroe Mills, Avondale Mills and Walton Monroe operated as separate entities until 1993 when the two merged to become Avondale Incorporated. In 1996, Avondale Inc. purchased the Graniteville Company, a textile manufacturer out of Graniteville, South Carolina. Graniteville, SC disaster scene. On January 6, 2005, a serious train derailment at the Graniteville facility caused a massive chemical spill resulting in the deaths of 6 Avondale employees. A speeding Norfolk Southern train hit a poorly aligned track and crashed into a parked locomotive. The crash sent 16 train cars careening into a parking lot next to one of Avondale's data processing centers at the facility. One of the cars, carrying 90 tons of chlorine, ruptured and sent a massive cloud of chlorine gas through the facility and the neighboring town. In all, 9 people died as a result of the crash. In May 2006, following a settlement agreement with Norfolk Southern Railroad, Avondale Mills' CEO, Robert Williams Sr., announced that Avondale Mills would formally close all of its operations. Over 4,000 people in 4 states found themselves unemployed as a result.  See also  * B.B. Comer * Camp Helen * Avondale Mill Village  Notes   References  * Atkins, Leah Rawls.

In his book Scientology: A New Slant on Life, Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote the following passage: In the same book, he also wrote: These passages, along with other ones of a similar nature from Hubbard, have been criticized by Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice as expressions of hatred towards women. However, Baylor University professor J. Gordon Melton has written that Hubbard later disregarded and abrogated much of his earlier views about women, which Melton views as merely echoes of common prejudices at the time. Melton has also stated that the Church of Scientology welcomes both genders equally at all levels‚Äîfrom leadership positions to auditing and so on‚Äîsince Scientologists view people as spiritual beings. The book Scientology: A History of Man by L. Ron Hubbard does not use gender-neutral language. L. Ron Hubbard's discussion of abortion in his 1950 book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health states that abortion and attempts at abortion could cause trauma to the fetus and to the mother in both spiritual and physical ways. Scientologists came to believe that attempted abortions could cause traumatic experiences felt by the fetus, which would later be remembered as memories referred to in Scientology as \\"engrams\\". In the Scientology technique called Auditing, Scientologists are frequently queried regarding their sexual feelings and behaviors. These questions about Scientologists' sexual behavior are often posed to members during \\"security checks\\", a specific form of auditing sessions where individuals are required to document their divergence from the organization's ethics. One of the questions asked in these security checks is, \\"Have you ever been involved in an abortion?\\". In contrast, it has been alleged that if a woman gets pregnant while in the Scientologist organization called Sea Org, she will either be sent to a lower-level organization of Scientology, or be pressured to have an abortion. The Traditional scientology wedding ceremony includes these remarks on men and women: ::Now, (groom's name), girls need clothes and food and tender happiness and frills, a pan, a comb, perhaps a cat. All caprice if you will, but still they need them. Hear well, sweet (bride's name), for promise binds. Young men are free and may forget. Remind him then that you may have necessities and follies, too. Silent birth, sometimes known as quiet birth, is a birthing procedure advised by L. Ron Hubbard and advocated by Scientologists in which \\"everyone attending the birth should refrain from spoken words as much as possible\\" and where \\"... chatty doctors and nurses, shouts to 'PUSH, PUSH' and loud or laughing remarks to 'encourage' are avoided\\". According to Scientology doctrine, this is because \\"any words spoken are recorded in the reactive mind and can have an aberrative effect on the mother and the child.\\" There have been no attempts to prove this medically or scientifically. Hubbard warned against sexual activity (including masturbation) during pregnancy, on premise that sexual activity during pregnancy could damage fetal development, as by producing engrams detrimental to future activity. This view is disputed by some doctors, as Paulette Cooper commented in her book The Scandal of Scientology: These same beliefs form the basis for Hubbard's Silent birth doctrine. According to a Scientology manual on raising children, a couple should be silent before and after coition. Roy Wallis, in 1976 wrote in The Road to Total Freedom that the Scientologist population was 59% male and 41% female, a number referenced on The Auditor, a publication of the Church of Scientology. In 1988, a participant observer study from the University of Copenhagen showed that the average participant in the Church of Scientology Copenhagen was a 35-year-old man. Though the numbers are not great in disparity, ‚Äúthey provide non-census evidence supporting the contention that more men than women become member of CoS,‚Äù Tollefson and Lewis write.

She is known in Nigeria for being the first woman to direct a national newspaper operation and served as editor for two more. She was a Hausa, Muslim, feminist, and advocate for interfaith society, who was known for being an adviser to the Nigerian President on International Affairs and the founding of NGOs, such as Women In Nigeria (WIN) and the Federation of Muslim Women's Association (FOMWAN). Yusuf was killed in the 2015 Mina stampede while on Haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  Personal  Yusuf attended Ahmadu Bello University and founded the organization Women in Nigeria there in the early 1980s.Bilkisu Yusuf was born December 2, 1952. She advanced from her primary education at Ansar Primary School, Kano in 1964 to secondary school at the Government Girls College, Dala, Kano. Yusuf's higher education was in both political science and journalism. She earned her bachelor's degree in political science at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria; her master's degree in political science and international relations from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, Wisconsin, United States; and an advanced degree in journalism from the International Journalism School at Moscow State Institute of International Relations in Moscow, Russia, in 1986.

She was also active in the Bring Back Our Girls, which was aimed at the safe return of the Chibok girls.  Death  A stampede occurred at an intersection in Mina, Saudi Arabia on September 24, 2015, at about 9 a.m. The crowds were on their way from Muzdalifah to Jaramat, where pilgrims cast stones at pillars to symbolize the stoning of the devil during the Hajj. From there they would head to the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Over 2,000 pilgrims were trampled to death during the stampede and almost 200 of those were identified as Nigerian citizens. Bilkisu Yusuf was identified among those killed by the stampede. Other prominent Nigerians who were trampled to death in the stampede include Professor Tijjani El-Miskin.  Context  Pilgrims from Hajj in Mina make their way to the Jamarat Bridge along marked paths.Saudi Arabia is a Middle Eastern country with a population of 27,752,316. It is home to the two of the most sacred mosques in the Muslim religion. One of those is Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, which is the destination of the Hajj pilgrimage. And the other is Medina's Masjid an-Nabawi, burial site of the Prophet Muhammad. The pilgrimage to Mecca is the fifth pillar of Islam and according to its belief should be conducted at least once in every Muslim's life. This pilgrimage is done by thousands of people each year from all across the world. Nigeria is a country in West Africa. Their society has strong patriarchal ties, which leads to much discrimination against women. They also have a problem with extreme poverty and drugs.

Recorded at the Trojan House and Madden Brothers Studio in Los Angeles, California with producer Brandon Paddock. It was released on October 21, 2015 in Japan by VAP and on October 23, 2015 worldwide by independent North American label Hopeless Records. Vena is the second Coldrain album to be released by Hopeless Records, the first being The Revelation, and the fourth album by the band to be released in Japan by VAP. This would be the follow-up to 2013's The Revelation, also to be the first album released worldwide in 2014. It would be their third highest charting album on the Oricon Albums Chart, debuting and peaking at number 9, only behind Fateless which peaked at number 8 and The Revelation, which peaked at number 7. The album spawned five singles, two of which that were released prior to the release of Vena. \\"Words of the Youth\\" in August and \\"Gone\\" the following month. The latter getting substantial air play on radio stations in the United States. The following three singles would all be released in 2016, with \\"Wrong\\" being released in January, \\"The Story\\" in May and the final single \\"Fire in the Sky\\", being released on July 27th. Like its predecessor The Revelation. Vena maintains alternative metal elements which were established in The Revelation, while continuing to further refine their sound and often swaying into a style that is known as metalcore in several songs such as \\"Wrong\\", \\"Words of the Youth\\", \\"Fire in the Sky\\" and \\"Runaway\\", that would end up featuring Jacoby Shaddix from the Grammy nominated rock band Papa Roach on the record that runs a little over 38 minutes long. Background For a good while on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Cryptic tweets would be up such as a random thing about \\"The calm before the storm\\", before being followed up with \\"big things are coming\\". This would lead to speculation of a new studio album, as well with the band later sharing a strange looking logo that would eventually end up being the tattoo on the album cover. \\"Words of the Youth\\" would later be released as a promotional and downloadable single on August 28th, along with the news of the album title, tracklist, album release date and a world tour. However, later teases would also hint at a new music video for the song \\"Gone\\". This would end up being released on September 16th and would come out to critical acclaim and get major radio airplay on Octane, BBC Radio One and Kerrang. The band would start promoting the album by playing the lead single \\"Gone\\" on tour with Bullet For My Valentine and While She Sleeps on a European Tour in September and October 2015.  Critical reception  The album received mixed to positive from several critics. Luke Nuttall of The Sound Board rated the album 7/10 and commented: \\"On this, their fourth album, the sound that Coldrain have gone for doesn't deviate much from what they've tried in the past. Vena is largely a collection of thoroughly modern hard rock, polished up but not entirely without grit and with the odd metalcore flourish appearing throughout. Largely though, the focus is on their sound's melodic aspect, a wise move considering that's what they're undeniably best at. It's hardly the most original concept ‚Äì a sort of midpoint between Bullet For My Valentine and Thirty Seconds To Mars ‚Äì but in terms of what they aim for, they hit all the right targets. The likes of \\"Divine\\" and \\"The Story\\" have enough stormy bluster in their choruses to show exactly why this band are such a huge deal in their home country, while \\"Runaway\\" gallops along with deft riffs before Papa Roach frontman Jacoby Shaddix arrives to steal the show with yet another barnstorming guest appearance to add to his ever growing list.\\" Ali Cooper of Already Heard rated the album 3/5 and stated: \\"Beyond the eventless brevity of chaotic opening title track, vocalist Masato Hayakawa pours every ounce of anguish behind melodic cleans and suffering screams throughout ‚ÄòWrong‚Äô, just the start of a cleverly produced record depicting the damage of a broken heart and a broken mind. Instrumental blueprints laid by their Hopeless Records neighbours The Used burst through the distortion-laden ‚ÄòDivine‚Äô, while the sassy and dominant ‚ÄòPretty Little Liar‚Äô stands tall despite drawing more than a passing resemblance to the aforementioned's ‚ÄòPretty Handsome Awkward‚Äô.\\" The aforementioned critics focused more on the aggressive riffs and harsh vocals of frontman Masato Hayakawa. However, Johnathan Markwell of Mosh went on to compliment the beautiful melancholic vocals: \\" This is most noticeable with lead singer Masato Hayakawa who is able to go from truly aggressive scream vocals to completely melodic chrooning, and he performs pretty much flawlessly.

He is currently a professor at the Schrijversvakschool in Amsterdam. He has written the following historical novels: * Het oog van de basilisk (2000) * De valse dageraad (2001) * De dwaas van Palmyra (2003) * Het fluwelen labyrint (2005) * Koning voor een dag (2008) * De afvallige (2013) * De ommegang (2018) This writer's first three books take place before the Early Modern Period. Het oog van de basilisk's protagonist is Epiphanius Rusticus in the aftermath of the Roman Empire, while De valse dageraar is about Hroswith van Wikala in the Middle Ages, during the first millennium. The third novel De dwaas van Palmyra takes place in the 1st Century and describes the travels of the philosopher Apollonius of Tyana to India, as later seen through the eyes of his student, Damis. Het fluwelen labyrint takes place in Amsterdam during the 1980s. In Koning voor een dag, the protagonist is the historic poet Hipponax, who lived in Ionia during the 6th Century. Hipponax was known for his sharp tongue and his coarse language. For this book, Van Aken used both original fragments from Hipponax as well as fictional Hipponax poems he created himself. Jan van Aken's most recent novel is De Afvallige. It takes place during the time of Julian the Apostate, seen through the eyes of a group of boys belonging to a Christian Sect who ended up being involved in an assassination plot. This large-scale novel covers the period between 350 and 392 C.E.. Van Aken was previously published in the magazines Optima and Nieuw Wereldtijdschrift. His second novel was nominated for the Seghers Literatuurprijs. De afvallige came on the longlist for both the AKO and Libris literature prizes.  References  * \\"Jan van Aken.\\" Letterenfonds.

Cir. 2015) (en banc), 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 14175 (Aug. 13, 2015). the court expanded the doctrine and explained the current meaning of the term. The court said that the problem in divided infringement is determining, when \\"more than one actor is involved in practicing the steps\\" of a method claim of a patent, whether the acts of one actor are attributable to the other actor such that second one is to be held \\"responsible for the infringement.\\" The court said that it would hold one entity responsible for another's performance of method steps in two sets of circumstances: # \\"where that entity directs or controls others' performance\\", and # \\"where the actors form a joint enterprise.\\" In past cases, the court noted that it had held that an actor liable for divided infringement under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(a) only when \\"it acts through an agent (applying traditional agency principles) or contracts with another to perform one or more steps of a claimed method.\\" To those two circumstances, the court held that it would now add a third: > We conclude, on the facts of this case, that liability under ¬ß 271(a) can > also be found when an alleged infringer conditions participation in an > activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a > patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance.

Career  Ostap was a resident artist at the Urban Street gallery in Berlin in December 2012. In an interview about his work, Ostap has said: :\\"5 years ago I found Tape art - the art of gluing sticky tape. I have worked with this media ever since. Very often I mix the Tape Art with other forms of art, for example, Street Art, in which I try to give the impulse to find the new art-forms. Installations with the sticky tape give me the opportunity to present my ideas with the new point of view.\\" Ostap's work is influenced by modern culture and pop culture, politics, society, religion and sex. He cites pop art artists such as Andy Warhol as influences, as well as impressionist artists including Vincent Van Gogh.  Works  Ostap says of his art: :\\"I distance myself from the classic form of street art , like graffiti or tagging ‚Äì with my art, I try to arouse an emotion in the audience, especially positive emotions, like smiles or laughs, or on the contrary ‚Äì to show my personal attitude to the modern culture, politics, society, religion and sex. It does not mean, that in every work there is a great meaning, sometimes, I like to work with abstract forms and minimalist shapes.\\" Although a street artist, Ostap's works have also been exhibited in various projects and galleries.

Together with P.K. Ojong in 1965 he established the Kompas daily, the leading national broadsheet newspaper in Indonesia, where he was editor-in-chief until 2000. Early life and education Oetama was born on 27 September 1931 to a Javanese family of Catholic background, in Jowahan hamlet, Wanurejo village, 500 metres east of the Borobudur temple, Magelang Regency, Central Java, during the Dutch East Indies era. His father was a school teacher in Sleman, Yogyakarta. His parents initially wanted him to be either a priest, or teacher in his father's footsteps. Jakob finished his basic education in Yogyakarta, and continued his education at Seminary High School in Yogyakarta (1951). In his early career, he worked as a teacher in Mardiyuwana Junior High School in Cipanas, Cianjur, West Java, and then at Van Lith Junior High School in Jakarta. He continued teaching while majoring in history education, graduating in 1956. Oetama further studied journalism in Jakarta and graduated in 1959. He also studied at Gajah Mada University, also majoring in journalism, and graduated in 1961. Career Oetama's journalistic career started when he became an editor of Penabur weekly in 1955. In 1963, he established the Intisari magazine with his business partner and also fellow journalist, P. K. Ojong, which was inspired by Reader's Digest. Two years later, on 28 June 1965, also with Ojong, Oetama established the Kompas daily. Oetama and Ojong based the journalistic team of Kompas from the staff they had recruited for Intisari. He successfully managed Kompas throughout Suharto's authoritarian regime (1965‚Äì1998), which repressed the press and media freedom. Especially during the 1970s, when a number of news outlets were censored by the government, Kompas under Oetama approached journalism with caution and reported political issues with a moderating view, and hence largely escaped censorship. One exception was a two-week period in 1978 when Kompas was banned for reporting on student protests, and a conflict erupted between Ojong who would have preferred to close down Kompas to submitting to government demands, and Oetama, who was willing to fall in line with the government. Oetama became the general manager and the leading figure of Kompas following Ojong's death in 1980. Under Oetama's leadership, Kompas grew into a media conglomerate through extensive diversification and reinvestments of profits. By the early 1990s, the group under Kompas consisted of 38 subsidiaries and employed around 10,000 people. Beyond traditional print and publishing businesses the Kompas Gramedia Group under him also expanded into bookstores (i.e. Gramedia), hotels, and some manufacturing. Together with Jusuf Wanandi, Muhammad Chudori, Eric Samola, Fikri Jufri, Goenawan Mohamad, H. G. Rorimpandey dan Harmoko; Oetama also established The Jakarta Post, an English language Indonesian newspaper, in 1983.The Jakarta Post: It is trusted, it is incredible, 25 April 2013. 30th Special Anniversary Issue. Between the 1978 censoring and the fall of Suharto in 1998, Kompas did not publish open criticism of the Suharto government, leading Rosihan Anwar to criticize Oetama's cautious stance as \\"crab journalism\\". Despite this, however, Kompas remained politically autonomous, and still criticized the government with more subtle allusions. Kompas still maintained good relations with government-controlled media outlets and was willing to sanction their journalists or close certain publications instead of triggering conflict with the government or draw public ire ‚Äì one example was the shutdown of the Monitor magazine and the expelling of Arswendo Atmowiloto, which was recommended by a committee chaired by Oetama directly. Oetama remained editor- in-chief of Kompas until 2000, when he selected as his replacement. GlobeAsia estimated the net worth of Oetama and his wife Lilik at US$1.65 billion in 2018, making them the 21st richest Indonesians. Oetama was major supporter of the arts, establishing Bentara Budaya under Kompas Gramedia in 1982 which had galleries in Jakarta, Yogyakarta and Bali. He is a recipient of the Star of Mahaputera, 3rd class in 1973. Oetama had additionally served as an appointee to the People's Representative Council between 1 February 1967 and 1 October 1977, and again in 1997 although he had resigned by 1998. He received an honoris causa in communication from his former alma mater Gajah Mada University on 17 April 2003. Death On 22 August 2020, Oetama was admitted to Mitra Keluarga Hospital in Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, in a critical condition, suffering from multiple organ disorders. He lapsed into a coma on 6 September and died on 9 September at the age of 88 from multiple organ failure. His funeral procession was held on 10 September 2020 at Kompas Gramedia headquarters in Jakarta, broadcast live on Kompas TV and attended by 60 people in compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. He was buried after a procession at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in South Jakarta at the same day. The procession at Kalibata was led by former Vice President Jusuf Kalla.

He is known for his conservative perspective, his atheism, republicanism and efforts for animal rights. He is a member of De Vrije Gedachte. Since 2015, Cliteur is a member of the Dutch political party Forum voor Democratie, where he is chairman of the advisory board and the party's official think tank. In 2019 he was elected to be parliamentary group leader for Forum voor Democratie in the Dutch Senate.Paul Cliteur unaniem gekozen tot fractievoorzitter FVD in de Eerste Kamer, forumvoordemocratie.nl, 4 June 2019 Cliteur has also been on the board of several organisations, including supervisor of the Telders Foundation (think tank of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy), and from 1993 until 1995 chair of the Humanist League (Humanistisch Verbond).  Lawyer and philosopher  Cliteur studied law and philosophy, and graduated on 22 March 1989 with his dissertation Conservatisme en cultuurrecht (\\"Conservatism and cultural law\\", published in 2005 under the title Natuurrecht, Cultuurrecht, Conservatisme, \\"Natural law, Cultural law, Conservatism\\"). From 1995 until 2002, he was Professor of Philosophy at Delft University. He is Professor of Jurisprudence at Leiden University, where he delivered his maiden speech on 28 May 2004 on \\"The neutral state, particular education and multiculturalism\\". His activities mainly include law, cultural history, philosophy and ethics.  Columnist and publicist  Cliteur is mainly known for his opining works, in which he expresses his political views. He served as a columnist for, amongst others, Trouw, and had a spoken column in the TV show Buitenhof. In these, he first and foremost expresses his liberal opinions, his own vision of multiculturism, and also advocates for animal rights. In March 2004, Cliteur told Het Parool in an interview that he felt he was being limited in freely expressing his opinions on Islam after others branded him a \\"racist\\" and \\"stigmatiser\\". This was partly due to an AIVD report, which argued criticism of Islam is counterproductive for the social integration of Muslims. Cliteur felt it necessary to moderate the tone of his spoken columns for Buitenhof. After being criticised for taking this position, he decided to terminate his contributions to Buitenhof completely, because he regarded himself to be no longer credible. An overview of his philosophy is described in Dirk Verhofstadt in gesprek met Paul Cliteur. Een zoektocht naar harmonie (2012), an in-depth interview between Dirk Verhofstadt and Paul Cliteur on Enlightenment values such as the freedom of speech, separation of church and state, the right to self-determination and the equality of every human being.

Quotes  *'[My book Against Decadence] is available at any bookstore, anyone can read it, including jihadists, but I think they can learn a lot from it. I think it's good and that it won't encourage them to commit [terrorist] attacks. But what I am afraid of, is when such a book is summarised as 'It's actually just stigmatising strangers and that is racism', that does somewhat frighten me. And that does induce a safety risk, because types like Volkert van der G. do look at that, and that may be kept in their minds (...).' *'What we should be really cautious about, is that right now we won't be going in the direction ‚Äìand it is going slightly in that direction‚Äì where a kind of identification will arise like: 'Criticism of Islam = criticism of Muslims = racism'.' *'Nowadays, when you attack Catholicism, nobody cares, right? But when it's about Islam, an entire cordon of people will gather around \\"the Muslims\\", thinking they're doing them a service. But I disagree, because things always improve through criticism. And so I think you should be able to subject belief systems to criticism. Liberalism, socialism... you should treat religions the same way we do liberalism. It would be insane if I would say: 'Listen here, I am a liberal! You can't say that about John Stuart Mill, because he provides me with an example!' Or: 'You're now touching my liberal/humanist soul!' No, of course not! You shouldn't. You should freely discuss belief systems, because you respect the people who follow them!'

In 2017, the heart of the district was confirmed as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. History and description  The Neustadt district was created by the Germans during the Reichsland period (1871‚Äì1918) to serve as a new city center. As opposed to the old town on the Grande √éle, which in 1871 had more narrow and crooked streets and less squares than today, the new town was conceived along monumental boulevards and broad, rectilinear streets that were seen as modern, healthy and easy to police. In order to gain the necessary space, several belts of fortifications, mostly dating from the years 1519‚Äì1552, and 1630‚Äì1681, were torn down; remains of these are found with each archaeological excavation in the area. Many architectural styles were used for the construction of the Neustadt, mostly on a grand scale: Baroque Revival, Renaissance Revival, Gothic Revival, Romanesque Revival, often a mixture of several or all of these styles (Historicism). At the end of the 19th century, at the same time as a new building material, reinforced concrete, a new and better defined style appeared as well: Art Nouveau. The Neustadt comprises a number of public buildings and monuments that are today classified as Monuments historiques, such as: *Palais du Rhin, former palace of the German Emperors *University Palace (also the observatory, the zoological museum, the botanical garden etc.) *National and University Library *National Theatre of Strasbourg, the former Parliament building of Alsace-Lorraine *Palais de Justice *Palais des F√™tes *St Paul's Church *Strasbourg railway station *H√¥tel Brion *Villa Schutzenberger *22, Rue du G√©n√©ral de Castelnau *56, All√©e de la Robertsau and also landmarks that are not classified as Monuments historiques (as of 2019), such as the Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Catholic Church.

It flew just before the outbreak of World War II. After the war it was re-engined and flew until 1953. Design and development In 1935 L√©on Lacroix built, in collaboration with G√©rard Trussant, a Mignet Pou-de-Ciel. He then joined with Barrat de Nazaris to design and construct three Pou types and a very small, single seat biplane, the LN-3, named the Microplan. After crashing the latter, de Nazaris decided to leave light aircraft design and Lacroix rejoined Trussant to design and build another biplane, the LT-51 which, with de Nazaris' blessing, inherited the Microplan name. Though another small biplane, the LT-51 was a two-seater with over twice the wing area of its predecessor. It was a single bay biplane with approximately equal span, rectangular plan wings mounted with dihedral only on the lower wing and with marked stagger, so that the single interplane strut on each wing leant forward strongly. These struts had airfoil sections and had extended, faired heads and feet. Inverted-V cabane struts linked the upper wing centre section to the upper fuselage. Long ailerons were fitted only on the lower wing. The Microplan was powered by a geared-down Lef√®vre flat twin engine mounted in the nose with its cylinders projecting for cooling. Behind the nose the fuselage was flat sided with deep, rounded upper decking. Its single, open cockpit was under the trailing edge of the wing and behind it narrowed to the tail. This was conventional, with a tapered, round tipped tailplane and elevators mounted on top of the fuselage. It had a tall, straight edged and round tipped fin and rudder, the latter reaching down to the keel and moving in an elevator cut-out. The biplane had conventional landing gear with each independently mounted mainwheel attached to faired V-struts and to a single long faired strut to the upper fuselage; there was a long tailskid. Its first flight was from Agen on 25 June 1939, piloted by Sauret. In September 1939 it was scheduled to take part in a light aircraft rally at Cahors, piloted by Trussant, which, given international developments, may not have taken place. Hidden, the Microplan survived the war and was re- engined by Frantz Trussant with a more powerful Volkswagen engine in a modified nose, making its first flight on 5 August 1948. In July 1949 it was registered as F-WFKQ in the name of de Nazaris, passing after his death in 1952 to his widow; it was involved in an accident at Biscarosse in March 1953 and de-registered but went on to fly in Spain. It is currently stored, though not on display, at the Mus√©e de l'Aviation L√©g√®re (Museum of Light Aviation) near Revel, Haute-Garonne.

After a 37-year career in Oklahoma, serving as second-in-command of the Works Progress Administration and later designing the Oklahoma Department of Public Welfare's adoption policies, Kull moved to Alaska and became the first social worker to administer service to Native Alaskans in the Aleutian Islands. She also secured the funds for the first child care center in Alaska and directed the first home-health service for the elderly in the State. She was posthumously inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2015. Biography Alice Montgomery was born on May 17, 1897 near Perry in the Oklahoma Territory and was raised in Oklahoma.

After her husband's death in 1953, Kull left public service and began working with the Salvation Army in Oklahoma City until 1959. In 1959, after 37 years of service in Oklahoma, Kull moved to Alaska. She was hired by the Department of Health and Welfare in Anchorage to help in preparation for statehood to plan social services for Alaskan Athabaskans and homesteaders of south central Alaska. Governor Egan sent her to the Pribilof Islands with a directive to help the Native Alakans there transition to federal citizenship. She was the first social worker to attend the needs of peoples living in the Aleutian Islands. In 1961, she transferred from Anchorage to Juneau and was promoted to Child Welfare Supervisor. She secured the federal funds for the first accredited child care facility in the state, which was established in Juneau. She left the service of the State in 1967, moved to Kotzebue and began working with the US Public Health Services Department to provide health services to native Alaskan villages in the bush. After 2 years, she returned to Juneau and established the first accredited home-health service in Alaska, Alaska Homemaker Services, to help the elder community remain in their homes as long as it was feasible. Kull worked with Homemaker until the mid 1970s and in 1976 was appointed to a state Senior Housing Committee. As part of the committee, she was pivotal in attaining senior housing in Juneau and establishing the Older Alaskan's Commission in 1981, serving three terms on the Commission. In addition, she was part of the Planning Committee of the White House Conference on Aging and a representative to the State committee on Services to the Elderly. Kull retired in 1983 but continued her lobbying for women's rights, children's issues, and native rights. Kull died on December 8, 1991 in Juneau, Alaska.

The Financial Times reported in May 2013 that Qatar was becoming a larger provider of arms to the various groups. Since the summer of 2013, Saudi Arabia has emerged as the main group to finance and arm the rebels.Saudi edges Qatar to control Syrian rebel support retrieved 6 June 2013 Saudi Arabia has financed a large purchase of infantry weapons, such as Yugoslav-made recoilless guns and the M79 Osa, an anti-tank weapon, from Croatia via shipments shuttled through Jordan. The weapons began reaching rebels in December 2012 which allowed rebels' small tactical gains against the Syrian army. This shipment was said to be to counter shipments of weapons from Iran to aid the Syrian government. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar have received criticism from the Western Media for backing certain Syrian rebels associated with the Army of Conquest, which includes the al-Nusra front, an al-Qaeda affiliated group. In August 2017, the Syrian opposition was informed by the Saudi foreign minister that the Kingdom was disengaging from them. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia has taken a more conciliatory stance towards the Syrian government.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syria-and-saudi-arabia- to-potentially-reconcile-after-uae-reopens-damascus-embassy/ Croatian weapons M79 Osa anti-tank weapon purchased by Saudi Arabia from Croatia for use in the Syrian Civil War In December 2012, a new wave of weapons from foreign supporters were transferred to rebel forces via the Jordanian border in the country's south. The arms included M79 Osa anti-tank weapons and M-60 recoilless rifles purchased by Saudi Arabia from Croatia. Previously, most of the weapons were delivered via the Turkish border in the north. The goal for the change in routes was to strengthen moderate rebels and to support their push towards Damascus. Timber Sycamore Saudi Arabia was involved in the CIA‚Äìled Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels. A classified US State Department cable signed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported that Saudi donors were a major support for Sunni militant forces globally, and some American officials worried that Syrian rebels being supported had ties to Al Qaeda. Bandar bin Sultan In August 2013 the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan had been appointed to lead Saudi Arabia's efforts to topple Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and that the US Central Intelligence Agency considered this a sign of how serious Saudi Arabia was about this aim. Bandar was described as \\"jetting from covert command centers near the Syrian front lines to the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris and the Kremlin in Moscow, seeking to undermine the Assad regime.\\" After tensions with Qatar over supplying rebel groups, Saudi Arabia switched its efforts from Turkey to Jordan in 2012, using its financial leverage over Jordan to develop training facilities there, overseen by Bandar's half-brother Salman bin Sultan. In late 2012 Saudi intelligence also began efforts to convince the US that the Assad government was using chemical weapons.Adam Entous, Nour Malas and Margaret Coker, Wall Street Journal, 25 August 2013, A Veteran Saudi Power Player Works To Build Support to Topple Assad The Saudi government also would be sending prisoners sentenced to death to fight in Syria.

Early history and ownership The Red Mill was built by Ralph Hunt in 1810, on land he had inherited from his father, Daniel, who had been an early landowner in Clinton and built the Stone Mill across the street in 1763 (now known as the Hunterdon Art Museum).https://hunterdonartmuseum.org/history/ It was in use as a wool processing plant for the first few years, although by 1820, the wool business had failed in the downturn for cloth. Eventually, Hunt's business failed, and he lost hundreds of acres on both sides of the Raritan River. Present day The Red Mill in Clinton New Jersey, as viewed from across the Raritan River.

It draws on the grid-group theory of Mary Douglas, on his fieldwork in Canada, Britain, Israel, and the former Soviet republics, and on his own experience. His work has often centred on workplace crime, and his best-known book, still often discussed, is Cheats at Work (1982). Born Gerald Margolis in Manchester, the eldest of four brothers in a Jewish family,Mars (2015) p. 23 and note 28. The family surname was changed to Mars. he grew up in Blackpool where, leaving school at 15, he worked at stalls on the Golden Mile and Pleasure Beach. After National Service and varied employment he was admitted in 1959 under the mature students' state scholarship scheme to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where his bemused tutor was the classicist W. A. Camps.Mars (2015) pp. 112-124 In 1972 he gained a doctorate in anthropology at London School of Economics, supervised by Raymond Firth, having done fieldwork in 1962-1964 (hosted by the Memorial University of Newfoundland) among the dockers of St John's, Newfoundland. His title was An Anthropological Study of Longshoremen and of Industrial Relations in the Port of St John's, Newfoundland, Canada. From 1966 to 1984 he was a lecturer at Middlesex Polytechnic, then briefly at the Polytechnic of East London. In 1974 he helped to set up the first British campus of what is now ESCP Europe. Retiring from full-time teaching he became a professor at the schools of management and policy studies at Cranfield with part-time professorships at several other universities. For seventeen years he was a part-time consultant at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.Gerald Mars at Cambridge Scholars Publishing In 2003 he was awarded the Lucy Mair Medal by the Royal Anthropological Institute.Lucy Mair Medal Prior Recipients Since 2008 he has been honorary professor of anthropology at University College London,UCL Anthropology: Honorary Staff and since 2010 visiting professor of organisational ethnography at Suffolk Business School.Biography at Suffolk Business School In Becoming an Anthropologist: A Memoir and a Guide to Anthropology he shows how his childhood experiences among Jews and Christians in Manchester, his work at fairground stalls in Blackpool and his National Service in the Royal Air Force steered him towards anthropology.Mars (2015) pp. 1-93 His research at St John's, Newfoundland, at the difficult moment when traditional working practices among longshoremen were doomed to change, impelled him to explore the hidden and unofficial culture of those who work in highly regulated organizations.Mars (2015) pp. 126-142 Soon afterwards he undertook an exploration of the black economy‚Äîthe real economy‚Äîof the Soviet republics.See the title of G. Mars and Y. Altman (1983): \\"How a Soviet Economy Really Works\\", in M. Clarke, ed., Corruption (London: Frances Pinter) He has applied the discipline of social anthropology and extended its methodologies to criminology (particularly workplace crime and sabotage), the economic and social effects of long wave economic cycles, occupational theory and the hotel and tourism industry: the latter was the focus of his jointly authored work The World of Waiters (1984) and of several later studies. Mars is thus one of relatively few scholars who have employed Mary Douglas's neo-Durkheimian Cultural Theory (\\"grid-group theory\\") in work on organizations and have gone on to apply its insights to business management.Altman (2015) His highly innovative study Cheats at Work is frequently cited and discussed.Sieh (1993); Thornthwaite and McGraw (2012); Perri 6 (2015) He has published a collective volume and a number of papers on the anthropology of food, several of them co- authored with his wife, the food historian Valerie Mars.

The company is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Austin, Texas, with regional offices in Reading, UK; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Absolute is a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).https://www.eweek.com/it-management/absolute-software-product-overview- and-analysis History Founded in 1993 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Absolute's primary goal was to create a product that would enable individuals and businesses to manage, track and secure computers regardless of the physical location of the device. In 2000, Absolute became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). In 2005, Persistence technology by Absolute was embedded for the first time into the firmware or BIOS of a computer. This was the start of an ongoing partnership with most major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) where Absolute technology ships with the hardware from the factory. Absolute's regional presence in Europe was first established in November 2006, with an office in Newbury, UK, to expand Absolute's international operations. In July 2009, a second regional office was opened in Austin, Texas, to serve as a base for Absolute's U.S.-based sales team. In September 2012, a third regional office was opened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In 2007, Absolute achieved Gold Certified Partner Status in the Microsoft Partner Program, a distinction provided by Microsoft to technology companies that have demonstrated expertise in Microsoft-based technologies. In December 2009, Absolute announced its acquisition of the LANrev product suite, a comprehensive computer systems management software application, from Pole Position Software. Following the acquisition, the product suite was rebranded as Absolute Asset Management, and eventually renamed as Absolute Manage. In November 2012, Absolute acquired the assets of LiveTime Software, a privately held helpdesk and IT Service Support Management (ITSSM) provider. LiveTime assets were officially relaunched as part of Absolute's expanded product suite in January 2013 as Absolute Service, an IT Service Management (ITSM) solution. Absolute Service received PinkVERIFY ITIL 3 Certification from Pink Elephant. Absolute was identified as a Visionary Vendor in the Gartner Inc. Magic Quadrant for Client Management Tools from 2012 to 2014, and was positioned in the Niche quadrants of the Magic Quadrant for Mobile Device Management Software and the Magic Quadrant for Content-Aware Data Loss Prevention in 2013. In June 2013, Absolute acquired Palisade Systems, a privately-held provider of data loss prevention (DLP) technologies. In October 2013, Absolute launched an integrated student and device protection initiative called Absolute Safe Schools, which educates students and staff of participating schools on the safe use of mobile devices and provides assistance in the event of device loss and theft. Through this program, which operates in conjunction with Absolute endpoint security products, the Absolute Investigations team works with local law enforcement agencies to recover protected devices after a theft. In December 2013, John Livingston stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors at Absolute. Following this announcement, Daniel Ryan took on the role of Chairman of the Board, while Chief Financial Officer Errol Olsen served as interim CEO during the search for a successor. On June 13, 2014, Geoff Haydon was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Director of Absolute. Prior to Absolute, Geoff Haydon served as Chief Operating Officer of EMC Asia Pacific and Japan. Former McAfee executive Christopher Bolin joined Absolute as Chief Product Officer on February 19, 2015, in order to develop Absolute's global product strategy. As part of a comprehensive rebranding strategy, Absolute changed its product nomenclature, renaming Computrace to Absolute Data and Device Security (DDS) in July 2015. On July 16, 2015, Absolute announced its intention to divest Absolute Manage and Absolute Service. The sale of these products to HEAT Software was completed in October 2015 for an approximate gross total of USD$11.0 million. In January 2018, Geoff Haydon left Absolute and Steve Munford was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer.https://www.absolute.com/en/about/pressroom/press- releases/2018/absolute-names-steve-munford-as-interim-ceo-and-announces- preliminary-second-quarter-financial-results On November 2, 2018, Christy Wyatt was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Director of Absolute.https://quotes.wsj.com/CA/XTSE/ABT/company-people/executive- profile/116963699 In January 2020, Absolute was listed by Forbes as one of the Top 10 Cybersecurity Companies to watch in 2020. Products and services Absolute's flagship product is the Absolute Platform, formerly known as Data and Device Security (DDS). Absolute relies on patented Persistence technology, which is embedded into the firmware of most computers, tablets, and smartphones at the factory. The Persistence module is activated once the Absolute agent is installed. If the software client is removed from a device through flashing the firmware, replacing the hard drive, reimaging the device, or resetting the device back to factory settings, Persistence technology will trigger an automatic reinstallation of the software client. Persistence technology is embedded in more than half a billion devices worldwide. Partnerships Absolute has ongoing partnerships with many OEMs globally, who embed Persistence technology by Absolute into the firmware of their devices at the factory. Strategic partnerships include Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett- Packard, and Samsung. Dell was one of Absolute's early customers before becoming a supplier for Absolute. President of Dell Canada Kevin Peesker noted that Dell has \\"been able to be there with them providing them scalable infrastructure\\" as Absolute has grown. This has allowed Absolute to \\"be very efficient in scaling out their business\\" from a Vancouver base on a global level. Absolute has also built an extensive global network of partnerships with resellers, distributors and in-country partners such as CDW, PCM, Insight and InTechnology. Aligning with other technology companies, Absolute has worked closely with leading operating system providers and chipset manufacturers and has collaborated with recognized security companies to create complementary technologies and services. Since 2007, Absolute has maintained its Gold Certified Partner Status in the Microsoft Partner Program. Through this partnership, Absolute incorporated security reporting functionality for Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) into Absolute DDS, a feature that became available in mid-2015. In August 2015, Absolute joined the RSA Ready Technology Partnership program, run by the Security Division of EMC, creating interoperability between Absolute DDS and RSA Security Analytics, an advanced threat detection and forensics platform.

It was one of the major engagements in the Revolt of Ghent (1449‚Äì53). The city was besieged by forces of the rebellious city of Ghent and defended by forces led by Simon de Lalaing, one of the leading captains of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The siege included one of the largest artillery bombardments then seen in Europe. The relief of the town by forces under Philip and his allies opened the way for an attack on Ghent by the Burgundian forces. In 1453 the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Gavere. Background The revolt of Ghent began as resistance of the civic representatives to the growing power of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy over their city, with popular support, particularly over attempts by the Duke, Philip the Good to impose indirect taxes, including a salt tax on the city, similar to the French Gabelle, from 1447. The civic authorities were overthrown by a popular movement that ruled through a general assembly. Most of the major neighbouring towns, afraid of popular revolt in their own locations, sided with the Duke and he declared war on Ghent on 31 May 1452. The Duke attempted to blockade the city by garrisoning surrounding towns, including Oudenaarde, which lies further up on the River Scheldt, which he put under the command of one of his leading captains Simon de Lalaing. Ghent attempted to take these surrounding towns to break the blockade and to form a line of defence against the forces of the Duke and his allies.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good: The Apogee of Burgundy (Boydell Press, 2002), , pp. 303‚Äì19. Course Simon de Lalaing (1405‚Äì77), Burgundian commander of the defence of the city Under the command of three unnamed captains, the Ghenters laid siege to Oudenaarde on 14 April 1453, also occupying Espierres, attacking Aalst and later (on 16 April) unsuccessfully attempting to take Grammont. They threw two bridges over the Scheldt on either side of the city so that they could attack from both banks. De Lalaing prepared to resist the attackers by burning the suburbs of the city.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good: The Apogee of Burgundy (Boydell Press, 2002), , p. 319. The Ghenters transported a large amount of artillery by the river, described by one chronicler as including bombards, cannons, veuglaries, and serpentines. Among these was the huge bombard known as Dulle Griet, which weighed more than 16 tons. The defenders also had a large number of artillery pieces and the resulting artillery duel over the course of the siege was one of the largest seen in Europe until that point.Robert Douglas Smith and Kelly DeVries, The Artillery of the Dukes of Burgundy, 1363‚Äì1477 (Boydell Press, 2005), , p. 128. The defenders organised firewatch parties to counter incendiary projectiles launched into the city at night and tanks of water in the street to put out fires. The attackers used psychological warfare, shooting messages into the city that indicated that De Lalaing was planning to betray the city to them. They paraded two boys, which they claimed were De Lalaing's two sons, captured in a raid into Hainault and promised to kill them if he did not surrender, to which De Lalaing replied with a cannonade. De Lalaing was almost killed when he fell into the river as he was returning from inspecting the watch, but this was unknown to the besiegers.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good: The Apogee of Burgundy (Boydell Press, 2002), , pp. 319‚Äì20. Relief While the siege was underway the Duke mustered his main force at Grammont and his cousin and ally John II, Count of Nevers, his forces at Seclin. The count with 3,000 menPeter Fraser Purton, A History of the Late Medieval Siege, 1200‚Äì1500, Volume 2 (Boydell & Brewer, 2010), p. 292. took the bridge at Espierres and nearby Helchin and then advanced to relieve the city on 24 April. The Ghenters on the west bank of the city fled, abandoning most of their artillery, including Dulle Griet, and their baggage. The rebel forces on the east bank then also fled and were pursued by the Duke's forces to the gates of Ghent. According to the Duke, large numbers were captured and killed. The chronicler Enguerrand de Monstrelet stated that the common opinion was that more than 3,000 Ghenters were killed in the pursuit, while the Count lost only one man, a man-at- arms.Thomas Johnes, ed., The Chronicles of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, Enguerrand de Monstrelet, Volume 2 of The Chronicles of Enguerrand de Monstrelet: Containing an Account of the Cruel Civil Wars Between the Houses of Orleans and Burgundy; of the Possession of Paris and Normandy by the English; Their Expulsion Thence; and of Other Memorable Events that Happened in the Kingdom of France, as Well as in Other Countries ...

The three captains escaped to Ghent, but were executed and five new leaders elected in their place. Aftermath From 1 to 15 May Ghent was bombarded by the Burgundians, who eventually pulled back to Aalst, Dendermonde, and Oudenaarde. The final attack on the rebels was delayed by an embassy from Charles VII of France, peace negotiations, and financial difficulties in paying the ducal army. The next year the rebels were decisively at the Battle of Gavere on 23 July 1453 and signed a treaty, the Peace of Gavere, which restored the traditional government of the city and enhanced ducal authority.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good: The Apogee of Burgundy (Boydell Press, 2002), , pp. 323‚Äì33.

The station building is part of the Macon Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early history Col. Robert L. Berner, a prominent Macon attorney and former state legislator, filed a petition on September 28, 1912, with the Georgia Railroad Commission, asking that the railroads calling at Macon be required to erect an adequate union passenger station in Macon. His efforts culminated in the construction of Terminal Station, which was officially opened in 1916.Terminal Station Opens, April 6, 1917, The Macon Telegraph, Macon, Georgia The Terminal Station building has a limestone exterior, with the main lobby and waiting areas having floors and walls of pink Tennessee marble. Terminal Station encompassed 13 acres and was owned by the Macon Terminal Company. By the mid 1920s, the station dispatched an estimated 100 arrivals and departures per day. The station was served by the Georgia Railroad, Central of Georgia Railway, Macon, Dublin and Savannah Railroad, and Southern Railway. The last trains running from there were the Royal Palm (1970) and the Nancy Hanks (1971).

The farm was moved in 1957 by George G. and Vivian Harris to New Milford. They farmed the land and ran a successful Brown Swiss cattle breeding program. Harris Hill Brown Swiss were shown and sold nationally and internationally. In 1981 George G. Harris started working for the National Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders Association at which time his future son-in-law took over the dairy operation. Harris Hill Farm was a working dairy farm until 1987. Upon George G's retirement, the Harris family started a pumpkin patch. George, Vivian, their children and grandchildren all contributed to the operation. Upon the death of George G and Vivian Harris, the next generation of The Harris Family (George O, Susan, and Janet) continues Harris Hill Farm. In 2012 the Harris Family sold the development rights to 79 acres of the farm to the Town of New Milford and State of Connecticut. Hay is produced by the family, a local farmer leases fields to grow feed corn, another local farmer leases pastures to raise sheep and The New Milford Youth Agency uses one field to raise garden vegetables for their summer program.

It was a significant habitat for water birds and the lakes were used for fishing. A suggestion about draining the mire was first presented in 1898. The mire was drained in 1902‚Äì10.

Riis depicting a trench used as a mass grave for tenement residents who died during the period of mass immigration in New York.  Immigrants and Economic Degradation  Immigrants especially refuge in the tenements during the massive immigration through Elis Island. However, due to the large influx of people immigrating to the United States, the tenement plan shortly failed. There was simply not enough room, resources, or economic stability for people, including children, to survive. Soon, many were unable to afford food and other basic necessities. This eventually led to the bigger problem of not being able to afford living in the already crowded tenements. The depraved poverty that spread throughout New York was the ultimate catalyst in the death toll. Immigrants were already faced with many challenges moving to the United States, on top of the economic state that they came to it in. This helped foreshadow the magnitude of deaths that would occur.  Poverty and Death  One of the many horrors that occurred in the tenements of New York were the trenches that were often found. These trenches were used as unmarked, mass graves for those who died in the tenements. Due to the massive amount of poverty suffered by those who were living in tenements, death occurred at a rapid rate, linking poverty and the trenches closely together. People were not able to afford anything; however, they were able to live inside the tenements. Death spread quickly, affecting people's lives at tenements, and ultimately, leading to their bodies being dumped in the trenches.  Analysis  The picture illustrates the depth in which the trenches were created in order to accommodate the body count-nearly three stories deep. Many of the bodies were stacked on top of one another, illustrating those who cannot afford and survive. Death was a matter of impact to housing towards the immigrants. There was nowhere else to get rid of the corpses once they die except for trenches, even if they pass away inside the tenements. The trenches were a symbol of not only the government and wealthy people's contribution (or lack thereof) to the state New York was in, but the poverty that was suffered by the other half.

She was owned and bred by Robert Cowell and trained by Michael Stoute. She did not race as a juvenile but emerged as a top-class middle-distance performer in 1985, winning three of her six races including the Ribblesdale Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks. She was retired at the end of the season and had modest success as a broodmare. Background Sally Brown was a \\"lengthy, angular\\" chestnut mare with a narrow white blaze and bred by her owner Robert Cowell at his Chevington Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was one of the best horses sired by Posse, a Kentucky-bred stallion who won the St. James's Palace Stakes and Sussex Stakes in 1980. Posse's other progeny included the Coronation Cup winner Sheriff's Star. Sally Brown's dam Unsuspected was a successful racemare who won eight races between 1974 and 1976. As a broodmare she produced several other winners including Shoot Clear (Waterford Candelabra Stakes), Untold and Mohican Girl (Gala Stakes). She lived until the exceptionally advanced age (for a Thoroughbred) of 36, dying in June 2008. The filly was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Beech Hurst stable in Newmarket and was ridden in her major races by Walter Swinburn. Racing career =1985: three-year-old season= Unraced as a two-year-old, Sally Brown made her debut in a maiden race over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse in April and finished second to Northern Aspen (later to win the Prix d'Astarte and the Gamely Stakes). In May the filly was moved up in distance for a maiden at Haydock Park and recorded her first success as she won by three lengths from the colt Sharp Noble. Sally Brown was then stepped up in class for the Group Two Ribbesdale Stakes and started the 7/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Little Deep Water, Grace Note (runner-up in the Lingfield Oaks Trial), Goody Blake (runner-up in the Lupe Stakes) and Silver Dollar. Ridden by Swinburn she tracked the leader Little Deep Water before taking the lead a furlong out. She drew away from her opponents in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Graecia Magna with a gap of four lengths back to Goody Blake in third place. The filly was sent to Ireland and moved up to Group One level for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse on 13 July and started second favourite behind Dubian, a filly who had finished third behind Oh So Sharp and Triptych in The Oaks. In a slowly-run race, she was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Helen Street, Alydar's Best (winner of the 1984 Grand Crit√©rium) and Dubian, beaten four lengths by the winner. Sally Brown faced Helen Street and Alydar's Best again when she was one of seven fillies to contest the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse on 20 August. The other runners included Kiliniski (winner of the Lingfield Oaks Trial and fourth in the Epsom Oaks), Helenetta (Cheshire Oaks), Cold Line and Petradia. Helen Street started the 8/11 favourite ahead of Alydar's Best and Kiliniski with Sally Brown fourth choice at odds of 6/1. Sally Brown raced in third place behind the outsiders Cold Line and Helenetta before taking the lead early in the straight. She was strongly challenged in the final furlong but stayed on strongly to win by three quarters of a length and a head from Kiliniski and Helen Street. In September Sally Brown was sent to France to run in the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. After looking likely to be involved in the finish on the final turn, she faded badly in the straight and finished unplaced behind Walensee. Assessment In 1985, the independent Timeform organisation gave Sally Brown a rating of 120, placing her 11 pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year-old filly Oh So Sharp. In the official International Classification she was rated on 79, making her the fifth-best three-year-old filly in Europe over 11 furlongs+. Breeding record Sally Brown was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. Between 1988 and 1998 she produced at least eight foals and three winners: *Desert Queen, a bay filly, foaled in 1988, sired by Green Desert. Unraced. *Anne Bonny, bay filly, 1989, by Ajdal.

Altshuler was the Director of the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program and the UCLA Women's Life Center, each being part of the Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA. Education and early career Altshuler received both her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1978) and her M.D. degree (1982) from Cornell University, where she was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. From 1982 - 1983 she interned at UCLA's Center for Health Sciences/Wadsworth Veterans Administration. She completed her residency at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital in 1986. Altshuler completed a two-year fellowship at the Biological Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) from 1987‚Äì1989. During her residency, Altshuler completed several postmortem and clinical research projects while in training with mentors Arnold Scheibel, M.D. and Jeffrey Cummings, M.D. These foreshadowed her interests in neuroscience and led to her fellowship in Washington D.C. At the NIMH intramural laboratories, she continued this work, completing several projects related to postmortem differences in the brains of patients with schizophrenia and mood disorders. She cemented her clinical interest to study patients with bipolar illness during her fellowship in biological psychiatry at NIMH. There, she was a pioneer in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an in vivo technique to assess structural changes in the brains of patients with psychiatric disorders. In 1989, Altshuler joined the UCLA Department of Psychiatry faculty, where she has been a professor for more than 25 years. She has consistently played a major leadership role in the research, teaching/mentoring, and clinical care missions of the Department of Psychiatry at UCLA, as well as the broader global community of psychiatrists and psychiatric research. Research interests Altshuler has developed and pursued clinical and basic research in three primary areas: neuroanatomic and cognitive abnormalities in the major psychoses, course and treatment of bipolar illness and pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders specific to women. Altshuler's research on neuroanatomic abnormalities in patients with severe mental illnesses has focused on both the gross and histologic/receptor level and has identified the specificity of abnormal brain functioning for a given psychiatric disorder and phase of illness. For example, she was the first to identify that the amygdala is activated when bipolar patients enter a manic state and lower among patients in a depressed state. She concurrently demonstrated that orbitofrontal activation is persistently lower among persons with bipolar disorder, a trait-like reaction. These findings differentiate bipolar disorder from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These findings regarding basic brain functioning complement her clinically-focused research which has improved the quality of care for persons with bipolar disorders. She has conducted several multi-site collaborative studies evaluating the optimal medication and treatment strategies for persons with bipolar disorder. For example, most psychiatrists withdraw treatment with antidepressants after symptoms remit following a depressive episode. However, her work has demonstrated that patients who achieve a positive acute antidepressant response to 10 weeks of antidepressant treatment adjunctive to a mood stabilizer will probably maintain response with the same continued treatment with risk of manic episode no higher than the reported rate for patients on mood stabilizer monotherapy. She has also devoted her career to focusing on how these disorders are best managed among women in different phases of their life. In particular, she has studied non-depressed women (who have previously had at least one episode of unipolar depression), following them during pregnancy and the post-partum period. Her work found that women who discontinued antidepressant medication relapsed significantly more frequently (68%) over the course of their pregnancy compared with women who maintained their medication (26%). This study dispelled the myth that pregnancy was protective against depression and, more importantly, provided an evidence-based foundation for women and their physicians to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing versus discontinuing antidepressant medications during pregnancy. Over the last 25 years, the importance of this work has been recognized by National Institutes of Health (NIH), as she has received more than 22 federal grants supporting this work. Concurrently, the Veterans Administration also provided a series of grants. She has received both support to advance her career, recognizing her leadership in psychiatry, as well as large randomized controlled trials and basic neuroscience grants to advance our understanding of how brain functioning differs between persons with a psychiatric disorder and not. In addition to NIH funding, she has received a series of grants from private foundations (e.g., Stanley Foundation, MSST Foundation, and Swift Foundation) and small grants from pharmaceutical companies (Abbott, Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Solvay). These awards supported not only her own research, but allowed her to train the next generation of psychiatrists in clinical research. Career As Director of the UCLA Mood Disorder Research Program, Altshuler created a collaborative clinical research infrastructure within the Department of Psychiatry that would span both the UCLA and the Veterans Administration, Brentwood sites. The Mood Disorders Research Program focuses primarily on the etiology and treatment of bipolar disorder and major depression. The Women's Research Program is an adjunct to the Mood Disorders Research Program that has attracted national attention with its focus on depression during phases of life specific to women. Altshuler has mentored approximately 8-12 people per year, from new graduates to junior faculty. She has cultivated the careers of both fellows and junior faculty who have published productively, received academic appointments and created research programs at prestigious universities and received federal funding under her mentorship. Publications Over the past 30 years, Altshuler has published over 265 articles in peer-reviewed journals, 25 chapters in edited volumes, has been invited to give more than 50 major plenary addresses and lectures and her research has been presented in 175 posters and abstracts at national and international meetings. More than 15 of her published articles reviewed a specific scientific issue, providing new insights and analyses to the psychiatric clinical or research community. She has repeatedly published in the most prestigious journals for both medicine (Journal of the American Medical Association, Brain) and psychiatry (Archives of General Psychiatry, American Journal of Psychiatry, and Biological Psychiatry). In addition, she has published more than 27 letters to respond and comment on cutting edge research by others.

She was 16 years old. The suicide was filmed by a Brazilian news show, Aqui Agora (Here Now) and shown on the SBT network. This broadcast led to skyrocketing ratings, and a national conversation about the sensationalized, violent and amoral nature of that news show. Death On July 5, 1993, Daniele Lopes, despondent from a recent romantic break-up, climbed out on a 7th story parapet of an office building where she worked as a receptionist. While contemplating her fate, police and a news crew arrived and started filming. The events were filmed until after the girl jumped, but the scene was cut before she reached the ground. When the unedited footage was shown on Brazilian national television, it caused a spike in ratings. Lopes' youth and broken heart may have romanticized and contributed to the interest in the incident. An edited version of the suicide was also shown on American television, with commentary. Aftermath The Brazilian psychiatrist Jacob Pinheiro Goldberg was a prominent critical voice of the broadcast, stating it may cause a societal desensitization effect, and psychoanalyst Jurandir Freire Costa referred to the media as vultures. Other communication experts were also critical. In 1994, the Alves Lopes family reached a 1.05 million dollar settlement with SBT network for moral damage.

It is useful to this process due to its high refractive index. Thoriated glass is radioactive due to the inclusion of thorium dioxide, oxide of radioactive element thorium. It has therefore been succeeded as a material of choice by glass including lanthanum oxide. Thoriated glass can contain up to 30% by weight of thorium.http://www.irpa.net/irpa3/cdrom/VOL.3B/W3B_13.PDF Robert C. McMillan & Steven A.

Many Kodak and Asahi Takumar lenses that were produced prior to the 1960s are radioactive. Radiation browning Over extended time periods, thoriated glass may develop significant discoloration. This is due to induced F-centers forming in the glass as the radioactive decay of the thorium progresses. The formation of F-centers is due to the ionizing effect of the high energy thorium decay products. This process can potentially be reversed by annealing the glass or exposing it to light.

It was founded in 2001 by Shannon and Jamie Pitts, who were living in San Ramon, California, and had hired au pairs in the past to take care of their children. By 2013, the firm had connected more than one million families and caretakers. History GreatAuPair was founded in 2001 by Shannon and Jamie Pitts, residents of San Ramon, California. The couple had for a couple years enlisted the help of au pairs to relieve Jamie from taking care of their children. According to their account, they decided to help other parents do likewise by starting a website that allowed families and au pairs to find each other. Jamie Pitts conceived of the idea, and Shannon Pitts helped start the company after his employer, a dot-com company, failed. He aimed for a new job that would enable him to spend more time at home and with his family. His former job had required him to commute two hours each day to San Jose, California. In July 2002, GreatAuPair had 7,000 registered users. In December 2003, it had connected more than 60,000 families and au pairs. In October 2008, the company had 6,000 families and 17,000 au pairs. By 2013, the company had matched more than one million families and caretakers. In 2007, multiple consumers using GreatAuPair were scammed into sending money to au pairs or families who said they needed money. The firm issued a press release reminding users to be wary of sending money to people in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and other developing countries. In December 2010, Princess M√§rtha Louise of Norway and her husband Ari Behn found a native English-speaking au pair for their children Maud Angelica Behn, Leah Isadora Behn, and Emma Tallulah Behn through GreatAuPair. In 2011, GreatAuPair became a division of InteliMark Enterprises, which was based in Gardnerville, Nevada. In 2019, GreatAuPair and the 14 other companies permitted by United States Department of State to hire au pairs acceded to a $65.5 million settlement to a class-action lawsuit begun in 2014. The lawsuit accused the companies of colluding with each other to pay au pairs the same wage throughout the United States: for a 45-hour workweek, they would be paid $197.75 per week and be provided shelter and food. The companies said that the $4.35 per hour wage did not take into account the food and shelter and said they complied with what the State Department suggested they pay. They did not agree to being at fault in the settlement but promised that they would tell parents and nannies that the pay can be discussed. GreatAuPair is based in Austin, Texas. Services Users create GreatAuPair profiles containing their resumes, images, and essays explaining their child-raising beliefs. Although user profiles can be reviewed without charge, consumers have to pay to receive their contact details. The company provides details about visas and does background checks on all au pairs from the United States. The company also matches people with elder caretakers, babysitters, pet sitters, house sitters, and tutors. Commentary In 2006, journalist Armin Brott wrote in his \\"Ask Mr. Dad\\" column that along with Craigslist and Nanny Locators, GreatAuPair was one of the \\"best resources\\" for finding nannies or babysitters. Jason Vollmer and Lisa J. Vollmer wrote in their 2007 The Princeton Review book What to Do with Your Psychology or Sociology Degree that GreatAuPair is \\"a fairly comprehensive site featuring nanny and au pair openings within the United States and abroad\\". In their 2013 Let's Go book Let's Go Europe 2013, members of the Harvard Student Agencies wrote that GreatAuPair was \\"an easy-to-use, US-based organization that matches au pairs with families across the world\\". In their 2013 Let's Go book Let's Go Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, they wrote that GreatAuPair was \\"one of the most trusted international job matching sites around\\". The au pair program is managed by the United States Department of State as an \\"exchange visitor program\\", but critics argue that it works instead as a guest worker program. Noy Thrupkaew of The Washington Post wrote in 2016 that GreatAuPair reflects this divide. On the one hand, GreatAuPair tells families seeking nannies that au pairs are \\"one of the most affordable childcare options available, especially if you have a gaggle of kids\\". On the other hand, GreatAuPair tells au pairs that they get the chance to travel to \\"great cities, improve your English, and learn more about American culture\\". Thrupkaew said that GreatAuPair's messages \\"can lead to clashing expectations and disputes\\".

Biography Itaya Hazan was born in Shimodate, Ibaraki Prefecture, as Itaya Kashichi. His father was a soya sauce maker, and he was the youngest of eight children. His alias Hazan, meaning \\"wavy mountain\\", comes from the landscape of his native area. In 1889, he entered the Tokyo Art School, where he studied sculpture under K≈çun Takamura and Tenshin Okakura. Subsequently, he taught sculpture at the Ishikawa Prefectural Industrial School in Kanazawa. In 1898, the school closed, and Hazan started to study traditional ceramics of China and eventually to work on ceramics. He published a sketchbook Twelve Shapes of Ancient Ceramics in the same year. In 1903, he moved to Tokyo to the Tabata Artists and Writers Village and started to work under the name Hazan. His assistant there was Fukami Sanjiro, and, after Sanjiro left in 1910, Genda Ichimatsu, who stayed an assistant until his death in 1963. Before the 1900s, Japanese ceramics followed traditional patterns, and the pieces were often anonymous. There was no distinction between fine and applied arts, in the same sense as they were distinct in the West. Hazan was one of the first artists who integrated them with the European (most notably the Art Nouveau) style, thus creating modern Japanese ceramics. Hazan's early work featured relief carved decoration and paid attention to light. Hazan extensively used color throughout his career. He developed two styles in ceramics, saiji and hokosaiji. His first (group) exhibition was in 1906 at the Japan Art Association. At the 1911 Nationwide Ceramics Exhibition Hazan won the top prize. In the 1910s, ceramics started to develop commercially. Hazan was not happy with this development and decided to withdraw from exhibitions, developing it like fine art instead. In the 1930s, he moved to the classical Chinese tradition. In 1954, Hazan became the first potter to be awarded the Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho), the top merit for an artist in Japan. In 1960, he rejected an invitation to become a Living National Treasure. The largest collection of Hazan's work is hosted by the Idemitsu Museum of Arts.

Best known for his award-winning 1967 short film A Place to Stand, he also pioneered the multi-dynamic image technique used in films and television shows. Early years Chapman was born in Toronto, shortly after midnight on January 24, 1927, and just minutes after his twin brother, Francis. They were sons of distinguished architect Alfred Hirschfelder Chapman (of Chapman and Oxley) and concert pianist Doris Chapman. Christopher spent a year in England in the 1950s designing cars for the Ford Motor Company before returning to Canada and becoming a filmmaker. Christopher and his twin had four elder siblings, Philippa, Howard, Robert and Sally. Another brother, Julian, died in infancy. Film innovator Over his career, he made approximately 40 films for television, the National Film Board of Canada, theatrical release, tourism organizations, science centres and international expositions. Chapman's first film, The Seasons, won the Canadian Film of the Year at the Canadian Film Awards (CFA) in 1954. His film A Place to Stand received two Academy Award nominations and won for Best Live-Action Short in 1968. It also won the CFA Canadian Film of Year. The film featured the multi-dynamic image technique which used moving panes of moving images within the single context of the screen. Over a year of filming, Chapman shot of film, which he edited into 18 minutes, though the images moving across the screen were the equivalent of an hour and three-quarters of film. The process exhausted Chapman and he was still unsure of using it until its first screening occurred. \\"There were a couple of stenographers, who were eating their lunch watching the screening, and they were agog,\\" Chapman stated. \\"But I wanted to run. I was exhausted and thought it was a failure, but a chap grabbed me as I was going out the door. He'd been standing at the back of the screening room and said he was blown away by it. It was Steve McQueen.\\" In 1968, McQueen starred in The Thomas Crown Affair, directed by Norman Jewison, a film that used Chapman's split-screen technique. Jewison added the multiple- image sequences into the film after seeing A Place to Stand. Over the years since, many films and television series have used the technique, with the most recent known to be the American series 24, which, by using the technique, documented the simultaneous actions of its characters. Personal life Chapman resided in Uxbridge, Ontario, at the time of his death, with his wife of 44 years, Barbara-Glen Chapman (n√©e Kennedy). He died on October 24, 2015, at ReachView Village, a long-term care facility in Uxbridge. He was 88. He was survived by his wife and son Julian Chapman (former Deputy Commander of 4th Canadian Division, Canadian Army Brigadier General). Honors In addition to his film honors, Chapman was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in 1987 and awarded a Doctor of Laws by Ryerson University in 2000. Chapman served as president of both the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Directors Guild of Canada. He was also a member of The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto.

Life The Franciscan Order supposedly reached Nottingham in 1230, settling in the Broad Marsh.. The son of well-off parents, William entered the order early in life and may have attended Robert Grosseteste's lectures at Oxford. His brother Augustine also joined the Franciscans. He served under Pope Innocent IV and followed the pope's nephew Opizzo east when he was appointed Latin Patriarch of Antioch. While there, Augustine served as bishop of Laodicea.. Without holding lesser offices,. William was appointed vicar of Haymo of Faversham, the third Minister Provincial of England in 1239,. and was elected to succeed him upon Haymo's promotion to Minister General of the Order in 1240. As Minister Provincial, he appears in the chronicle of his friend Thomas of Eccleston as a helpful and wise cleric with good humor and strong force of character, \\"thinking nothing of incurring the anger of the powerful for the sake of justice\\". He was a contemporary of William of Esseby. and enlarged the Franciscan houses at York, Bristol, and Bridgwater.. He resisted other proposed expansions, however, with the admonition \\"I did not become a friar for the purpose of building walls\\".. He had the roof removed from the London chapel and the embossments on its cloister scraped away but provided lecturers from the universities to visit all the larger convents. He resisted inroads by the Dominicans, traveling to the papal court in 1244 to obtain a letter restraining their proselytizing. (He probably attended the general chapter at Genoa. during this trip, although Eccleston's account of its activities seems to have been mistaken.) In 1250, John of Parma held a chapter at Oxford, taking a referendum as to whether William should be confirmed in or deposed from his post; the vote was unanimous in his favor. Little states that he was supported by the general chapter at Metz the next year and, probably at the same time, carried a decree rejecting Pope Innocent IV's laxer ' in favor of Gregory IX's '. Mellors states that he was deposed by the Council of Metz nine years after taking office. En route to the papal court, his ' contracted the plague at Geneva or Genoa. William remained and tended to him, catching the infection himself and dying around July 1254. Mellors claims he was buried in Marseille. The English Franciscans, indignant at his deposition, had meanwhile re√´lected him unanimously. He was succeeded in his position by the Minister Provincial of Germany, Peter of Tewkesbury.The Friars, p. 242. Works \\"A Good Sermon on Obedience\\" (),Cambridge Pembroke MS 265 fol. 192-6. copied in the style of the 3rd quarter of the 13th century, is attributed to William. On the authority of Eccleston, he is also responsible for A Concordance of the Four Gospels or Concordance to the Evangelists.. This William is also often credited with a Commentary on the Gospels which remained well known for centuries, but it should be properly attributed to the later English Minister Provincial also known as William of Nottingham.

Roman Catholicism About 17.2% of the population (18.5% of the citizenry) is Roman Catholic. Roman Catholicism made a brief appearance in Ivory Coast in the mid-seventeenth century and reappeared two centuries later when French missionaries began to work among the Agni. The first African Roman Catholic mission in Ivory Coast was established in 1895, and the first African priest was ordained in 1934. In the 1980s, the Roman Catholic Church operated seminaries and schools throughout the country. Although Ivory Coast is officially a secular state, the president expressed pride in Abidjan's large Roman Catholic cathedral and alone funded construction of a basilica at Yamoussoukro, his birthplace, by 1990. Some villages have also adopted patron saints, whom they honor on both secular and religious holidays. Protestant In 2014 about 11.8% of the population (14.5% of the citizenry) describes themselves are Evang√©lique which is probably best translated as Protestant with a further 1.7% (2.1% of the citizenry) as Methodists. Also 0.5% of the population described themselves as following Harrism and 0.4% as following the Celestial Church of Christ. =Harrism= The largest Protestant religion as of the mid-1980s was Harrism, begun in 1914 by William Wade Harris, a Liberian preacher who proselytized along the coast of Ivory Coast and Ghana. Harris set an example for his followers by leading a simple life and eschewing conspicuous wealth. He condemned the use of amulets and fetishes as idolatry, and he preached against adultery, theft, and lying. His was a simple, fairly austere form of Christianity, which was open to Roman Catholics and Protestants and did not preach open defiance of colonial authority. In 1915 Harris was expelled from the region by an uneasy colonial governor, an action that revitalized his church, leaving dozens of small \\"Harrist\\" churches along the coast. A decade later, Methodist missionaries made contact with Harris and attempted to continue his work among the lagoon peoples. Harris succeeded in part because of his ethnic background‚Äîhe was African but not Ivoirian‚Äîbut also because he converted women as well as men‚Äîa practice that had been scorned by earlier Christian missionaries who failed to recognize the impact of matrilineal descent on an individual's spiritual life. Harrism was subsequently recognized as a branch of Methodism. Most widely recognized among the syncretic religions of the country are numerous offshoots of Harrism along the coast, where new prophets, preachers, and disciples blend traditional beliefs, Harrism, and modern-day political advice to help deal with the problems of everyday life. =Latter-day Saints= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims more than 43,000 members in 211 wards or branches in Cote d'Ivoire. They also have 27 family history centers in Cote d'Ivoire.

Political career =Tony Benn's leadership campaigns= During the Labour Party's early years of opposition following the defeat of James Callaghan's Labour government in 1979, Lansman worked as the \\"chief fixer\\" for Tony Benn. He was a prominent member of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy and worked with Benn on his campaign during the 1981 Labour Party deputy leadership election. He was also the Secretary of the Rank and File Mobilising Committee, which was the primary campaigning organisation for Benn. Although Benn was not elected, Lansman was successful in his election to the Labour Co-ordinating Committee. During the deputy leadership election campaign, on the Weekend World discussion programme of 21 September, Denis Healey wrongly accused Lansman of organising the severe heckling of speeches he had given in Cardiff and Birmingham. Lansman denied this was the case, as he had been in Spain during the Cardiff meeting and travelling to Aberystwyth during the Birmingham meeting. Healey later apologised for his mistake. According to Lansman, the producers of Weekend World, London Weekend Television, accepted he had been slandered and made an out of court settlement. Mervyn Jones identified Lansman as part of a group on the left that were \\"quite prepared to see a right-wing breakaway as the necessary cost of swinging the party in what they saw as the desired direction\\". Alongside Vladimir Derer and Victor Schonfield, Lansman was described as \\"unreservedly dedicated\\", with \\"no political ambitions of [his] own\\" and \\"in a position to work day and night for the cause without pay\\". Lansman later organised Benn's campaign in the 1988 Labour leadership election, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Neil Kinnock. From 2010, Lansman worked as a researcher for Michael Meacher. In 2010, Lansman became the editor of the left-wing website, Left Futures. =Leadership of Jeremy Corbyn= Lansman volunteered for Jeremy Corbyn's leadership campaign in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, and was the sole director of Jeremy Corbyn Campaign 2015 (Supporters) Ltd, an official campaign company that held the data collected by the campaign. During the election, he was criticised for posting a link on Twitter to a Facebook page depicting rival candidate Liz Kendall as a future Conservative Party leader. A Corbyn campaign spokesperson commented: \\"Jon Lansman's tweets are not on behalf of the campaign. We discourage all Jeremy Corbyn supporters from joining in with spoof websites or social media.\\" Following Corbyn's election as leader, Lansman was a founder of the campaign group Momentum. Before the Labour Party Conference in late September 2015, Lansman was defeated by Michael Cashman and Gloria De Piero in an election for membership of the Conference Arrangements Committee, the body that sets the agenda for the Conference. Lansman is reported to be a supporter of mandatory reselection for Labour MPs. In October 2015, he denied rumours that he was planning to stand to be the Labour Party candidate in Michael Meacher's constituency of Oldham West and Royton, following Meacher's death. Labour, Israel, Palestinians and Jews Lansman was interviewed by The Jewish Chronicle in January 2016. He was asked about attitudes to Israel in the Labour Party and the attitudes of Jews towards it: \\"Yes, of course the vast majority of British Jews are supportive of Israel as a Jewish state ‚Äì and actually so is Jeremy ‚Äì but they are far from supportive of all aspects of what is currently happening there\\", he said. \\"I think Jews in Britain want peace too. I think Jeremy's message of fairness for the Palestinians is not something that will be rejected by the Jewish community.\\" At the end of April 2016, after long-standing Corbyn ally Ken Livingstone had made comments which led to his suspension from Labour Party membership, Lansman was quoted as saying: \\"A period of silence from Ken Livingstone is overdue, especially on antisemitism, racism and Zionism. It's time he left politics altogether.\\" A few days later, in early May, he wrote on the Left Futures blog that the use of the term Zionist to describe supporters of the government in Israel was \\"counter-productive\\". He cited one poll of British Jews which found 71% favoured a Palestinian state and 75% opposed the Israeli settlements, while 68% still identified as Zionists. A \\"rational debate about how to change the terms of the current debate\\" requires, in Lansman's opinion, an acknowledgement \\"that people on the left may also demonstrate some prejudice of their own.\\" \\"I think progress has been uneven; let's put it that way\\", he said in September 2016. Recent developments in Labour concerning antisemitism have \\"clearly taken us back as well as forward\\" he added, citing the Chakrabarti Inquiry as an example of the latter. In 2018, Lansman criticised the Jewish Voice for Labour group at the Limmud Festival.Simon Rocker. \\"Jon Lansman faces sceptical audience at Limmud\\" Jewish Chronicle 24 December 2018.https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jon-lansman-faces-sceptical-audience- at-limmud-1.474283 Lansman argued that ‚Äúthe most influential antisemitism- deniers, unfortunately, are Jewish anti-Zionists‚Äù and that JVL \\"is an organisation which is not just tiny but has no real connection with the Jewish community at all,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt represent the Jewish community in a way that the Jewish Labour Movement clearly does represent the Labour wing of the Jewish community.\\" In May 2020, Lansman announced that he will step down as the chairman of Momentum the following month. In July 2020, Lansman apologised for criticising ex-Labour staffers who had appeared on BBC Panorama's programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic, following the Party's decision to apologise for similar comments, which they said had been \\"false and defamatory\\". This response contrasted with that of Momentum and that of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said it was a \\"political decision, not a legal one\\" to apologise and pay damages to the staffers.https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/jon-lansman-apologises-for-joining- labour-attack-on-whistleblowers-1.501908 National Executive Committee In January 2018, Lansman was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee. The following March, he stood as Labour's general secretary in succession to Iain McNicol. However, Lansman withdrew, saying that he had stood to avoid Jennie Formby being chosen unopposed and to help end Labour's \\"command and control\\" inclinations, and that he had achieved his intention of creating a debate over how the party is managed. Personal life In Lewisham in 1985, Lansman married Bethany Wagstaff. She died of breast cancer in January 1999 aged 39; the couple had three children. Lansman has been a trustee of the charity, Breast Cancer Care, under whose auspices his wife had set up the Lavender Trust before she died, both to help younger women become aware of the disease and to support them. Lansman's son and brother run a network of property companies. Lansman is an atheist, although he still observes some Jewish holidays festivals.

History  = First formation =  Russian Civil War  The history of the 35th Rifle Division's first formation began in August 1918 when the Kamyshin front troops of the North Caucasus Military District were formed. On 2 September, it was renamed the North Tsaritsyn‚ÄìKamyshin front. On 4 October, the front was reorganized into the 1st Kamyshin Rifle Division, part of the 10th Army, fighting on the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War. The division fought in battles against the Don Army north of Tsaritsyn in the area of Burluk and Krasny Yar during the Battle of Tsaritsyn between October and December 1918. Between February and March 1919 the division headquarters, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, and other division units were transferred to the Northern Front, where they became part of the 6th Army. The rest of the division joined the 14th Rifle Division. On the Northern Front, the division fought against White and Allied intervention forces in the area of Plesetsk and Onega. On 23 March, the division staff was given responsibility over the Onega‚ÄìArkhangelsk railway direction. In April, the division headquarters was transferred to the Eastern Front after the remainder of the division was disbanded. On 4 April, the 35th Rifle Division began forming in the Volga Military District at Kazan from parts of the brigades of the poor and railway defense regiments. On 17 April, the arriving 1st Kamyshin Rifle Division headquarters was renamed the headquarters of the 35th Rifle Division. The 35th Division's original headquarters was merged into the 1st Brigade headquarters on 24 April. In June, the division was sent to the front as part of the 5th Separate Army, fighting against Alexander Kolchak's White Army in a campaign known as the Counteroffensive of Eastern Front, which captured the Ural region from the White Army. Between 24 June and 13 July, it fought in the Zlatoust Operation, withdrawing to the Ufa River and advancing towards Zlatoust along the Ay River and the Bol River. The division then withdrew to the line of Kusinsky Zavod and participated in the breakthrough of White defenses in the Zlatoust area. From 17 July to 4 August, the 35th Division fought in the Chelyabinsk Operation, participating in offensive and defensive battles and the elimination of a White breakthrough on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk. It fought in the Petropavlovsk Operation from 20 August to 4 November. The division covered the southern flank of the 5th Army's strike group as it advanced on Petropavlovsk, and participated in the recapture of the city. From 4 to 16 November, the 35th fought in the Omsk Operation, advancing on Omsk along the Trans-Siberian railway. It then fought in the Novonikolaevsk Operation between 20 November and 16 December, capturing the Medvedovskaya station and cutting the Barnaul‚ÄìNovonikolayevsk railway line. During the Krasnoyarsk Operation from 18 December to 7 January 1920, the division continued to pursue the retreating White troops east and encircled and captured a large White group in the Balakhtinsky area while attacking Krasnoyarsk from the southwest. On 13 December, the division was awarded the honorific \\"Siberian\\". In May and June 1921, the division defended Soviet territory against Roman von Ungern- Sternberg's incursion from Mongolia, then crossed the border in the Mongolian operation from June to August. In July, the division's 104th Rifle Regiment defeated von Ungern-Sternberg's army at the battle of Lake Gusinoye. The operation ended with the capture and execution of von Ungern-Sternberg, and the 35th returned to Soviet territory.  Interwar period  The division became part of the East Siberian Military District in September 1921 and soon after transferred to the West Siberian Military District. In June 1922, the 35th was reduced to peacetime strength, with its 104th and 105th Brigades being used to form the 1st Pacific and 36th Rifle Divisions, respectively, on 14 June. The division became part of the Siberian Military District in June 1924. In 1928, it was awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner. The division was part of the 18th Rifle Corps in 1929. In 1929, the division (alongside the 36th Rifle Division) and its corps became part of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army. Between April 1931 and October 1935, the 35th was a territorial unit. In 1938, it became part of the 2nd Red Banner Army.  World War II  On 22 June 1941, when Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began, the division was part of the Far Eastern Front. The 35th included the 183rd, 196th, and the 352nd Rifle Regiment, as well as the 119th Light Artillery Regiment and the 177th Howitzer Regiment. In July, the division became part of the newly formed 35th Army, covering the Ussuri River border. In January 1942, the 177th Howitzer Regiment was withdrawn from the division, which was reorganized according to the December 1941 tables of organization. On 30 August 1943, the 35th was awarded the Order of the Red Star in commemoration of its 25th anniversary for \\"outstanding success in combat and political training, and direct participation in the battles for the Motherland\\". In August 1945, just before the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the 35th was part of the 5th Separate Rifle Corps, directly subordinated to the 2nd Far Eastern Front. When the invasion began on 9 August, the division attacked across the Ussuri into the Raohe Fortified Region in the corps' second echelon. It advanced to Boli in eastern Manchuria in eleven days of combat from 9 to 19 August. The division disbanded in the fall of 1945. = Second formation = In 1955, it was reformed from the 255th Rifle Division at Ust-Bolsheretsk in the Far Eastern Military District. On 17 May 1957, it became the 125th Motor Rifle Division of the 43rd Army Corps. It was disbanded on 7 March 1958.

It was formerly four houses and built as 2 Rutland Gate and 4‚Äì8a Rutland Gate, but the houses were converted into a single property during the mid 1980s. Description 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate is a large white stuccoed house originally built as a terrace of four houses in the mid 19th-century. The four houses were later converted into a single property. A competition to redesign the house was held in 1982 and won by the architectural firm YRM. The present 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate was built between 1985 and 1987, replacing 2 Rutland Gate and 4‚Äì8a Rutland Gate, a group of 1930s houses. The Survey of London describes the design of the present 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate as \\"One of YRM's least Modern designs ... the building comprises a rather bland white palazzo.\\" In 2012, the house was described as having seven storeys and 45 bedrooms, with a total size of 60,000 sq ft. The interior of 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate has a swimming pool, underground parking, several lifts, and substantial interior decoration of gold leaf. The interior of the house was described as having been decorated by Monzer Hammoud by The Guardian and by the French designer Alberto Pinto by the Evening Standard in July 2015. The windows of the house are believed to be bulletproof. 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate has been likened to two other palatial London houses, Bridgewater House in St James's, and Dudley House in Mayfair. History Since 1982, 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate has been owned by Yunak Corporation, registered in the Dutch Antilles tax haven of Cura√ßao. The house was the London residence of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and billionaire businessman Rafic Hariri, until his assassination in 2005. Following Hariri's death, the house was given as a gift to the then‚ÄìCrown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (1928‚Äì2011), who had business links with Hariri. In 2012, 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate was reported to be for sale at an asking price of ¬£300 million, which would have made it the most expensive house in Britain if realized, surpassing the ¬£140 million paid for Park Place in Berkshire by the Russian banker Andrey Borodin. The house remained unsold and was later valued at ¬£140 million in early 2015. In June 2015, contents from the property were put up for auction in a 1,252 lot sale lasting two days. Items for sale included Murano glass chandeliers, gold plated waste paper bins, and 24 marble bathrooms. A loan of ¬£55 million to fund the cost of stripping out the property was secured against the house in December 2014, issued by Omni Capital Partners, a financial services company owned by the property developers Christian and Nick Candy. After 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate had not sold by July 2015, the Saudi owners of the property were planning to turn the house into luxury apartments. In January 2020, Chinese businessman Cheung Chung-kiu was in the process of buying the property for between ¬£205 and ¬£210 million, which would make it easily the most expensive house ever sold in the UK.

The central body is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in accretion disks is referred to as diskoseismology.  Manifestations  Accretion disks are a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics; active galactic nuclei, protoplanetary disks, and gamma ray bursts all involve accretion disks. These disks very often give rise to astrophysical jets coming from the vicinity of the central object. Jets are an efficient way for the star-disk system to shed angular momentum without losing too much mass. The most spectacular accretion disks found in nature are those of active galactic nuclei and of quasars, which are thought to be massive black holes at the center of galaxies. As matter enters the accretion disc, it follows a trajectory called a tendex line, which describes an inward spiral. This is because particles rub and bounce against each other in a turbulent flow, causing frictional heating which radiates energy away, reducing the particles' angular momentum, allowing the particle to drift inwards, driving the inward spiral. The loss of angular momentum manifests as a reduction in velocity; at a slower velocity, the particle must adopt a lower orbit. As the particle falls to this lower orbit, a portion of its gravitational potential energy is converted to increased velocity and the particle gains speed. Thus, the particle has lost energy even though it is now travelling faster than before; however, it has lost angular momentum. As a particle orbits closer and closer, its velocity increases, as velocity increases frictional heating increases as more and more of the particle's potential energy (relative to the black hole) is radiated away; the accretion disk of a black hole is hot enough to emit X-rays just outside the event horizon. The large luminosity of quasars is believed to be a result of gas being accreted by supermassive black holes. Elliptical accretion disks formed at tidal disruption of stars can be typical in galactic nuclei and quasars. Accretion process can convert about 10 percent to over 40 percent of the mass of an object into energy as compared to around 0.7 percent for nuclear fusion processes. In close binary systems the more massive primary component evolves faster and has already become a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole, when the less massive companion reaches the giant state and exceeds its Roche lobe. A gas flow then develops from the companion star to the primary. Angular momentum conservation prevents a straight flow from one star to the other and an accretion disk forms instead. Accretion disks surrounding T Tauri stars or Herbig stars are called protoplanetary disks because they are thought to be the progenitors of planetary systems. The accreted gas in this case comes from the molecular cloud out of which the star has formed rather than a companion star. Artist's view of a star with accretion disk  Accretion disk physics  Artist's conception of a black hole drawing matter from a nearby star, forming an accretion disk. In the 1940s, models were first derived from basic physical principles. In order to agree with observations, those models had to invoke a yet unknown mechanism for angular momentum redistribution. If matter is to fall inwards it must lose not only gravitational energy but also lose angular momentum. Since the total angular momentum of the disk is conserved, the angular momentum loss of the mass falling into the center has to be compensated by an angular momentum gain of the mass far from the center. In other words, angular momentum should be transported outwards for matter to accrete. According to the Rayleigh stability criterion, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial(R^2\\\\Omega)}{\\\\partial R}>0, where \\\\Omega represents the angular velocity of a fluid element and R its distance to the rotation center, an accretion disk is expected to be a laminar flow. This prevents the existence of a hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum transport. On one hand, it was clear that viscous stresses would eventually cause the matter towards the center to heat up and radiate away some of its gravitational energy. On the other hand, viscosity itself was not enough to explain the transport of angular momentum to the exterior parts of the disk. Turbulence-enhanced viscosity was the mechanism thought to be responsible for such angular- momentum redistribution, although the origin of the turbulence itself was not well understood. The conventional \\\\alpha-model (discussed below) introduces an adjustable parameter \\\\alpha describing the effective increase of viscosity due to turbulent eddies within the disk. In 1991, with the rediscovery of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), S. A. Balbus and J. F. Hawley established that a weakly magnetized disk accreting around a heavy, compact central object would be highly unstable, providing a direct mechanism for angular-momentum redistribution. = Œ±-Disk Model = Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) proposed turbulence in the gas as the source of an increased viscosity. Assuming subsonic turbulence and the disk height as an upper limit for the size of the eddies, the disk viscosity can be estimated as u=\\\\alpha c_{\\\\rm s}H where c_{\\\\rm s} is the sound speed, H is the scale height of the disk, and \\\\alpha is a free parameter between zero (no accretion) and approximately one. In a turbulent medium u\\\\approx v_{\\\\rm turb} l_{\\\\rm turb} , where v_{\\\\rm turb} is the velocity of turbulent cells relative to the mean gas motion, and l_{\\\\rm turb} is the size of the largest turbulent cells, which is estimated as l_{\\\\rm turb} \\\\approx H = c_{\\\\rm s}/\\\\Omega and v_{\\\\rm turb} \\\\approx c_{\\\\rm s} , where \\\\Omega = (G M)^{1/2} r^{-3/2} is the Keplerian orbital angular velocity, r is the radial distance from the central object of mass M. By using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, combined with conservation of angular momentum and assuming that the disk is thin, the equations of disk structure may be solved in terms of the \\\\alpha parameter. Many of the observables depend only weakly on \\\\alpha, so this theory is predictive even though it has a free parameter. Using Kramers' law for the opacity it is found that :H=1.7\\\\times 10^8\\\\alpha^{-1/10}\\\\dot{M}^{3/20}_{16} m_1^{-3/8} R^{9/8}_{10}f^{3/5} {\\\\rm cm} :T_c=1.4\\\\times 10^4 \\\\alpha^{-1/5}\\\\dot{M}^{3/10}_{16} m_1^{1/4} R^{-3/4}_{10}f^{6/5}{\\\\rm K} :\\\\rho=3.1\\\\times 10^{-8}\\\\alpha^{-7/10}\\\\dot{M}^{11/20}_{16} m_1^{5/8} R^{-15/8}_{10}f^{11/5}{\\\\rm g\\\\ cm}^{-3} where T_c and \\\\rho are the mid-plane temperature and density respectively. \\\\dot{M}_{16} is the accretion rate, in units of 10^{16}{\\\\rm g\\\\ s}^{-1}, m_1 is the mass of the central accreting object in units of a solar mass, M_\\\\bigodot, R_{10} is the radius of a point in the disk, in units of 10^{10}{\\\\rm cm}, and f=\\\\left[1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{R_\\\\star}{R}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\right]^{1/4}, where R_\\\\star is the radius where angular momentum stops being transported inwards. The Shakura-Sunyaev Œ±-Disk model is both thermally and viscously unstable. An alternative model, known as the \\\\beta-disk, which is stable in both senses assumes that the viscosity is proportional to the gas pressure u \\\\propto \\\\alpha p_{\\\\mathrm{gas}}. In the standard Shakura-Sunyaev model, viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the total pressure p_{\\\\mathrm{tot}} = p_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} + p_{\\\\mathrm{gas}} = \\\\rho c_{\\\\rm s}^2 since u = \\\\alpha c_{\\\\rm s} H = \\\\alpha c_s^2/\\\\Omega = \\\\alpha p_{\\\\mathrm{tot}}/(\\\\rho \\\\Omega) . The Shakura-Sunyaev model assumes that the disk is in local thermal equilibrium, and can radiate its heat efficiently. In this case, the disk radiates away the viscous heat, cools, and becomes geometrically thin. However, this assumption may break down. In the radiatively inefficient case, the disk may \\"puff up\\" into a torus or some other three-dimensional solution like an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). The ADAF solutions usually require that the accretion rate is smaller than a few percent of the Eddington limit. Another extreme is the case of Saturn's rings, where the disk is so gas poor that its angular momentum transport is dominated by solid body collisions and disk-moon gravitational interactions. The model is in agreement with recent astrophysical measurements using gravitational lensing. = Magnetorotational instability = HH-30, a Herbig‚ÄìHaro object surrounded by an accretion disk Balbus and Hawley (1991) proposed a mechanism which involves magnetic fields to generate the angular momentum transport. A simple system displaying this mechanism is a gas disk in the presence of a weak axial magnetic field. Two radially neighboring fluid elements will behave as two mass points connected by a massless spring, the spring tension playing the role of the magnetic tension. In a Keplerian disk the inner fluid element would be orbiting more rapidly than the outer, causing the spring to stretch. The inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down, reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit. The outer fluid element being pulled forward will speed up, increasing its angular momentum and move to a larger radius orbit. The spring tension will increase as the two fluid elements move further apart and the process runs away. It can be shown that in the presence of such a spring-like tension the Rayleigh stability criterion is replaced by : \\\\frac{d\\\\Omega^2}{d \\\\ln R}>0. Most astrophysical disks do not meet this criterion and are therefore prone to this magnetorotational instability. The magnetic fields present in astrophysical objects (required for the instability to occur) are believed to be generated via dynamo action. = Magnetic fields and jets= Accretion disks are usually assumed to be threaded by the external magnetic fields present in the interstellar medium. These fields are typically weak (about few micro-Gauss), but they can get anchored to the matter in the disk, because of its high electrical conductivity, and carried inward toward the central star. This process can concentrate the magnetic flux around the centre of the disk giving rise to very strong magnetic fields. Formation of powerful astrophysical jets along the rotation axis of accretion disks requires a large scale poloidal magnetic field in the inner regions of the disk. Such magnetic fields may be advected inward from the interstellar medium or generated by a magnetic dynamo within the disk. Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There are problems, however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward towards the central star of the disk. High electric conductivity dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is not a perfect electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than the rate at which it is being carried inward by accretion of matter. A simple solution is assuming a viscosity much larger than the magnetic diffusivity in the disk. However, numerical simulations, and theoretical models, show that the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity have almost the same order of magnitude in magneto- rotationally turbulent disks. Some other factors may possibly affect the advection/diffusion rate: reduced turbulent magnetic diffusion on the surface layers; reduction of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity by magnetic fields; and the generation of large scale fields by small scale MHD turbulence ‚Äìa large scale dynamo. In fact, a combination of different mechanisms might be responsible for efficiently carrying the external field inwards towards the central parts of the disk where the jet is launched. Magnetic buoyancy, turbulent pumping and turbulent diamagnetism exemplify such physical phenomena invoked to explain such efficient concentration of external fields.  Analytic models of sub-Eddington accretion disks (thin disks, ADAFs)  When the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and the opacity very high, the standard thin accretion disk is formed. It is geometrically thin in the vertical direction (has a disk-like shape), and is made of a relatively cold gas, with a negligible radiation pressure. The gas goes down on very tight spirals, resembling almost circular, almost free (Keplerian) orbits. Thin disks are relatively luminous and they have thermal electromagnetic spectra, i.e. not much different from that of a sum of black bodies. Radiative cooling is very efficient in thin disks. The classic 1974 work by Shakura and Sunyaev on thin accretion disks is one of the most often quoted papers in modern astrophysics. Thin disks were independently worked out by Lynden-Bell, Pringle and Rees. Pringle contributed in the past thirty years many key results to accretion disk theory, and wrote the classic 1981 review that for many years was the main source of information about accretion disks, and is still very useful today. thumb300pxleftSimulation by J.A. Marck of optical appearance of Schwarzschild black hole with thin (Keplerian) disk. A fully general relativistic treatment, as needed for the inner part of the disk when the central object is a black hole, has been provided by Page and Thorne, and used for producing simulated optical images by Luminet and Marck, in which, although such a system is intrinsically symmetric its image is not, because the relativistic rotation speed needed for centrifugal equilibrium in the very strong gravitational field near the black hole produces a strong Doppler redshift on the receding side (taken here to be on the right) whereas there will be a strong blueshift on the approaching side. Due to light bending, the disk appears distorted but is nowhere hidden by the black hole. When the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and the opacity very low, an ADAF is formed. This type of accretion disk was predicted in 1977 by Ichimaru. Although Ichimaru's paper was largely ignored, some elements of the ADAF model were present in the influential 1982 ion-tori paper by Rees, Phinney, Begelman and Blandford. ADAFs started to be intensely studied by many authors only after their rediscovery in the mid-1990 by Narayan and Yi, and independently by Abramowicz, Chen, Kato, Lasota (who coined the name ADAF), and Regev. Most important contributions to astrophysical applications of ADAFs have been made by Narayan and his collaborators. ADAFs are cooled by advection (heat captured in matter) rather than by radiation. They are very radiatively inefficient, geometrically extended, similar in shape to a sphere (or a \\"corona\\") rather than a disk, and very hot (close to the virial temperature). Because of their low efficiency, ADAFs are much less luminous than the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disks. ADAFs emit a power-law, non-thermal radiation, often with a strong Compton component.  Analytic models of super-Eddington accretion disks (slim disks, Polish doughnuts)  The theory of highly super- Eddington black hole accretion, M‚â´MEdd, was developed in the 1980s by Abramowicz, Jaroszynski, Paczy≈Ñski, Sikora and others in terms of \\"Polish doughnuts\\" (the name was coined by Rees). Polish doughnuts are low viscosity, optically thick, radiation pressure supported accretion disks cooled by advection. They are radiatively very inefficient. Polish doughnuts resemble in shape a fat torus (a doughnut) with two narrow funnels along the rotation axis. The funnels collimate the radiation into beams with highly super- Eddington luminosities. Slim disks (name coined by Kolakowska) have only moderately super-Eddington accretion rates, M‚â•MEdd, rather disk-like shapes, and almost thermal spectra. They are cooled by advection, and are radiatively ineffective. They were introduced by Abramowicz, Lasota, Czerny and Szuszkiewicz in 1988.  Excretion disk  The opposite of an accretion disk is an excretion disk where instead of material accreting from a disk on to a central object, material is excreted from the center outwards on to the disk. Excretion disks are formed when stars merge.  See also   References  * *  External links  * * Professor John F.

His photos mostly consisted of black and white landscapes with a graphic style, but later transitioned into portraiture. Klein said that his photographs were a white on black, not black on white because ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do anything you get a back image. Things only happen when you open the shutter; then you make a drawing in white‚Äù.Warren, Lynn. ‚ÄúEncyclopedia of Twentieth- Century Photography, 3-Volume Set‚Äù. Photo Agencies p 1225. Routledge. November 15, 2005.  Career  A bunker serving as a house in Zeelandic Flanders photographed by Aart Klein in October 1945 Klein began working at the Netherlands' premier photo press agency, Polygoon in the 1930s, without having any formal training in photography. During his time at Polygoon, he started as an administrative assistant and continued to work there for nine years. During World War II, he held a multitude of other jobs, ranging from press photographer to wedding photographer. Klein was forced to work for the Nazis during the 1940s, however, he resisted by taking underground pictures and sending them to Allied forces in England and joining Particam, or Partisan Cameras, a group of Dutch resistance photographers. After the War ended, Klein and members of the Partisan Cameras photographed the aftermath of the war in Germany in a collection of photos called Zoo leeft Duitschland op de puinhopen van het derde rijk (\\"How Germany Lives. On the Ruins of the Third Reich\\"). Some members of this group went on to form a new photo agency of the same name, Particam, later changing it Particam Pictures. Klein's technique was unusual in that he avoided the use of a flash by heating the developer. This allowed for darkened rooms such as theaters to be photographed inconspicuously. Developing this technique aided in Particam Pictures ability to corner the stage market in theatre, opera, ballet, and circus shows. The North Sea flood of 1953, the worst storm in Dutch history, flooded the southern part of the country. 1,835 people were killed, forty seven thousand homes were destroyed and three hundred and six pounds of dikes and embankments were damaged. Klein, along with other photographers and photojournalists, depicted the aftermath of this storm and its effect on the country.‚ÄúThe Big Flood of 1953 photographed‚Äù. Nederlands Fotomuseum. Klein spent hours in dark rooms creating the contrast or effect that he had in his mind. One of his many talents was the ability to photograph birds as if he positioned them himself. This talent led to one of his assistants saying that he carried birds in his pocket. However, this talent was due to Klein‚Äôs ability to wait until the right moment where the outcome matched his vision. He would then spend his time in the dark rooms to create his contrasting colors. His work entitled Zebra (1957) strongly shows this practice because of the sharp etching across the picture that creates an almost hypnotizing pattern. In 1956 Klein decided to leave Patricam Pictures and venture into his own studio. In this studio he created what are considered his most famous images of the Delta engineering project.‚ÄúThe Delta Works as seen through Aart Klein's camera‚Äù. Nederlands Fotomuseum. The theme of the book seemed to be a continuation of his photography during the flood, which was the human struggle against the force of water. He focused on the juxtaposition of infrastructure and the natural landscape of the Netherlands. These works shared with his previous work the emphasis on stylized patterns of darkness and light. He depicted the progress of his country in a personal, yet optimistic way. After this photo series ended Klein worked for the newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad and other photography companies. Toward the end of his life, around the 1980s, he traveled with aid from grants and the government, but his activity as a photographer began to dwindle. Klein died in 2001, at the age of 92.

Vahanian in a book entitled The Death of'God (1961) claimed that in contemporary W. culture God had ceased to be a meaningful factor.\\"  Contents  In the book, Vahanian observes that many people in his era regarded the Christian God to be irrelevant to their situation. He describes that Christianity, and particularly theism, was not resonating with people. One explanation given for this is that the Christian God is too transcendent, whereas people in his day were largely focused on the practical worldly goals. The book describes the process of secularization, namely, how society has steadily removed God its institutions. Vahanian contends that the apparent religiosity of the 1950s obscures many from recognizing this process. The book criticized efforts to modernize Christianity, such as Norman Vincent Peale's 1952 best-seller, The Power of Positive Thinking, which Vahanian asserted reduced Christianity to \\"a tool for success.\\" Instead, Vahanian argued that faith was for coping with suffering, developing the conscience, and confronting doubts about God. The book claimed that Peale and Billy Graham had \\"domesticated\\" Christianity and its God. The book includes a religious critique of existentialism.

The warehouse was built about 1925 for Frank Adams & Co., who operated the Adams Gristmill (now home to the Bellows Falls Historical Society Museum) in central Bellows Falls. The building was served by a railroad spur (now inactive and paved over) and was used by the Adams mill to store flour and grain. The mill ceased operation in the 1960s, and the warehouse has since been adaptively repurposed by other industrial uses.

The participants (ISSG) were 20 powers and international organisations: China, Egypt, France, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Arab League, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Co-Chairs of the ISSG are Russia and the U.S.  Background  Western media claimed that the Russian air strikes that had begun in Syria on 30 September 2015 had tipped the balance of power on the Syrian battlefield between government and opposition in president Assad's favor, thus upending the strategy of the U.S., oppositional groups backed by the U.S. and European allies to drive Assad out of power. On 23 October 2015, foreign ministers John Kerry of the U.S., Sergey Lavrov of Russia, Adel al- Jubeir of Saudi Arabia and Feridun Sinirlioƒülu of Turkey met in Vienna, preparing new international talks aiming at peace in Syria.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 24 October 2015. They agreed to consult with all parties, and aimed to reconvene on 30 October with a broader meeting. Lavrov said afterwards he hoped that Iran and Egypt would be invited. While both Jubeir and Kerry acknowledged differences with Russia and Iran over the future of Syria‚Äôs President Bashar al-Assad, Kerry said \\"if we can get into a political process, then sometimes these things have a way of resolving themselves\\". On 29 October 2015, the foreign ministers of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia again met in Vienna to further prepare the talks of 30 October. US Secretary of State John Kerry also had meetings with his Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz, the UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, as well as Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, Sergey Lavrov of Russia, Adel al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia, and Feridun Sinirlioƒülu of Turkey. Also, Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran had a bilateral meeting with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. Iran‚Ä≤s invitation for 30 October was the first time the country was involved in international Syrian peace negotiations. 30 October 2015 round =Participants= Participating in the 30 October Vienna talks were the US, UK, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Jordan, China, France, Germany, Italy as well as the European Union. Iran took part in international Syrian peace negotiations for the first time; the offer of inviting Iran had been made by Russia and initially met resistance on the part of the United States and Saudi Arabia. No Syrian representative was invited to participate. =Discussions= The purpose of the meeting was to look for a plan to convince Syria‚Äôs government and rebels to agree to a national cease-fire and a process of political transition. Western media claimed though, that determining Syrian president Assad‚Äôs future, including what powers he could maintain during a political transition and whether he can compete in a future presidential election, seemed a necessary first step to be taken before any other agreement between the conflicting Syrian parties would be reachable. The ministers participating in the talks signed a joint statement: Final declaration on the results of the Syria Talks in Vienna as agreed by participants, which among other things stated that \\"Syria's unity, independence, territorial integrity and secular character are fundamental\\". The participants agreed to ask the United Nations to convene Syria's government and opposition to start \\"a political process leading to credible, inclusive, non-sectarian governance, followed by a new constitution and elections\\" to be administered under UN supervision. Russia and the US remained at discord concerning the future political role of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. The US maintained that Assad should have no role in Syria's future; Russia maintained that Assad should not be forced to go and that Syrian elections should decide who will rule Syria. =Aftermath= Shortly after the talks in Vienna on 30 October 2015, Saudi Arabian and Iranian officials exchanged sharp rebukes that questioned future participation of Iran in the next round of talks. Working groups that convened, on the initiative of the US, in the run-up to the 14 November round of talks reflected tensions between Russia and the US over the leadership role allegedly assumed by the US, the very idea of such groups being criticised by Russia. 14 November 2015 meeting  On 14 November 2015, the Vienna talks, with all twenty members of the ISSG present, resulted in a peace plan for Syria. The ISSG: * stated their commitment to ensure a Syrian-led and Syrian- owned political transition based on the 2012 Geneva Communiqu√© in its entirety; * agreed to support and work to implement a nationwide ceasefire in Syria to come into effect as soon as the representatives of the Syrian government and the opposition have begun initial steps towards the transition under UN auspices on the basis of the Geneva Communique; * agreed on the need to convene Syrian government and opposition representatives in formal negotiations under UN auspices with a target date of 1 January 2016; * assigned a UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, to decide who should represent the opposition in those negotiations; * reiterated that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Da'esh) as well as the Jabhat al-Nusra Front, and \\"other terrorist groups, as designated by the UN Security Council, and further, as agreed by the participants and endorsed by the UN Security Council, must be defeated\\"; and * gave Jordan the charge \\"to help develop among intelligence and military community representatives a common understanding of groups and individuals for possible determination as terrorists, with a target of completion by the beginning of the political process under UN auspices\\". Russia and the US remained at discord about a possible role of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in any political transition, but their foreign ministers, Lavrov and Kerry, both played down those differences. Kerry suggested the Syrians would decide the fate of Assad: \\"We did not come here to impose our collective will on the Syrian people\\", but also said the war \\"can‚Äôt end as long as Bashar Assad is there\\". Lavrov, however said the conflict, or its solution, is \\"not about Assad ... ISIS is your enemy\\".  December 2015 UN Security Council endorsement  After John Kerry visited Moscow where he met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov as well as Vladimir Putin on 15 December 2015, it was announced that on 18 December 2015 world powers would meet in New York to pass a UN resolution endorsing the principles of the Vienna process. The UN Security Council in its resolution 2254 (2015) of 18 December 2015 which unanimously passed, again commended ‚Äúa Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition based on the Geneva Communiqu√©‚Äù of 30 June 2012, and endorsed the \\"Vienna Statements\\" and transitional plan of the ISSG of 30 October and 14 November 2015 (see above): * A first required step was the UN Secretary General to convene representatives of the Syrian Government and opposition for negotiations on a political process, preferably in January 2016; * Followed by ‚Äúcredible governance‚Äù before July 2016, the drafting of a new constitution, and fair elections under that new constitution before July 2017. The resolution acknowledged the \\"role of the ISSG as the central platform to facilitate the United Nations‚Äô efforts to achieve a lasting political settlement in Syria\\". The major powers remained divided on who should represent the Syrian opposition.  Geneva peace talks  On 1 February 2016, the United Nations started UN-mediated peace talks for Syria in Geneva. These talks were suspended on 3 February, purportedly because UN envoy Staffan de Mistura did not want the UN to be associated with the Syrian government‚Äôs military advance against rebels north of Aleppo, backed by Russian airstrikes. Munich: 'cessation of hostilities'  The ISSG, meeting in Munich, Germany, on 11 and 12 February 2016 agreed on a plan to end hostilities in Syria within a week ‚Äì provided Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would agree to that, to immediately begin delivering humanitarian aid, and to revive the Geneva peace talks on Syria that were suspended on 3 February.‚ÄòSyria crisis plan: Cessation of hostilities, humanitarian airdrops, peace talks laid out in Munich‚Äô.

The Guardian, 12 February 2016. Retrieved 24 February 2016. Russian foreign minister Lavrov emphasized that everyone agreed on the need to destroy ISIL, that talking about ground troops invading Syria would only add fire to the conflict, and called the idea that things in Syria would improve if President Assad would abdicate an illusion.

William attended the Franciscan General Chapter in 1322 and had royal permission to travel abroad in 1324 and 1325. In 1330, he was ordered by Pope John XXII to extradict the friars Peter de Saxlingham, John de Hequinton, Henry de Costeseye, and Thomas de Helmedon. They were all arrested at Cambridge on charges of heresy. William died in Leicester sometime between 1330 and 1336 and was buried in the same Greyfriars cemetery that later held Richard III.. For a time, it was thought that his body may have been the one discovered in a double stone-and-lead coffin near Richard III's remains... However, continued investigation established that tomb belonged to an as-yet-unknown elderly woman.. He was succeeded as Minister Provincial by Roger of Denemed. Works William was the actual author of the Commentary on the Gospels that was formerly attributed to the earlier William of Nottingham. Based on Clement of Llanthony's One from Four, the postill was well known for centuries and survives in numerous manuscripts. His Sentences () survives in a single copy and preserves various statements made by John Duns Scotus and his classmates while at Oxford, where they immediately preceded William. One section thoroughly and temperately covers the scholastic opinions on the eternity of the world prior to the 1316 disputation, reaching the conservative conclusion that nothing truly infinite exists within God's Creation. In his capacity as the Franciscan lector at Oxford, he was responsible for copying five large volumes of postillsOxford Merton MSS 166 and 168‚Äì171. for Sir Hugh of Nottingham, who was a clerk at the Royal Exchequer.

It was designed by Alexander Brown Wilson and built in 1915 by J J Georges. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 June 2008.  History  The Railway Hotel at Gympie is a large, two- storeyed timber building constructed in 1915-1916 for owner Charles Caston. Designed by Brisbane architect AB Wilson, it replaced an earlier single-storey Railway Hotel erected in 1882 on the same site. Gympie was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield put Queensland on the map as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. The early makeshift structures of Gympie gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings. The township provided a ready market for local timbergetters and the growing number of agricultural producers in the surrounding district. By the end of the 1870s, an intensive phase of underground reef mining was underway, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie. The 1880s were an important period of expansion for railways in Queensland, with new lines opening throughout the state. The economic importance of Gympie's mining industry was the key factor in the approval of the construction of the railway line between the sea port of Maryborough and Gympie. The line was officially opened in August 1881, and soon became the dominant transport artery for the movement of goods and people in and out of Gympie. Gympie railway station, located between Tozer Hill and Caledonian Hill, was erected adjacent to land owned by Walter A Compigne, Gympie's first Clerk of Petty Sessions in 1868 and registrar of the Gympie District Court by 1874. In 1882 Compigne took advantage of this proximity to the station by constructing the Railway Hotel on his land. As Queensland's railway system expanded, hotels joined other businesses in clustering around the rail stations. Use of the name \\"Railway Hotel\\" was common by the 1860s, a popular means of advertising proximity to the railway station. By the early twentieth century there were close to 70 \\"Railway Hotels\\" in Queensland. Compigne did not conduct the Railway Hotel himself, preferring to lease it to licensees. Following his death in 1884 the property passed to his wife Mary Ann, who continued leasing out the Railway Hotel. In 1888 construction of the North Coast railway commenced simultaneously from Brisbane and Gympie. The southward extension resulted in further land resumptions, with the allotment on which the Railway Hotel stood being reduced in size. In May 1888, tenders were called for the removal of the Railway Hotel, possibly to reposition the hotel following the resumption. The Gympie-Brisbane rail line was opened in 1891, linking a coastal route from Brisbane to Bundaberg. The extended scope of services from Gympie railway station generated more activity around the railway precinct. In 1892 title to the Railway Hotel and adjoining land was transferred to Charles Caston, a second generation Gympie mining secretary. The Caston family maintained an interest in the hotel for over 60 years. Caston continued to lease out the Railway Hotel. On the night of 1 February 1915, the Railway Hotel was almost totally destroyed by fire, except for some detached rooms at the rear. In May tenders were advertised for the construction of a new Railway Hotel, designed by Brisbane architect Alexander Brown Wilson. After working in the private practice of Colonial Architect, FDG Stanley, and studying in England, Wilson began his own architectural practice in Brisbane in 1884, maintaining a long and distinguished career until his retirement in 1928. He was responsible for buildings in Brisbane such as the Plough Inn at South Bank, Kinauld at Highgate Hill and Leckhampton at Kangaroo Point. Gympie builder JJ Georges was awarded the contract for the construction of the new hotel in June 1915 and this was completed by February 1916 at a cost of ¬£1980. The new hotel was a large two-storey timber building with first floor verandahs and a double gabled roof with a detached kitchen to the rear. Wilson's design responded to the requirements of a subtropical timber hotel, providing well ventilated rooms with high ceilings and guests quarters that opened onto front and rear verandahs. The interiors of the building were enhanced by the inclusion of pressed metal ceilings. The exterior of the hotel shared similarities with popular domestic architecture in its decorative treatment of the verandah and gables. Two earlier detached rooms were repositioned at the rear of the premises. Between 1916 and 1920 Charles Caston held the license to the hotel. The building's elevated position on a rise overlooking the station made it a prominent landmark in the city. The rebuilding of the Railway Hotel coincided with a substantial upgrading to the Gympie railway station between 1911 and 1915. Crew barracks for overnight accommodation were built in 1914. Other work included a new large station building, pedestrian subway, an underpass linking Station Road to Mellor Street and conversion of the platform into an island. In 1915, a large overbridge was built from the island platform linking Lady Mary Terrace and Station Road. The new bridge was a welcome development for the Railway Hotel, with pedestrians alighting from the overbridge directly in front of the building. The opening of the Mary Valley railway to Brooloo in 1915 and the connection between Cairns and Brisbane in 1924 sent more goods and people through Gympie. The Gympie district was the largest producer of bananas in Australia in the 1920s and an important pineapple growing area. Fruit trains began operating from Gympie to Melbourne and in 1923 the Gympie Fruit Growers Co-operative Association erected premises opposite the station on Tozer Street. The Wide Bay Co-operative Dairy Company also was located on Tozer Street and in 1925 built one of Australia's largest butter factories. By 1927 one tenth of Queensland's milk production was from the Gympie district. The centrality of the railway precinct to Gympie's economy offered enhanced opportunities for the Railway Hotel to generate business. In November 1928 newly formed Brisbane brewer Castlemaine Perkins Limited acquired an interest in the lease of the Railway Hotel from William English. The purchase of the leasehold by Castlemaine Perkins exemplified their practice of acquiring hotel freeholds and leases throughout Queensland. This process of vertical integration continued into the 1930s, ensuring the companies domination of the Queensland market. A licensing inspection report from 1936 indicates the Railway Hotel's internal arrangement of space followed a layout typical of early twentieth century Queensland hotels. The first floor contained 12 guest bedrooms, a sitting room, one bathroom, two water closets and front and rear verandahs. On the ground floor were eight guest rooms, one sitting room, dining room, large kitchen, laundry, parlour, bar, and cellar. Four detached rooms at the rear of the premises were used by the publican and servants and a garage with space for two cars was available for guests. The Railway Hotel was a prosperous and well maintained place at this period. Used extensively by the travelling public and commercial travellers the hotel averaged fifty guests a week, mostly persons of \\"good character\\". Castlemaine Perkins maintained an interest in the hotel until 1945, through leases and sub-leases to and from publicans. In 1953 the Caston family ended their association with the Railway Hotel and since that time a number of owners and publications have been involved in its management. The public bar was enlarged in 1966, by incorporating the parlour bar at the far end from the street entrance. The dining room has been extended into the front sitting room and kitchen capacity has been expanded by widening the original walkway. The garage and detached rooms have been removed and in recent years a beer garden has been added at the rear of the building. With the electrification of the North Coast railway line in 1989, a new railway station for Gympie was built east of the town. Since 1998, the original Gympie railway station has become an important tourist attraction for the city with the Mary Valley Heritage Railway operating steam train excursions through the Mary Valley. The Railway Hotel continues its role of providing drink, food and lodgings for visitors and locals. A regular local clientele drink at the public bar and a number of long-term residents occupy rooms on the first floor. Memorabilia throughout the building celebrates the hotel's long association with the railway.  Description  A prominent landmark standing on one of Gympie's hilltops, the Railway Hotel is a two-storeyed timber building on the corner of Station Road and Tozer Lane, Gympie. From this elevated site, adjacent to the former Gympie railway station, the hotel affords expansive views across Gympie and surrounding districts. A timber footbridge connects the hotel and the railway station. The Railway Hotel is a large rectangular building sheltered by a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheeting. The building faces northeast, is timber-framed, clad with chamferboards and stands on brick and concrete stumps on a sloping site. The front elevation is dominated by projecting end gable bays carrying panels with painted lettering RAILWAY (east bay) and HOTEL (west bay) below decorative battened, pressed metal gable infills. Verandahs to each level have weatherboard valances. The verandah to the first floor has stop- chamfered timber posts with long, elegant curved brackets and dowel and decorative panel balustrading. On the ground floor enclosed verandahs flank the main entrance. Double-hung sash windows shaded by timber awnings punctuate the side elevations. The ground floor elevation is asymmetrical with an off- centre main entrance sheltered by a projecting gable roof crowned at the apex by a metal scroll finial. A set of low tiled concrete stairs rises to the timber floored entrance porch which is framed by oversized decorative brackets matching the pattern of the brackets to first floor verandah posts. A four- panelled timber entrance door with glazed sidelights and fanlights opens into the vestibule and a side door to the left opens onto the former sitting room off the dining room. A later metal ramp runs along the front from the west to alight at the porch. The public bar is accommodated within the east side of the building and is entered through doorways to the northeast recessed to each side of a bay window. The awning sheltering one of these entrances is recent. Northwest of the public bar, two low timber doors open from carpark level into the concrete and brick basement cellar. The ground floor accommodates the entrance vestibule, manager's office and private quarters, dining room and former sitting room, and public bar. The ground floor plan works off the entrance vestibule from which a fine timber stair rises to the guest accommodation on the first floor. From the vestibule, the dining room is entered to the left and the manager's quarters/office to the right. The vestibule runs through to the rear verandah which accommodates toilets at each end. Partitions to the ground floor rooms are post and rail construction lined with vertical tongue and groove boards. All the public rooms, including the bay window space in the public bar, have decorative pressed metal ceilings, ceiling roses and cornices except the rear section of the public bar where the ceiling is lined with tongue and groove timber boards. The dining room opens onto the service corridor to the rear, to the public bar through a door at the far east side of the room and receives service from the bar through an open hatch. The former lounge to the northeast of the dining room is enclosed with aluminium sliding doors and accommodates a billiard table. The public bar is refurbished and incorporates the former parlour bar to the southeast. There is evidence of earlier partitions now removed and a window opening now infilled with vertical timber boards. Murals decorating the upper walls and bar fittings are recent. The first floor is organised about a central corridor which is punctuated by arched openings and accommodates 12 bedrooms, a recreation room and two storage cupboards. Verandahs run to the front and rear, the narrow rear verandah accommodating bathrooms and toilets at each end. Short transverse corridors connect front and rear verandahs. The bedrooms open onto the corridor and the verandahs four- panel timber doors with fixed fretwork transom windows open onto the corridor and French windows with pivoting glazed fanlights open onto the verandahs. The partitions are of post and rail construction lined with vertical timber boards. The external walls are clad with chamferboards. The ceilings are lined with tongue and groove boards and have decorative metal ceiling roses. Double-hung sash windows terminate each end of the corridor and are installed in the end rooms. Earlier gas light pipes and fittings remain to the upper and lower rear verandahs. Original door and window joinery and hardware remain throughout the building. The building has timber floors throughout except for the upper verandahs which are now sheeted with a thick fibre cement board. Fibre cement sheeting encloses the bathrooms to the northwest and the enclosed services corridor of the ground floor rear verandah. A timber framed two-roomed rectangular building clad with chamferboards (some beaded to the interior), the kitchen/laundry wing stands to the rear of the main building. It is reached from the rear ground floor verandah through an enclosed service corridor and storage area. The roof to the kitchen/laundry is clad with corrugated metal sheeting with a gable to the north end and a hip to the south. A two- sided fireplace with a tall brick chimney stands to the centre. The fireplace is no longer operable and accommodates a contemporary stove within the north end. The kitchen fit-out is recent including the plasterboard lining. The laundry ceiling is lined with timber boards and has a decorative metal ceiling rose; the laundry walls are unlined. A modern beer garden sheltered by a low pitched skillion roof stands to the northwest of the kitchen/laundry. This is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. A bitumen carpark slopes uphill towards the railway line forming a forecourt to the building. A concrete fence runs along the northeast side of the carpark from which terraced garden beds retained by battered stone and concrete walls fall to Station Road. The beds are planted with a range of shrubs and a set of concrete stairs rises within them.  Heritage listing  Railway Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 June 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Railway Hotel at Gympie, constructed in 1915 on a site associated with a hotel since 1882, is important in demonstrating a significant pattern of urban development from the 1860s: the clustering of commercial premises in the vicinity of railway stations. The Railway Hotel at Gympie is an excellent illustration of this trend. The connectivity between the hotel and the railway station, due both to the close proximity and to the footbridge that emerges from the station in front of the hotel, is a particularly good illustration of the interdependence of commercial places (including hotels) and railways in moving and accommodating goods and people in Queensland prior to developments in road transportation. The hotel occupies a prominent and easily accessible position in relation to the former Gympie Railway Station, and for decades has offered accommodation to rail travellers and the provision of drink and food for visitors and locals. The construction of the new Railway Hotel in 1915-1916 is associated with a period of significant growth in Gympie, during which services and facilities at Gympie Railway Station and precinct were expanded, closely linked to the increasing economic importance of the district's dairy and fruit industries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Although some interior alterations, especially on the ground floor which contains the public spaces, can be expected in hotels that have sustained their function through many decades, the Railway Hotel at Gympie retains a high degree of integrity and intactness. It remains important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a large timber hotel of the early twentieth century, expressed in its form, exterior detail, and internal layout, fittings, fixtures and decorative detailing. High ceilings and verandahs illustrate a response to sub-tropical Queensland conditions, while the decorative elements on the verandah and gables reveal the influence of domestic forms on hotel architecture at this period. Internally, the place retains an early and fine timber staircase; extensive use of decorative pressed metal ceilings, ceiling roses and cornices in the public rooms on the ground floor; original door and window joinery and hardware; and a highly intact upper floor with early bedrooms opening off a central corridor. Earlier gas light pipes and fittings remain to the upper and lower rear veranda's. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Situated on one of Gympie's hills, the Railway Hotel is a prominent and well-known landmark in Gympie. The building's position overlooking the train station and next to the platform footbridge, reinforces its connectivity to the railway while making a strong aesthetic contribution to the railway precinct and to the Gympie townscape.

He was the Director of Music for the Welsh Region of the BBC. Biography Idris Lewis was born in Birchgrove near Swansea on 21 November 1889, the son of a coal miner. He was interested in music as a child, and when he was sixteen he won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music in London. In 1911 and 1912, after completing his studies at the Royal College, Lewis toured India and the Far East, giving piano recitals. He became assistant director at Daly's Theatre in London, and musical director at the Lyric and Gaiety Theatres. He was also organist at the Charing Cross Road Welsh Presbyterian Chapel and conductor of the London Welsh Choral Society and of the London Welsh Male Voice Choir. In 1927 he joined the film company British International Pictures, where he was the musical director from 1931 to 1937. While there he arranged the music for several films. His work on the 1934 film Blossom Time starring Richard Tauber brought Lewis to the attention of the BBC, and in 1936 he became the first Music Director of the Welsh Region of the BBC in Cardiff, where his assistants were to include the composers Mansel Thomas and Arwel Hughes. At the BBC Lewis was responsible for several radio series of popular vocal music, including Melys Lais and Cenwch im yr hen ganiadau. In addition to his film compositions, Lewis composed songs and arranged works for male voice choir. His song cycle Alun Mabon is a setting of a pastoral poem in Welsh by John Ceiriog Hughes (1832‚Äì1887), and includes C√¢n Yr Arad Goch which has become well known and has been recorded by singers including Bryn Terfel.

Intrastate airlines in the U.S. are defined as air carriers operating inside of one individual state and thus not flying across state lines. Larger intrastate airlines in the U.S. that operated mainline turboprop and/or jet aircraft were created as a result of past federal airline regulations as passenger air carriers that only flew intrastate service were not regulated by the federal government but were instead primarily regulated by the respective state governments in their home states. For example, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and Air California were both regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) prior to the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.https://www.latimes.com/business/hilzik/la-fi-hilzik-20140810-story.html Intrastate air carriers primarily operated in the United States but also elsewhere globally. In the U.S., California, Florida, Hawaii and Texas had scheduled jet passenger service operated by intrastate air carriers in the past. History Intrastate airlines were created as a result of U.S. federal government regulation of the airline industry. A number of intrastate airlines were also commuter or regional air carriers primarily operating smaller prop and/or turboprop passenger aircraft. These airlines connected smaller cities within their home state to the larger cities and airline hubs in the same state. Several intrastate air carriers in the U.S. operated larger mainline turboprop and/or mainline jet aircraft in the states of California, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas in the past. These airlines included: * Air California operating Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets as well as Boeing 737-100, 737-200 and Douglas DC-9-10 jets in California * Air Florida operating Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-9-10 jets as well as Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets in Florida * Aloha Airlines operating Vickers Viscount propjets followed by British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 737-400 jets on interisland flights in Hawaii * Hawaiian Airlines operating Vickers Viscount propjets followed by Douglas DC-9-10, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 and McDonnell Douglas MD-81 jets on interisland flights in Hawaii * Holiday Airlines operating Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets in California * MarkAir operating Boeing 737-200 jets in Alaska * Muse Air operating McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets in Texas * Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) operating Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets as well as Boeing 727-100, 727-200, 737-200, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar jets in California * Southwest Airlines operating Boeing 737-200 jets in Texas Pacific Southwest Airlines was the only U.S.-based intrastate air carrier ever to operate wide body jetliners in the form of the Lockheed L-1011. Before introducing the turboprop powered Lockheed L-188 Electra into its fleet in 1959 followed later by jet aircraft, PSA operated Douglas DC-3, DC-4 and DC-6 piston powered propliners during the 1950s. Most of the above airlines then added other jetliner types to their aircraft fleets after commencing interstate service in the U.S. For example, AirCal and PSA both added British Aerospace BAe 146-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets to their respective fleets with AirCal also introducing Boeing 737-300 jets. Muse Air added McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and DC-9-50 jets to its fleet. Air Florida added Boeing 727-100, 727-200, 737-100, 737-200, Douglas DC-8-62 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 jets to its fleet with the DC-8 and wide body DC-10 being used for transatlantic international flights. Southwest added Boeing 737-300, 737-500, 737-700 and 737-800 jetliners to its fleet and also operated Boeing 727-200 jets at one point. Aloha added Boeing 737-700 and Boeing 737-800 jets for flights to west coast of the U.S. and Canada as well as to South Pacific destinations. Hawaiian added Douglas DC-8-62, Douglas DC-8-63, Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jets followed by Boeing 767-300 and Airbus A330 jets for flights to the U.S. mainland as well as to international destinations and also subsequently operated McDonnell Douglas MD-81 jets on its interisland flights in Hawaii. Hawaiian currently operates Boeing 717-200 jets and ATR 42-500 propjets on its interisland flights. Due to Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) regulations governing interstate air transportation, smaller airlines and start up carriers were often able to find niche markets in their home states and were not subject to CAB exemption to cross state lines. United States Following the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, several intrastate airlines in the U.S. that were operating mainline jet aircraft then expanded with interstate service and in some cases international flights. One of the most successful former intrastate carriers which continues to exist is Southwest Airlines. Other airlines which started with intrastate services such as Air California (subsequently renamed AirCal), Air Florida, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and Muse Air (subsequently renamed TranStar Airlines) were subjected to post deregulation mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcies and no longer exist as individual airline companies. Also following the Airline Deregulation Act, those airlines previously classified and listed in the Official Airline Guide (OAG) as operating as an \\"Intrastate Air Carrier\\" were no longer listed as intrastate airlines in flight schedules published in the OAG. Former intrastate air carriers in the U.S. Air carriers noted in bold operated jet aircraft on their intrastate flights with all of these specific airlines with the exception of Discovery Airways and Tahoe Air subsequently expanding their operations with scheduled interstate service in the U.S. Intrastate route information is primarily taken from the route maps and system timetables sections of the departedflights.com website as well as the system timetables section of the timetablesimages.com website.http://www.departedflights.com, Airline Route Maps & Complete Airline Timetableshttp://www.timetableimages.com AirCal, Air Florida, Aloha Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, PSA and Southwest eventually operated scheduled international flights as well. Hawaiian Airlines, Horizon Air, SkyWest and Southwest are the only airlines on this list currently still operating. * Air California - The airline began operations in 1967 with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop service nonstop between Orange County Airport (now John Wayne Airport) and San Francisco International Airport. In 1976, Air California was primarily operating Boeing 737-200 jetliners as well as Electra propjets and was serving Lake Tahoe (served via the Lake Tahoe Airport with the Electra), Oakland, Ontario, Orange County, Palm Springs, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose. The airline subsequently expanded its service to destinations in Alaska, Arizona, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state as well as British Columbia in Canada, changed its name to AirCal and was then acquired by American Airlines after commencing interstate and international flights. * Air Florida - The airline began operations in 1972 with Boeing 707 jetliners with service to Miami, Orlando and St. Petersburg (via the St. Pete- Clearwater International Airport) and was the only airline in the U.S. to operate the 707 in intrastate service. By 1975, Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets had replaced the Boeing 707s with service being operated into Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee and Tampa.http://www.departedflights.com, April 15, 1975 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Tampa flight schedules In 1977, Gainesville and Jacksonville had been added to the route system with Douglas DC-9-10 jet service also having been introduced by this time and by 1978 Daytona Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Panama City, Pensacola and West Palm Beach in Florida had been added as well.http://www.departedflights.com, December 9, 1977 & Sept. 1, 1978 Air Florida route maps The airline then expanded during the late 1970s and early 1980s with new domestic service to destinations in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont as well as Washington, D.C. A major international expansion was also initiated at this same time from Air Florida's Miami hub with service to Amsterdam, Brussels, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Oslo, Shannon, Stockholm and Zurich in Europe in addition to flights to many destinations in the Caribbean and Central America as well as the Bahamas with service to Bermuda from the New York City area also being operated. Air Florida ceased operations in 1984 after declaring bankruptcy following commencement of interstate and international services. *Air Illinois - according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Air Illinois, which was a commuter air carrier, operated a separate, stand alone intrastate operation in Illinois with nonstop service between Chicago Meigs Field and the state capital in Springfield, IL utilizing Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops. http://www.departedflights.com, April 15, 1975 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Chicago Meigs Field flight schedules Air Illinois also operated British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets as well as commuter turboprop aircraft on interstate services. * Air Mid-America Airlines - operated Convair 600 turboprops in the state of Illinois *Air Pacific (United States) - operated in the state of California.

It was designed by Leslie Gordon Corrie and built in the 1890s by William Anthony. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011.  History  Smithfield Chambers, a two storey rendered brick building in Upper Mary Street Gympie, was built in 1895 for William Evan Thomas, mining secretary and sharebroker. Gympie (initially called Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in October 1867 by James Nash in the Upper Mary River district. The new goldfield put Queensland on the map as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. By Christmas of 1867, according to the Gold Commissioner, the Gympie field had a population of 4,000 (or over 15,000 according to James Nash). Alluvial deposits were quickly exhausted and from 1868 shallow reef mining occurred. As it evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, Gympie developed a distinctive character with an irregular street pattern amid a series of valleys and ridges. Development of roads within the township followed the terrain rather than adopting the standard grid pattern that was applied to townships surveyed for settlement, and consequently many roads run along ridgelines with linking roads across valleys and hillsides. Existing buildings and mining homestead leases were accommodated in the first survey of the township in April 1868. By the mid 1870s, the vicinity of Upper Mary Street and Channon St was dominated by government and financial institutions. The early makeshift structures of Gympie gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings. By the end of the 1870s, an intensive phase of underground reef mining was underway, facilitated by the injection of share-holding capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. During the early 1880s, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie. The increase in production led to an upsurge in company formation on a massive scale. This growth led to the 1884 formation of the Gympie Stock Exchange, specialising completely in providing facilities for the transfer of shares of mining companies. The presence of sharebrokers engaged in share trading at the Gympie Stock Exchange and of mining secretaries involved in the administration of mines were the natural consequence. Mining secretaries ensured that the mining company they represented complied with relevant legislation and regulation, and they kept board members informed of their legal responsibilities. Mining secretaries were the company's named representative on legal documents, and it was their responsibility to ensure that the company and its directors operated within the law. It was also their responsibility to register and communicate with shareholders, to ensure that dividends were paid and company records maintained, such as lists of directors and shareholders, and annual accounts. During the 1880s and 1890s Gympie was Queensland's second and then third biggest gold producer (after Mount Morgan overtook it in 1887). During this period gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland export income. The influx of money and the resultant yield of gold at Gympie were reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks and company secretary and brokers' offices. Several fires - in 1877, 1881 and 1891 - razed most of the earlier timber buildings in upper Mary Street and accelerated this transformation. While major floods and the economic depression affected the Gympie goldfield in the early 1890s, a rapid expansion in mining activity occurred during 1894. At the end of 1893, 58 leases embraced an area of 892 acres (361ha) and 78,978 ounces (2.24 tonnes) of gold bullion was produced. By the end of 1894 there were 80 leases covering 1,354 acres (548ha) and 111,168 ounces of gold bullion (3.15 tonnes) was produced, the biggest year of production of the 1890s. It was within this context of growth and prosperity that Smithfield Chambers was built in 1895 by William Evan Thomas, mining secretary and sharebroker. Thomas was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1854. A builder by trade, Thomas arrived in Brisbane in 1885, where he started business as a building contractor before eventually working for Hall's Mercantile Agency. After visiting Gympie in the early 1890s, Thomas moved to the township and commenced business as a mining secretary and sharebroker. Although Thomas had no experience in gold mining he soon became a very successful operator, floating a number of new mines in the eastern portion of the goldfield, attracting investors from Australia and abroad. By the end of 1895 WE Thomas and Co. acted as secretaries for 28 of the 100 mining companies of Gympie, the largest provider of these services. In November 1894 Thomas purchased freehold land adjoining Gympie's Stock Exchange from Matthew Mellor for ¬£1,000 cash. At this time the site featured timber buildings occupied by a chemist and fruiterer, and mining brokers. Thomas engaged Brisbane architect Leslie Gordon Corrie to design a block of offices and shops. Born in Hobart in 1859, Corrie trained as an architect in Tasmania and worked in private practice and for government. In 1886, he established a private practice in Brisbane and was appointed architect to the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society. In 1888-1892 he was in partnership with his former master Henry Hunter. From 1898 to 1905 he was in partnership with GHM Addison as Addison and Corrie. Corrie was a foundation member and long-time councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects, elected a fellow in 1889 and President from 1906-08. Smithfield Gold Mine, circa 1897 Before construction Thomas had already decided on the name of the building - \\"Smithfield Chambers\\", in honour of one of Gympie's most successful early mines, the Smithfield which began operating in 1867. Corrie advertised for tenders to erect the building during February 1895. By early March, William Anthony, of Brisbane (builder of the 1888 Smellie and Co Warehouse in Brisbane) was awarded the building contract for ¬£2,500, exclusive of the strong room and doors, with a requirement to have the work completed by July. Thomas' proposed internal layout for Smithfield Chambers was described in the Gympie Times in late 1894. On the ground floor there were two shops, one at either side, and the centre had a suite of offices facing the street on each side of the hall, with clerks' rooms and a boardroom at the rear. On the first floor there was a suite of three offices on the eastern side, accessed by a separate staircase. The other side of the first floor was divided into five offices and a large boardroom. Each suite of offices was provided with a strong room (of the four strongrooms, three are still extant). When completed, Smithfield Chambers, a two storey rendered brick building designed in a classical idiom was one of the largest and most prominent buildings on upper Mary Street. Thomas reinforced his commercial presence on the streetscape by prominently wording the parapet with \\"Smithfield Chambers\\" and \\"W.E. Thomas & Co., mining secretary\\". The building also included a first floor verandah and street awning. Among the earliest occupiers of the building were Mr J Nicholson, who operated as a tobacconist and hairdresser in one of the shop spaces, consulting engineer Brunel Kay and mining secretaries and agents Maxey and Moodie. In 1899 Thomas sold Smithfield Chambers to JB Charlton, a stockbroker and in 1902 ownership passed to John Donovan, a mining speculator. Gold production in Queensland peaked in 1903, due largely to a final burst of production at Gympie, which was followed by a 60 percent decrease in production between 1903 and 1913 as the three major Queensland goldfields (Charters Towers, Gympie and Mount Morgan) declined simultaneously. The Gympie field passed through its most profitable period from 1901 to 1906 and in 1903 produced its peak annual output of 146,000 fine ounces (surpassing Mount Morgan that year). After 1906 the decline that began in 1904 accelerated and by 1925 the last of the big mines had ceased production, ending a 50-year phase of deep reef mining in Gympie. In 1930 Charles Bright became owner of Smithfield Chambers. The building's association with gold mining continued through its occupation by Gympie's Stock Exchange Club. The Club had moved into Smithfield Chambers from the Australian Joint Stock Bank building opposite in 1923, which had been used as the Stock Exchange from 1902-1922. The club initially used the ground floor, and their premises consisted of a bar, reading room, three card rooms and two offices in 1937. During the early 1930s the Gympie branch of the Country Women's Association held their meetings at the chambers. The top floor was occupied by spirit merchants in 1957, and in 1958 the Stock Exchange Club took over three rooms on the first floor for a library, reading room and dinette. The club closed in 1963, and in 1964 Jack Cartwright, of Power and Cartwright solicitors, purchased the building. Power and Power, the firm predating Power and Cartwright, may have operated from the building from the 1950s. A photo from 1973 shows that the verandah had been removed by this time and John McCarthy Real Estate occupied the shop space to the left of the building. The current office fit-out dates from the 1970s, when an internal light well at the centre of the building was enclosed, and an awning replaced the verandah (post-1973). The rear yard of the building, which is level with the rear of first floor, contains the remains of a brick stable on the northwest side, and a rendered brick earth closet block, with eight cubicles and an access lane to the rear. While no documentary evidence has confirmed LG Corrie as the architect of the block, Corrie is known to have had a particular interest in sanitation, as Mayor of Brisbane in 1901 and as a lecturer in sanitary engineering in 1906. The Gympie Municipal Council first introduced by-laws relating to the erection and maintenance of earth closets in 1883. Initially only certain areas of the municipality (including Mary Street) were required to conform to provisions. In areas where earth closets were made mandatory, pit systems were filled in and existing toilets were required to be rebuilt or altered. Each earth closet was fitted with a box or other vessel \\"for the reception of nightsoil or other filth\\" and placed conveniently for removal. Earth closets were also required to be furnished with \\"a suitable receptacle for the storage of a quantity of dry earth for deodorising purposes\\". People engaged in the removal of nightsoil were required to pay an annual license fee and could only operate between eleven at night to five in the morning. From 1885 the council operated its own nightsoil service. By 1894 the whole of the municipality was under the provisions of the by-laws. In 1895, the by-laws were further extended and every nightman was required to keep a register of all premises visited, to be submitted monthly to the council inspector. Nightsoil service charges at this time were one shilling and six pence for a single pan and one shilling and three pence for additional pans. Smithfield Chambers is still used by Power and Cartwright. The ground floor, including the former shop spaces, is used as offices, and the first floor is only partially utilised. The two staircases from the street level to the first floor still exist, although only the northwest one is in use. A large space at the centre rear of the first floor has been partitioned. There are still two strong rooms on the ground floor, and one on the first floor.  Description  Smithield Chambers, 2015 An austere, two storey, rendered brick building in a classical idiom, Smithfield Chambers stands prominently on a sloping site to the northeast side of upper Mary Street, Gympie. Stables and a row of earth closets stand to the rear of the property. The rendered and painted front elevation is symmetrical about a central bay which at street level comprises a recessed main entrance with splayed reveals forming a shallow porch opening into the offices beyond. The entrance, now housing a set of modern steel framed doors, is flanked by sash windows with projecting moulded sills and chamfered surrounds enriched with roll mouldings. Pairs of narrow, cricket bat panelled timber doors are to each side of the sash windows and the former shop fronts to the outer bays are now infilled with fixed glass lights to the uphill side and glazed sliding doors to the downhill. At the upper level the five bays, defined by pilasters, are punctuated by window openings to the offices and stairwells beyond. Unified by the depressed arched window heads running level, the four larger openings each housing three hopper windows mark the offices and two smaller full pane sash windows mark the stairwells. A heavy projecting cornice crowns the pilasters below a blank parapet screen bearing the wording \\"erected / & co. / Smithfield Chambers / Ltd / A.D. 1896\\". This is topped by a central decorative gable panel bearing the wording \\"W.E. Thomas\\" below a floral enrichment. A suspended metal awning extends over the footpath. At the rear the building sits within the excavated hillside retained by a rendered masonry wall framing narrow passageways to the sides and rear of the building. The stepped rear elevation is dominated by the projecting, curved roof steel framed balcony to the middle of the upper level. The upper and lower levels are punctuated by timber doors with fanlights and full pane sash windows. The blank southeast and northwest elevations, step back at the rear accommodating a narrowing of the building footprint. Rectangular in plan, the building is laid out around a small two storey light well, accommodating office suites around the light well and shops to the outer edges. The light well is now enclosed but perimeter walls survive with elements including sash windows to the northwest and an arched opening to the northeast at the ground floor and sash windows opening from the boardroom and front and side offices on the first floor. The ground floor accommodates offices to the middle separated from the former shop spaces by stairwells rising to the upper level. The light well separates the front offices, now open plan, from the rear offices which are partitioned off a central corridor. A substantial strong room, notable for its heavy metal door and concrete floor, stands to the east corner and a smaller strong room is accommodated beneath the southeast stairwell. The two roomed shop spaces are rectangular in plan, the northwest now partitioned into offices. Both shops have rear doors exiting to the narrow passageways to the sides of the building. An acoustic tile ceiling has been inserted throughout the ground floor. A recent concrete block extension accommodating toilets stands to the rear on the ground floor. The first floor accommodates two suites of offices. The suite to the southeast consists of two offices and a strong room working off a corridor accessed from the dedicated stair from Mary Street. This strong room is also notable for its heavy metal door and concrete floor. The office suite to the northwest comprises two rooms to Mary Street and three rooms along the northwest side working off the corridor arrived at from the stair from Mary Street. This corridor runs to the boardroom extending across the rear with a small room opening off to the west corner. On the first floor, internal masonry walls are plastered and room partitions are timber framed and lined, some also have panels of opaque textured glazing. Ceilings are lined with tongue and groove timber boards, have moulded timber cornices and decorative ceiling roses. Original cedar door and window joinery, skirtings and architraves survive throughout. The boardroom is notable for its joinery including the painted French windows with fanlight to the balcony flanked by large full pane varnished cedar sash windows and full pane sash windows to the former light well to the southwest. This room now has a lower plain plaster ceiling and a three-quarter height partition to the southeast. The hopper windows to the Mary Street side offices do not have internal sills, reflecting the removal of earlier French windows to these openings. A small metal framed bridge travels from the rear balcony over the retaining wall to a grassed rear yard which accommodates stables to the northwest side and a row of earth closets to the northeast. Open to the front, the stables have perimeter brick walls to three sides, rendered to the exterior and face brick to the interior. Semi- circular fixed timber louvred openings run along the northeast wall and a line of rectangular fixed timber louvres runs along the upper northwest wall. The timber framing and cladding of the four bay structure are generally in a state of collapse. The end bays have timber floors supported by timber stumps, the middle bays have timber framed and lined partitions to an earth floor, some roof framing and corrugated iron roof cladding remain. Built on sloping ground with the cubicles stepping down, the eight earth closets are enclosed by three perimeter brick walls with rendered brick exteriors and painted brick interiors. The cubicles are sheltered by a skillion roof clad with corrugated iron and have rectangular fixed timber louvred windows with sills to the upper part of the northeast wall. The lower openings to this wall have small timber doors providing access to the pans. Some cubicles retain timber boxes and all retain timber doors. The easement from Nash Street gives access to the rear of the earth closets and stables. There are a number of self-sown trees and the ground to the easement path and yard is uneven.  Heritage listing  Smithfield Chambers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Smithfield Chambers is important in demonstrating the evolution of gold mining at Gympie, a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for approximately 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production shifted from shallow to deep reef mining from the mid-1870s, this change was reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. The building illustrates the growth, wealth and confidence of the Gympie goldfield in the 1890s. For nearly 70 years the building was intimately associated with the mining industry - from its earliest function of accommodating mining secretaries to the housing of the Gympie Stock Exchange Club from 1923 to 1963. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The row of earth closets to the rear of Smithfield Chambers is important as a rare surviving example of an early sanitary system that was once common but is now obsolete. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Designed to stand prominently in the commercial district of a booming gold mining town and retaining major design elements, including discreet office suites, boardroom, strong rooms, stables and earth closets, Smithfield Chambers is important in illustrating the layout and operation of a mining secretaries' building. The row of earth closets to Smithfield Chambers is a fine example of this type of sanitary facility, demonstrated by its layout and siting, and in its retention of major design elements including discreet cubicles with pan service doors, boxes and a service easement.

The gates provide an entranceway on Mary Street (the main street of Gympie) through to the Gympie Memorial Park in Reef Street. The gates were designed by George Rae and built in 1920 by A L Petrie & Son. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Gympie War Memorial Gates were unveiled in 1920 by Edward, Prince of Wales. The gates were designed by George Rae, of Brisbane. Monumental masonry firm A L Petrie and Son of Toowong undertook the stonework whilst an unknown local blacksmith produced the ironwork. The memorial honours the 167 local men who fell in the First World War and the two who fell in the Boer War. The gates were unveiled on 3 August 1920. The township of Gympie was established after the discovery of gold by James Nash in 1867. This was the beginning of the first large goldrush in Queensland, and the town developed to support and supply the prospectors who came to the area. In 1919 the Queensland Institute of Architects held a design competition for a memorial on behalf of the Gympie and Widgee District Soldiers' Memorial Fund. George Rae, then a young draftsman in the Brisbane office of Lange Powell won the competition. He also won the competition for the design of the Toowong War Memorial in Brisbane. George Rae was born in Glasgow, Scotland and arrived in Brisbane in 1914. Between 1919 and 1922, he was articled to architect L L Powell. He left to travel to Sydney and worked as a draftsman in various offices until 1924. Whilst in Sydney, he studied at Sydney Technical College and also with Professor Leslie Wilkinson. Returning to Brisbane in 1924, he again worked with L L Powell, firstly as chief draftsman and then as an associate. He became a registered architect in Queensland in 1929. The masons, A L Petrie and Son were the largest monumental masonry firm in Queensland at this time and were responsible for many First World War memorials throughout the state. The Henderson family donated their Union saw mill site for the Gympie Memorial Park and additional land was acquired at a later date. One of the objections was that the memorial park site was not on Mary Street, the main street of Gympie, but on the street behind it, Reef Street. So the Hendersons also donated land with a frontage from Mary Street through to Reef Street to create a passageway to the memorial park. The memorial gates stand on Mary Street at the entrance to the passageway. The cost for the gates was and although the memorial was for the whole of the Widgee Shire, the funds were raised primarily by public subscription and the Gympie City Council. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60 000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair.  Description  left Great War pillar, 2015 The First World War Memorial Gates are situated in Mary Street, Gympie. They are located at the entrance to a block of land which stretches from Mary Street to Reef Street. The gates are flanked by a hotel on one side and a shop on the other, forming a walkway to the Gympie Memorial Park behind. The area between the two buildings is paved with planting down each side. Brick toilet blocks are located at the Reef Street end. The Gates comprise two large and two small sandstone pillars with wrought iron swing gates and a wrought iron ornamental arch supporting a central lantern. An identical set of the smaller pillars are located in the walkway behind, also with an ornamental arch and lantern. The inner pair of pillars on the main gate are larger than the outer pair, however all four pillars have the same basic structure with differences in detailing. Names of the fallen in the Boer War and World War I (left-hand side), 2015 Names of the fallen in the World War I (right-hand side), 2015 All pillars sit on a substantial plinth capped by a torus moulding. From this rises a shaft of banded sandstone which culminates in a stepped element. The entire front face of the pillar projects slightly forward. The outer pillars are each surmounted by stylised eternal flame finials of sandstone. The front faces bear sandstone plaques with the words The Great War and appropriate dates on the western side and The Boer War and appropriate dates on the eastern side. The lower sides of each plaque is embellished with relief carved festoons of tropical fruit. The inner pillars are the same standard design as the outer pillars, but at a larger scale. They are surmounted by large urns, draped with swags. The front faces display marble plaques with leaded names of the local Fallen Heroes from the Boer and First World Wars. Above each plate are relief carved laurel wreaths with drapery behind. At the foot of the western pillar is a marble plaque with an inscription to the memory of the fallen. Green painted wrought iron swing gates allow vehicular traffic between the inner pillars and pedestrian traffic between these and the outer pillars. The gates have central arches at the top and simple decorative elements. Connecting the two inner pillars is an ornamental archway comprising scrollwork and scalloping and two flat plates. On one plate is the word Gympie, while on the other is the word Widgee. A decorative lantern is located at the centrepoint of the arch. Located behind the main gates is a second set of pillars, similar in design to the main outer pillars. The front faces bear marble plaques with the leaded names of the locals men who served in the Vietnam and Second World Wars. They are joined by the same decorative arch as the front pillars and have the words Lest We Forget on the flat plates. A lantern also hangs from the centrepoint.  Heritage listing  Gympie and Widgee War Memorial Gates was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. This particular memorial is rare as it also commemorates those who fell in the Boer War. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Unveiled in 1920, the Memorial at Gympie demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As part of the Memorial Park, the Memorial Gates contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the townscape. They are also of aesthetic significance for their high degree of workmanship and design. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Memorial Gates have a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. They also have special association with Brisbane architect George Rae as an early example of his work, and with Brisbane masonry firm, A L Petrie and Son.

Introduced in February 2016, it is used as the account system for Nintendo-published mobile apps, as well as the Nintendo Switch console (where it succeeds the Nintendo Network accounts used for authentication on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U), and other Nintendo services such as My Nintendo. A Nintendo Account can be created using an email address, or social login via Facebook, Google account, Twitter, or an existing Nintendo Network ID.  History  Prior to his death in July 2015, then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata secured a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA to develop mobile titles based on Nintendo's first-party franchises. During a presentation related to this business alliance on March 17, 2014, Iwata announced that a new membership program would be jointly developed by Nintendo and DeNA that encompasses the existing Nintendo 3DS and Wii U systems , smartphones and tablets, as well as a new gaming platform under development codenamed \\"NX\\". According to Iwata, the new membership service would \\"create a connection between Nintendo and each individual consumer regardless of the device the consumer uses.\\" In anticipation of the launch of Nintendo's first app, Miitomo, as well as the launch of its new loyalty program My Nintendo, Nintendo Account registration opened on February 17, 2016. Nintendo Account was extended to video game hardware with the March 2017 release of Nintendo Switch, where user profiles can be linked to an account for services such as online multiplayer and Nintendo eShop. In preparation for its release, the Nintendo Account ID system was introduced for display names. As of system software 6.0 (released September 2018 alongside Nintendo Switch Online), Nintendo Accounts can no longer be unlinked from profiles on a Switch console. Nintendo eShop balances can also be merged between Nintendo Network and Nintendo Account profiles. In April 2020, Nintendo confirmed that up to 160,000 Nintendo Accounts were affected due to a leak of Nintendo Network ID (NNID) user and password information gained via credential stuffing from other breaches, which led to malicious users to use these accounts to purchase digital content on the owner's credit card or stored payment. By April 24, 2020, Nintendo disabled the NNID means to log into the Nintendo Account, emails affected users to change their password, and recommended all users enable two-factor authentication for their Nintendo Account. Availability Pre-registration for a Nintendo Account began on February 17, 2016 in 16 markets. A Nintendo Account is required to sign up on My Nintendo. On March 31, 2016, the Nintendo Account, and consequently My Nintendo, was released in 39 markets, and has since been released in more. As of March 2017, Nintendo Account recognizes up to 165 territories. Similarly to predecessor Club Nintendo, as well as the Nintendo eShop, the Nintendo Network ID and My Nintendo, the Nintendo Account is not IP-restricted, and users from unlisted territories (as well as from listed territories with lesser services) can sign up for a Nintendo Account and use the service, in a country address different from their own without any known repercussions. However, persistent limits of the selected regional Nintendo eShop of choice applies. Regardless, the Nintendo Account is supported in more territories than Club Nintendo was, albeit many of the territories added later may be limited to only Nintendo mobile app support.

In 1947, he became a member of the Democratic People's Party (DNP) and involved in campaign activity of the party during the 1947 parliamentary election. In 1948, he organized several protests against the forced nationalization of his secondary school by the Communists. He also participated in the mass demonstrations against the unlawful arrest and imprisonment of Archbishop J√≥zsef Mindszenty. After that he was excluded from all secondary schools in the whole country, just months before graduation. He was able to take his leaving exam only in 1964 in Budapest. After 1949 he worked as an unskilled worker. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he joined the re-established Democratic People's Party. He again became involved in politics during the end of communism in Hungary, when he helped to organize the Buda branch of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF).

The app, Nintendo's first, allowed users to converse with friends by answering various questions, and featured Twitter and Facebook integration. The app was released in March 2016 for iOS and in May 2016 for Android, launching alongside their My Nintendo service. Despite initially being a critical and commercial success, with over ten million downloads worldwide a month after release, its popularity dwindled soon after and it was ultimately discontinued in May 2018.  Features  Miitomo served as a conversational app where users could communicate with friends by answering questions on various topics, such as favourite foods or current interests. Similar to Tomodachi Life, which some of the Miitomo development team also worked on, players used a Mii avatar which they could create from scratch or obtain from their My Nintendo account or a QR code, and gave it a computer generated voice and personality. Users could add friends to Miitomo by communicating directly with their device or by linking the app to their Facebook and Twitter accounts. By tapping their Mii, users could answer various questions which were shared with their friends, while tapping their thought bubble allowed them to hear answers from other friends. Users could visit, or be visited by, other friends and were able to answer certain questions that would only be shared with a specific friend. Players were also able to take pictures of their Mii, known as MiiFotos, which could be shared with friends as well as posted online. Performing various actions in the app would earn Miitomo Coins, which could also be obtained through in-app purchases. These coins could be spent on various clothing items that can be used to customize the user's Mii. Additional clothing items could be obtained through the Miitomo Drop minigame, which could be played by either spending Miitomo Coins or using Game Tickets earned through play. The app was tied into My Nintendo's rewards scheme, with users able to earn Miitomo Platinum Points by clearing missions such as changing their outfits daily or linking their accounts. Miitomo Platinum Points could be exchanged for special item rewards or additional Game Tickets, or could be combined with standard Platinum Points for other My Nintendo rewards.  Development  Miitomo was initially announced on October 25, 2015. Nintendo partnered with DeNA to leverage their understanding of mobile platforms as part of Nintendo's push for development on mobile devices, who were responsible for the service's infrastructure and My Nintendo integration. The app was first released in Nintendo's home market of Japan on March 17, 2016, and was later released in Western territories on March 31, 2016. The development team was headed up by Tomodachi Lifes core developers, under the supervision of Super Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto. Additionally, Nintendo announced plans to update the app further beyond the launch period. Albeit not required, users who linked their Nintendo Account to Miitomo enjoyed benefits such as cloud-saving. The app was released alongside the My Nintendo service respectively in all supported countries. Miitomo first launched in Japan on March 17, 2016, and by the end of the month, the app became officially available in all sixteen countries that were eligible for My Nintendo's pre-registration period. The app later became available in Mexico, Switzerland, and South Africa on June 30, 2016, and in Brazil on July 28, 2016. An update in November 2016 added five new features, enabling users to send messages to friends, customize their rooms, share their outfits with the world in \\"Style Central\\", publicly answer questions in \\"Answer Central\\", and allow for the creation of \\"Sidekick\\" Mii characters, which have their own rooms. Along with the major update, Miitomo launched in forty additional countries on the same day without any official announcements. In January 2018, Nintendo announced that the game would be discontinued, with its servers being shut down on May 9, 2018. Nintendo also stated that a browser-based Mii Maker tool would be created in late May following the discontinuation of Miitomo, the likes of which could be used to transfer and save Mii characters created within the app.  Reception  In Japan, Miitomo had one million users within three days of its launch, overtaking the instant messenger Line as the most downloaded free app on the Japanese App Store. In the week after its initial launch, Nintendo's shares grew by eight percent following the success of the app. In less than 24 hours after its worldwide launch on March 31, the app already had three million users globally, and also rose to the top of the U.S. App Store, overtaking Snapchat. Miitomo later had 1.6 million downloads within its first four days in the United States. By April 2016, Miitomo had a user base of over 10 million users with 300 million conversations between friends and 20 million screenshots taken within the app itself. Later observations conducted by SurveyMonkey however, found that only a quarter of the people who had downloaded it regularly opened the app by May 2016, being used half as much as Candy Crush Saga and Clash Royale.

Plan D-Minus was part of the National Plan for Emergency Preparedness, which also included Mobilization Plan C (providing direction for federal planning in the three weeks prior to a global nuclear war). The Plan Federal Emergency Plan D-Minus was designed for activation in the aftermath of either an anticipated or surprise attack of a \\"devastating\\" nature. It envisioned a scenario based on what was described as a major attack against the United States involving the near-simultaneous, or closely sequential, detonation of several hundred nuclear warheads. Plan D-Minus assumed a nuclear attack against the continental United States resulting in 48 million immediate fatalities and a significant number of non- fatal casualties. Primary government command and control facilities, such as the White House and the Pentagon, would be destroyed and emergency relocation facilities would be rendered minimally operable as a result of physical damage and the effects of radiation sickness on staff. At the same time, nothing but critical communications would survive and even those would be crippled due to action by enemy saboteurs. Industrial and agricultural production would be severely disrupted, society would fragment into local gangs, and the financial system would completely collapse. Immediately following an attack under D-Minus conditions, the National Security Council's Office of Emergency Planning would initiate and then decentralize its primary post-attack programs, including anti-hoarding and resource conservation measures, to those state and local governments that remained functioning. Meanwhile, emergency federal departments responsible for the most critical aspects of recovery would be formed and staffed from the \\"Executive Reserve,\\" a 1,700-person group of public sector employees who had previously received specialized management training. Heads of emergency departments were private sector subject-matter specialists who had been chosen in advance. A series of pre-drafted executive orders would be immediately signed by the President of the United States authorizing extraordinary measures, including preventative detention of persons on the FBI Security Index and suspension of publication of the Federal Register. Exercise Spade Fork Exercise Spade Fork, a training exercise simulating D-Minus conditions, was run from September 6, 1962 to September 27, 1962, concluding just weeks before the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the Spade Fork scenario, the first weapon to hit the United States was a decapitation strike at the president's Hammersmith Farm residence in Newport, Rhode Island. The exercise was timed to coincide with the command post exercise High Heels II, the military parallel to the civilian Spade Fork. Though long-planned to test nuclear war preparedness, the exercises were modified on September 17 by Gen. Herbert B. Powell to provide cover for the mobilization of units of the Fourth United States Army for deployment to Mississippi, whose governor was then resisting a court order to desegregate the University of Mississippi. Supersession Federal Emergency Plan D-Minus was rendered redundant due to changing conditions and assumptions about the nature of nuclear war. It was replaced in the mid 1960s by the Digest of Federal Emergency Measures. The digest, unlike Plan D-Minus, offered a set of scalable responses based on a continuum of destructive scenarios.

A Pratt through truss that carries Township Road 439 over the creek in Benton Township, Lackawanna County was built in 1885 and is on the Historic American Engineering Record. The bridge has a moderate span and is known as the Slates' Mill Bridge or the Tunkhannock Creek Bridge. In the early 1900s, major industries in the watershed of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek included agriculture and summer resorts. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad crossed through the watershed during this time period. Streams in the creek's watershed also provided water power for flour and lumber mills at Laplume, Dalton, and Factoryville. The major communities in the watershed at this time included Dalton, Factoryville, Glenburn, Fleetville, Laplume, Bardwell, and East Benton. One of the major features of the Hallstead Cutoff was an embankment in the vicinity of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. It is high, long, and has a volume of at least of fill. It was constructed in the early 1900s. In 2003, a grassroots citizens' group known as the South Branch Tunkhannock Creek Watershed Coalition was formed for the purposes of conservation in the watershed of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. In 2004, they began doing monthly monitoring of water quality, gauging water temperature, pH, the concentration of dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and the concentration of nitrates and orthophosphates. Since 2005, the organization has also been doing semiannual monitoring of macroinvertebrates in the watershed. Biology The main stem of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek is designated as a Trout-Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The main stem of the tributary Ackerly Creek also holds these designations. However, all other stream's in the watershed of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek are designated as Coldwater Fisheries and Migratory Fisheries. The creek is classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Approved Trout Waters. On a long reach of the creek between US Route 6 and the Keystone College campus, a Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only regulation is in effect. Brown trout and rainbow trout have been stocked in reaches of the creek by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. South Branch Tunkhannock Creek supports a relatively diverse array of aquatic fauna. Forests of eastern hemlock occur near South Branch Tunkhannock Creek along Little Rocky Glen, and ferns grow on ledges near the glen. Recreation Trail at Little Rocky Glen near South Branch Tunkhannock Creek At least of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek, downstream of a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 438, are navigable by canoe during snowmelt and within three days of heavy rain. The creek's difficulty rating typically ranges from 1 to 2-, although there is one class 3‚Äì4 rapid, at Little Rocky Glen. The scenery is described as \\"good\\" in Edward Gertler's book Keystone Canoeing. South Branch Tunkhannock Creek is relatively popular with kayakers and is also highly popular with anglers. However, the creek is highly powerful at Little Rocky Glen and several people have drowned in it. Lackawanna State Park is in the watershed of South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. The Countryside Conservancy owns a small preserve called Little Rocky Glen on the creek. Although there are several recognizable easy-to-moderate paths in the preserve, there is no formal trail system. Hikes known as the North Woods Trail and the Lackawanna Lake Loop are also in the vicinity of the creek at Lackawanna State Park. The first trail is of moderate difficulty and is long, while the second is easy to moderate and is . South Branch Tunkhannock Creek is described as \\"beautiful\\" at Lackawanna State Park in Jeff Mitchell's book Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeastern.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1883 to 1935. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 February 1995.  History  St Patrick's Church was constructed on Calton Hill in Gympie from 1883 to 1887, by the Roman Catholic Church. It was the third permanent church constructed in the town for the Catholic community on or near this site. The building was designed by the prominent Brisbane architect, FDG Stanley. The first Catholic mass was celebrated in Gympie in February 1868, in the Brisbane Hotel, by Father Tissot. The following month, Father Matthew Horan arrived on the newly established goldfields and assumed his position as parish priest, which he held until his death in 1923. Upon his arrival, Father Horan pitched a tent on Calton Hill to celebrate mass, beginning the long Catholic domination of the site. Tenders appeared in the Nashville Times on 18 March 1868, for the construction of a permanent church building. This timber building was ready for use by the end of 1868, but lasted only four years due to the damaging effects of weathering and white ants. Some of the land at Calton Hill was donated to the church by local residents including Patrick Lillis, and other land was bought at auction. In 1872 a second church was constructed of hardwood, and opened by Rev Dr James O'Quinn, Bishop of Queensland. Despite the later addition of side aisles, the hardwood church was regarded as inadequate for the growing Catholic congregation and another building was planned reflecting the importance of the church in the community. In 1879 a Catholic school was established on land nearby, when the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Gympie. Plans for the new church were prepared by well known Brisbane architect, FDG Stanley, and a local builder William Streeton and presented to the newly appointed Bishop Robert Dunne in 1881. Plans shown to the bishop were prepared for both a stone and brick church costing ¬£3800 and ¬£3000 respectively, and from these Dunne decided to proceed with a stone church. Bishop Dunne officiated at a ceremony, on 28 January 1883, to lay the foundation stone at St Patrick's. Subscription lists were opened for the funding of the construction and donations by the end of the day totalled ¬£1200. On 19 September 1883 the tender of J Smith and Co was accepted to supply the material and build the church for a sum of ¬£3591. Construction of St Patrick's took place over the next four years, firstly by the original contractors, then by Messrs Peter and George Duckworth. At about the time of this changeover the southern wall of the church collapsed in a strong wind. The joinery and seating was undertaken by local carpenter, William Condon. An organ worth ¬£500 and a marble altar also worth ¬£500 which was donated by Mr James Fitzpatrick, a successful mining pioneer in the area, were features of the new building. On 17 July 1887 St Patrick's Church was opened by Rev. Robert Dunne who had become the first Archbishop of Queensland. The church was built at a final cost of around ¬£10,000. At the opening, St Patrick's Church, which was built to accommodate 950, was crowded with 1400 people who paid to attend the service. The church was described as a landmark for many miles around due to its elevated position, its great height, its pure white stone walls and its well-cut lines. St Patrick's was rectangular in plan, though was designed to accommodate the later addition of transepts. It was originally built with corrugated iron roof sheeting with small ventilation gablets lining the roof. When St Patrick's opened, other churches in Gympie included a timber Presbyterian church on Red Hill, a timber Weslyan Methodist Church on Surface Hill which was replaced in the 1890s by a large brick church, and a small Church of England on Palatine Hill, also replaced by a large brick church in 1888. St Patrick's Church continued to grow under the care of Father Horan; an organ gallery, designed by Hugo Durietz was added in 1896. Upon Horan's death on 6 July 1923, Dean Michael O'Flynn became the new parish priest. O'Flynn immediately began arrangements for the completion of the east end of the church. Brisbane architects, Cavanagh and Cavanagh, were commissioned to design the completion of the southern end, parts of which had been stopped with metal sheeting until this time. The extension included a polygonal chancel and flanking this, two smaller polygonal rooms used as the vestry and the sanctuary. The tender of Mr Brittam, for an amount of ¬£1790 was accepted by 8 September 1924 and the work was finished in 1925. The following year work was completed on the adjacent brick presbytery, which replaced an earlier timber building. On 14 April 1929 Archbishop James Duhig dedicated newly installed stained glass windows placed where in the gables where the transepts were to have been extended. These windows were dedicated to the remembrance of the Catholic Emancipation and in particular to a key figure in the struggle, Daniel O'Connell. Duhig also laid the foundation stone for the new convent, commemorating the centenary of the Sisters of Mercy and the Jubilee of their arrival in Gympie. Father O'Flynn remained at St Patrick's until his death in 1935, when he was replaced by Monsignor Timothy Malony. Malony undertook vast improvements to the grounds, including paving and lawns around the church, and the construction of broad steps to the church. In 1951, the new parish priest Monsignor David Dee, concerned with the lack of accommodation at St Patrick's, established a new Catholic church in northern Gympie, diminishing the large congregation.  Description  St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is a substantial sandstone building on Calton Hill, a prominent site in Gympie. It is surrounded by concrete paving, and established lawns and gardens. There is a timber-framed bell tower on the lawns to the east of the church. The church has a rectangular plan, featuring a clerestoried five bay nave and side aisles, with an additional unextended transept bay. The church features a polygonal chancel and two smaller polygonal rooms on the southern end used as a vestry and a sanctuary. The building is constructed of rock-faced sandstone laid in courses of random sized blocks, with elements such as quoining, continuous moulding beneath the gutter, plinth course and string courses chiselled smooth. The building has a plinth of larger rock-faced sandstone blocks. The angle buttressing is sandstone with wide chiselled edges. The southern end of the church, including the transept gables, diagonal buttressing, chancel, vestry and sanctuary is constructed of bricks with an inscribed render, imitating ashlar stonework. Generally the church has pointed arch windows with geometric stone tracery. The steeply pitched gabled roof has Marseilles pattern interlocking terracotta tiles, with matching ridge capping. Gables are found on the southern end of the east and west walls, where transepts were to begin. Featured on each of the gables is a large pointed arch stained glass window, integrating many smaller lights with geometric tracery. The western wall features a portal entrance framed by a ribbed pointed archway. Pointed arch windows flank the portal and feature hood mouldings, which are integrated with a string course. Above the entrance is a large three arched window, incorporating four lancet lights and geometric tracery. At the highest point of the gable is a small inverted eyelet window. Pointed arch windows are found on the southern and northern walls, defining the internal bays. The clerestory windows use the quatrefoil motif, to frame brightly coloured stained glass in simple geometric patterns. Internally, round sandstone piers supporting pointed arches, form arcades which define the nave and aisles of the church. Slender engaged columns extend upward from the piers to support a variation of hammer-beam timber roof trusses, strengthened with brackets of decorative joinery. The ceiling is diagonally boarded, tongue and groove, v-jointed timber. A pointed chancel arch, opens onto the chancel which has a faceted dome ceiling, which is painted with religious scenes. The chancel features a marble altar, accessed via two marble stairs, and a small stained glass rose window of the Holy Family. The organ gallery at the west end of the church is supported on slender round columns with prominent stylised Doric capitals. The organ is inscribed with Richard Heslop 16 Burma Rd London. Timber-framed Stations of the Cross line the walls of the side aisles. Many of the stained glass windows bear plaques with details of the person who donated them.  Heritage listing  St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 February 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

It was designed by John Richard Hall and Claude William Chambers and built from 1876 to 1877 by Andrew Collins. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011.  History  This single- storey masonry former Queensland National Bank (QNB) and residence is located on the corner of Channon and Nash Streets, Gympie. It was designed by architect John Richard Hall in 1875 and opened in February 1877. Extensions designed by architect Claude Chambers were made in 1898. The bank served its original function until 1937. Gympie (initially known as Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield turned Queensland into a significant gold producer and contributed much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. With the change to deep reef mining from 1875, came the need for extensive capital investment through the formation of companies using foreign as well as local capital. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. The first Queensland National Bank building in Gympie, 1873 As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, it developed a distinctive character with an irregular street pattern amid a series of valleys and ridges. Consequently, many roads run along ridgelines (such as Channon Street) with linking roads across valleys and hillsides (as does Nash Street). Gradually the early makeshift structures of 1860s Gympie gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings, including government buildings on Channon Street from the mid 1870s. A series of fires in Mary Street in 1877, 1881, 1891, 1929 and 1946 razed many of Gympie's early buildings, but left the QNB building untouched. Other extant early buildings are the former Gympie Court House and Lands Office (1876) and the first Masonic Hall in Duke Street (1869). The Queensland National Bank was the first and most successful of Queensland's three indigenous 19th century banks. As the colony's most powerful banking institution, the QNB dominated the Queensland economy. It was established in March 1872 by an influential group of prominent Queensland squatters, politicians, lawyers, and businessmen who wished to secure development capital free from overseas or inter-colonial control. It commenced trading on 3 June 1872 at its first office in Brisbane. The bank attracted widespread Queensland patronage and branches opened in quick succession. By early in 1874 the bank had 10 branches. In 1878 the Queensland National Bank opened a branch in London, while one in Sydney opened two years later. In September 1879 Thomas McIlwraith (Queensland Premier 1877-83, 1888, 1893), a director of the QNB, persuaded Queensland Parliament to confer on it the whole of the Queensland Government's banking business. By 1880 the bank held 40% of the total deposits and advances in Queensland, a higher proportion than any other bank in any Australian colony. Despite financial scandals and a brief suspension of operation during the 1890s the bank exclusively held the government's account for 42 years, until 1921. A branch of the Queensland National Bank opened in Gympie on 11 December 1872, within six months of the bank commencing operation. In its first 21 days of trading the Gympie branch purchased of gold and in the first seven years of trading it handled of gold. By 1890 the QNB had 14 branches on the Queensland mining fields. Charters Towers and Gympie were the premier mining branches transacting more than half of the bank's mining business. Their aggregate deposits and advances exceeded making them highly profitable branches. Mainly due to Queensland's three major gold mining centres - Gympie, Charters Towers and Mount Morgan - gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland's export income during the 1880s and 1890s. The value of gold output rose from in 1883 to in 1889, exceeding the value of exported wool. These enormous amounts of gold were purchased by banks such as the Queensland National Bank, which played a vital role in this process of wealth creation and distribution. The architect for the Gympie branch of the Queensland National Bank and many of its other branches throughout the colony from 1872 was John Richard Hall (1835-83). Born and trained as an architect in England he migrated to the colonies by 1857. On 23 December 1859 Hall was appointed a foreman of works in the Queensland Colonial Architect's Office, but in the following May was made redundant. By 1864 Hall had begun private practice as an architect in Brisbane but little of his earliest work can be identified. From 1866 to 1872 he was Assessor for Brisbane's North Ward and in 1866 he was runner-up in a design competition for an engine house for the Citizens' Volunteer Fire Brigade. In 1868 he was appointed as a licensed surveyor in Queensland and took over superintending the outstanding work of Benjamin Backhouse, especially the completion of the Brisbane Grammar School (demolished 1911). As a private architect, Hall designed fine buildings throughout Queensland, including buildings for the Queensland National Bank; Maryborough Boys Grammar School (1881); residences including \\"Greylands\\", \\"Langlands\\" and 'Pahroombin'; commercial projects; churches; and hotels. Bank personnel outside the Queensland National Bank, circa 1890 Hall designed the QNB's Gympie bank building in 1875 and construction took place in the following year, on the site of the bank's previous timber building, which was moved to the rear of the new building and used as part of the residence. The task of supervising the building of the Gympie branch of the QNB and residence was undertaken by local Gympie architect Hugo Durietz. The new building was mainly of brick with stone foundations and the old timber premises were attached at the rear as part of the manager's residence. Andrew Collins was appointed as the builder after his tender of was accepted. The total cost of the building, opened in February 1877, was . In 1898 alterations to the Queensland National Bank building in Gympie were made by architect Claude William Chambers. These widened the bank on the western side of the Channon Street elevation to accommodate the accountant, clerks and a strong room. A site plan shows the extended bank building and the location of its outbuildings on the large block of land in relation to the building. The stables and buggy shed with feed room were located along Nash Street from the nearest point of the building. A water closet was located from the nearest point of the building to the south-east of the residence and a second lavatory was located to the south-west of the bank building along Channon Street. Architect C W Chambers (1861-1947) was born and educated in Melbourne and worked in both Melbourne and Sydney before coming to Brisbane in November 1885 to work for FDG Stanley. He assisted with the plans for St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Robert Harper and Co.'s mills and D L Brown and Co.'s new warehouse in Brisbane; was honorary architect to the Brisbane gymnasium and in 1885 was instrumental in founding the Queensland Institute of Architects. In March 1889 Chambers joined the Sydney architects A L & G McCredie as their Brisbane partner, forming McCredie Bros and Chambers. He supervised the firm's new AUSN offices (Naldham House) and in December 1889 produced the firm's winning entry in a design competition for Brisbane's Trades and Labour Hall. After the partnership ended on 1 February 1893, Chambers practised in his own right as an architect and consulting engineer in Brisbane and supervised the Burns, Philp and Co Offices in Townsville for the McCredie Brothers architects. His practice was one of Brisbane's largest in the early 20th century. His major works include \\"Drysllwyn\\" (later 'Raymont Lodge') home of Gympie magnate, William Davies; \\"Ross Roy\\", Indooroopilly; additions to the Commercial Travellers Association Club, Elizabeth Street (1898); \\"The Big Block\\" for Finney Isles, Queen Street (1908‚Äì10) and Perry House, corner of Albert and Elizabeth Streets, (1910‚Äì13). After entering partnership with Lange Powell in 1911 as Chambers and Powell, he moved to Sydney in 1915. From 1920 to 1935 Chambers formed another Brisbane partnership with E M Ford as Chambers and Ford and practised in Sydney from 1931 to 1934 with a pioneer woman architect from Queensland, Beatrice May Hutton (1893-1990). After the turn of the century the town's key function changed from gold mining to service town for the surrounding dairy and fruit- growing district. Accordingly, the QNB turned to commerce and agriculture to provide the Gympie branch's business. Over time the commercial centre of the town moved eastward down Mary Street in response to commercial activity centering upon the railway station. As a result, the QNB Board sanctioned the purchase of premises at the corner of Mary and Monkland Streets in 1937 for its operations and approved the sale of the Channon Street bank premises. In the following year it was sold. The building was used by industrial service businesses until its purchase by the Widgee Shire Council in 1990. Restoration of the former Queensland National Bank building by the Widgee Shire Council took place in 2000 after the shire council received funding under the Federation Community Projects Program for restoration of the building. The project was described as \\"architecturally sensitive restoration works on a culturally significant building\\". The work included reinstatement of the front and side verandahs that had been removed decades previously; repairs to the rear verandah, flooring, stumps, joists, windows, plaster and roof; repair and upgrading of electrical and plumbing installations and toilet facilities; polishing selected floors and laying floor coverings; and painting the building internally and externally. The former Queensland National Bank building served as Widgee Shire Council chambers (later the Cooloola Shire Council chambers) for a number of years, but, after the shire was amalgamated into the Gympie Region in 2008, the building was used as office space by the Gympie Regional Council.  Description  The former Queensland National Bank, a single storey rendered masonry building, stands to the corner of Channon and Nash Streets, Gympie. Sheltered by a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting the building, at street level to the north corner, is supported on concrete stumps and stone retaining walls accommodating the slope of the site south and southwest down to Mary Street. Three rendered masonry chimney stacks rise from rooms on the eastern side. Decorative paired timber roof brackets interspersed with rectangular moulded concrete indents run around the building under the main roof. A reconstructed timber floored verandah runs around the northeast and northwest sides, sheltered by a concave roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The main elevation faces northwest onto Channon Street and is asymmetrical about the main entrance which is marked by the projecting gable roof entrance within the concave verandah roof. The elevation is punctuated by large full pane sash windows one to the east and three to the west of the entrance, a two leaf timber door with an arched fixed light fanlight over. Plain painted concrete sills with stark moulded brackets project beneath the windows. The northeast elevation to Nash Street is punctuated by a run of openings - a set of French windows and entrance to the former residence to the south end and a line of four large sash windows to the north matching those of the main elevation. The blank southwest elevation is partly obscured by the recent small hipped roof, weatherboard clad extension accommodating an entry porch and toilets. The southeast elevation accommodates two large sash windows with concrete sills and is supported on a random course stone wall base. L-shaped in plan, the building accommodates the former bank in the northwest wing and the former manager's residence in the southeast wing. The bank wing is rectangular in plan and accommodates the banking chamber, accountant/clerks' office, strong room, manager's office and stationery room. Entered from the main entrance on Channon Street, the banking chamber is distinguished by a decorative pressed metal ceiling and cornice. Two flattened archways with prominent decorative keystones to the southwest mark the extent of the 1876 chamber beyond which is the accountant and clerks area also defined by a pressed metal ceiling and cornice matching that in the main banking chamber. A strong room stands to the southern corner of this space. The heavy metal door to the strong room has a maker's mark - John N Tann's Reliance Door - stamped on the front. The former manager's office stands to the northern corner of the building and opens into the banking chamber to the southwest and the stationery room to the southeast which in turn opens to the former residence behind. The manager's office is notable for a fine decorative pressed metal ceiling and accommodates a fireplace with a decorative timber surround. Square in plan, the core of the residence survives to the southeast of the bank. Four rooms are organised off a central hall which narrows halfway along. The main entrance to Nash Street is a four-panel timber door with sidelights and fanlights. Both front rooms have fireplaces with carved timber surrounds. Ceilings throughout the residence are plastered and plain with no cornices. The remnant of a gas light fitting remains in the room to the northwest of the entrance hall. Recent reconstruction and renovation work includes new door and window joinery and light fittings, however, original skirtings, architraves, fanlights, and door and window joinery and hardware survive. A pine floor runs throughout, polished in some areas and covered with carpet in others. A bitumened carpark stands to the southwest and southeast of the building. The shed to the south-east on Lot 1 is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland National Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank (QNB) building (1877)-and the important gold-era precinct of which it is a part-is physical evidence of the vital role of financial institutions in the process of wealth creation and distribution on Queensland goldfields as it converted enormous amounts of gold into cash. Gympie's gold was a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for approximately 60 years from 1867. The former QNB building is set apart from other bank buildings also in the Queensland Heritage Register (e.g. Royal Bank of Queensland) in being one of the permanent commercial buildings that resulted from the success of shallow reef mining, an early phase of gold mining in the town of Gympie, and the expectation of further gold discovery through deep reef mining. For 60 years the building served as a Queensland National Bank branch and manager's residence. It is one of only a few known 1870s commercial buildings remaining in Gympie. The siting of the QNB building on Commissioners Hill and its later sale when the centre of the town moved eastwards after gold production ceased also illustrate the evolution of Gympie's development. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former QNB building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, being a good example of a masonry structure combining a banking chamber, office and manager's residence. Its siting with other important institutions like the Lands Office and Courthouse on Commissioner's Hill, high above the gold diggings, illustrates the prominence of banks in the gold mining town of Gympie. The former QNB building is the oldest extant bank building in Gympie and the only one dating from the 1870s. Its intactness is demonstrated in its planning, room volumes, joinery, strongroom and pressed metal ceilings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Sited on one of Gympie's high points in the vicinity of important government buildings such as the former Lands Office and Courthouse, the former QNB building is symbolic of the importance and permanence of the bank in one of the most economically important towns in Queensland. Along with a number of other bank buildings, including the former Bank of New South Wales (Bank of New South Wales, Gympie), the QNB building contributes to an important and substantially intact gold-era precinct in upper Mary Street area of Gympie. The building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities expressed in the craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design which complement other surviving 19th century buildings in its vicinity. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former QNB building, operating as a QNB branch from February 1877 until 1937, has a special association with the Queensland National Bank. As one of its earliest and most profitable branches, the Gympie branch of the QNB was important in the QNB's growth in Queensland. By 1880 the QNB held 40% of the total deposits and advances in Queensland, a higher proportion than any other bank in any Australian colony. The bank also exclusively held the Queensland government's account for 42 years (1879-1921). As the colony's most powerful banking institution, the QNB dominated Queensland's economy during the last quarter of the 19th century.

It was designed by Hugo Durietz and built in 1892. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011.  History  The former Royal Bank of Queensland building at Gympie, located at 199 Mary Street, was designed by architect Hugh Durietz in 1891 and built in 1892. This neoclassical building served as the Gympie branch of successive banks for 87 years, firstly as Royal Bank of Queensland from 1892 and finally as the National Australia Bank to 1979. Gympie (initially known as Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield turned Queensland into a significant gold producer and contributed much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, the early makeshift structures of the 1860s gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings from the mid 1870s. With the change to deep reef mining from 1875, came the need for extensive capital investment through the formation of companies using foreign capital. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. Mainly due to Queensland's three major gold mining centres - Gympie, Charters Towers and Mount Morgan - gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland's export income during the 1880s and 1890s. The value of gold output rose from ¬£698,000 in 1883 to ¬£2.75 million in 1889, exceeding the value of exported wool. These enormous amounts of gold were purchased by banks such as the Royal Bank, which played a vital role in this process of wealth creation and distribution. The influx of money and the resultant yield of gold at Gympie were reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks and company secretary and brokers' offices. Several fires - in 1877, 1881 and 1891 - razed the earlier timber buildings in upper Mary Street and accelerated this transformation. A fire in January 1891 destroyed all of the buildings between the Gympie Times offices and the Mining Exchange Hotel which lead to the construction of more permanent masonry buildings on the eastern side of upper Mary Street. The last of the new buildings erected was the Royal Bank of Queensland, located adjacent to the Gympie Times office. Designed by Hugh Durietz in 1891, tenders were invited for the erection of the bank premises in December 1891; closing on 24 December. The bank was completed in 1892. Hugo Durietz (1831-1908) dominated Gympie architecture and its society. He was reported as having trained as an architect in Sweden before migrating to Victoria in 1852, attracted by its gold discoveries. He joined the gold rush to Canoona (Queensland) in 1858 but by 1862 had commenced business as a builder in Brisbane. He was contracted to build the Bank of New South Wales building on the corner of Queen and George Streets in Brisbane (subsequently replaced by the present building), supervised by James Cowlishaw, in 1864‚Äì65. In 1866 he was elected as an alderman for Kangaroo Point in the Brisbane Town Council but was bankrupted during the 1867 depression. After finalisation of his insolvency case in December 1867 he joined the rush to the Gympie goldfield where he became involved in many innovative business enterprises and joined community committees including those of the School of Arts; hospital; Mutual Improvement Association; Agricultural, Mining and Pastoral Society; and the Gympie Primary School. He is also attributed with introducing the mechanical cream separator to Queensland, a vital factor in the growth of the Queensland dairy industry. By 1871 Durietz had begun his practise as an architect in Gympie and for more than 30 years he was commissioned by institutions on whose committees he served, many religious denominations and by business leaders and professionals, often on an ongoing basis. He tendered for 113 buildings during his career; projects ranging from numerous hotels, shops and cottages to public buildings in Gympie like the Surface Hill Wesleyan Church, the Gympie School of Arts and the Royal Bank building. The Royal Bank of Queensland, established in 1885 by local investors who were finding it hard to obtain loans from sources outside Queensland, was intended as an alternative to its rival the Queensland National Bank. It was one of only three Queensland-based banks established during the 19th century. The head office opened in Brisbane in February 1886 and although it established three branches in the mining towns of Gympie, Charters Towers and Croydon, it generally avoided mining towns because they were too risky. Instead the Royal Bank concentrated on mercantile and agricultural interests near the coast, opening branches in sound agricultural districts and ports. By 1889 it had 20 branches and agencies including branches in London and Edinburgh. In 1890 the Royal Bank occupied fifth place amongst the ten banks trading in Queensland. The Royal Bank, in contrast to the Queensland National Bank, generally contented itself with timber and iron premises rather than occupying extravagant masonry buildings in the larger towns; established a more cautious lending policy instead of erratic lending due to fluctuating government deposits; and was the bank of humbler men rather than of the elite. Initially the Royal Bank had followed a cautious banking policy acquiring ¬£1 million in deposits by the end of 1888. This forced the bank to increasingly lend to people and industries that could not easily repay on demand, thereby following the custom of Queensland banking. Subsequently, in May 1893 the Royal Bank became one of the many banks that temporarily ceased trading at the height of the 1893 banking crisis in Queensland. By the end of May a reconstruction scheme for the Royal Bank had been announced and in early August 1893 the bank re-opened for trading. The 20th century brought a series of mergers for the Royal Bank of Queensland. In 1917 the bank merged with the Bank of North Queensland, which had opened in Townsville in 1888, to become the Bank of Queensland. In 1922 this bank was absorbed by the National Bank of Australasia. Following the amalgamation of the Queensland National Bank with the National Bank of Australasia to form the National Bank of Australia in 1948 there were two branches of the bank in Gympie - at 33 and 199 Mary Street. In January 1980 the National Bank amalgamated its branches at 33 Mary Street and 199 Mary Street to form a single bank of the National Bank in Gympie at 33 Mary Street, ending 87 years of banking at 199 Mary Street. The former Royal Bank of Queensland building was auctioned in March of the same year and became commercial premises. Alterations to the bank have included the enclosure of most of the rear verandah and some of the side verandah, the addition of partition walls to form an office in the centre of the public space and removal of the banking counter. Doorways in two interior walls have been altered. A ramp has been added on the left hand side from Mary Street to the main entrance. Roofing iron has been replaced on the main roof and the rear and side verandahs. The former Royal Bank building before 2011 was the headquarters of the Gympie Muster.  Description  The former Royal Bank of Queensland is an imposing single-storey rendered masonry building with a pedimented temple front standing prominently to upper Mary Street in Gympie's central business area. The rendered masonry front fence forms a plinth to the building which is set back from the property boundary and raised above street level. The compact front elevation is dominated by a projecting pedimented portico which is framed by fluted corner pilasters and shelters a set of concrete stairs and a landing. The plain moulded pediments of the front elevation and portico rest on decorative entablature friezes. The portico pediment has 1892 inscribed within. The front elevation is defined by fluted corner pilasters and composed of three arched openings notable for their severe rendered rusticated surrounds. The central arched entrance accommodates a narrow draft lobby which projects into the banking chamber. The lobby is lined with timber panelling and houses two sets of doors, the outer a set of solid timber panelled doors and the inner a set glazed timber doors. The flanking arched openings house timber framed double hung sash windows with masonry sills. Garden beds sit behind the front fence separating the building from the footpath. Decorative wrought iron balustrading runs between the fence posts and a decorative wrought iron gate opens to the entry steps. A recent concrete ramp to the western end is accessed from the street through a later opening in the front fence. The building is sheltered by a gabled roof hidden from view behind the pediment. The roof is timber-framed and clad with corrugated metal sheeting and rests within parapet walls on all four sides. Box gutters drain to two rainwater heads at each end of the northern elevation. A masonry chimney with moulded cornice rises through the roof on the eastern side of the building. Exterior walls to the remainder of the building are rendered and finished with shallow ruled ashlar. The western elevation is punctuated by four large double-hung sash windows shaded by curved timber-framed window hoods. Verandahs wrap around the east and north. The south end of the east verandah is open and stop chamfered posts with capitals are supported on recent metal stirrups and bearers are supported on low masonry piers. The verandah roof is timber-framed and the floor is lined with wide hardwood boards. Two door openings to the east verandah flank a large double-hung timber sash window. At the south end, a timber paneled door with glazed fanlight opens into the manager's office and the northern opening houses glazed French windows which open into the vestibule to the rear of the manager's office. The remainder of the verandahs is enclosed with concrete blockwork. The parapet wall on the northern elevation rises to follow the gabled roof shape and is capped with a simple masonry mould. Early security bars remain in place on all external openings. The interior is organized around the banking chamber which is accessed directly from the main entrance. The manager's office opens to the right of the chamber and two smaller offices and the bank vault run along the rear. A side entrance from the east verandah opens into a vestibule to the rear of the manager's office providing discreet access to this office and to the rear of the chamber. The banking chamber has additional later partitioning that is not full height. Two decorative timber rails run at half height around the chamber. An early fireplace, located in the manager's office, is framed with a simple timber mantelpiece and has a cast iron grate and side cheeks with a masonry hearth. The interiors generally are notable for early cedar joinery and early door and window hardware including door knobs, locks, drop bolts, porcelain finger plates and key plates, and brass door handles to inner entrance doors. There is a gaslight fitting to the left of the vault opening. Internal openings are generous in height and house fine timber-paneled doors with tall glazed pivoting fanlights. Generous moulded plaster skirting boards and timber skirting blocks and architraves are intact throughout. All interior timber work and joinery is varnished. Walls and ceilings are lined with hardset plaster with deep moulded cornices. A single decorative plaster ceiling rose is located in the banking chamber. Floors are generally covered with recent carpet. The early bank vault remains intact and is secured by a heavy, metal plated door with early door furnishings intact. The vault is formed with arched brickwork supported on thick brickwork walls which have a thin render finish and has metal rod cross bracing. The site rises sharply to the north, registering Gympie's hilly landscape. A concrete retaining wall stands to the rear of the building within which concrete steps rise steeply to a flat grassed platform which accommodates a small blockwork shed which is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. An early concrete surface drain is located on the eastern side of the building.  Heritage listing  The former Royal Bank of Queensland was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Royal Bank of Queensland (Royal Bank) building (1892)-and the important gold- era precinct of which it is a part-is physical evidence of the evolution of gold mining at Gympie, a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for approximately 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production continued and evolved from alluvial to shallow reef mining to deep reef mining from 1875, this change was reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. The Royal Bank, built during the third stage of Gympie mining, symbolised the wealth and permanence of the town. The former Royal Bank building is important in demonstrating the vital role of financial institutions in the process of wealth creation and distribution on Queensland goldfields as it converted enormous amounts of gold into cash. The longest serving of all the Gympie bank buildings, the Royal Bank building functioned as a bank branch from 1892 to 1979. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Royal Bank of Queensland building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, being a good example of a masonry structure in a classical style combining a banking chamber and offices. Its siting with other gold-related buildings in upper Mary Street above the gold diggings, illustrates the prominence of banks in the gold mining town of Gympie. Its intactness is demonstrated on its exterior and in its room volumes, joinery and fittings and extant strongroom. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Royal Bank building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities expressed in the craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design. These qualities complement other surviving 19th century buildings in the street, particularly other banks also entered in the Queensland Heritage Register including the nearby former Bank of New South Wales. Its balanced classical design, often associated with banks, projects the concept of stability that financial institutions of this era sought to convey through their buildings' architecture. Set back from the property boundary and with a prominent portico addressing the Mary Street frontage, the former Royal Bank has a striking appearance, giving it enormous streetscape presence among the upper Mary Street gold-era buildings. This important and substantially intact gold-era precinct comprises a harmonious streetscape of late Victorian commercial buildings dating from the 1880s and 1890s. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Royal Bank building is a fine example of the work of architect Hugo Durietz who dominated Gympie architecture between 1871 and at least 1902 and was a highly regarded community leader. Other extant significant buildings designed by Durietz, include the Surface Hill Wesleyan Church, School of Arts, the organ loft of the St Patricks Church and the upper floor and facade of the Crawford & Co Building at 216 Mary Street, Gympie.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1881 to 1882. It is also the former Australian Joint Stock Bank and the Neilson, Stanton and Parkinson Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011.  History  The former Australian Joint Stock Bank (AJSB) and later Gympie Stock Exchange building is a single storey rendered brick building in the classical style, plus a basement. Located in upper Mary Street, Gympie, it was designed by leading Queensland colonial architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1881-1882 for the Australian Joint Stock Bank as its permanent Gympie branch. Between 1902 and circa 1922 it functioned as the Gympie Stock Exchange Offices and Club. Gympie (initially known as Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield turned Queensland into a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, the early makeshift structures of the 1860s gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings from the mid 1870s. With the change to deep reef mining from 1875, came the need for extensive capital investment through the formation of companies using foreign as well as local capital. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. The influx of money and the resultant yield of gold were reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks and company secretary and brokers' offices. Several fires - in 1877, 1881 and 1891 - razed the earlier timber buildings and accelerated this transformation. A fire in August 1881 destroyed all of the buildings between Patterson's brick store and the Bank of New South Wales (242 Mary Street), leading to construction of more permanent masonry buildings in western side of upper Mary Street. One new building was that of the Australian Joint Stock Bank constructed during 1881 and 1882. Australian Joint Stock Bank, Gympie, circa 1871 The Australian Joint Stock Bank was established with the discovery of gold in southern colonies in 1852 and opened branches on Queensland goldfields as they were discovered, including a branch at the Gympie goldfield on 10 March 1868. By 1878 the AJSB wished to establish a permanent branch in the town and purchased two adjacent town allotments (allotments 5 and 6, Section A) for this purpose in late October and early November 1878. The building designed for this site by architect FDG Stanley is in the neo-classical style befitting an organisation wishing to project stability, reliability and longevity. After seeing the plans, the building was described by the Gympie Times as \\"a very handsome brick building of two - or more correctly speaking - of one storey and a basement. The lower portion will be used as a record room, and the upper floor adapted for offices etc, the front being adorned with a handsome portico\\". Andrew Collins was contracted as the builder and the building cost approximately . The bank's architect, FDG Stanley, arrived to Queensland in 1861 and was employed by the Lands and Works Department in the Queensland Colonial Architect's office from 1863 until 1881. The last eight years of his service were as Colonial Architect and as such he was the longest-serving of all Queensland's Colonial Architects. His principal building in this capacity was the Supreme Court Building in Brisbane (demolished). Thereafter Stanley worked in private practice until his death in 1897. His work was prolific and he produced many important buildings including the Queensland National Bank in Brisbane, the Holy Trinity Church and Rectory in Fortitude Valley, the Queensland Club in Brisbane and the Brisbane General Post Office. Among his regular clients were the Queensland National Bank, Australian Joint Stock Bank, the Union Bank of Australia, the Anglican Church and the merchants DL Brown and Co, for whom he designed substantial buildings throughout the colony. His buildings in Gympie include the former Gympie Post Office and St Patrick's Catholic Church. Stanley has been described as \\"the best known of all Queensland's early architects because of the quality, diversity and extent of his work\\". Although bank architecture projected stability and reliability, these could not be provided in 1893 when Queensland suffered its worst banking collapse and eight of its eleven banks temporarily ceased trading, including the AJSB. It suspended trading from April to July when it reopened as a limited liability bank, namely, the Australian Joint Stock Bank Limited (AJSB Ltd). The property at 236 Mary Street was transferred to this institution and the bank continued to operate from this building in Mary Street until its closure on 17 January 1902. Shortly thereafter the premises were sold to the Gympie Stock Exchange which retained the premises until 1923. From its inception on 10 July 1884, with 127 members and 60 companies listed, the Gympie Stock Exchange had occupied a building on the opposite side of upper Mary Street adjacent to the Mining Exchange Hotel (now the RSL Club). At its meeting on 25 February 1902 the Committee of the Gympie Stock Exchange resolved to offer for the AJSB Ltd premises on the following terms: cash, the balance in instalments of pa with 5% added for interest. The purchasers were to have the right to pay larger instalments and the Bank was to retain the deeds of the property until it was fully paid for. At its next meeting on 5 March 1902, the offer having been accepted, the Chairman of the Committee was empowered to complete the purchase of the AJSB Ltd premises. The Committee met again on 12 March to consult with architect Hugo Durietz regarding alterations to the premises. These additions and alterations were undertaken in May and June 1902. They included the Stock Exchange call room, a separate timber building, erected by Pointer and Stewart for at the rear of the former bank and accessed by a laneway on the lower (left-hand-side) of the building. The Stock Exchange offices and its newly formed club were housed in the former bank building. The formation of the Gympie Stock Exchange had resulted from the increase in the production of gold at Gympie through deep reef mining. During the 1880s and 1890s Gympie was Queensland's second and then third biggest gold producer (after Mt Morgan gold production overtook it in 1887). During this period gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland's export income. The increase in production led to an upsurge in company formation because the industry was also the major capital-using sector of the colonial economy and so adopted company formation on a massive scale. This growth in gold- mining shares led to the formation of the Gympie Stock Exchange for their trading. Other goldfield stock exchanges were established at Charters Towers and Ravenswood. The Gympie Stock Exchange specialised completely in mining. During its existence it competed with its Brisbane counterpart (also established in July 1884) - providing facilities for the transfer of shares of Gympie mining companies. The existence of the Stock Exchange in Gympie, in the heart of the goldfield, kept many shares away from Brisbane and, in addition, aided the development of company formation in Gympie. The volume of sales of Gympie shares on the Brisbane Stock Exchange rarely exceeded that on the Gympie Exchange. Substantial changes in the Queensland mining sector occurred between 1899 and 1913. Gold production in Queensland peaked in 1903, due largely to a final burst of production at Gympie, which was followed by a 60% decrease in production between 1903 and 1913 as the three major Queensland goldfields (Charters Towers, Gympie and Mt Morgan) declined simultaneously. A treatment process for mine tailings that used cyanide had provided Gympie a record yield in 1899. The Gympie field passed through its most profitable period from 1901 to 1906 and in 1903 recorded an output of 146,000 fine ounces (surpassing Mount Morgan that year). After 1906 the decline that had set in at Gympie in 1904 began to accelerate. This downturn in gold production forced the eventual closure of the Stock Exchange . Despite this closure the Stock Exchange Club continued in this location at 236 Mary Street until 1923 when the premises were sold. On 5 July 1923 Gympie solicitor Frederick Barker Sykes purchased the Gympie Stock Exchange site for . The Gympie Stock Exchange call room was removed . It was divided into two sections. One of these was moved to Mothar Mountain where it became the home of Professor Edward Sykes (son of FB Sykes; Professor of Law at the University of Queensland and later at the University of Melbourne) and was later destroyed by fire. The other portion was relocated to the north-west of the Cooroy railway station goods' shed, where it remains. After the sale, the Gympie Stock Exchange Club moved to Smithfield Chambers on the opposite side of Mary Street, where the Club remained until when its closure occurred due to a declining active membership. The former bank and stock exchange building continued in the ownership of the Sykes family until 1976 when it was sold to Neilson, Stanton and Parkinson - another firm of solicitors. These owners report that only minor changes have been made to accommodate their firm's operations in the original building, although additions have been made to the rear of the building.  Description  The former Gympie Stock Exchange, a single storey (with basement) masonry building with an elegant temple front, stands in upper Mary Street in Gympie's central business area. The early part of the building stands to the front of the site and a latter addition to the rear is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The building is built to the front property boundary. The building is sheltered by a hipped roof clad with metal sheeting which is screened by a decorative balustraded parapet. A brick chimney with cornice banding rises through the roof on the western side of the building. The temple front comprises moulded square columns in an implied Doric order forming a timber floored entrance colonnade running across the front elevation. The columns support a plain entablature with a heavy moulded cornice. The projecting central entrance is flanked by twinned round and square columns supporting a plain entablature and crowned with a plain pediment. Decorative wrought iron balustrading runs between the square columns and a two-leaf decorative wrought iron gate marks the entrance. The front elevation is defined by square pilasters to the corners and is smooth-rendered masonry with a paint finish. The elevation is composed of three arched openings comprising a central entrance flanked by large double hung timber sash windows. A moulded cornice gives unity to the elevation. The side elevations of the building are red facebrick and the building is separated from the adjacent buildings by narrow pedestrian lanes. The central front entrance comprises a draft lobby consisting of a pair of exterior timber paneled doors with an arched fanlight and a pair of interior glazed timber doors on pivoting hinges. These swing doors are notable for the decorative brass, timber and glass handles. The flanking arched openings accommodate large double-hung timber sash windows. The draft lobby opens into the banking chamber with the manager's office and the bank vault opening off this to the west. The rear section is organized off a central corridor with two rooms opening to the west and a single room to the east. Internal openings are generous with wide timber paneled doors some with glazed pivoting fanlights. The south opening to the manager's office accommodates a glazed timber paneled door. Generous timber skirting boards, skirting blocks and architraves are throughout. Walls are lined with plaster and ceilings with fibrous cement sheeting with timber cornice and cover strips. Much early door and window hardware survives including brass door handles and plates, porcelain fingerplates, doorknobs, key plates, hinges and locks. Floors are generally lined with recent carpet but the early pine floor boards are intact below. The original rear doors are intact and consist of a pair of timber paneled doors to the east side and a single timber paneled door to the west. The foyer accommodates part of the ornate carved and paneled front counter. The thick vault door has a fine timber paneled door with original hardware including brass handle to the chamber face and is lined with a heavy brown metal plate to the inner face. The vault comprises an arch concrete roof supported by thick brick walls. The manager's office has an early fireplace with a decorated timber mantelpiece and cast iron grate and side cheeks. The basement accommodates a storage vault where brick piers, brick foundation walls and the sandstone foundations of the vault above are visible. The timber-framed floor above is unlined. Facebrick arched brick lintels are above internal openings which accommodate pairs of timber paneled doors. Early metal bars are located on the inner face of the timber sash windows which have been sealed.  Heritage listing  The former Australian Joint Stock Bank and former Gympie Stock Exchange offices and club was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Australian Joint Stock Bank (AJSB) building (1882)-and the important gold-era precinct of which it is a part-is physical evidence of the evolution of Gympie gold mining, which was a major economic contributor to the wealth of Queensland for nearly 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production continued and evolved from alluvial to shallow reef mining to deep reef mining from 1875, this change was reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. The former AJSB building was one of these permanent commercial buildings. The former AJSB building is important in demonstrating the vital role of financial institutions in the process of wealth creation and distribution on Queensland goldfields when as a bank branch (1882-1902) it converted enormous amounts of gold into cash and later in its role as the Gympie Stock Exchange Offices and Club (1902-circa1922). The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As the premises of the Gympie Stock Exchange Offices and Club from 1902 to circa1922, the former AJSB building demonstrates a building type that has always been uncommon in Queensland and remains so. It is a rare surviving remnant of one of the four stock exchanges (in Brisbane, Gympie, Charters Towers and Ravenswood) that operated during the 19th century while Queensland was a significant gold-producer. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former AJSB building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, being a good example of a masonry structure in the classical style combining a banking chamber and office. Its siting with other important gold-related buildings in upper Mary Street, high above the gold diggings, illustrates the prominence of banks in the gold mining town of Gympie. Its intactness is demonstrated in its planning, room volumes, joinery, and strong room. Designed by the respected and prolific architect, FDG Stanley in 1881-82, the former AJSB building is a good example of Stanley's regional bank architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former AJSB building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities, expressed in the craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design. These qualities complement other surviving 19th century buildings in the street, particularly other banks also entered in the Queensland Heritage Register including the nearby former Bank of New South Wales. The important and substantially intact gold-era precinct, of which this building is a valuable part, comprises a harmonious streetscape of late Victorian commercial buildings dating from the 1880s and 1890s. Its balanced classical design, often associated with banks, projects the concept of stability that financial institutions of this era sought to convey through their buildings' architecture.

History =Aboriginal community= Koonibba was formerly an Aboriginal mission, founded in 1901 by the Lutheran Church on land comprising which they bought in 1899. The mission was established near the traditional lands of the Wirangu, Mirning, and Kokatha peoples. A school was built within a year, with the church following in 1903. The church was built by two Aboriginal men named Thomas Richards and Mickey Free (Michael Free Lawrie). Aboriginal people came to the mission seeking employment, for which they were paid, but conversion to Christianity was a pre-condition for wages, food and housing. The South Australian Royal Commission on the Aborigines gathered evidence from the mission in 1914, and recommended that the mission be taken over by the government. In 1914, the Koonibba Children's Home was opened. After World War I ended in 1918, the mission stopped growing wheat, and started grazing sheep instead, which needed less labour, so people moved away for work. In 1931 the Lutherans decided to sell the station, without any prior consultation with the residents. The residents petitioned the Church to work the land autonomously, but their request fell on deaf ears. No buyers were forthcoming, and farming ceased in 1993, but the church continued to control the lives of the residents until 1958, when the residents staged a walk-off as a protest. In 1963, the mission was taken over by the South Australian Government, and then in 1975 it was transferred to the Aboriginal Land Trust, which leases the site to a local Aboriginal community organisation, the Koonibba Aboriginal Community Council, Inc., which manages the community. \\"Koonibba Lutheran Children's Home\\" was listed in the 1997 Bringing Them Home report, as an institution housing Indigenous children forcibly removed from their families, leading to the Stolen Generations. =The locality of Koonibba= Boundaries for a locality were created on 28 January 1999 for the long-established local name of Koonibba. The Eyre Highway forms part of the locality's southern boundary. In 2013, a portion of the locality which was located in the Yumbarra Conservation Park was removed and added to the new locality of Yumbarra to ensure that all of the conservation park was located within the new locality. Population and facilities , Koonibba and an adjoining part of the locality of Yumbarra has a population of 149, 87% of whom are Indigenous Australians. The settlement has a public school, the Koonibba Aboriginal School. An Australian rules football club, the Koonibba Football Club, was formed in 1906. It is the oldest Aboriginal football club still in existence, and plays in the Far West Football League today. A general store, giving locals access to fresh groceries for the first time in 40 years, was opened in February 2019. It is planned to develop tourist attractions, with a focus on the history of the settlement. Cultural artefacts stored at the South Australian Museum would be put on display, to engender pride in the community and provide a learning experience for tourists. Heritage buildings The Our Redeemer Lutheran Church from the former Koonibba Lutheran Mission survives and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Koonibba Test Range In 2019-2020, a private space company, Southern Launch, consulted with the Koonibba Community Aboriginal Corporation and established the Koonibba Test Range in the vicinity of Koonibba. The first launches were small rockets carrying a small replica payloads on 19 September. This made Koonibba \\"the world‚Äôs first First Nations community to host the world's largest privately operated rocket test range\\". Companies, universities, space agencies and other organisations from around the world are expected to pay for their rockets to be taken to the site, the launch and recovery of their payloads and rockets, with Southern Launch arranging for the necessary permits. In literature Mazin Grace, by Dylan Coleman, is a fictionalised account of the author's mother's life as a Kokatha child growing up on Koonibba in the 1940s and 1950s. It won the 2011 David Unaipon Award for Unpublished Indigenous Writer.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built in 1896. It is also known as Jeffery & Cuddihy Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011.  History  Tozer's Building was designed in 1895 by noted Brisbane architect Richard Gailey as solicitors' offices for Horace Tozer (later knighted) and his partner Anthony Conwell. Practising as a solicitor in Gympie from 1868 until 1898, Tozer was noted as an authority on mining law and as a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, minister and Agent-General. These two storey purpose-built offices with basement, designed in a classical style have been used as solicitors' offices from 1896 until the present day. Gympie was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield established Queensland as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, the early makeshift structures of the 1860s gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings from the mid 1870s. With the change to deep reef mining during the 1880s came the need for extensive capital investment. Gympie was Queensland's second and then third biggest gold producer during the 1880s and 1890s (after Mt Morgan gold production overtook it in 1887). In this period gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland export income. Gympie's part in the production was reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks and mining secretaries' and brokers' offices. Several fires - in 1877, 1881 and 1891 - razed the earlier timber buildings and accelerated this transformation. A fire in August 1881 destroyed all of the buildings between Patterson's brick store and the Bank of New South Wales (242 Mary Street) on the south-western side of Mary Street, Gympie. This included the earlier building that had stood on the site of the present-day Tozer's Building (originally Allotment 10, Section A). Horace Tozer established a legal practice in Gympie in 1868 following his admission as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland on 7 December 1867. In 1871 he purchased, under the Goldfields Town Land Act 1869, the town lot on the north- eastern side of upper Mary Street on which he had built his business premises in the early days of the town. The Brisbane Courier reported in February 1881 that Gympie property had increased in value as a consequence of a very marked improvement in mining. Subsequently in August 1881 Horace Tozer sold his upper Mary Street property and moved to leased premises on the same side of upper Mary Street. In 1886, he went into partnership with Anthony Conwell (d 1897) as Tozer and Conwell, solicitors. In 1891 the premises leased by Tozer and Conwell were burnt down when the north-eastern side of Mary Street, between the Gympie Times office and the Mining Exchange Hotel was razed, and the partnership suffered a loss of ¬£5,000 in uninsured property. The solicitors moved temporarily into a building next to the Australian Joint Stock Bank (236 Mary Street) on the opposite side of upper Mary Street from January to March 1891. They then moved to offices next to Caston and Davidson, Mining Secretaries, (Crawford and Co Building, 216 Mary Street), possibly in a building that occupied the site of the current Tozer's Building (218 Mary Street). At the time, this property was owned by Charles Campion Bunworth, a Gympie businessman, who owned a number of Mary Street properties. The property had been mortgaged to Gympie MLA and community leader, William Smyth, for ¬£3,200 in February 1890. By April 1894 Bunworth was insolvent and the property passed to Robert Jones who sold it to Ellen Jane Smyth, the wife of William Smyth, in August 1894. In October 1895 tenders for contractors to erect offices and strongrooms in Mary Street, Gympie were invited by architect Richard Gailey with plans available for inspection at the offices of Tozer and Conwell, Gympie. Upon its completion, the building formed part of the gold era streetscape of upper Mary Street created in the 1880s and 1890s. Richard Gailey (1834-1924) was an architect from Derry, Ireland, who had settled in Brisbane in 1864. He established his own practice here in 1865, and over the next 60 years built up a thriving business, working until his death in 1924. He designed Baptist churches including the Baptist City Tabernacle in Brisbane, the former Baptist Church in Ipswich; commercial buildings such as banks including the Westpac Bank Building, Normanton (formerly the Bank of New South Wales); and many hotels including the Jubilee Hotel, Orient Hotell, Regatta Hotel, Wickham Hotel, all in Brisbane. Many commercial buildings in Brisbane designed by Gailey during the 1880s were characterised by classical idioms and details. He designed the Commercial Hotel and the Bank of New South Wales Building located in Mary Street, Gympie. Building owner Ellen Smyth was the second wife of self-made man, William Smyth, who rose from gold miner to mining speculator, making his fortune through investment in mine shares, particularly from the highly profitable Phoenix No 1 Mine. He became the largest mine owner on the Gympie field. Elected as an alderman for Borough of Gympie in 1883, Smyth was mayor of Gympie from 1883 to 1884 when he resigned after election as the Member for Gympie in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, in which he served from 7 September 1883 to 11 March 1899. He was a Director of the Royal Bank of Queensland, Gympie Gas Company and One Mile Sawmill. Smyth died in 1899. His widow was involved in a number of community organisations including the National Council of Women of Queensland (NCWQ), first as a delegate and later as Honorary Vice-President. Her lessee, Sir Horace Tozer, born on 23 April 1844 at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, was both solicitor and politician. Practising law in Gympie from 1868 and as a joint owner of mining leases, Tozer became an authority on mining law, was a member of the Gympie Mining Court and conducted two mining appeals before the Privy Council in London. He was elected as member for Wide Bay in 1871 but stood down a few months later for Henry Edward King to contest the seat in a by-election. He served as an alderman in the first Gympie Municipal Council from 1880. In 1888 Tozer again nominated for Wide Bay and won the seat, which he held until 5 March 1898. From 12 August 1890 until his retirement from parliament Tozer held ministerial offices. He served as Colonial Secretary and Secretary for Public Works until March 1893, Colonial Secretary from March 1893 to August 1896 and as Home Secretary from 1896 until 2 March 1898. From March to November 1897 he acted as Queensland Premier in the absence of Sir Hugh Nelson and in that year was appointed K.C.M.G. In London, Tozer acted as Queensland's Agent-General from 1898 to 1909 when he retired because of ill- health. During his public life he introduced significant legislation including the Public Service Act 1896, the Factories and Shops Act 1896 to regulate hours and conditions, the Election Act 1897 and the controversial Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897. In his ministerial capacity Tozer was responsible for establishing the Free Public Library in 1895 and the National Art Gallery of Queensland . He died on 20 August 1916. The solicitors firm established by Horace Tozer in 1868 was continued in Tozer's Building by his descendants for another 94 years, perpetuating his name, his connection with the site and his community involvement. Sir Horace Tozer's son, Vivian Hoyles Tozer, who had entered the firm, leased the building until he purchased the property in 1949 after the death of its owner, Ellen Jane Smyth. Vivian Tozer qualified as a solicitor in 1892, later was elected MLA, and served as a citizen soldier in the Queensland Defence Force. Following his death, Tozer's Building passed to descendants, Seymour Darvall Tozer and Horace Vivian Tozer in 1959, quickly passing to Horace Vivian Tozer solely in October 1959. In 1990 the property transferred to the firm of solicitors, Jeffery Cuddihy and Joyce, which currently occupies the building. Some changes have been made to the original building. The rear upper storey verandah has been altered, a fireplace on the rear, right-hand- side wall of the ground floor has been boarded up and wall partitions have been added to create office space at the rear of the original building on the ground floor. The interior staircase to the basement, which was accessed from behind the staircase to the upper floor, has been closed off from access from the ground floor. The original strongrooms on the ground floor and in the basement are extant. In 2009 the upper floor offices were unchanged as was the staircase leading to the first floor from the foyer. The original counter in the foyer is in place but the clerk's grill with writing slope has been removed, although it remains stored in the building. An extension has been added to the rear of the original building for offices on the ground floor, with a new opening through the rear wall of the 1896 building, and staff facilities in the basement area are accessed by a new staircase. The basement retains its strongrooms, fireplace, staircase and windows, including their security bars.  Description  Tozer's Building is a two storey building with basement built to the front and side alignments of a narrow allotment that extends between Mary and Reef Streets. The building is one of a group of Gympie gold- mining buildings dating from the late nineteenth century on the southern side of the upper slope of Mary Street in Gympie's central business district. It has load bearing masonry walls supporting a timber-framed roof and floors. Its roof, clad with corrugated metal sheeting, is concealed behind the parapet walls to the front and side alignments and its hipped end is visible from the rear. Tozer's Building has a detailed, symmetrically composed facade with smooth-rendered masonry featuring elements arranged in careful proportion typical of the Neoclassical style. Openings are arched and of equal widths and are visually separated by square pilasters set in low relief and string courses. Pilasters on the lower level have capitals decorated with flower motifs while pilasters of the upper floor have Corinthian style capitals. Arches are finished with moulded architraves and keystones. The parapet comprises decorative balustrading and a deep moulded cornice. The main entrance is located on the western side of the facade and is accessed from the street via two concrete steps with risers finished with tessellated tiles. A pair of painted timber paneled doors with an arched and glazed fanlight above provides access into a small entry vestibule which is lined with timber paneling to walls and ceilings and hardwood boards to the floor. The vestibule recesses into and provides access to the building's foyer space via another pair of timber paneled swing doors with two glazed and arched panels inset. A tall, arched window with double-hung sashes and a masonry sill is located to the east of the front entrance together with a basement window. Windows on the upper level are similar in design but are slightly shorter in height. On the rear elevation, the upper level has two tall timber framed double-hung sash windows positioned either side of a four paneled timber door which opens onto a verandah which has been modified. The verandah has a bullnosed roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting and a dowel balustrade. A concrete blockwork addition to the ground floor and basement level extends toward Reef Street and the rear elevation houses exit doors on the eastern side to both levels. The ground floor of the 1896 building contains three rooms: the foyer, a strongroom and a rear office. The foyer contains the original counter with robust detailing, part of which is stored in the basement and a grandfather clock on the southern wall. On the north-western wall, a half-turn stair provides access to the upper level. Paneling to the underside of the first flight houses an access door to a single flight of stairs leading to the basement. The stairs consist of closed risers and treads with turned balusters and newel posts, the basement stair is painted and the upper staircase is clear finished. The strongroom with heavy metal door is also located on the north- western wall adjacent to a fireplace to the rear office. Partial height timber framed partitions lined with plasterboard positioned parallel to the south-eastern wall, are later additions and separate the office and strongroom from a hall created to access the rear addition. On the first floor, two offices are separated by the upper flight of stairs. The front office which has a fireplace on its south-western wall has been divided into two offices and an entrance vestibule by timber framed partial height partitions lined with plasterboard. The rear office which has access to the rear verandah has a fireplace on its north-western wall and safes set into masonry in the northern corner. The basement of the 1896 building, has painted brickwork walls lined throughout with storage shelves. A strongroom is located beneath the ground floor strongroom adjacent to a fireplace. The ceilings are lined with tongue and groove boards and the floor is formed with concrete. The rear wall contains a central door and two full height windows with double hung sashes secured with metal grilles. Original internal walls on the upper two levels are finished with plaster lined to imitate stone ashlar while ceilings on all levels are lined with double beaded tongue and groove boards with timber cornices. Internal openings are generous in height and consist of timber- paneled doors with glazed pivoting fanlights above. Generous timber skirting boards, skirting blocks and architraves are located in many areas. The majority of the interior timber work and joinery is clear finished though the skirting in the rear office of the ground floor has been painted. Original door and window furniture survives and some light fittings including gas jets above the staircase and in the rear office on the first floor. The two storey rear concrete block extension is not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Tozer's Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Tozer's Building (1896) is important in demonstrating the evolution of gold mining at Gympie, a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for approximately 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production evolved from alluvial to shallow reef mining to deep reef mining from 1875, the changes were reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. As the offices of solicitor and politician Sir Horace Tozer, a leading authority on mining law during Queensland's gold era, the building is the product of Gympie's importance as the third largest goldfield in Queensland during the 1890s and illustrates the importance of gold mining in Queensland history. Its siting near Commissioners Hill in the vicinity of important government and gold-related buildings also illustrates the growth and evolution of Gympie's development. It forms part of the upper Mary Street gold era precinct. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Tozer's Building is a good example of commercial offices designed by Richard Gailey. The original 1896 structure is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Victorian-era commercial offices. It comprises a foyer, handsome cedar staircase to the first floor rooms, a ground floor office, strongroom and a basement with its own strongrooms. The interior contains fine finishes such as plaster walls, decorative plaster cornices, pine ceilings, and handsome original cedar joinery including counter, windows, fanlights, architraves, skirtings and substantial doors. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities expressed in the interior craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design which complement other surviving 19th century buildings in the street. Located on the south-western side of Mary Street, the former Tozer's Building forms part of the harmonious upper Mary Street gold era streetscape of late Victorian commercial buildings dating from the 1880s and 1890s. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Tozer's Building has a special association with the life and work of Sir Horace Tozer, solicitor, member of the Queensland parliament from 1890, Queensland minister from 1893 to 1898, and Queensland's Agent-General from 1898 to 1909. Resident in Gympie from the first year of the Gympie goldfield, Sir Horace Tozer became an authority on mining law, introduced significant legislation into Queensland parliament and held influential public offices during the course of his career, thereby helping to shape the future of the Colony, and later State, of Queensland and its people. Tozer's Building was built for [Sir] Horace Tozer and is still known by his name. The legal firm that he established in 1868 and his descendants continued was conducted from Tozer's Building for 94 years, perpetuating his name and connection with the site.

Saudi Arabia, spearheading a coalition of nine Arab states, began carrying out airstrikes in neighbouring Yemen and imposing an aerial and naval blockade on 26 March 2015, heralding a military intervention code-named Operation Decisive Storm (). More than 70 health facilities in Yemen have been destroyed by a series of airstrikes conducted by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition since March 2015. Many of these have been public health hospitals staffed or supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Critics of the assaults say the airstrikes are war crimes in violation of the protections of health care facilities afforded by the internationally recognized rules of war and have called for independent investigations. Many other civilians targets, including schools, and school buses in Yemen are also bombed by the Saudi-led coalition. 1,500 schools were damaged and destroyed during Yemeni Civil War. The UN accused the Saudi-led coalition of \\"complete disregard for human life\\".  Timeline  =October 2015 - Saada airstrike= Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian-led coalition airstrike on 26 October 2015 had completely destroyed the M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res hospital in Saada, in northwestern Yemen, including the operating room. The first strike hit an unused part of the hospital, so the facility was completely evacuated at once. There were no direct casualties. The spokesman for the coalition forces, Brig-Gen Ahmed al- Asiri, disclaimed responsibility for the attack. \\"With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care\\", MSF said. \\"This attack is another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine,\\" said Hassan Boucenine, MSF head of mission in Yemen. The GPS coordinates of the only hospital in the Haydan district were regularly shared with the Saudi-led coalition, and the roof of the facility was clearly identified with the MSF logo, he said.\\"MSF hospital in Yemen bombed by airstrike\\", Xinhua (2015-10-28) Abdallah al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, said the coordinates were inaccurate, although he admitted that the airstrike was \\"a mistake\\". The UNICEF said the hospital in Saada was the 39th health center hit in Yemen since March, when the violence escalated. MSF reports that the Saudi- led coalition, supported by the British military, has been bombing hospitals across Yemen for the past 10 months. As many as 130 health facilities have been hit. \\"More children in Yemen may well die from a lack of medicines and healthcare than from bullets and bombs,\\" its executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement. He added that critical shortages of fuel, medication, electricity and water could mean many more will close. Amnesty International said the strike may amount to a war crime and called for an independent investigation.Noah Browning, \\"Yemeni MSF hospital bombed, Saudi-led coalition denies responsibility\\", Reuters (October 27 2015)\\"Doctors Without Borders says Saudi-led airstrikes bomb Yemen hospital\\", Associated Press (October 28, 2015) =December 2015 - Taiz airstrike= On December 3, 2015 an airstrike by the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen hit a health center in Taiz, wounding nine people.

Six people died and another 7 were injured, including three MSF staff, two of them in critical condition. Several buildings at the medical facility collapsed after the attack,Mark Tran, \\"Four patients among dead after explosion at hospital in Yemen\\", The Guardian (January 10, 2016).Adam Withnall, \\"Attacks on hospitals mean people in Yemen are now too scared to go for treatment, MSF says\\", The Independent (January 19, 2016). although the critical areas of the hospital were not destroyed. The rocket hit a corridor leading from the main gate to the hospital buildings, with a metal fence alongside. The wounded were hit by shrapnel from the missile, and also by shards of metal from the fence. The injuries were brutal. Vickie Hawkins, Executive Director of MSF-UK, said, \\"... there is a risk that \\"errors\\" in war situations will become normalised‚Äîjust as \\"collateral damage\\" has been normalised in people's minds since the first Gulf War. This would provide the perfect alibi for armies to shrug off accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It perpetuates impunity. In a separate attack by the Saudi-led coalition, an airstrike was reported to have hit a center for the blind in the capital Sana'a, resulting in multiple injuries. =August 2016 - Abs district hospital airstrike= On August 15, 2016, after the collapse of a UN-sponsored cease-fire, an airstrike by the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen destroyed a hospital operated by Yemen's Ministry of Health and supported by MSF and UNICEF in Abs District, Hajjah Governorate in northwestern Yemen. The bombardment struck the hospital's triage area near the emergency room and killed at least 19 and wounded 24 people.Noah Browning and Tom Brown, \\"Airstrike Hits Doctors Without Borders Hospital in Yemen\\", Scientific American. On line, n.d. At the time of the attack, there were 23 patients in the surgery ward, 25 in the maternity ward, 13 newborns and 12 patients in the pediatric ward, MSF said. The hospital had a 14-bed emergency room, a maternity unit and a surgical unit. Hospital staff were among the dead and wounded. ‚ÄúThere were no armed people there,‚Äù a witness said. The hospital was reportedly treating child victims of another airstrike on a school in the town of Haydan, in neighboring Saada province, in which 10 children died and another 30 were wounded, all between the ages of 8 and 15 years. MSF has now withdrawn its staff members from Haydan, Razeh, Al Gamouri and Yasnim hospitals in Saada governorate and Abs and Al Gamouri hospitals in Hajjah governorate. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, condemned the attack in a statement, emphasizing that antagonists in the Yemen conflict had damaged or destroyed more than 70 health facilities since the hostilities began 17 months ago. =June 2018 - Airstrike on cholera treatment center in Abs= Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian coalition airstrike struck a new M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res cholera treatment center in Abs, in northwestern Yemen.

Youssef al-Hadrii, a spokesman for the Houthi-controlled health ministry, said most of the children killed in the bombing of houses and a school since the war beginning. There was no comment from the coalition. =6 November 2019 attack= According to aid group and Yemeni officials, 8 people including 3 civilians were killed by a Houthi drone and missile strike attack in Mocha that targeted a refugee camp and a hospital ran by Doctors without Borders, causing the hospital to shut down.

In ancient Greece, many were divided over what they believed to be the cause of the illness that a patient faced. Some believed it was the punishment of the gods while others believed it to be caused by a physical problem, this led to many variations of treatment ranging from prayer to surgery. It is only through centuries of understanding as well as modern technology that we are now able to diagnose and treat those afflicted properly.  Treatment  Treatment of mental illness in ancient Greece was a new and experimental process due to the lack of the modern-day tools and technology that allow doctors to identify these mental ailments. Some ancient physicians didn't understand what part of the body was responsible for the strange behavior and turned to prayer and forgiveness from the gods. However most physicians understood mental illness was often caused by physical ailments such as an imbalance of the humors. Hippocrates was a physician that believed that the brain was the center of thought, intelligence and emotion. Because of this he and many others came to the conclusion that mental disorders came from problems with the brain. As time went on and physicians began to better understand mental illness they began to treat patients in different ways. ‚ÄúThey were mostly (not entirely) concerned with psychoses (externalizing disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and drug and alcohol use disorders) rather than neuroses (internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety), and they took into account a full range of hard-to- define symptoms including inappropriate behavior in public, delusions, delirium, and hallucinations. Treatments also covered a whole range from physical restraint to counseling; they did not make much use of pharmaceuticals.‚Äù  Role of religion and superstitions  Treatment of mental illness in ancient times was often linked to religion. People who were stricken with madness were believed to be punished by the gods or possessed by demons. There are claims in the Old Testament of possession and madness cast upon people by god, these in reality may actually have been cases of mental illnesses that alter behavior such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dissociative identity disorder. To people who had never encountered these diseases it would have been difficult to diagnose and identify the disease in a logical way backed by hard evidence because there was likely no evidence to refer to. Due to this lack of evidence and logic, many treatments were designed to help clear the body of any spirits that may have taken over the patient‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúArchaeologists have unearthed skulls datable back to at least 5000 BCE which have been trephined or trepanned‚Äîsmall round holes have been bored in them with flint tools. The subject was probably thought to be possessed by devils which the holes would allow to escape.‚Äù  Mental illness in society  As in the modern age, there was a stigma attached to those who were suffering from mental illness. ‚ÄúThe ancient Greeks first gave voice to the concept of stigma noting that those who were marked with mental illness were often shunned, locked up, or on rare occasions put to death.‚Äù People with diseases that altered behavior were often shunned and feared by those around them. This had to do with the fear of that which was not understood. Many thought the gods were angry at the affected individual and that they would receive a similar fate through association. The afflicted were also confined so that they would not cause injury to themselves, others or damage to property. Plato once wrote ‚ÄúIf a man is mad, he shall not be at large in the city, but his family shall keep him in any way they can.‚Äù In ancient Greece it was up to the family of the ill to keep them in check as well as prevent them from disturbing the peace. Depending on the severity of the affliction, patients were either allowed to roam aimlessly through the city or forced to completely remain indoors.

Founded in 1946 by Francis C. Scott, the charity is based at the Brathay Hall and estate near the town of Ambleside. The organisation's main focus is on training and developing general skills for youth, including Lake District-based outdoor education and experiential learning, but also organises people and organisation development courses for adults. In 2007, the trust began holding the Brathay Windermere Marathon, a now annual charity marathon. History =Early years of the Trust= Image of Brathay Hall from the early days of Brathay Hall Trust. In 1939, Francis Scott of the Provincial Insurance Company in Kendal, purchased Brathay Hall estate, an 18th-century country house. Scott wanted to protect the area from housing and business development and to devote the residence to a charitable cause. The events of World War II caused Scott to postpone his plans, until eventually Brathay Hall Trust was founded in 1946. Scott saw a need for a leadership training and an activity centre, so offered Brathay Hall as a base for the National Association of Boys' Clubs. He began running \\"Holidays with Purpose\\", a one-week course of outdoor education and cultural activities, including the production of newspapers and staging drama productions. The courses targeted boys from low socio-economic backgrounds who lived in cities in the north of Britain. In 1947, the Brathay Exploration Group was founded as an offshoot of Brathay Trust by geographer Brian Ware. Boys taking part in Brathay Trust programmes who had shown promise were recommended for the course, along with schoolboys, which partnered with universities to conduct field studies. The group originated after a comment by geographer WV Lewis, who noted that many of the Lake District tarns had imperfect depth data collected on them. The group conducted glacier surveys in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia),Norway and Iceland, and ornithology surveys on Foula in the Shetland Islands, and has continued to lead data collection expeditions well into the 21st Century. Low Bank Ground, in Cumbria‚Äôs Duddon Valley, is managed by Brathay for Wigan Council. Due to the success of the single week courses, Brathay Trust launched an extended four-week course in 1950. Scott felt that the Brathay programmes needed to diversify more to succeed, so decided to finance many additions to the Brathay estate, including a boathouse, a theatre and extra dormitories. Brathay sought to distinguish itself from the outdoor oriented charity Outward Bound, by focusing on a much broader range of activities. These courses were created after consultation with northern British industrial firms, who supported the courses as a way to bring out latent talent with the facilitation of well-rounded development for the youth of Postwar Britain. The four-week course became the basis for Brathay activities until the mid-1960s. Beginning in 1955, Brathay partnered with the Oxfordshire Education Authority to offer extended courses to schoolchildren from Oxfordshire, which blended history and geography lessons with outdoor education. Brathay's youth courses were praised by Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther, the Chairman of the Central Advisory Council for Education, in his 1949 publication The Crowther Report, and similarly in the government produced Albemarle Report. In both reports, Brathay was praised for how their outdoor and physical activities had a strong youth appeal, motivating in a different way to conventional education. = Course diversification = Brathay Hall, HQ of Brathay Trust, photographed in 2014. In the mid-1960s, Brathay began to offer leadership and training and development programmes, targeted to adults from commercial companies, the government and other organisations. In 1963, the Francis C. Scott Charitable Trust was set up, with Scott's son Peter acting as the trust's chairman. The trust was a major source of funding for Brathay during its early years, though over time, Brathay became less reliant on the Scott family funds until the current position where the two trusts are entirely separate financially. In the early 1970s, the courses were further developed by Peter Prior of Bulmers and John Adair of the Industrial Society, who saw great opportunities of developing the youth courses into industry- based adult courses. Businesses such as the John Lewis Partnership developed annual staff development courses held at Brathay. In the late 1960s with the help of the Industrial Society, Brathay's four-week courses were refocused, to relate the activities to the participants' lives, and decision making in general. In 1967, Brathay opened the Field Study Centre, a one-week academic- focused programme for schools based at Brathay Hall, which continued to run until 1986. In the 1970s and 1980s, a variety of programmes were created in the wake of increased unemployment in the United Kingdom, targeting youth skills acquisition, and youth rehabilitation. The courses were developed alongside the Trident Trust, and focused on youth who had not completed secondary school. The trust became an Accredited Training Centre by the UK government, and in 1977 became a member of the Development Training Advisory Group, alongside Outward Bound, Endeavour Training and the YMCA. The group was a consortium that encouraged quality practices in outdoor education courses and youth training. Brathay's youth offender rehabilitation work continued on into the 1990s, where the trust worked alongside the Breakthrough Foundation. In January 2012, Brathay Trust acquired a contract to manage two Lake District outdoor centres owned by the Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council, Low Bank Ground, close to Coniston Water and Hinning House in the Duddon Valley. Both properties had been in danger of sale or closure, and Brathay Trust will continue to manage the properties until 2019. Brathay Hall Brathay Hall and grounds from Windermere. The Trust is based in Brathay Hall, a Georgian- style country house set on a 360-acre property close to the Ambleside village on the shores of the River Brathay. Brathay Hall is grade II listed and was built in the 18th century by George Law, the son of a lawyer who has a strong interest in the Backbarrow ironworks. After Law's death in 1802, his son Henry rented the property to John Harden, a gentleman and amateur Cumbrian artist who lived a life of leisure, entertaining guests such as poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Romantic painter John Constable. Jessy's Journal, an account of the diaries of Jessy Harden, the lady of the house at that time, offer an insight to day-to-day life at that time. In 1833, the property was sold to draper Giles Redmayne, whose family lived at the estate for almost a century. Architect Alfred Waterhouse in his early career was contracted to build Gate Lodge at Brathay Hall in 1857, and three years later became the mentor for Redmayne's fourth son, architect George Tunstal Redmayne. George Tunstal Redmayne's grandson Martin Redmayne was a politician who was created a life peer, becoming the first of the Redmayne baronets. While under the ownership of Redmayne, Thomas Arnold, headmaster of the Rugby School often holidayed at Brathay Hall with his family. The Redmayne family owned the estate until Francis Scott purchased the property in 1939. In addition to the hall, several other buildings exist on the estate, which are used for youth accommodation. One, Old Brathay, was rented out to a member of the Lloyd family of Lloyds Bank, while the property was possessed by George Law. Brathay Trust administers several other locations, including the Bradford Youth Centre in West Yorkshire and several Lake District residences, on behalf of the Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council. Community activities Young people on a Brathay residential programme taking part in a Ghyll Scramble. In 1993 Brathay began collaborating with the Police and Youth Encouragement Scheme, an outreach programme pairing Merseyside youth with police officers. Courses typically last five days, and focus on building motivational skills. In 2011, the Francis C Scott Charitable Trust partnered with the University of Cumbria to begin holding the Aspiring Leaders Programme at Brathay Hall, an annual leadership event for youth from Cumbria and North Lancashire. In 2003, Brathay secured funding from Central Government through a Youth Sector Development Fund to extend their activities through community hubs. The Trust has subsequently developed projects that run out of Youth Centres in Bradford, Sheffield, Wigan and in urban areas of Cumbria. The start of the 2015 Brathay Windermere Marathon. In 2007, Brathay became the location for courses set up by charity Future for Heroes (originally called Remount), which helps the rehabilitation for returned servicemen of the British Armed Services. In 2015, a team from Future for Heroes entered the Brathay Windermere Marathon, raising ¬£1,000 for the charity. Brathay Hall is the location for the annual Lake District Summer Music festival, as well as a two-week music summer school run by the festival. =Marathon= In 2007, Brathay Trust began to organise two marathon-related events, the Brathay 10in10 and the Brathay Windermere Marathon. The Brathay 10in10 is an endurance running event featuring ten marathons organised over a ten-day period, with the final one coinciding with the Brathay Windermere Marathon, an open event, which was first run as the Windermere Marathon in 1982.

It was the second amphibious assault on South Sakhalin, after the (now Shakhtyorsk) on August 16. Assault Japanese forces in the port and the city had two battalions of infantry, artillery and mortar units, and coast guard. All of them were subordinate to the commander of the 88th Infantry Division of the Fifth Area Army. After a Soviet submarine and aviation reconnaissance on August 17, on August 19 an amphibious force of the 113th Rifle Brigade and a battalion of marines of total force of 3,400 moved out from Sovetskaya Gavan and landed at Maoka early morning on August 20. Due to heavy fog there was no aviation support, and instead the city was subject to heavy artillery bombardment from ships. Due to initial surprise the coastal facilities were quickly occupied, but later the Soviet troops, according to the Soviet sources, were met with fierce Japanese resistance.Chapter 13, \\"–û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Æ–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–∞—Ö–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞\\" in: –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –°. –ï., –ë–∞–≥—Ä–æ–≤ –í. –ù., –ë–µ–≤–∑ –°. –°., –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–æ–≤ –ú. –ù., –ö–æ—Ç—É—Ö–æ–≤ –ú. –ü. \\"–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –¢–∏—Ö–æ–æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç\\", Moscow, Voenizdat, 1973 However the Japanese side states that their military tried to avoid engagement keeping defensive positions, busy with evacuation of equipment (described as \\"looting the city\\" in some Soviet sources ) and guiding the evacuation of about 18,000 civilians.

WKPW is owned by New Castle Career Center and operated by students at Knightstown High School. History WKPW was originally operated by Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home in Knightstown. Instructor/Program Director Mike York, who had worked in the Indianapolis radio market for many years at WIBC, WNAP and WENS, designed the studios. The students, under York's supervision, assisted with building and outfitting of the broadcast facility. The project was under the direction of ISSCH Superintendent Robert Molnar, Assistant Superintendent John Wittkamper and Eder Career Center Director Paul Wilkinson. The project was completed after nearly two years and on September 23, 1993 WKPW began broadcasting a radiated power of 250 watts on a 100-foot (30.48 m) tower. Early programming consisted of Country Music, Top 40 and Oldies during the school week. The original license was only valid during the school day and the transmitter would be turned off at 3 pm each day. On January 10, 1994, WKPW began broadcasting 24 hrs a day with the help of a TM Century Ultimate Digital CD Automation System and Engineer Dan Parrish. At the beginning of 1994 WKPW submitted an application to the FCC for a power increase to 4,400 watts and a tower height increase to 180-foot (54.86 m) as well the ability to broadcast 24 hours a day. On July 14 of that year, the application was approved by the FCC and WKPW began all-day broadcasting. June 2001 saw the implementation of a Broadcast Electronics Audio Vault 100 Digital Automation System. In the summer of July 2005 the automation system was upgraded again to the Audio Vault 2 system. In January 2009, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels decided to close the ISSCH and turn it over to the Indiana National Guard Youth Challenge Academy. Veterans, veteran organizations, parents, teachers, students along with the public, protested at the Indiana State House while submitting thousands of signatures on petitions to stop the closing of the facility. The governor's decision was final and WKPW and the Broadcasting Program along with the other career and technical programs were in jeopardy of going away permanently. The New Castle Career Center stepped in and made the decision that all programs would be moved to the career center in New Castle, Indiana with the exception of WKPW and the Broadcasting Program. Knightstown High School and the Charles A. Beard School Board proposed that the program and radio station be moved to that school. In 2009, plans were being finalized to move the radio station to the high school. A seldom used area known as the Stage Craft room was chosen to be the home of the new studios. The studio floor plans were designed and approved. In January 2010, the students in the Broadcasting Program, along with York, began the renovation process. Countless hours, days and weekends were spent on the construction, decorating and implementation of equipment. During the construction process, the station's FCC license was transferred from ISSCH to the New Castle Career Center. Upon completion of the facilities, the final pieces of equipment were installed on May 24‚Äì25, 2011 under the direction of Chief Engineer Robert Hawkins and studio engineer Chuck Hurley. On May 26, 2011, broadcasting began from the showcase studios at Knightstown High School. 2016 provided the opportunity to build two new production rooms, taking almost a year to complete. Programming WKPW is a student noncommercial radio station playing Classic Hits from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and mid-1990s. Students are live daily Monday thru Friday 8 am ‚Äì 2 pm.

It was named for Apache chieftain Cuchillo Negro, who was killed in 1857. The town is located on the north bank of Cuchillo Negro Creek. Cuchillo's name change came after the 1900 Census. It was recorded under its present name in the 1910 Census. Wilson, John P., Between the River and the Mountains: A History of Early Settlement in Sierra County, New Mexico, Report #40, John P. Wilson, Las Cruces, New Mexico, August 1985 History The town was thought to have been founded by at least 1871. That place had not appeared in the 1870 Census. However, areas along Cuchillo Negro Creek between there and the Rio Grande had been farmed for some time before 1869, according to the local Indian Agent's report of his tour of the area in that year. They had been planted by people from Alamocita, to the west on the Rio Grande in late 1867. Alamocita was founded by former residents of Alamosa abandoned after it was destroyed by a flood in 1867. The agent believed they were planting crops of corn for supplying the Southern Apache being rationed at Canada Alamosa and in anticipation of a reservation being formed in that vicinity. Some of these farmers were living in the area until on January 10, 1872, The Borderer, of Las Cruces, published a letter from a newspaper publisher writing from Alem√°n Ranch that settlers on the Cuchillo Negro were all coming in for fear of an Indian outbreak. On September 19 of that year Gen. O. O. Howard wrote from a New Mexican hamlet he called Cuchillo, that he had bought 30 days rations at a general store there for the Apache band of Ponce, in return for his help in finding and getting Cochise to meet with Howard to make peace. The town first appears as the Plaza Cuchillo Negro on a 1875 Diagram of Southern Apache Indian Reservation. This probably indicated that the houses of the residents had been built in a typical fashion for New Mexico frontier settlements. They were often located around a central plaza forming a defensive wall around it on the outside, as protection from the raids of hostile Apache or Navajo. The town of Cuchillo Negro first appears on the Census of June 1880. It found the town had 233 occupants in 51 houses. All but three if the population were native born New Mexicans. Fifty five heads of families were farmers, thirty were laborers, two were freighters, one a tailor and one a miner. In 1881, the creek at the town and below was described as being a fine stream of excellent water, and the land was all susceptible to irrigation by the stream. A post office began in operation at Cuchillo Negro from 1883 and has continued to the present day.The Origins of Sierra County:Political and Economic Roots by James B. Sullivan, pp,6-13, SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO HISTORICAL REVIEW, Do√±a Ana County Historical Society, Volume IX, No.1, Las Cruces, New Mexico January 2002 By 1895 the town was reported as having developed a community ditch irrigation system which was described, as originating at a diversion dam eight miles upstream, that irrigated 300 acres at the town, and 200 acres farther upstream from private ditches. In 1928 the community ditch irrigated 450 acres and there were other diversion dams and private ditches up stream as far as Chise and beyond. Three private ditches below the town, diverted any flood waters to irrigate hay fields and pasture. In 1940 only 400 acres were irrigated at the town by the ditch.

The changed trajectory is its own cause, without an origin. A causal loop is a theoretical proposition in which, by means of either retrocausality or time travel, a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people) is among the causes of another event, which is in turn among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine before its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path. In this sequence of events, the change in the ball's path is its own cause, which might appear paradoxical. Terminology in physics, philosophy, and fiction Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to \\"come from nowhere.\\" The notion of objects or information that are \\"self-existing\\" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical, with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a bootstrap paradox, \\"A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing.\\" an information paradox, or an ontological paradox. The use of \\"bootstrap\\" in this context refers to the expression \\"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps\\" and to Robert A. Heinlein's time travel story \\"By His Bootstraps\\". The term \\"time loop\\" is sometimes referred to as a causal loop, but although they appear similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting. An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Allan Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin. A similar example is given in the television series Doctor Who of a hypothetical time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name. Everett gives the movie Somewhere in Time as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him. Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes ‚Äì information or an object looping through time ‚Äì are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws. He does not find this paradoxical, and attributes problems regarding the validity of time travel to other factors in the interpretation of general relativity. A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and Igor Novikov labeled such items without origin as Jinn, with the singular term Jinnee. This terminology was inspired by the Jinn of the Quran, which are described as leaving no trace when they disappear. Lossev and Novikov allowed the term \\"Jinn\\" to cover both objects and information with reflexive origin; they called the former \\"Jinn of the first kind\\", and the latter \\"Jinn of the second kind\\". They point out that an object making circular passage through time must be identical whenever it is brought back to the past, otherwise it would create an inconsistency; the second law of thermodynamics seems to require that the object become more disordered over the course of its history, and such objects that are identical in repeating points in their history seem to contradict this, but Lossev and Novikov argued that since the second law only requires disorder to increase in closed systems, a Jinnee could interact with its environment in such a way as to regain lost order. They emphasize that there is no \\"strict difference\\" between Jinn of the first and second kind. Krasnikov equivocates between \\"Jinn\\", \\"self-sufficient loops\\", and \\"self-existing objects\\", calling them \\"lions\\" or \\"looping or intruding objects\\", and asserts that they are no less physical than conventional objects, \\"which, after all, also could appear only from either infinity, or a singularity.\\" The term predestination paradox is used in the Star Trek franchise to mean \\"a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past.\\" This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine titled \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\", although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as Calvinism and some forms of Marxism that encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined. Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term \\"predestination paradox\\" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event. Self-fulfilling prophecy A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other \\"infallible foreknowledge\\" mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb's paradox. A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in the classical play Oedipus Rex, in which Oedipus becomes the king of Thebes and in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling. 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 37‚Äì49 The movie 12 Monkeys heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past. Novikov self-consistency principle General relativity permits some exact solutions that allow for time travel. Some of these exact solutions describe universes that contain closed timelike curves, or world lines that lead back to the same point in spacetime. Physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov discussed the possibility of closed timelike curves in his books in 1975 and 1983, offering the opinion that only self-consistent trips back in time would be permitted.Novikov, Igor (1983). Evolution of the Universe, p. 169: \\"The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'‚Äîthey all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self- consistent way.\\" In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, \\"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\\", the authors suggested the principle of self-consistency, which states that the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent. The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past. Physicist Joseph Polchinski argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a billiard ball sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a wormhole at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as \\"Polchinski's paradox\\". Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self- consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and Robert Forward showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions. Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find any initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven. The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known. Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel. Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity. Quantum computation with negative delay Physicist David Deutsch shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay--backwards time travel--could solve NP problems in polynomial time, and Scott Aaronson later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve PSPACE problems in polynomial time. Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning. Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons. However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC (closed timelike curve, or a causal loop) fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic quantum field theory on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of general relativity.

It was first discussed by Jan Narveson in 1967, and Jeff McMahan coined the term 'the Asymmetry' in 1981.: \\"The Asymmetry was first discussed by Jan Narveson in 'Utilitarianism and New Generations', Mind 76 (1967), pp. 62‚Äì72. The label is due to Jeff McMahan, 'Problems of Population Theory', Ethics, 92 (1981), pp. 96-127.\\" McMahan formulates the Asymmetry as follows: \\"while the fact that a person's life would be worse than no life at all ... constitutes a strong moral reason for not bringing him into existence, the fact that a person's life would be worth living provides no (or only a relatively weak) moral reason for bringing him into existence.\\": \\"Consider the view that, while the fact that a person's life would be worse than no life at all (or 'worth not living') constitutes a strong moral reason for not bringing him into existence, the fact that a person's life would be worth living provides no (or only a relatively weak) moral reason for bringing him into existence. This view, which I shall refer to as 'the Asymmetry,' is approved both by Narveson and by common sense.\\" Professor Nils Holtug formulates the Asymmetry evaluatively in terms of the value of outcomes instead of in terms of moral reasons. Holtug's formulation says that \\"while it detracts from the value of an outcome to add individuals whose lives are of overall negative value, it does not increase the value of an outcome to add individuals whose lives are of overall positive value.\\" Much of the literature on the ethics of procreation deals with the Asymmetry.: \\"Much of the literature on the morality of procreation revolves around the issue whether there is a difference between the duty to bring a happy child into the world and the duty to avoid conceiving a miserable child.\\" A number of authors have defended the Asymmetry,For example, , , , , , , , , and . and a number of authors have argued against it.For example, , , , , , and John Broome (according to ). Many who defend the asymmetry appeal to its intuitiveness. However, more elaborated defences of the asymmetry have been yielded. For instance, Jan Narveson argues that: > If we cause a miserable child to come into existence, there will exist a > child who will have a justified complaint, while if we refrain from causing > a happy child to come into existence, this child will not exist and so can > have no complaint. Against Narverson's argument, Timothy Sprigge has claimed that if we give a miserable child a genuine reason to complain by bringing her into existence we also give a happy child a genuine reason to be grateful. Professor Sprigge's argument highlights that Narveson's claim does not explain why the future of the miserable child is special but the future of the happy child is not special in the same way. Parfit solves this issue by holding these views: > (1) appeal to the Person-affecting Restriction, (2) claim that causing > someone to exist can be either good or bad for him, and (3) appeal to the > Narrow Principle. According to the Narrow Principle, it is wrong, if other > things are equal, to do what would be either bad for, or worse for, the > people who ever live. It is therefore wrong to have the Wretched Child, > since this would be bad for him. But it is in no way wrong to fail to have > the Happy Child. The Narrow principle justifies Narveson's defence of the asymmetry. However, this has been contested. For instance, Nils Holtug holds that the asymmetry is incompatible with a person-affecting solution to the nonidentity problem and, in addition, it is counterintuitive in another case. Suppose that in the future the last inhabitants of the earth can populate the world again or refrain from procreating and thus bring an end to the human race. Whatever they do, these already existing individuals will be equally happy. Even if they could bring billions of happy individuals into existence, there would surely be a few of them whose existence would be miserable and, hence, given the asymmetry they should bring about the end of the human race since the happiness of those possible billions of individuals counts for nothing compared to the suffering of those who would have miserable lives. To avoid this radical separation between happiness and suffering, Holtug appeals instead to the Weak Asymmetry: > Everything else being equal, it is better to avoid that a person comes into > existence and has a life worth not living (at level ‚Äìn), than to ensure that > a person comes into existence and has a life worth living (at level n). This allows to give extra weight to the badness of bringing miserable lives into existence but also allows to outweight small quantities by much larger ones when comparing suffering and happiness.

The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Brands, manufacturers and prototypes =Historical= The now defunct Australian company Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. designed the first known French fry vending machine, named Mr. French Fry. The company registered the design with the Australian government in January 1982. The machine cooked hot chips within 60 seconds, and operated using three AUD $0.20 coins. A salt packet was included underneath the cup that the chips were served in. Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., developed a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, which was used in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off in the event of a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it. =Contemporary= Beyondte Technology, based in Shenzhen Province, China, began development of the Robo French fry machine in 2008, which delivers hot French fries in around 95 seconds. Beyondte Technology was acquired by Breaktime Solutions in Belgium. The machine was developed by Belgian entrepreneurs, and field tested in Brussels, Belgium during the summer of 2012. The machine weighs , and can cook French fries in beef fat or cooking oil. The machine requires manual servicing and cleaning after around 150 orders are prepared. Later developments included installation of a ventilation system that uses three filters to reduce odors emitting from the machine. The New York Post has referred to the Robo French fry machine as the \\"Rolls Royce of vending machines.\\" In August 2013, an order of French fries from the machine was priced at USD $3.50. E-Vend Technology, a Russian company, manufactures a French fry vending machine in China and Israel using technology from the United States. The machine uses frozen French fries, and prepares them in around 45 seconds using hot air, rather than cooking oil. Fotolook, s.r.o., based in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, Slovakia markets a French fry vending machine. After ten years of development, in January 2015 the Hot Chips Company in Perth, Australia released a hot chips vending machine that uses rice bran oil. The company stated plans to produce and market more machines sometime in 2015, and has developed four prototypes that were tested in Adelaide and Perth. The prototypes also supply condiments, including one named \\"chicken salt,\\" which is chicken-flavored salt popular in Australia. In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, students and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes from start to finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at , and it cooks them in oil at . The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box. From 2017 Integra d.o.o., a Croatian company, manufactures a more sophisticated and technology advanced French Fry vending machine codenamed Saratoga. Machine dispenses deep fried french fries in 35 seconds, dispenses sauce, salt and a wooden fork. It features an advanced air filtration system, oil filtering system, easy to clean interior, touch screen and has a proprietary televending system (iVend) from which machines can be monitored, report sales and machine status, and the operator can change prices and machine settings remotely.

His music career started in the 1990s when he stumbled upon a recording studio while attending college in Louisville, Kentucky. Hay is most known for his work with \\"Pon de Replay\\", the debut single from Rihanna. Hay has produced six albums and a single that topped the Billboard Charts in multiple genres including Hip-Hop and Jazz. Hay's jazz album, a re-imagination of Follow the Leader by Eric B. & Rakim ended Michael Bubl√©'s 38 week reign at the top of the Billboard Charts. Publicist career Starting out in the music business as a publicist, Jonathan Hay worked with established recording artists and record labels alike. His first professional project was with Quo, the short lived hip-hip duo that was signed to Michael Jackson's MJJ Productions. Hay's first success was achieved with Days of the New, the multi- platinum rock band who had four hit singles. In 2003, Travis Meeks, the lead singer of the group slammed the publicist for making unauthorized and premature disclosures, which the musician felt \\"actually damaged his chances\\" to advance his career. Hay worked for Whitney Houston through her father's John Houston Entertainment company. In 2005, Hay tried to promote Rihanna's debut single by \\"fabricat[ing] stories of Rihanna and Jay Z, leaking false rumors to tabloids, working with Internet message boards, etc.\\" Hay worked as a publicist for Suge Knight's Death Row Records and announced its catalog was being sold to Hasbro. In 2012, Hay was part of a guardianship case involving teen actress Ariel Winter, a star on the TV series Modern Family, and her mother, Chrisoula \\"Crystal\\" Workman. Hay testified and signed a declaration for Ariel Winter in favor of her staying with her sister Shanelle Workman Gray. On October 23, 2015, Hay appeared on Inside Edition and publicly apologized to Beyonc√© for his story in the unauthorized biography Becoming Beyonc√©. Hay is in the book for his publicity stunt in 2005 for spreading rumors that Jay Z was dating Rihanna to boost the then 17-year-old's \\"Pon De Replay\\". Hay confessed that he started those rumors during a difficult time. \\"The PR stunt that I did was out of desperation to help break 'Pon de Replay,'\\" Hay said. \\"It was reckless and I didn't think it was going to work. I was just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what would stick.\\" Neither Rihanna or Jay Z was aware of his machinations Hay told Newsday. As he noted during an interview with HipHopDX: In December, Hay was in both Vogue and Vanity Fair for a recording project in Florida. Hay spoke out in Rolling Stone magazine [March 24, 2016 (Issue 1257)] to publicly support Kesha during her sexual assault lawsuit against Dr. Luke. The magazine called Hay a \\"crisis management expert\\". Hay told The Sun that his frequent collaborator Cyhi The Prynce wrote the lyrics to \\"Famous\\", the song that caused the public battle between Taylor Swift, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. According to Hollywood Life, a source close to West said, \\"Cyhi is a creative contributor on the song, in which he has been credited accordingly. However, the specific Taylor lyrics were written by Kanye himself.\\" Hay had involvement with the Drake and Sophie Brussaux pregnancy scandal. He told People Magazine \\"I've seen the text messages and they do exist\\" in reference to conversations purportedly from Drake, urging Brussaux to undergo an abortion. Hay has spoken out about this situation with Perez Hilton, Glamour Magazine (in the Netherlands), Hollywood Life and Public Magazine (in France). Hay spoke about the Kathy Griffin and Donald Trump photo scandal to The Huffington Post calling her press conference \\"flat-out gross\\". He explained, \\"From a PR perspective, she did do the right thing, by apologizing ‚Ä¶ but still that isn't enough. Not even close.\\" From the viewpoint of a crisis publicist, Hay was quoted in The New York Times about XXXTentacion's posthumous album release Skin. After being a publicist for over two decades, Hay started producing music full-time. Music production career Jonathan Hay first notable collaboration was with Prince and Audio Stepchild on \\"When Will We Be Paid\\", a cover song originally performed by The Staple Singers. The song was released through Prince's independent label NPG Records in April 2001 as part of a four-song extended play that peaked at No. 59 on the US Charts. Hip-Hop and Rap Releases (2013-2018): Hay co-founded SMH Records with Mike Smith a Charlotte, North Carolina based record label.

It belongs to the Bangalore Division. It is located 50 km from the district headquarters Tumkur (via TCB Highway Road). Bangalore is the nearest Metropolitan Area to Hagalavadi which is located 120 km from Hagalavadi (to the Southeast). Etymology The modern name \\"Hagalavadi\\" came from \\"Agalavaadi (‡≤Ö‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤°‡≤ø)\\", where \\"Agala (‡≤Ö‡≤ó‡≤≤)\\" means \\"wide\\" and \\"vaadi (‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤°‡≤ø)\\" means \\"village\\" or \\"groups of people\\". History The founder of this dynasty was Erimada Nayaka. He was succeeded by Sali Nayaka (1508-1544), who expanded the territory considerably. Inscription Ck 38, dated 1696, relates to these two leaders. Hagalavadi is the headquarters of Palegar lineage. Chikkanayakanahalli was founded by Erimada Nayaka and named after his brother as Chikkanayaka(younger brother) =Hagalavadi dynasty chiefs= \\"The Hagalavadi chiefs ruled for about 300 years, from 1478 to 1776. Sali Nayaka, who captured Kandikere and Settikere, assisted the Penukonda army, on condition that his conquests be confirmed. When that army was defeated, he escaped to his capital with as much plunder as he could secure. Chiknayakanahalli was founded and named after his brother, and Honnavalli, Turuvekere and Nonavinakere were added to his possessions. On the completion of these enterprises he is said to have taken the name of Sali Nayaka from the idea that his conquests extended in a ‚ÄòSalu‚Äô or lineage. His grandson, Mudiyappa Nayaka I, extended their territory. Mudiyappa Nayaka II, who was the ninth in the line, was hailed as a Rajarishi for his benign rule; later he gave up the throne and engaged in spiritual pursuits. His son, Mudduveerappa Nayaka (1740-1753), successfully resisted the onslaughts of Salabat Jung and Dilwar Khan and was called ‚ÄòJung Bahadur‚Äô. Channabasappa Nayaka, the twelfth ruler, was imprisoned by Haidar Ali at Srirangapattana. The Nayaka died in prison and the territory was annexed by Ali. According to M. S. Puttanna (‚ÄòHagalavadi Palayagararu‚Äô 1931), Hagalavadi State had once covered more than three ‚Äì fourths of the present district of Tumkur. Many religious monasteries were built there during the 15th to 17th centuries; including the extant Mudduveeraswamy and Muddiyappa Nayakas. Hagalavadi has the longest history on TCB Road. The chiefs of this dynasty built many forts, temples and monasteries, many extant.\\" Development Hagalavadi's commercial development continues. The town depends on Tumkur City economically. As of 2017, this town is developing as a commercial hub. Notably road connections, infrastructure and water facilities are fundamental problems. Transport =Bengaluru- Haagalavaadi-Dasoodi express route= Bengaluru-Haagalavaadi-Dassodi route as one of the best route according to KSRTC and the local people. The main hurdle for this popular route is the worst road stretch between Shivarampura(Haagalavaadi Hobli Border) and Bukkapattana(08 Kilometers). This road stretch is completely ignored by CN Halli constituency MLA continuously. The road is full of pits and potholes. Even having this road difficulty, KSRTC is operating a few expresses from Bengaluru to Dasoodi. This route is bringing sufficient financial collection to the corporation. The KSRTC is ready to operate plenty of buses but the road stretch between Shivarampura(Haagalavaadi Hobli Border)-Bukkapatna prevent them. Three main roads reach Hosadurga via Hagalavadi: * Bangalore-Hagalavadi-Bukkapatna-Huliyar-Hosadurga. * Bangalore- Hagalavadi-Galigekere-Chikkanayakanahalli-Huliyar-Hosadurga. * Bangalore- Hagalavadi-Galigekere-Thimmanahalli-Huliyar-Hosadurga. =Bangalore- Hagalavadi-Bukkapatna-Hosadurga Main Highway= Primary destinations: *Kempegowda Bus Station (Majestic). *Nelamangala. *Dobbaspet. *Tumkur. *TCB Circle (Bheemasandra). *Bellavi. *Chelur (Gubbi Taluk). *Hosakere. *Haagalavaadi Cross. *Haagalavaadi-Shivapura Twin Towns. *Madenahalli *Sira Cross(Ramalingapura) *Bukkapatna. *Hoysalakatte (Hoisalakatte). *Huliyar. *Yalanadu. *Srirampura. *Hagalakere Handpost (Belagur and Maththod Road junction). *Hosadurga. *Holalkere. *Chikkajajur. *Sasalu. *Annagodu. *Davanagere. =Bangalore-Hagalavadi-Kathrikehal-Chikkanayakanahalli-Hosadurga main road= Primary destinations: *Kempegowda Bus Station (Majestic). *Nelamangala. *Dobbaspet. *Tumkur. *TCB Circle (Bheemasandra). *Bellavi. *Chelur (Gubbi Taluk). *Hosakere. *Haagalavaadi Cross. *Haagalavaadi-Shivapura Twin Towns. *Junjappanahatti(Junjappa Temple, Hagalavadi Town). *Madalapura. *Galigekere. *Singadahalli lake. *Madanamadu. *Kathrikehal. *Janehar. *Suttu Kanive(Zig-Zag Road). *Chikkanayakanahalli. *Huliyar. *Yalanadu. *Srirampura. *Hagalakere Handpost (Belagur and Maththod Road junction). *Hosadurga. *Holalkere. *Chikkajajur. *Sasalu. *Annagodu. *Davanagere. =Bangalore- Hagalavadi-Thimmanahalli-Huliyar-Hosadurga main road= Primary Destinations: *Kempegowda Bus Station (Majestic). *Nelamangala. *Dobbaspet. *Tumkur. *TCB Circle (Bheemasandra). *Bellavi. *Chelur (Gubbi Taluk). *Hosakere. *Haagalavaadi Cross. *Haagalavaadi-Shivapura Twin Towns. *Junjappanahatti(Junjappa Temple, Haagalavaadi Town). *Madalapura. *Galigekere. *Singadahalli lake. *Madanamadu. *Hagalavadi-Chikkanayakanahalli Road. *Hanumanthanahalli. *Ramanahalli. *Siddanakatte. *Thimmanahalli. *CN Halli-Kandikere-Bellara Road Junction(Kanive cross) *Balenahalli Gate. *Agrahara. *Handiganadu. *Barakanahal. *Huliyar. *Srirampura. *Yalanadu. *Hagalakere Handpost (Belagur and Maththod Road junction). *Hosadurga. *Holalkere. *Chikkajajur. *Sasalu. *Annagodu. *Davanagere. =TCB highway/road= The TCB highway (also known as the Tumkur‚ÄìHagalavadi highway or ‡≤§‡≥Å‡≤Æ‡≤ï‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å-‡≤π‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤°‡≤ø ‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤¶‡≥ç‡≤¶‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤ø) is a district highway in Tumakuru, Karnataka.

The length of the highway is 62 km from Bukkapatna to Bheemasandra (TCB Circle (‡≤ü‡≤ø.‡≤∏‡≤ø.‡≤¨‡≤ø ‡≤µ‡≥É‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤§-‡≤≠‡≥Ä‡≤Æ‡≤∏‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≥ç‡≤∞) or the junction of NH 206) and 66 km from Bukkapatna to Tumkur Town Hall Circle or Tumkur City Bus stops (KSRTC and Private.) The Paleyagars and Nayakas (Hagalavadi Chiefs) constructed this road to connect with different kingdoms. The Paleyagars and Nayakas (chiefs) expanded Hagalavadi's dynasty's territory as wide as the region up to Tumakuru, Sira, Chikkanayakanahalli, Turuvekere, Settikere, Nonavinakere and Nittur. They were all connected to the Chitradurga Nayakas, through this road when it was still made of mud. =The road stretch of TCB highway/road= The TCB highway/road, is part highway and part narrower road.

Haagalavaadi Cross Haagalavaadi Cross is an important junction of four roads near Haagalavaadi-Shivapura twin towns, in which four main roads(Tumkur- Haagalavaadi Highway, Haagalavaadi-Chikkanayakanahalli Road and Haagalavaadi- Nittur Road(via Appannanahalli) intersect. The Cross is located in just 4 kilometers away from Haagalavaadi-Shivapura twin towns. This intersection of four roads in Haagalavaadi-Shivapura is popularly known as Haagalavaadi Cross. Haagalavaadi Circle There are three main circles in Haagalavaadi-Shivapura twin towns. 1) Bukkapatna Gate Circle or State Bank Circle. 2) Haagalavaadi main circle. 3) Shivapura Circle. Haagalavaadi main circle or Haagalavaadi bus stand circle is an intersection of six roads, such as; 1) Bengaluru Road/Tumkur Road. 2)Bukkapatna/Sira/Hiriyur/Dasoodi/Huliyar/Hosadurga/Davanagere Road. 3) Chikkanayakanahalli/Tiptur/Hassan Road. 4) Mattikere Road. 5) Haagalavaadi Town Road or Rudreshwara Temple Road. 6) Kariyamma Temple Road. Several problems with the circle are the following: 1) Shops, Grocery stores and Chicken processing centres are established very near to the circle in resulting to make circle narrow. 2) The complete ignorance of Chikkanayakanahalli/Tiptur Road. This worst road is even more worst within the town limit. There is no tar at all from last 20 years. The road from the circle to Singadahalli lake is completely ignored by Gubbi MLAs and officials. However, the circle is an important cummercial hub and the main centre of the town. It is also one of the four important circles on TCB Road. the other three circles are Chelur Circle, Bellavi Circle, and Bukkapatna Circle. Shivapura Circle As a part of Haagalavaadi-Shivapura Twin town, a junction or intersection of four Roads(Tumkur-Haagalavaadi Highway and Chikkanayakanahalli-Yakkalakatte Road) in Shivapura urban area. The circle needs High Mast Light in the center, but Gubbi politicians are highly ignorance to install the High Mast Lamp at the center of Shivapura Circle. Proposed project of direct corridor between Bengaluru-Huliyar via Ajjappa Temple and Gantenahalli Lake There is a mud path/road exist currently between Haagalavaadi-Huliyar in the southern bottom of Soojikallu Gudda(Hill). This proposed direct corridor via Ajjappa Temple and Gantenahalli lake or Gantenahalli Butappa temple needs to build a road to connect Bengaluru from Huliyar directly. The current distance to Bengaluru from Huliyar is 170 KM from all the existing routes(Huliyar-Sira-Bengaluru or Huliyar- KB Cross- Bengaluru or Huliyar-Bukkapatna-Haaglavaadi-Bengaluru or Huliyar-KB Cross- Turuvekere-Yediyur-Bengaluru). But this proposed route from Huliyar (via Thimmanahalli, Gantenahalli Lake, Haagalavaadi, Chelur, Tumkuru) to Bengaluru will reduce travelling distance upto 20 Kilometres between Huliyar and Bengaluru/Tumkuru. Hence State Government and Karnataka PWD Department pick up this project and allocate funds in budget to construct Bengaluru-Huliyar direct corridor. Hagalavadi Kariyamma Temple The town's centre of attraction is the Kariyamma Temple and Devi. It is known particularly for the Goddess' beauty. Devotees visit the Goddess from great distances. A special non-vegetarian meal is made by worshippers every Tuesday and Friday in fulfillment of their Harakes (religious vow). The Kariyamma Devi Administration office holds a festival every March.

Il Giardino dei Semplici (also spelled just as Giardino dei Semplici and often referred as GDS) are an Italian pop-rock music group, mainly successful in the 1970s and 1980s. Formed in late 1974 and officially launched in early 1975, throughout four decades they have released 11 studio records, 3 live albums, 3 collections of re-recorded tracks, 18 singles and many Greatest Hits albums. The group is well-known for singing in their signature choral falsetto; their music is a cohesive blend of genres.  Career  The group formed in Naples in October 1974, but it was officially launched in February 1975 under the production of Giancarlo Bigazzi and Tot√≤ Savio. They got an almost immediate huge success, with several singles charting on the Italian hit parade. Characterized by a style which mixes Neapolitan tradition and melodic pop-rock, they got their biggest hit in 1976, peaking at the third place on the Italian hit parade with Tu, ca nun chiagne, a cover version of a 1915 Canzone Napoletana classic. In 1977 the group entered the main competition at the Sanremo Music Festival with the song Miele, which sold 1 million copies. They attended at the popular music competition Festivalbar three times, scoring three smash-hits: M'innamorai (1975); Vai (1976); Concerto in La Minore (dedicato a lei) (1978). Their 1979 song Silvie was a success in the Scandinavian countries. Later, the song was covered by artist Katri Helena with the title Helsingin helle, becoming a hit in Finland. In 1982, the group decided to self-produce their work. Their bestseller in the Eighties was the album Ed √® subito Napoli, which revisited classic Neapolitan songs through acoustic, electric and electronica music arrangements. In 2013, their album Argento vivo mixed pop with rock and spawned five videoclips. Il Giardino dei Semplici celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015 with the releases of an autobiographical book and a new live album. Their celebrative gig at the RAI Auditorium in Naples was filmed by the nationwide TV. In 2017 the band launched a new single, Dannata idea, which became a radio hit, peaking at No. 34 in the Italian indie single chart. They are currently working on a new studio album. They have performed an estimate of 1,800 concerts all across Italy, as well as tours in the States and Canada in 1978 and Romania in 1992. In 2001, two members of GDS co-wrote and co-produced the Italian hit Turuturu (often spelled as Turu Turu) - 3rd place at the Sanremo Festival in the \\"Young Section\\" - which eventually sold 1 million and 200,000 copies in the world once being rearranged and performed by various artists as Sandy & Junior and Gisela. Tommy Esposito, drummer of the band since 1980, is one of the lyricists and composers of the smash-hit song Grande amore, performed by Il Volo in 2015.

Dragon king (DK) is a double metaphor for an event that is both extremely large in size or impact (a \\"king\\") and born of unique origins (a \\"dragon\\") relative to its peers (other events from the same system). DK events are generated by or correspond to mechanisms such as positive feedback, tipping points, bifurcations, and phase transitions, that tend to occur in nonlinear and complex systems, and serve to amplify DK events to extreme levels. By understanding and monitoring these dynamics, some predictability of such events may be obtained.D. Sornette, Dragon-Kings, Black Swans and the Prediction of Crises, International Journal of Terraspace Science and Engineering 1(3), 1‚Äì17 (2009) (https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4290) and (http://ssrn.com/abstract=1470006)D. Sornette, Predictability of catastrophic events: material rupture, earthquakes, turbulence, financial crashes and human birth, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 99, SUPP1 (2002), 2522‚Äì2529. The dragon king theory was developed by Didier Sornette, who hypothesizes that many crises are in fact DKs rather than black swans‚Äîi.e., they may be predictable to some degree. Given the importance of crises to the long-term organization of a variety of systems, the DK theory urges that special attention be given to the study and monitoring of extremes, and that a dynamic view be taken. From a scientific viewpoint, such extremes are interesting because they may reveal underlying, often hidden, organizing principles. Practically speaking, one should study extreme risks, but not forget that significant uncertainty will almost always be present, and should be rigorously considered in decisions regarding risk management and design. The DK theory is related to concepts such as black swan theory, outliers, complex systems, nonlinear dynamics, power laws, extreme value theory, prediction, extreme risks, and risk management. Black swans and dragon kings A black swan can be considered a metaphor for an event that is surprising (to the observer), has a major effect, and, after being observed, is rationalized in hindsight. The theory of black swans is epistemological, relating to the limited knowledge and understanding of the observer. The term was introduced and popularized by Nassim Taleb and has been associated with concepts such as heavy tails, non- linear payoffs, model error, and even Knightian uncertainty, whose \\"unknowable unknown\\" event terminology was popularized by former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Taleb claims that black swan events are not predictable, and in practice, the theory encourages one to \\"prepare rather than predict\\", and limit one's exposure to extreme fluctuations. The black swan concept is important and poses a valid criticism of people, firms, and societies that are irresponsible in the sense that they are overly confident in their ability to anticipate and manage risk. However, claiming that extreme events are‚Äîin general‚Äîunpredictable may also lead to a lack of accountability in risk management roles. In fact, it is known that in a wide range of physical systems that extreme events are predictable to some degree.Didier Sornette TED Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis?language=enAlbeverio, Sergio, Volker Jentsch, and Holger Kantz. Extreme events in nature and society. Springer Science & Business Media, 2006. One simply needs to have a sufficiently deep understanding of the structure and dynamics of the focal system, and the ability to monitor it. This is the domain of the dragon kings. Such events have been referred to as \\"grey swans\\" by Taleb. A more rigorous distinction between black swans, grey swans, and dragon kings is difficult as black swans are not precisely defined in physical and mathematical terms. However, technical elaboration of concepts in the Black Swan book are elaborated in the Silent Risk document. An analysis of the precise definition of a black swan in a risk management context was written by professor Terje Aven.Aven, Terje. \\"On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context.\\" Safety science 57 (2013): 44‚Äì51. Beyond power laws The 5000 largest drawdowns for 8 different futures contracts plotted according to their empirical CCDF, shifted by factors of 10 for visibility. The dashed lines are power law fits. It is well known that many phenomena in both the natural and social sciences have power law statistics (Pareto distribution).Mitzenmacher, Michael. \\"A brief history of generative models for power law and lognormal distributions.\\" Internet mathematics 1.2 (2004): 226‚Äì251.Newman, Mark EJ. \\"Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law.\\" Contemporary physics 46.5 (2005): 323‚Äì351.Sornette, Didier. \\"Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences: Chaos, Fractals, Selforganization and Disorder: Concepts and Tools (Springer Series in Synergetics).\\" (2006). Furthermore, from extreme value theory, it is known that a broad range of distributions (the Frechet class) have tails that are asymptotically power law. The result of this is that, when dealing with crises and extremes, power law tails are the \\"normal\\" case. The unique property of power laws is that they are scale-invariant, self-similar and fractal. This property implies that all events‚Äîboth large and small‚Äîare generated by the same mechanism, and thus there will be no distinct precursors by which the largest events may be predicted. A well-known conceptual framework for events of this type is self-organized criticality. Such concepts are compatible with the theory of the black swan. However Taleb has also stated that considering the power law as a model instead of a model with lighter tails (e.g., a Gaussian) \\"converts black swans into gray ones\\", in the sense that the power law model gives non-negligible probability to large events. In a variety of studies it has been found that, despite the fact that a power law models the tail of the empirical distribution well, the largest events are significantly outlying (i.e., much larger than what would be expected under the model).Wheatley, Spencer, and Didier Sornette. \\"Multiple Outlier Detection in Samples with Exponential & Pareto Tails: Redeeming the Inward Approach & Detecting Dragon Kings.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.08689 (2015).Pisarenko, V. F., and D. Sornette. \\"Robust statistical tests of Dragon-Kings beyond power law distributions.\\" The European Physical Journal Special Topics 205.1 (2012): 95‚Äì115. Such events are interpreted as dragon kings as they indicate a departure from the generic process underlying the power law. Examples of this include the largest radiation release events occurring in nuclear power plant accidents, the largest city (agglomeration) within the sample of cities in a country, the largest crashes in financial markets, and intraday wholesale electricity prices. Mechanisms Fold bifurcation in ecologyBarnosky, Anthony D., et al. \\"Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere.\\"Nature 486.7401 (2012): 52‚Äì58. Physically speaking, dragon kings may be associated with the regime changes, bifurcations, and tipping points of complex out-of- equilibrium systems. For instance, the catastrophe (fold bifurcation) of the global ecology illustrated in the figure could be considered to be a dragon king: Many observers would be surprised by such a dramatic change of state. However, it is well known that in dynamic systems, there are many precursors as the system approaches the catastrophe. Positive feedback is also a mechanism that can spawn dragon kings. For instance, in a stampede the number of cattle running increases the level of panic which causes more cattle to run, and so on. In human dynamics such herding and mob behavior has also been observed in crowds, stock markets, and so on (see herd behavior). Left: Illustration of the system trajectory in the vicinity of a bubbling event. Right: empirical pdf (histogram) of peak heights in trajectories in double logarithmic scaleCavalcante, Hugo LD de S., et al. \\"Predictability and suppression of extreme events in a chaotic system.\\" Physical review letters 111.19 (2013): 198701. Dragon kings are also caused by attractor bubbling in coupled oscillator systems. Attractor bubbling is a generic behavior appearing in networks of coupled oscillators where the system typically orbits in an invariant manifold with a chaotic attractor (where the peak trajectories are low), but is intermittently pushed (by noise) into a region where orbits are locally repelled from the invariant manifold (where the peak trajectories are large). These excursions form the dragon kings, as illustrated in the figure. It is claimed that such models can describe many real phenomena such as earthquakes, brain activity, etc. A block and spring mechanical model, considered as a model of geological faults and their earthquake dynamics, produced a similar distribution.Shaw, Bruce E., Jean M. Carlson, and James S. Langer. \\"Patterns of seismic activity preceding large earthquakes.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978‚Äì2012) 97.B1 (1992): 479‚Äì488. It could also be the case that dragon kings are created as a result of system control or intervention. That is, trying to suppress the release of stress or death in dynamic complex systems may lead to an accumulation of stress or a maturation towards instability. For instance, brush/forest fires are a natural occurrence in many areas. Such fires are inconvenient and thus we may wish that they are diligently extinguished. This leads to long periods without inconvenient fires, however, in the absence of fires, dead wood accumulates. Once this accumulation reaches a critical point, and a fire starts, the fire becomes so large that it cannot be controlled‚Äîa singular event that could be considered to be a dragon king. Other policies, such as doing nothing (allowing for small fires to occur naturally), or performing strategic controlled burning, would avoid enormous fires by allowing for frequent small ones. Another example is monetary policy. Quantitative easing programs and low interest rate policies are common, with the intention of avoiding recessions, promoting growth, etc. However, such programs build instability by increasing income inequality, keeping weak firms alive, and inflating asset bubbles.Sornette, Didier, and Peter Cauwels. \\"1980‚Äì2008: The illusion of the perpetual money machine and what it bodes for the future.\\" Risks 2.2 (2014): 103‚Äì131.Sornette, Didier, and Peter Cauwels. \\"Managing risk in a creepy world.\\" Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions 8.1 (2015): 83‚Äì108. Ultimately such policies, aimed at smoothing out economic fluctuations, will enable an enormous correction‚Äîa dragon king. Detecting DKs as statistical outliers Probability density function schematic where the dragon king regime is represented by a lump of mass deep in the tail DKs are outliers by definition. However, when calling DKs outliers there is an important proviso: In standard statistics outliers are typically erroneous values and are discarded, or statistical methods are chosen that are somehow insensitive to outliers. Contrarily, DKs are outliers that are highly informative, and should be the focus of much statistical attention. Thus a first step is identifying DKs in historical data. Existing tests are either based on the asymptotic properties of the empirical distribution function (EDF) or on an assumption about the underlying cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the data. It turns out that testing for outliers relative to an exponential distribution is very general. The latter follows from the Pickands‚ÄìBalkema‚Äìde Haan theorem of extreme value theory which states that a wide range of distributions asymptotically (above high thresholds) have exponential or power law tails. As an aside, this is one explanation why power law tails are so common when studying extremes. To finish the point, since the natural logarithm of a power law tail is exponential, one can take the logarithm of power law data and then test for outliers relative to an exponential tail. There are many test statistics and techniques for testing for outliers in an exponential sample. An inward test sequentially tests the largest point, then the second largest, and so on, until the first test that is not rejected (i.e., the null hypothesis that the point is not an outlier is not rejected). The number of rejected tests identifies the number of outliers. For instance, where x_{(1)}>x_{(2)}>\\\\cdots>x_{(n)} is the sorted sample, the inward robust test uses the test statistic T_{r,m}=x_{(r)}/(x_{(m)}+\\\\cdots+x_{(n)}) where r is the point being tested (r=1,2,3,\\\\ldots), and r where m is the pre-specified maximum number of outliers. At each step the p-value for the test statistic must be computed and, if lower than some level, the test rejected. This test has many desirable properties: It does not require that the number of outliers be specified, it is not prone to under (masking) and over (swamping) estimation of the number outliers, it is easy to implement, and the test is independent of the value of the parameter of the exponential tail. =Examples= (II) Empirical CCDF of the log of radiation released (grey dashed) and damage (black) caused by accidents at nuclear power plants, with solid lines giving the fitted power law tail.

Some examples of where dragon kings have been detected as outliers include: * financial crashes as measured by drawdowns, where the outliers correspond to terrorist attacks (e.g., the 2005 London bombing), and the flash crash of 2010; * the radiation released and financial losses caused by accidents at nuclear power plants, where outliers correspond to runaway disasters where safety mechanisms were overwhelmed; * the largest city (measured by the population in its agglomeration) in the population of cities within a country, where the largest city plays a disproportionately important role in the dynamics of the country, and benefits from unique growth; * intraday wholesale electricity prices; and * three-wave nonlinear interaction‚Äîit is possible to suppress the emergence of dragon kings.

For instance, in non-linear systems with phase transitions at a critical point, it is well known that a window of predictability occurs in the neighborhood of the critical point due to precursory signs: the system recovers more slowly from perturbations, autocorrelation changes, variance increases, spatial coherence increases, etc.Strogatz, Steven H.

For the phenomena of unsustainable growth (e.g., of populations or stock prices), one can consider a growth model that features a finite time singularity, which is a critical point where the growth regime changes. In systems that are discrete scale invariant such a model is power law growth, decorated with a log-periodic function.Sornette, Didier. \\"Discrete-scale invariance and complex dimensions.\\" Physics reports 297.5 (1998): 239‚Äì270.Huang, Y., Ouillon, G., Saleur, H., & Sornette, D.

Fitting this model on the growth data (non-linear regression) allows for the prediction of the singularity, i.e., the end of unsustainable growth. This has been applied to many problems, for instance: rupture in materials,A. Johansen and D. Sornette, Critical ruptures, Eur. Phys. J. B 18 (2000): 163‚Äì181. earthquakes,S.G. Sammis and D.

An interesting dynamic to consider, that may reveal the development of a block-buster success, is epidemic phenomena: e.g., the spread of plague, viral phenomena in media, the spread of panic and volatility in stock markets, etc. In such a case, a powerful approach is to decompose activity/fluctuations into exogeneous and endogeneous parts, and learn about the endogenous dynamics that may lead to high impact bursts in activity.Sornette, Didier. \\"Endogenous versus exogenous origins of crises.\\" Extreme events in nature and society.

This model estimate can then be used to compute interesting quantities such as the conditional probability of the occurrence of a dragon king event in a future time interval, and the most probable occurrence time. When doing statistical modeling of extremes, and using complex or nonlinear dynamic models, there is bound to be substantial uncertainty. Thus, one should be diligent in uncertainty quantification: not only considering the randomness present in the fitted stochastic model, but also the uncertainty of its estimated parameters (e.g., with Bayesian techniques or by first simulating parameters and then simulating from the model with those parameters), and the uncertainty in model selection (e.g., by considering an ensemble of different models). One can then use the estimated probabilities and their associated uncertainties to inform decisions. In the simplest case, one performs a binary classification: predicting that a dragon king will occur in a future interval if its probability of occurrence is high enough, with sufficient certainty. For instance, one may take a specific action if a dragon king is predicted to occur. An optimal decision will then balance the cost of false negatives/false positives and misses/false alarms according to a specified loss function. For instance, if the cost of a miss is very large relative to the cost of a false alarm, the optimal decision will detect dragon kings more frequently than they occur. One should also study the true positive rate of the prediction. The smaller this value is, the weaker the test, and the closer one is to black swan territory. In practice the selection of the optimal decision, and the computation of its properties must be done by cross validation with historical data (if available), or on simulated data (if one knows how to simulate the dragon kings). In a dynamic setting the dataset will grow over time, and the model estimate, and its estimated probabilities will evolve. One may then consider combining the sequence of estimates/probabilities when performing prediction. In this dynamic setting, the test will likely be weak most of the time (e.g., when the system is around equilibrium), but as one approaches a dragon king, and precursors become visible, the true positive rate should increase. The importance of extreme risks Dragon kings form special kinds of events leading to extreme risks (which can also be opportunities). That extreme risks are important should be self-evident. Natural disasters provide many examples (e.g., asteroid impacts leading to extinction). Some statistical examples of the impact of extremes are that: the largest nuclear power plant accident (2011 Fukushima disaster) caused more damage than all (>200) other historical accidents together,Wheatley, Spencer, Benjamin Sovacool, and Didier Sornette. \\"Of Disasters and Dragon Kings: A Statistical Analysis of Nuclear Power Incidents & Accidents.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.02380 (2015). the largest 10 percent of private data breaches from organizations accounts for 99 percent of the total breached private information,Wheatley, Spencer, Thomas Maillart, and Didier Sornette. \\"The Extreme Risk of Personal Data Breaches & The Erosion of Privacy.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.07684 (2015). the largest five epidemics since 1900 caused 20 times the fatalities of the remaining 1363,Guha-Sapir, D., R. Below, and Ph Hoyois. \\"EM-DAT: International disaster database.\\" Univ. Cathol. Louvain, Brussels: Belgium. www. em-dat. net. (2014). etc. In general such statistics arrive in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, and the presence of dragon kings will augment the already oversized impact of extreme events. Despite the importance of extreme events, due to ignorance, misaligned incentives, and cognitive biases, there is often a failure to adequately anticipate them. Technically speaking, this leads to poorly specified models where distributions that are not heavy-tailed enough, and under-appreciate both serial and multivariate dependence of extreme events. Some examples of such failures in risk assessment include the use of Gaussian models in finance (Black‚ÄìScholes, the Gaussian copula, LTCM), the use of Gaussian processes and linear wave theory failing to predict the occurrence of rogue waves, the failure of economic models in general to predict the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, and the under-appreciation of external events, cascades, and nonlinear effects in probabilistic risk assessment, leading to not anticipating the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. Such high impact failures emphasize the importance of the study of extremes. Risk management The dragon king concept raises many questions about how one can deal with risk. Of course, if possible, exposure to large risks should be avoided (often referred to as the \\"black swan approach\\"). However, in many developments, exposure to risk is a necessity, and a trade-off between risk and return needs to be navigated. In an adaptive system, where prediction of dragon kings is successful, one can act to defend the system or even profit. How to design such resilient systems, as well as their real time risk monitoring systems,Sornette, Didier, and Tatyana Kovalenko. \\"Dynamical Diagnosis and Solutions for Resilient Natural and Social Systems.\\" Planet@ Risk 1 (1) (2013) 7‚Äì33. is an important and interdisciplinary problem where dragon kings must be considered. On another note, when it comes to the quantification of risk in a given system (whether it be a bank, an insurance company, a dike, a bridge, or a socio-economic system), risk needs to be accounted for over a period, such as annually. Typically one is interested in statistics such as the annual probability of loss or damage in excess of some value (value at risk), other tail risk measures, and return periods. To provide such risk characterizations, the dynamic dragon kings must be reasoned about in terms of annual frequency and severity statistics. These frequency and severity statistics can then be brought together in a model such as a compound Poisson process. Provided that the statistical properties of the system are consistent over time (stationary), frequency and severity statistics may be constructed based on past observations, simulations, and/or assumptions. If not, one may only construct scenarios. However, in any case, given the uncertainty present, a range of scenarios should be considered. Due to the shortage of data for extreme events, the principle of parsimony, and theoretical results from extreme value theory about universal tail models, one typically relies on a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) tail model. However such a model excludes DKs. Thus, when one has sufficient reason to believe that DKs are present, or if one simply wants to consider a scenario, one may e.g., consider a density mixture of a GPD and a density for the DK regime.
