It was published in Kodansha's Aria magazine from January 2014 to April 2018, and later, after Aria ceased publication, serialized in Sh≈çnen Magazine Edge from July to September 2018. Plot The series centers on Stella Kuonji, one of nine adopted siblings in the wealthy and influential Kuonji family. At one of the family's monthly tea parties, their parents announce that the children must now fight to the death within the next year, with the sole survivor being chosen as the family's heir. In the ensuing chaos, Stella's violent alternative personality, Bloody Alice, begins to resurface in Stella's clashes with the other children. As the series progresses, Stella learns that her adopted family are actually bandersnatches, creatures that feed on human souls, and that they require the tea at the monthly tea parties to survive. Her adopted mother, Olga, was the sole survivor of one of the Kuonji family's rituals of bloodshed among its children. As a result of winning, Olga was allowed to bring back her partner. Furthermore, Stella begins to suspect that the accident that killed her parents was a plot by the Kounjo family. Although Stella and her beloved elder brother Zeno wish to end the family tradition of ritualistic bloodshed, Olga denies that possibility. Release Kaori Yuki began serializing the manga in Kodansha's sh≈çjo magazine Aria on 28 January 2014. After Aria ceased publication on 28 April 2018, the series was transferred to Shonen Magazine Edge, starting publication on 17 July of the same year. The series finished on 15 September 2018. Yen Press licensed the series for release in North America. =Volume list= Reception Reviewing the first volume for Anime News Network, Rebecca Silverman gave it a grade of B. She commented that the series \\"doesn't always work, but it has enough potential to that given another volume or two, I feel like it will really take off.\\" She praised the art, and wrote that Stella's mother \\"is definitely a leading contender for 'sickest parent in manga.'\\", saying that the scenes with the parents were \\"a combination of enraging and chilling, making them easily the most effective part of the volume.\\" References External links * at Aria * at Hachette Book Group (parent of Yen Press) * Category:Comics based on Alice in Wonderland Category:Dark fantasy anime and manga Category:Gothic fiction Category:Kaori Yuki Category:Kodansha manga Category:Sh≈çjo manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Yen Press titles ","title":"Alice in Murderland (manga)"},{"id":"48336966","text":"Jeremiah Scott is the rhythm guitarist for the Christian metalcore band Demon Hunter and bassist for thrash metal act Destroy Destroy Destroy as well as a rock and metal producer based in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Second Bank of the United States was headquartered in Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia, the same as the First Bank, and had branches throughout the nation. The Second Bank was chartered by many of the same congressmen who in 1811 had refused to renew the charter of the original Bank of the United States. The predominant reason that the Second Bank of the United States was chartered was that in the War of 1812, the U.S. experienced severe inflation and had difficulty in financing military operations. Subsequently, the credit and borrowing status of the United States was at its lowest level since its founding. The charter of the Second Bank of the United States (B.U.S.) was for 20 years and therefore up for renewal in 1836. Its role as the depository of the federal government's revenues made it a political target of banks chartered by the individual states who objected/envied the B.U.S.'s relationship with the central government. Partisan politics came heavily into play in the debate over the renewal of the charter. \\"The classic statement by Arthur Schlesinger was that the partisan politics during the Jacksonian period was grounded in class conflict. Viewed through the lens of party elite discourse, Schlesinger saw inter-party conflict as a clash between wealthy Whigs and working class Democrats.\\" (Grynaviski) President Andrew Jackson strongly opposed the renewal of its charter, and built his platform for the election of 1832 around doing away with the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson's political target was Nicholas Biddle, financier, politician, and president of the Bank of the United States. Apart from a general hostility to banking and the belief that specie (gold and/or silver) were the only true monies, Jackson's reasons for opposing the renewal of the charter revolved around his belief that bestowing power and responsibility upon a single bank was the cause of inflation and other perceived evils. During September 1833, President Jackson issued an executive order that ended the deposit of government funds into the Bank of the United States. After September 1833, these deposits were placed in the state chartered banks, commonly referred to as Jackson‚Äôs ‚Äúpet banks‚Äù. While it is true that 6 out of the 7 initial depositories were controlled by Jacksonian Democrats, the later depositories, such as the ones in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Michigan, were run by managers who opposed Jacksonian politics. It is probably a misnomer to label all the state chartered repositories ‚Äúpet banks‚Äù.

The rebellion was brutally suppressed by Ottoman troops. Background During the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18, Austrian forces aided by Serb volunteers penetrated into West Morava and set up a new border there. The war resulted in renewed persecution against the Serb population in Kosovo, Metohija and neighbouring regions. The Ottomans relied on Albanians for securing their border regions with Austria, the Albanians becoming freed from the heaviest duties in return., The Albanians had for years opposed accepting subject obligations, but now promised to defend the land from enemies and to fight bandits among themselves; in return they were exempt from paying the mining tribute for that year. However, they continued causing disorder and refused paying taxes. In the second half of September 1717, during the retreat from Belgrade, at Ni≈° the Ottoman sultan chose Vizier Abdul Pasha to maintain order and peace in Kosovo, and especially in Skopje, Pristina and Vuƒçitrn. Uprising In Vuƒçitrn and in the nearby areas Novi Pazar and Peƒá, the Serb rayah rose up in a large revolt. This came after Austrian military success, and was meant to open the way for the Austrian army. Tahir Pasha was appointed by the government to deal with the rebellious Serbs. Ferhat Aga, the captain of Novi Pazar, joined Tahir Pasha to together break the uprising at Vuƒçitrn, Novi Pazar and Peƒá. It was brutally suppressed. The Ottoman troops that were sent to pacify the people and investigate, carried out new violence. Aftermath After the rebellion, the Albanians put pressure on the Serb rayah and the Ottoman local leaders. Tahir Pasha was meant to keep the rebellious rayah on the land, but also to impose tribute on the \\"new yabancƒ± (foreigner) rayah\\" (the immigrant Albanians) who seized other's property that did not belong to them. Trying to address the Albanian problem, in September 1718 Tahir Pasha sought a firman (official decree) to eradicate bandits in order to calm the land \\"from their plunder and murder\\". Only a month after the decree, Kurd Mehmed Pasha from Yakova was given the Sanjak of ƒ∞pek, and Tahir Pasha is no longer mentioned as alive. The harsh economic status, robberies, and threat of murder pushed the Kosovo Serbs into either accepting Islam, or seeking protection under a strong lord (accepting serfdom status). Many opted for a third alternative, to take refuge in other areas where life was more acceptable.

Sonita Alizadeh (; born 1996) is an Afghan rapper and activist who has been vocal against forced marriages. Alizadeh first gained attention when she released \\"Brides for Sale,\\" a video in which she raps about daughters being sold into marriage by their families. With the help of Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami, an Iranian documentary filmmaker who over three years documented her story in the film Sonita, Alizadeh filmed the video to escape a marriage her parents were planning for her, even though it is illegal for women to sing publicly in Iran, where she was living at the time. After releasing the video on YouTube, Alizadeh was contacted by the Strongheart Group, which offered her a student visa and financial help to come and study in the United States of America, where she then relocated and has resided since. In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Early life Alizadeh grew up in Herat, Afghanistan, under the rule of the Taliban. Her family first considered selling her as a bride when she was 10. Alizadeh has said that at the time, she didn't fully understand what that meant. Instead, her family fled to Iran to escape the Taliban. In Iran, Alizadeh worked cleaning bathrooms, while she taught herself to read and write. During this time, she also discovered the music of Iranian rapper Yas and American rapper Eminem. Inspired by their music, she started writing her own songs. In 2014, Alizadeh entered a U.S. competition to write a song to get Afghan people to vote in their elections. She won a $1,000 prize, which Alizadeh sent to her mother, who had moved back to Afghanistan. \\"Brides for Sale\\" Shortly after winning the competition, Alizadeh's mother sent for her to return to Afghanistan, saying she had found a man to buy her. She was 16. Her mother was trying to earn a $9,000 dowry so that her elder brother could purchase a bride, and thought she could get at least $9,000 by selling her daughter. After Rokhsareh Ghaemmaghami, director of the documentary Sonita, paid $2,000 to Sonita's mother and asked for six months of time for Sonita, she wrote \\"Brides for Sale\\" and Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami filmed the music video, which gained international attention. The video was not only popular with women in Afghanistan, but also drew the attention of the nonprofit Strongheart Group, which arranged to bring Alizadeh to the U.S. Present Alizadeh currently lives in New York and attends Bard College. In addition to attending classes, she continues to write songs. A documentary, called Sonita, premiered at the International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam in November 2015. The film gained positive reviews. The film was entered into the Sundance Film Festival and won the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize for a documentary film. The film also showed at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2016, and Seattle alt-weekly The Stranger designated it a \\"don't miss\\" feature.

Shown below it is a \\"fat face\\" design, a type also popular in early 19th century printing. Both typefaces are very bold, but the fat face's thick lines are the verticals as normal and the Italian's are the horizontals. A reverse-contrast letterform is a typeface or custom lettering in which the stress is reversed from the norm: instead of the vertical lines being the same width or thicker than horizontals, which is normal in Latin- alphabet writing and especially printing, the horizontal lines are the thickest. The result is a dramatic effect, in which the letters seem to have been printed the wrong way round. Originally invented in the early nineteenth century as attention-grabbing novelty display designs, modern font designer Peter Biƒæak, who has created a design in the genre, has described them as \\"a dirty trick to create freakish letterforms that stood out.\\" Reverse-contrast letters are rarely used for body text, being more used in display applications such as headings and posters, in which the unusual structure may be particularly eye-catching. They were particularly common in the nineteenth century, and have been revived occasionally since then. They could be considered as slab serif designs because of the thickened serifs, and are often characterised as part of that genre. The reverse-contrast effect has been extended to other kinds of typeface, such as sans-serif designs and designs more suitable for extended text passages. The design style, also known as \\"reverse-stroke\\" or \\"horizontal-stress\\", has no connection to reverse- contrast printing, where light text is printed on a black background. Historical background Centaur, based on 1470s Venetian printing. The narrowest part of the stroke is at top left/bottom right, so the axis is diagonal. Throughout the development of the modern Latin alphabet with an upper-case based on Roman square capitals and lower-case based on handwriting, it has been the norm for the vertical lines to generally be slightly thicker than the horizontals. Early 'roman' or 'antiqua' type followed this model, often placing the thinnest point of letters at an angle and downstrokes heavier than upstrokes, mimicking the writing of a right-handed writer holding a quill pen. (The Hebrew alphabet, in contrast, is normally \\"reverse-contrast\\" from a Latin-alphabet perspective, as the verticals are lighter.) From the arrival of roman type around 1475 to the late eighteenth century, relatively little development in letter design took place, as most fonts of the period were intended for body text, and they stayed relatively similar in design and rooted in traditions of Italian humanistic handwriting. A Didone type, Bodoni, from the late eighteenth century. The contrast has been increased and the axis of the contrast made more purely vertical. Rockwell. The serifs have been thickened and the contrast is minimal. Starting in the eighteenth century, typefounders developed what are now called transitional and then Didone types. These typefaces had a far greater amount of stroke contrast than before, with the difference in stroke width much greater than in earlier types. These had more constructed letterforms, matching the steely calligraphy of the period, and daringly slender horizontals and serif details that could show off the increasingly high quality of paper and printing technology of the period. In addition, these typefaces had a strictly vertical stress: without exception, the vertical lines were thicker than the horizontals, creating a much more geometric and modular design. A second major development of the period was the arrival of the printed poster and increasing use of signpainting and printing for publicity and advertising material, for example in newspaper adverts. This caused a desire to develop eye-catching new types of letters. As a result, new styles of lettering and \\"display type\\" began to appear, such as \\"fat face\\" bold faces, sans serif letters, apparently inspired by classical antiquity, and then slab-serifs. These letterforms were a new departure and not simply larger versions of traditional serif letters. Presumably to be more eye- catching, these new styles of letter were often extremely bold. The first reverse-contrast types The earliest known reverse contrast typeface dates to about 1821. It was created by the H.W. Caslon company in London, presumably as a parody of the crisp, high-contrast \\"Didone\\" typefaces and lettering of the period. A caps-only design, the foundry's steel master punches survive in the collection of the St Bride Library, London. The Caslon company called the type 'Italian'. Several display types at the time received exotic names: around the same time, 'Egyptian' was applied to sans- (and then slab-) serif types and 'Antique' to slab-serifs; this became increasingly common later in the century as more fanciful display faces were made. Nicolete Gray was prepared to believe that it was \\"probably\\" Italian in origin, however she was influenced by the French writer on printing Francis Thibaudeau, who claimed in his 1921 book La Lettre d'Imprimerie that the style appeared in France during the First French Empire (1804‚Äì1814/15), before its first appearance in Britain. Shields (2008) rejects Thibaudeau's claim: \\"Thibaudeau seems alone...and does not credit any French foundry with this type's origination. In my investigation so far I have found no evidence of examples earlier than Caslon & Catherwood's...the first French specimen with a confirmed date is Laurent & Deberny's 1835 broadside\\". Reverse-contrast designs do slightly resemble capitalis rustica writing from Ancient Rome, which also has emphatic horizontal serifs at top and bottom, although this may be a coincidence. Other names such as Egyptian were also used. Regarding design, the Caslon Italian typeface is very clearly \\"conceptual\\" in design, deliberately taking aspects of the fat face and one by one inverting them; Nick Sherman comments that it \\"shows a very literal approach to reversing stroke weight, so thicks become thin and thins become thick.\\" It has very thick serifs, so the gap between the serifs and the main strokes making up the letters is very small, as can be seen on letters such as 'E' and 'S'. To make the effect even more shocking, the triangular serifs were inverted (becoming thinner as they met the letter, not thicker), and the thicker line on the 'A' was moved from its normal position on the right (the natural position matching the handwriting of a right-handed writer) to the left, making a letter that seems to have been drawn the wrong way round. Writing for Print magazine, Paul Shaw described it as \\"one of the most bizarre slab serif types of the 19th century.\\" Barnes and Schwartz describe it as \\"perverse [but] done with sureness and confidence.\\" Within a few years of their introduction the printer and social reformer Thomas Curson Hansard had described them as \\"typographic monstrosities\\": > Fashion and Fancy commonly frolic from one extreme to another. To the razor- > edged fine lines and serifs of [Didone] type...a reverse [of sans and slab > serifs] has succeeded...the property of which is, that the strokes which > form the letters are all of one uniform thickness! After this, who would > have thought that further extravagance could have been conceived? It > remains, however, to be stated, that the ingenuity of one founder has > contrived a type in which the natural shape is reversed, by turning all the > serifs and fine strokes into fats, and the fats into leans. Oh! sacred > shades of [eminent typefounders of the past] Moxon and van Dijck, of > Baskerville and Bodoni! What would ye have said of the typographic > monstrosities here exhibited , which Fashion in our age has produced? In contrast, Walter Tracy described the design in 1986 as \\"a jeu d‚Äôesprit, not meant to be judged in conventional aesthetic terms.\\" The design was apparently successful, since it rapidly spread to the United States and elsewhere. For example, the George Bruce company of New York displays Caslon's Italian (or a close copy) in its 1828 specimen book. Many versions of similar design were released, both as metal and as wood type. Expansions of the concept included italic faces, confusingly called \\"Italian Italic\\", backslanted and sans-serif versions. Peter Biƒæak's Karloff is a sophisticated revival of the original reverse-contrast faces designed partly through mathematical interpolation. Biƒæak's group digitally inverted the contrast of a conventional Didone font: this allowed Biƒæak to create a family of normal and matching reverse-contrast fonts with upper- and lower-case, together with a low-contrast slab serif design, all with the same basic structure. These have been released as Karloff Positive, Negative and Neutral, the name referring to Boris Karloff. Village Type's Arbor like Karloff adds a lower-case, while Match & Kerosene's Slab Sheriff is caps-only, with a 'A' featuring the conventional stress on the right. A revival with extremely high contrast is Kris Sowersby's Maelstrom. Other unreleased revivals have reportedly been made for private use by Paul Barnes and Justin Howes.

The document was printed in Michigan, showing how far the Italian style had penetrated around 15 years after its appearance in London. French Clarendon French Clarendon type (top) compared to a conventional Clarendon design. Original French Clarendon wood type, showing its highly condensed design. French Clarendon type on a 1914 poster from Ljubljana. The reverse- contrast idea fused with a separate genre of slab-serif face, known as Clarendons. In the mid to late nineteenth century, it became popular for type foundries to offer reverse-contrast variants of Clarendon, a popular slab serif type genre, especially in the United States, creating large block serifs at the top and bottom of the letter. This was known as \\"French Clarendon\\" type. The advantage of French Clarendon type was that it allowed very large, eye-catching serifs while the letters remained narrow, suiting the desire of poster-makers for condensed but very bold type. French Clarendon designs were often created in wood type, used for large-print letters on posters. They are often associated with \\"wild-west\\" printing and seen on circus posters and wanted notices in western movies, although the style was really used in many parts of the world during this period. The style is sometimes called 'circus letter'. The practice was less popular with more artisanal printers: DeVinne commented in 1902 that \\"To be hated, it needs but to be seen.\\" In Europe the style was sometimes called Italienne, matching the Caslon name. In contrast to the original Caslon type, which features horizontals in the middle of the letter (like the cross-bar in the H) that are often but not always thick, French Clarendon types have the only thick lines at the top and botton, and all inner horizontals thin, and are generally less \\"conceptually\\" reverse- contrast, with serifs in a more conventional alignment apart from the thick strokes at top and bottom. David Shields reports that the first type of the genre is the \\"French Antique\\" face of Robert Besley & Co. (which had released and copyrighted the first Clarendon face) in an 1854 specimen. The University of Texas at Austin, which maintains a large archive of American wood type, reports that the first known wood French Clarendon type was issued by William Hamilton Page in 1865. Their collection shows the many other names used for wood type which display reverse-contrast characteristics, including 'Celtic', 'Belgian', 'Aldine' and 'Teutonic', as well as Italian again and sometimes 'Tuscan' or 'Etruscan' also. (At the time a separation did not fully exist between genre names and typeface names, so these may be the names of individual types, or if they proved popular the name of the subgenre they created.) At least one sans-serif typeface with reverse contrast was developed in this period. A variety of more modern adaptations have been made of the style, including Robert Harling's Playbill (1938) and more recently Adrian Frutiger's Westside, URW++'s Zirkus and Bitstream's P. T. Barnum. Writing on why he created a design in the genre, Frutiger, a designer better-known for his work in the sans-serif genre, commented: > As a type designer I wanted to draw something in every style. It's a matter > of professional pride...I found the existing Italiennes with their big feet > too harsh and strict...the fine curves in the serifs give Westside its own > expression. A text set in this typeface looks like a weaving pattern...I > really enjoyed drawing it. For one thing it was great fun. Frutiger decided to return to the Caslon type's pattern of all horizontals being thick apart from those on 'a' and 'e', which he felt could not be fitted into this system. Modern reverse-contrast types Because of their quirky, hand-made design, lighter versions of the French Clarendon style were popular for uses such as film posters in the 1950s and '60s. A well-reviewed modernisation of the style has been Trilby by David Jonathan Ross, who has written and lectured on the history of the genre. Released by Font Bureau, it is reminiscent of Clarendon revivals from the 1950s. It attempts to adapt the style to use in a much wider range of settings, going so far as to be usable for text. Bigfish is another modernisation inspired by lettering, in which the thickest stress is at the top. Some other adaptations have preserved the concept but changed genre, presenting sans-serif or script typefaces in the same style. Antique Olive of 1966 by Roger Excoffon is a well-known sans-serif design with subtle reverse-contrast aspects, particularly visible in its ultra-bold 'Nord' style, while Signo is an award-winning sans-serif reverse- contrast design from 2015.

Through research, government work, education and advocacy, she has worked to raise the prestige of Mexican handcrafts and folk art and to help artisans improve their economic status. Her work has been recognized with awards from various governmental and non-governmental agencies. Life and education Turok was born to American parents, with both growing up in the Boston area. After World War II, they decided to move to Mexico City, with her older brother, Kipi, where they started a postcard business. Marta was born in 1952, with another brother, Mark, coming after. Here they were raised, and Marta grew up bicultural and bilingual, attending the English-language American School in Mexico City. Turok decided to go to the United States to do her undergraduate degree, attended Tufts University, where her father had studied chemistry. The university allowed undergraduates to design their own course of study, which she took advantage of as they did not yet have an anthropology program. She chose to do a comprehensive senior thesis, traveling to Chiapas to research handcrafts there. There she worked with anthropologist Walter Morris, Jr., where the two decided to research the history and possible meanings being traditional design elements in Mayan handwoven cloth. This concept was completely new at the time, and subsequent research proved the concept correct, that the elements did indeed have meanings at one time, but most have been lost. During this time, she learned to speak Tzotzil and weave on a backstrap loom. Turok graduated in 1974, with a degree in anthropology and socioeconomics. Later, she studied ethnology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, graduating in 1978, and in 1996, received a certificate in marketing from the University of California Berkeley. Career Instead of using her research in Chiapas to start an academic career, she opted to follow a more pragmatic path, helping artisans improve their economic situation, promoting the cultural value of handcrafts and folk art, training artisans in marketing and working with collectors, museum curators and the general public. Turok began her career working for a number of government agencies and teaching classes on traditional Mexican textile design. Her government work focused on public policy to raise the status of handcrafts. She has worked with the National Indigenous Institute, and the Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesan√≠as (FONART), where as subdirector of social programs, created the policy guideline to distinguish handcrafts with artistic and cultural value. In 1988, she was the executive director of the Direcci√≥n General de Culturas Populares (Popular Cultures Bureau), the youngest women named to a senior post in the Ministry of Education. During her time there, it grew from 300 to 800 employees, with 17 regional offices. She established the Mexican Sport Confederation as a national entity, with supports the preservation of pre Hispanic sports and games. The agency also included the publishing of books related to folk art and popular culture, with topics such as s purpura, a dye made from a sea snail, organ grinders and charro music from northern Mexico. She also developed a project to preserve weaving and sewing traditions in numerous indigenous communities, providing fabric, embroidery thread and sewing needles. In the late 1980s, Turok decided to transition from government work to that in the non-profit sector. She founded the Asociac√≠on Mexicana de Arte y Cultura Popular (AMACUP) or Mexican Association of Popular Art and Culture in 1989, which focuses on developing contemporary products using traditional techniques. It also works to ensure that this handcraft production is both economically and environmentally sustainable. It has brought goods to new markets, especially international specialty stores and museum gift catalogs, as well as the major Mexican tourist centers of Canc√∫n, Los Cabos, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta. She remained president of the association from its founding until 2012. In the 2010s, she was the head of CENIDEART, the Research Center at the Escuela de Artesan√≠as (School of Handcrafts) of the National Institute of Fine Arts. Today, she is the curator for the Ruth D. Lechuga folk art collection at the Franz Mayer Museum. With the Escuela de Artesan√≠as she worked with accrediting handcraft traditions for the Secretariat of Public Education, as well as did research. With the Franz Mayer Museum she has curated exhibits such as Traditions, Mexican Popular Arts (SUNY/Albany 1992), Lacas Mexicanas (1997), El Juguete en M√©xico (1998), Cer√°mica de Mata Ortiz (1999), El Sarape de Saltillo (2003), 1001 Rostros de M√©xico: m√°scaras de la colecci√≥n de Ruth D. Lechuga (2010) and El Arte Popular de Hidalgo: rituales, usos y creaciones October 2010 ‚Äì March 2011. Turok also worked as a co-curator for the exhibition Grupo de Grabadores Mixtecos Unidos, A.C. as part of the Living Earth Festival of the Museum of the American Indian (Smithsonian, 2011) and with the Centro de las Artes Ind√≠genas del Taj√≠n, worked to form the Muse√≥grafos Totonacas. In addition, she has trained artisans in marketing and the environment and for 40 years has served as a judge in Mexican craft contests, such as those sponsored by the Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art in New York. She is still active academically; giving conferences on topics related to Mexican handcrafts and folk art and has taught seminars and courses. In 2016, Turok and Margarita de Orellana became the co-executors of the collection of more than 20,000 artifacts, books and personal items donated by Ruth D. Lechuga to the Franz Mayer Museum.

It offers interactive data visualization products for business intelligence and business analytics. History Logi Analytics, formerly LogiXML, was founded in 2000 by Arman Eshraghi, a software development and architecture professional. The company claims its mission is \\"to help application teams create smarter software.\\" In 2000, Logi Analytics developed LGX AppDev, an XML-based engine that built Web applications and evolved to address the specific task of report-building for BI. Logi Report (then called LGX Report), the first engine-driven, XML-based reporting application. Between 2002 and 2004, more features were added to Logi Report until Eshraghi made the decision to brand the full-featured version separately - as Logi Info - and offer the basic version free of charge. Then in 2004, Logi Analytics began marketing Logi Report as a free Web-based BI reporting tool. The product was renamed Logi Report or Freereporting.com.DM Review, July 2004. In 2006, Logi Analytics discontinued the LGX branding and introduced the Logi product line, consisting of applications for ad hoc, managed and OLAP reporting, an embedded database to be used between operational databases and reporting servers, and a connector pack for integration of commonly used Web-based sources into the Logi reporting environment. They also started to expand internationally, partnering firstly with Nano Blue in AsiaPac, then Intenda in EMEA. In 2008, Logi Analytics streamlined its commercial product offering, concentrating on Logi Info (managed reporting, analysis and dashboarding), Logi Ad Hoc (ad hoc reporting, analysis and dashboarding), and the Logi 9 platform (Web-based BI platform including managed and ad hoc reporting, analysis, dashboarding and data integration). The company changed its name to 'Logi Analytics in March, 2013. In October 2013, Logi Analytics received a $27.5 million growth equity investment led by new investor LLR Partners. Updata Partners also participated in the round. The company previously raised $23.1 million from Updata Partners, Grotech Ventures and Summit Partners, who remain invested in the company. In 2014, Logi Analytics introduced its data discovery product, Logi Vision, to be deployed as a stand-alone application or integrated with its business information platform, Logi Info. Together, these integrated products can be used by customers to address a wide range of analytics use cases across the organisation. In July 2015, Logi DataHub was introduced as part of the Logi 12 release, designed to simplify data preparation and ensure high performance for self-service analytics. With DataHub, customers can rapidly connect, acquire, and blend data from files, applications or databases, whether on-premise or in the cloud; cache it in a high-performance self-tuning repository; and prepare it using DataHub's smart profiling, joining, and intuitive data enrichment.

Biography The Kourtikios or Kourtikes family was Armenian in origin and entered Byzantine service under Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867‚Äì886), when its eponymous founder, K'urdik, ceded his fortress of Lokana to the Empire. Nothing is known of Michael Kourtikios' early life and career, although a seal of his attests his holding the post of topoteretes of Thrace. In 976, the general Bardas Skleros rebelled against Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) with the backing of the eastern themes. In late 976 or early 977 he crossed the Anti- Taurus Mountains and defeated a loyalist army at Lapara. This event strengthened Skleros' position and led to the defection of several high- ranking officers. According to the account of the late 11th-century historian John Skylitzes, following Skleros' victory at Lapara, in Attaleia, the capital of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, the populace rose up in his support. They took the local admiral prisoner and offered their services, along with the entire thematic fleet, to Skleros, who placed Kourtikios as the new commander of the Cibyrrhaeots. Leo the Deacon, however, who was a contemporary to the rebellion, reports that this happened only later, in 978, after Skleros scored a victory against the loyalist general Bardas Phokas the Younger, that Attaleia went over to the rebel. Werner Seibt, followed by other scholars like Alexander Kazhdan and Michael Whittow, furthermore suggested that Kourtikios was actually the admiral deposed by the Attaleians, who then switched his allegiance to Skleros. According to Skylitzes, Kourtikios attacked and raided several Aegean islands, and prepared to capture Abydos on the Hellespont, thereby cutting Constantinople's seaborne links to the western provinces still loyal to Basil, as well as allowing Skleros to ferry his troops over to Europe. Skylitzes reports that then he was defeated in a major battle off Phocaea by the Droungarios of the Imperial Fleet, Theodore Karantenos. Leo the Deacon on the other hand records that the Imperial Fleet was led by Bardas Parsakountenos, who defeated a rebel fleet off Abydos through the use of Greek fire. Modern scholars therefore suggest that there may have been two naval engagements, one under Parsakountenos off Abydos, and one under Karantenos‚Äîwho accordingly was probably a thematic strategos rather than the droungarios of the Imperial Fleet‚Äîagainst Kourtikios off Phocaea.

Larry Payne, the 16-year-old in the background, was killed by Jones later in the day. Larry Payne was a sixteen-year old African American teenager who was killed following a march in support of the Memphis Sanitation Strike on Thursday, March 28, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was the only fatality on that day although the New Pittsburgh Courier reported 60 injured and 276 arrested. Martin Luther King Jr. called Payne's mother, Lizzie Payne, on the phone to console her after her son's brutal death at the hands of Patrolman Leslie Dean Jones. Events leading up to Payne's death Conflicting accounts describe the looting that occurred in tandem with the march on Thursday March 28 1968 that led to a city-wide curfew and Mayor Loeb calling the Tennessese National Guard. Payne's funeral There was a five-hour wake the day before the funeral on Monday, April 1, 1968. Six hundred attended his funeral at Clayborn Temple on Tuesday, April 2, 1968. Striking sanitation workers, clergy members who supported the strike, and national television representatives were all in attendance as well as the students and faculty of Mitchell Road High School where Payne was enrolled prior to his death. Rev. B.T. Dumas, pastor of New Philadelphia Baptist Church gave the eulogy entitled \\"Man Is Like Grass And Is Cut Down in Various Stages of Life.\\" Surprisingly, Rev. Dumas made no reference to the unusual circumstances of Payne's death. Payne's mother, Lizzie Mason Payne, had to be led from the church she was so full of grief. The Washington Post quoted her as saying: \\"They killed you like a dog.\\"  Events after Payne's death  King planned to visit Payne's mother during his next visit to Memphis, but was killed before the visit could occur.

Nationalism in the 19th century  With the nation-building process in mid-19th century, first Croatian-Serbian tension appeared. Serbian minister Ilija Gara≈°anin's Naƒçertanije (1844) claimed lands that were inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians and Croats were part of Serbia. Gara≈°anin's plan also includes methods of spreading Serbian influence in the claimed lands. He proposed ways to influence Croats, who Gara≈°anin regarded as \\"Serbs of Catholic faith\\".Vuk Karad≈æiƒá considered Croatian language as part of Shtokavian dialect and counted Croats as \\"Catholic Serbs\\" except those who speak Chakavian dialect. Those living in the Balkans, he labeled as Serbs. Croatia was at the time a kingdom in Habsburg Monarchy, with Dalmatia and Istria being separate Habsburg Crown lands. Ante Starƒçeviƒá, head of the Croatian Party of Rights, advocated for Croatia as a nation.In the Name of Independence: The Unmaking of Tito's Yugoslavia, Branko Belan, 2010, p. 82,83 After Austro-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and Serbia gained its independence from Ottoman Empire, Croatian and Serbian relations deteriorated as both sides had pretensions on Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1902 there was a reprinted article written by Serb Nikola Stojanoviƒá that was published in the publication of the Serbian Independent Party from Zagreb titled Do istrage va≈°e ili na≈°e (Till the Destruction, ours or yours) in which denying of the existence of Croat nation as well as forecasting the result of the \\"inevitable\\" Serbian-Croatian conflict occurred. During the 19th century, some Italian radical nationalists tried to promote the idea that a Croatian nation has no sound reason to exist: therefore the Slavic population on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea (Croats and Slovenes) should be Italianized, and the territory included in Italy.\\"Buying and Selling the Istrian Goat: Istrian Regionalism, Croatian Nationalism, and EU Enlargement\\", (book), John E.

The Anti-Slavic sentiment, perpetuated by Italian Fascism, led to the persecution of Croats, alongside ethnic Slovenes on ethnic and cultural grounds.

This period was therefore characterised as \\"centralising, oppressive and dedicated to the forcible Italianisation of the minorities\\" consequently leading to a strong emigration and assimilations of Slovenes and Croats from the Julian March.\\"Le pulizie etniche in Istria e nei Balcani\\", Inoslav Be≈°ker, retrieved 29. Feb. 2020 Following the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Italy occupied almost all of Dalmatia, as well as Gorski Kotar and the Italian government made stringent efforts to further Italianize the region. Italian occupying forces were accused of committing war crimes in order to transform occupied territories into ethnic Italian territories.Z. Dizdar: \\"Italian Policies Toward Croatians In Occupied Territories During The Second World War\\", Review of Croatian History Issue no.1 /2005 An example of this was the 1942 massacre in Podhum and Testa, when Italian forces murdered at least 108 Croat civilians and deported the remaining population to concentration camps. The Italian government operated concentration camps for Slavic citizens, such as Rab concentration camp and one on the island of Molat. =Chetniks= Regarding the realization of his Greater Serbian program Homogenous Serbia, Stevan Moljeviƒá wrote in his letter to Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá in February 1942:Nikola Milovanoviƒá ‚Äì DRA≈ΩA MIHAILOVIƒÜ, chapter \\"SMERNICE POLITIƒåKOG PROGRAMA I CILJEVI RAVNOGORSKOG POKRETA\\", edition \\"Rad\\", Belgrade, 1984. The tactics employed against the Croats were at least to an extent, a reaction to the terror carried out by the Usta≈°e, but Croats and Bosniaks living in areas intended to be part of Greater Serbia were to be cleansed of non-Serbs regardless, in accordance with Mihailoviƒá's directive of 20 December 1941. However the largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia where they preceded any significant Ustashe operations. Chetnik ethnic cleansing targeted Croat civilians throughout areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which Croats were massacred and expelled, such as the Krnjeu≈°a massacre and the Gata massacre. According to the Croatian historian, Vladimir ≈Ωerjaviƒá, Chetnik forces killed between 18,000-32,000 Croats during World War II, mostly civilians. Some historians regard Chetnik actions during this period as constituting genocide. Written evidence by Chetnik commanders indicates that terrorism against the non-Serb population was mainly intended to establish an ethnically-pure Greater Serbia in the historical territory of other ethnic groups (most notably Croatian and Muslim, but also Bulgarian, Romanian, Hungarian, Macedonian and Montenegrin). In the \\"Elaborate\\" of the Chetnik's Dinaric Battalion from March 1942, it's stated that the Chetniks' main goal was to create a \\"Serbian national state in the areas in which the Serbs live, and even those to which Serbs aspire (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lika and part of Dalmatia) where \\"only Orthodox population would live\\". It is also stated that Bosniaks should be convinced that Serbs are their allies, so they wouldn't join the Partisans, and then kill them.\\" Regarding the campaign, Chetnik commander Milan ≈†antiƒá said in Trebinje in July 1942, \\"The Serb lands must be cleansed from Catholics and Muslims. They will be inhabited only by the Serbs. Cleansing will be carried out thoroughly, and we will suppress and destroy them all without exception and without pity, which will be the starting point for our liberation. Mihailoviƒá went further than Moljeviƒá and requested over 90 percent of the NDH's territory, where more than 2,500,000 Catholics and over 800,000 Muslims lived (70 percent of the total population, with Orthodox Serbs the remaining 30 percent). According to Bajo Stani≈°iƒá, the final goal of the Chetniks was \\"founding of a new Serbian state, not a geographical term but a purely Serbian, with four basic attributes: the Serbian state [Greater Serbia], the Serb King [of] the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, Serbian nationality, and Serbian faith. The Balkan federation is also the next stage, but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state, that is, the Greater Serbia.ƒåetniƒçki zloƒçini nad Hrvatima i Muslimanima u Bosni i Hercegovini tijekom Drugog svjetskog rata (1941.-1945.), Zvonimir Despot, Veƒçernji list, 25.

Ramet. Chetnik ideology was influenced by the memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Serbs in north Dalmatia, Knin, Obrovac, and Benkovac held the first anti-Croatian government demonstrations. On 28 June 1989, the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, exiled Croatian Serb Chetnik commander Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá bestowed the Serbian politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj with the title of vojvoda, encouraging him to \\"expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign elements from holy Serbian soil\\", stating he would return to the Balkans only when Serbia was cleansed of \\"the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat\\". ≈†e≈°elj is a major proponent of a Greater Serbia with no ethnic minorities, but \\"ethnic unity and harmony among Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Serbs, Muslim Serbs and atheist Serbs\\". In late 1991, during the Battle of Vukovar, ≈†e≈°elj went to Borovo Selo to meet with a Serbian Orthodox Church bishop and publicly described Croats as a genocidal and perverted people. In May and July 1992, ≈†e≈°elj visited the Vojvodina village of Hrtkovci and publicly started the campaign of persecution of local ethnic Croats. 16,000 Croats were killed during the Yugoslav Wars, 43.4 percent of whom were civilians. largely through massacres and bombings that occurred during the war. The total number of expelled Croats and other non-Serbs during the Croatian War of Independence ranges from 170,000 (ICTY), 250,000 (Human Rights Watch) or 500,000 (UNHCR). Croatian Serbs forces together with Yugoslav People's Army and Serbian nationalist paramilitaries committed numerous war crimes against Croat civilians. According to the Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps, a total of 8,000 Croatian civilians and Prisoners of war (a large number after the fall of Vukovar) went through Serb prison camps such as Sremska Mitrovica camp, Stajiƒáevo camp, Ni≈° camp and many others where many were heavily abused and tortured. A total of 300 people never returned from them. A total of 4,570 camp inmates started legal action against former Serbia and Montenegro (now Serbia) for torture and abuse in the camps.

As Spider-X was seen by many wearing Spider-Man's costume, he is initially believed to be Spider-Man himself, mutated by the Darkhold, until his own mother learned the truth and explained this to the titular group. Kornfield grew up off Broadway in New York City raised by his mother, with his father having been killed at an unknown time period. He had a very active imagination and idolized all superheroes, even writing letters to as many as he could. His mother was brutally assaulted and mugged on New York's streets. Brian was obsessed with being a superhero so he could find and take down the muggers. Brian was met by the Dwarf (an agent of the Elder God Chthon) offering him the power to be like his idol Spider-Man via a page of the Darkhold. Brian accepted the offer and was transformed into Spider-X. His obsessive desire for vengeance was twisted even further by the Darkhold's black magic and Brian saw himself as the ultimate arbitrator of justice, willing to mete out punishment that no one else would. Spider-X first brutally slew his mother's mugger. He then captured and planned to slay some other criminals, which brought him into conflict with the Ghost Rider and John Blaze when the two crashed into Spider-X's web that had been spun across the entire street. The conflict ended inconclusively when Spider-X fled from the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare; his eight eyes may have somehow diluted the Stare's force, allowing him to break hold. The occult investigators/warriors the Nightstalkers came to New York and investigated a previous letter from Kornfield, which claimed there is an occult basis to the rise in New York City's crime. Spider-X attacked the three of them when his mother was questioned. His struggles escalated, bringing in some of the Darkhold Redeemers summoned by the energy released by the use of a Darkhold page, as well as Morbius the Living Vampire and even Spider-Man himself. Still seeking to punish criminals, Spider-X continued to fight off the occult investigators/warriors and traveled to the 14th Street power station where the mutant criminal the Paralyzer was using the electrical energy for the electrical monster Zzzax's recreation. Spider-X attacked Zzzax and the group of heroes fighting him poured their own powers into the conflict which caused an energy overload, apparently both killing Spider-X and dissipating Zzzax. When Spider-X first obtained his powers, he could tap into mystical power to achieve virtually limitless variations/amplifications of Spider-Man's powers. He also possessed a high degree of resistance to injury, including mystical assaults. He could recover from most attacks in seconds. He could climb walls and adhere to virtually any surface. He could form durable, adhesive webs which exuded a powerful acid. He possesses four extra spider-like limbs, two of which grew from his upper back and two from his waist. He had razor-sharp fangs and could project bursts of destructive energy from his mouth.

She is born in Athens in October 10, 1972. Education Savvaidou studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 1995 before completing several postgraduate qualifications at the Panth√©on-Assas University in Paris. Those included a diploma in French studies (DEUF), a Master's degree in public law (DEA de Droit Public Intern), a master's degree in public finance and tax law (DEA de Finances Publiques et Fiscalite) and a PhD with the thesis title: \\"The compulsory collection of taxes in French and Greek law\\". Her PhD was completed in 2003. From 2008 to 2009 she completed a postgraduate program on \\"Comparative Tax Policy and Administration\\" at Harvard University. Academic career Savvaidou has pursued post-doctoral research into corporate taxation at the University of Athens. She has also taught at the University of Athens, the National School of Public Administration and the National School of Judges. She is currently a lecturer at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki] as well as a visiting professor at University of Macedonia. She has been awarded by European Commission Jean Monnet Chair in European Tax Policy and Administration. She has published numerous books and articles in tax policy and administration. These include the monograph entitled \\"Financial Transparency. Initiatives, Standards and Codes, Financial Management Assessment Tools, Financial Rules and Institutions, Greek Financial Reform \\", for which she has been awarded Ioannis - Ionos Tsatsaroni Prize by the Academy of Athens ]. Professional career Savvaidou has worked as an adviser to the Ministry of Finance and to the private sector over the issue of tax. Before becoming the Secretary General, she worked as a senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Savvaidou became the Secretary General of Public Revenue on 24 June 2014, succeeding Haris Theoharis, who cited personal reasons for his resignation. The role effectively made Savvaidou the top tax official in Greece as she was made head of the public revenue authority, responsible for tax collection. Controversy On 16 October 2015, the Minister of Finance, Euclid Tsakalotos, at the request of the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, asked Savvaidou to resign. This took place because an anti-corruption prosecutor, Yiannis Dragatsis, had filed charges against her and she was expected to answer questions over them on 20 October. On 20 October, Savvaidou faced allegations from anti-corruption prosecutor Yiannis Dragatsis over two separate incidents: one concerned a decision to review a fine of ‚Ç¨78 million imposed on an IT firm, whilst the second involved the extension of the time that television channels had to pay a special tax on advertising revenue. In a statement released on the same day, Savvaidou rebuffed both of the charges, claiming that neither of the charges leveled against her resulted in losses for the state. On 22 October, the \\"cabinet unanimously accepted the proposal of the Finance Minister to dismiss\\" Savvaidou from her role. There were some suspicions that the move was politically motivated. In a statement issued in response to her dismissal, Savvaidou said that: \\"I refused to resign from my post, because I cannot depart at a time when my attention to duties is being questioned in such an unfounded manner and my honesty and dignity is being slighted\\". On 14 April 2016, the Athens Inquiry Council, by its opinion (1338/2016), ruled that the first charge against Savvaidou was unfounded and ruled that no charges should be brought against her for her TV ad tax extension of payment. The Council considered that the decision did not harm the State. The Athens Appeals Council's vote became irrevocable as the appeal was dismissed. Indeed, according to the Appeals Chamber, she was wrongly prosecuted without any prior investigation and consequently her direct referral to the Athens Trial Chamber hearing, which was the reason for her dismissal before the expiry of her term was illegal. On July 6, 2017 Savvaidou was also acquitted of the second charge of attempted infidelity related to the decision to reaudit three companies by unanimous vote of the Athens Court of Appeals (1120/2017). On July 26, 2017, the Attorney of the Supreme Court of Appeal Xeni Demetriou appealed against the dismissal of the Athens Council of Appeals, finding that it had no full reason. However, there were spikes for the purposefullness of this Supreme Court decision. Finally, on August 10, 2018, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court decided (1292/2018) to reject the appeal of the Supreme Court of Appeal, as the reasons presented to it by Xeni Dimitriou were thus unfounded so the decision by the Athens Appeals Council became irrevocable.

It was situated in the municipalities of Wauwil and Egolzwil in the Canton of Lucerne (Luzern). Established in 1940, Wauwilermoos was a penal camp for internees, including Allied soldiers, among them members of the United States Army Air Forces, who were sentenced for attempting to escape from other Swiss camps for interned soldiers, or other offences. Together with H√ºnenberg and Les Diablerets, Wauwilermoos was one of three Swiss penal camps for internees that were established in Switzerland during World War II. The intolerable conditions were later described by numerous former inmates and by various contemporary reports and studies. Aerial photograph of the Wauwilermoos camp area in mid-1944 Wauwilermoos camp in late 1944  History  Established in 1940, Wauwilermoos was a penal camp for internees, particularly for Allied soldiers during World War II. Unlike civilians, for instance Jewish refugees, who were usually sent back to the territories occupied by the Nazi regime, the Swiss government was required by the Geneva Convention of 1929 to keep these soldiers interned until the end of hostilities. The soldiers were held in barracks, and they were used as workers for agriculture and industry, except for officers who were not compelled to work and stayed in unoccupied mountain hotels, mainly in Davos. Among the Swiss prisoners were members of the United States Army Air Forces, who were sentenced for attempting to escape from other Swiss camps for interned soldiers, or other offences. The internment prison camp was one of three Swiss penal camps for internees that were established in Switzerland during World War II. In Wauwilermoos prison camp both military internees and male civilian internees who had been convicted under the Swiss Military Criminal Code were detained. Wauwilermoos housed military internees of various nations, including England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Russia, Yugoslavia, and the USA. Swiss military-run prisons like Wauwilermoos were established earlier in the war, after cantonal prisons became \\"overcrowded with prisoners convicted in military court.\\" According to a decree of the Swiss Federal Council in 1941, military prisoners would be confined according to whether their offences qualified them for \\"custodia honesta,\\" or honourable confinement. Special military-run prisons would offer confinement for \\"certain offenses of purely military character\\" since honourable crimes such as \\"escape and escape attempts... [were] usually not the crimes of common criminals\\".Colonel A. Rilliet, Rapport No. 4, dated 16 May 1944, International Committee of the Red Cross Archives, Geneva, Switzerland, Record Group B/G2, Intern√©s en Suisse. In: Dwight S. Mears: Interned or Imprisoned?Federal Council decree of 12 May 1941 \\"Vierter Bericht des Bundesrates an die Bundesversammlung √ºber die auf Grund der ausserordentlichen Vollmachten ergriffenen Massnahmen vom 21.

Regardless of the intent of the Federal Council, for most of 1944 the Swiss authorities did not follow the custodia honesta model, but rather \\"grouped American internees with common criminals in Wauwilermoos\\". From July 1941 to September 1945 Wauwilermoos was under the command of Swiss Army captain Andre B√©guin. D√ºbendorf airfield The harsh detention conditions were later described by numerous former inmates and by various contemporary reports and studies. For instance, the American airman Sergeant Daniel L. Culler was one of the first USAAF airmen sent to Wauwilermoos, in June 1944. On 12May of that year Culler, the B-24's tail gunner, Howard Melson, and the British soldier Matthew Thirlaway had slipped away from Adelboden, where they were interned. They hoped to escape via Z√ºrich and Bellinzona to Italy, rejoining the Allies near Rome. After three days in the Ticino mountains Culler became ill, and he decided to go back to the Adelboden camp. Culler was condemned, still ill, and placed on rations of bread and water for ten days in Frutigen. When he returned to Adelboden he was sent to Wauwilermoos without any explanation; later he was informed that a judge had deemed his punishment as too light. Culler's good clothes were confiscated by B√©guin in return for \\"old dirty rags.\\" Sent to barracks 9, Culler was repeatedly raped by internees from Eastern Europe. He reported this to camp commandant B√©guin and some of the guards who laughed and sent him back. The next days they even closed Culler's barrack at night. The torture did not end until new internees became Culler's roommates: \\"I was bleeding everywhere\\", Culler said later. Culler fell seriously ill and was transferred to hospital. B√©guin, who has been labelled \\"a disgrace to Switzerland\\", was appointed at his own request as the commander of the camp. The sanitary facilities were dysfunctional, and B√©guin stole the food packages and harassed the Allied internees. \\"He was a Nazi, not only a Nazi sympathizer\\" Robert Cardenas told CBS 8 News in a 2013 interview. Cardenas, a retired US Air Force brigadier general, was a captain in the 44th Bomb Group interned in Switzerland in 1944. While Cardenas was not himself sent to Wauwilermoos, he did visit it and witnessed the camp's abysmal conditions firsthand. In his recollection: Between 149 and 161 Americans who were caught attempting to escape in 1944 were sent to Wauwilermoos, \\"where their confinement would eventually test the limits of international law.\\" The American internees remained in Wauwilermoos until November 1944, when the US State Department lodged protests against the Swiss government and secured their release.Dwight S. Mears, \\"The Catch-22 Effect: The Lasting Stigma of Wartime Cowardice in the U.S. Army Air Forces\\", The Journal of Military History 77 (July 2013): 1037‚Äì43. The agreement did not impact all nationalities, as Soviet internees were still at the Wauwilermoos camp in July 1945. Starting in 1943 Switzerland attempted to shoot down American and British aircraft, mainly bombers, overflying Switzerland. Six aircraft were downed by Swiss Air Force fighters and nine by anti-aircraft cannons; 36 airmen were killed. In addition there were 137 emergency landings during the war. Officers were interned in Davos, enlisted men in Adelboden. The representative of the US military in Bern, military attach√© Barnwell R. Legge, instructed the soldiers not to flee so as to allow the US Legation to co-ordinate their escape attempts, but the majority of the soldiers thought it was a diplomatic ruse or did not receive the instruction directly. Soldiers who were caught after their escape from the internment camps were often detained in the Wauwilermoos prison camp near Luzern. On 1October 1944 Switzerland housed 39,670 internees in all: 20,650 from Italy, 10,082 from Poland, 2,643 from the United States, 1,121 from the United Kingdom (including five Australians), 822 from the Soviet Union, and 245 from France. In September the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was commissioned by the US Supreme Command to organise the escapes of 1,000 American internees, but this did not happen until late in the winter of 1944‚Äì45. pp. 189‚Äì242.  Location  Wauwilermoos moorland The site was located on the former Wauwilersee lake in the municipalities of Egolzwil, Wauwil and Sch√∂tz in the Canton of Luzern in Switzerland. Peat at the former Wauwilersee lake had been mined since 1820, and the area was drained in the mid-19th century. Due to the fact that the camp was built on a former lake, the internees often sank to their ankles in mud.  Buildings and organisation  Entrance area guarded by two Swiss Army soldiers The camp was under the supervision of the Swiss Army. From the beginning, Wauwilermoos had a bad reputation. The camp was guarded day and night by soldiers with dogs. In all 47 men formed the guard as of 13February 1945. The camp was additionally secured by several rows of barbed wire. Within the camp sector \\"Santenberg\\" was considered a military prison, sector \\"Egolzwil\\" housed alcoholics, while the department for \\"difficult elements\\" and for repeat offenders was in the sector \\"Wauwilermoos\\". In Wauwilermoos prison camp there were both military internees and male civilian internees who had been convicted under the Swiss Military Criminal Code. Bird's eye view animated map, from Notlandung documentary On the site a total of 25 barracks were situated: eleven barracks with a capacity of about 550 inmates; the remaining 14 barracks were used by the Swiss camp staff. The prisoner barracks could each accommodate up to 50 people and were built from wood; they were neither insulated nor were they heated in winter. The barracks were equipped with simple beds stuffed with straw, and only officers slept on straw-filled mattresses. Sanitary facilities were basic; the latrines were simple trenches in the earth. The diet was meagre and poor. The detainees were widely lacking medical care. Even access to auxiliary packets from the Red Cross and communication by letter were denied. The officer barracks were designed for only 20 occupants, but had 86 by autumn 1944. As a result Andr√© B√©guin explained that \\"he could no longer provide amenities such as sheets and shaving mirrors for officers below the rank of captain\\". Firewood to heat the stoves was also in short supply. In response to the Americans \\"who [threatened to cut] up tables and benches to keep warm\\", B√©guin claimed surprise, and resolved that \\"if they behaved churlishly we could no longer treat them like officers\\". The commandant claimed that the allocation of firewood was greater than the quantity rationed to Swiss soldiers, a comparison used to justify many conditions around the camp. B√©guin also claimed that \\"the barracks were built according to regulations, and despite their shortcomings, were 'of the same type as those used in the Army.Memo from Captain Andre B√©guin to Swiss Federal Commissioner of Internment and Hospitalization, \\"Concerne: Les intern√©s am√©ricains et le camp p√©nitentiaire de Wauwilermoos\\", dated 22 November 1944, SFA, Box E5791, Vol. 8/24. In: Dwight S. Mears: Interned or Imprisoned? Officials at the US Legation in Switzerland disagreed with B√©guin‚Äôs \\"tempered description of conditions\\" at the penal camp. According to Brigadier General B. R. Legge, the camp was: General Legge considered them worse than those in POW camps in Nazi Germany. Prior to the escape attempts of summer 1944, only a few American internees were condemned to Wauwilermoos, usually for \\"drunkenness and disorderly conduct\\" and with the tacit approval of the US legation. Once the escapes of American POWs increased, the \\"Swiss government sent every offender to Wauwilermoos, normally for two or three months without trial\\". By autumn 1944, over 100 American internees were incarcerated in Wauwilermoos, and \\"the Swiss government threatened to keep them there without trial for six to seven months\\". Many of the American internees were eventually charged in the Swiss military justice system, \\"an experience that forever changed their perceptions of Swiss neutrality\\".  Legal premises  The majority of Americans held in Wauwilermoos in autumn 1944 were in \\"pre-trial confinement, awaiting a military tribunal by the Swiss Army for the crime of attempting escape\\". The Swiss military tribunals were convened by territorial courts (German: Divisionsgericht), operating under the Swiss Military Court Regulations of 1889 (Milit√§rstrafgerichtsordnung) and the Swiss Military Penal Code of 1927 (Milit√§rstrafgesetz Bundesgesetz vom 13. Juni 1927). The jurisdiction was established by decree of the Swiss Federal Council in 1939. Presided over by a judge or chief justice, the tribunal panels consisted of six officers and non- commissioned officers under a judge. The Federal Council selected the judges and panel members for three-year terms. They retained their regular military positions while serving the court. The military court regulations specified that the chairmen must \\"hold at least a major degree\\", but the judges were not required to be trained in law, despite their position as \\"chairman of the court\\". Also a prosecutor, defence attorney, court clerk, and in the case of foreign defendants, a translator, were present at the tribunals. The authority to try military internees under the Military Penal Code (MPC) meant that \\"the intent to apply internal Swiss law to internees predated World War II\\". Internees on trial for escaping normally faced charges of \\"disregard of regulations\\", an MPC article that allowed punishment of up to six months of imprisonment in times of war. However, the MPC did not specify a minimum sentence and even permitted disciplinary punishment in \\"mild cases\\". \\"This subjectivity gave military tribunals wide latitude to treat escape attempts as minor infractions, or instead to classify them as criminal felonies\\". Once a tribunal convened, the burden of proof was normally substantiated by escape reports from the internment camp commanders, arrest reports from police, and interrogations carried out by an official investigator. This preliminary investigation was a laborious process and did not facilitate the swift execution of justice. The Swiss military justice system was overwhelmed by the rash of escape attempts in the summer of 1944. For the minority of indicted internees who eventually received verdicts the average sentence was 74 days in prison, but the average time to complete the investigations and military tribunals was 82 days.Steiner, Die Internierung von Armeeangeh√∂rigen kriegf√ºhrender, 66.

Dale Ellington, a gunner on a B-17 bomber based in England, was shot at by German anti-aircraft fire in April 1944. The aeroplane was shot at again by Swiss fighters and anti-aircraft batteries after crossing the Swiss border and then landed at D√ºbendorf airfield. Initially interned in Adelboden, Ellington remained there until September when the American forces were approaching the France‚ÄìSwitzerland border. On 17 September 1944 Ellington slipped out by using his passable German to purchase train tickets for himself and three other internees. Dressed in civilian clothes, the group travelled unaccosted to a city near the French border where they were arrested by an observant Swiss soldier. They were first confined in the Basel city jail for three days and then transferred to Wauwilermoos where Ellington recalled \\"barbed wire, straw bunks, and guard dogs\\". After nearly a month in Wauwilermoos, Ellington and his companions were transported to Bern to appear at the Swiss military tribunal. Each defendant was given a copy of the poorly translated charges, and had \\"methodically listed the identities of the defendants, the charges against them, a catalog of evidence, and the names of their tribunal jurors\\", in fact the only trial record they received. The tribunal panel consisted of three Swiss officers, of which the highest ranking were two captains, and three enlisted soldiers. During the interrogation, a Swiss captain asked why they had travelled so far from their camp at Adelboden, and in response, \\"one of the airmen defiantly informed the juror that ‚Äòwe were chasing butterflies‚Äô‚Äù. According to Ellington, the response to this lack of candour was: \\"You have served thirty days at the detention camp and you will now return there and serve forty five more!\\" Ellington was returned to Wauwilermoos until 1December. The verdict of the tribunal was not delivered for another 20 days, by a slightly altered panel on which one of the Swiss captains had been replaced by another officer of the same rank. The verdict was 75 days confinement for each of the four defendants, with 45 days deducted for pre-trial confinement. In addition, they were each fined their pro-rated share of the trial cost of 17.5 Swiss francs. Ellington was unaware that the tribunal continued after his departure, and was never informed of the actual verdict. This \\"demonstrates that internees had difficulty comprehending their experience with Swiss military justice due to both language and cultural differences, and the fact that they were effectively serving their sentences in advance of the tribunal verdicts\\".Dale C. Ellington, Memoirs of Internment: ‚ÄúInternee-Escapee, 1944,‚Äù unpublished manuscript, 3‚Äì7, and Internment Data Card of Dale C. Ellington, SFA, Box E 5791 1988/6. In: Dwight S. Mears: Interned or Imprisoned?  Conditions, human rights violations, and inspections  Wauwilermoos barracks in late 1944 Interior of the barracks: beds of straw to the right and latrines to the left Wauwilermoos camp in winter 1944‚Äì45 Under the title \\"Das ist ein Skandal, Mit Hunden gehetzt\\" (\\"This is a scandal, rushed with dogs\\") the Swiss newspaper Berner Tagwacht reported on 7January 1944 the fate of the Soviet Russian internee Dobrolyubov in late November 1943. After a failed escape from Wauwilermoos, Dobrolyubov was condemned to the punishment cell. Because he was sick, Dobrolyubov asked to be sent to the camp's sickroom, but this was denied by B√©guin. When Dobrolyubov argued, a dog was sent in, pulling him to the ground and tearing his clothes. A guard kicked the internee lying on the ground before Dobroliubov was sent to the punishment cell. Symforian Dziedic, a Polish lieutenant, was voluntarily returned to Switzerland after fleeing to France. After a second attempt to escape at the end of 1943, he was imprisoned in Wauwilermoos again. B√©guin locked Dziedic, as described by the lieutenant, in an \\"arrest local beside the pigsty\\". Dziedic had to take off his uniform and put on rags, and was paraded through the camp. In the second half of December 1943, the then 26 Soviet Russian internees were sent, along with other detainees, to fetch wood from the forest. They were accompanied by several guards with dogs who ordered the soldiers to collect significantly more wood than normal and take it to the prison camp, from the forest. The Russian internees refused to comply with this, and a guard fired his gun into the air and set the dogs on his prisoners. For this alleged resistance, soldier Malfejw was detained for ten days in the punishment cell. In a fight among inmates of barrack 29 on 28September 1944, a 27-year-old Russian internee was shot by the guards and another wounded by two bullets. Robert Gamperl, probably a German refugee, reached Switzerland in November 1943. He and other internees in camp Lindenhof-Witzwil had refused to work. He was \\"punished with twenty days sharp arrest and transfer to the prison camp Wauwilermoos for three months‚Äù on the grounds that the detainees had wanted to force an investigation of the camp's \\"undemocratic and inhumane conditions\\". On 30April 1944 Gamperl asked the Swiss Commissariat for Internment by letter to \\"review the real reasons, a hearing by the legal officer and reprieve to the clarification of the matter\\". His letter was never forwarded from Wauwilermoos; neither were letters from Alfred Friedrich and Josef Haslinger. Jules Keller, a medical student, had deserted from the German Army. From Wauwilermoos he sent at least five requests between 23August and 2November 1944 to the Federal Commissioner for Internment. Keller asked for health reasons to spend internment near his aunts in Z√ºrich. He argued that because of a chronic gastrointestinal disease he was \\"cramped and incapacitated\\". He asked, supported by further justifications and medical certificates, to be transferred to a nursing home. His letters were never answered; similarly unanswered were three letters sent in August and September 1944 by Josef Dudkowiak, an officer of the German Air Force. Dudkowiak had deserted after four and a half years, after he had denounced his superior officer for corruption. Dudkowiak also said that he had been sent to the Wauwilermoos penal camp without any explanations. On the occasion of a lecture in front of Swiss officers B√©guin explained his \\"art of bulk handling\\" (German: Kunst der Massenbehandlung) on 26June 1944: A US military memo of 1944 mentioned the conditions in Wauwilermoos as \\"worse than in enemy prison camps\\" and confirmed the first-hand impressions. The \\"meals consisted of watered-down soups and scorched stale bread\\". The sanitary circumstances were subpar: for instance, the latrines were just trenches, very unsanitary, and to clean them the trenches were hosed down every few weeks. Reportedly, \\"lice and rats were everywhere and the men got sick with boils due to the unsanitary conditions\\". They \\"also lost weight, mostly about 40 pounds\\". B√©guin castigated American internees by \\"subjecting them to cruel punishments and solitary confinements for minor infractions\\". The soldiers also were \\"imprisoned a total of 7 months\\"; the Hague Convention allowed only 30 days confinement. In addition, the internees did not know the length of their sentences. 2nd Lt. Paul Gambaiana was another USAAF airman sent to the camp. Just before D-Day his aircraft went down. In a telephone interview from his home in Iowa in 2013 Gambaiana said: James Misuraca spoke about the compound of single-storey buildings surrounded by barbed wire, the armed Swiss guards with dogs, and the commandant, \\"a hater of Americans, a martinet who seemed quite pleased with our predicament\\". Arriving on 10October 1944, Misuraca and two other US officers made an escape on 1November. They had \\"timed the rounds of the guards, climbed out a window and over wire fences and walked for miles\\". A US Legation officer then drove them to Gen√®ve at the border to France, and on 15November they reached the Allied lines. Most of the Wauwilermoos prisoners had never shared their stories until Mears's grandson contacted them. In early December 1944 USAAF First Lieutenant Wally Northfelt was nearing his second month of imprisonment at Wauwilermoos. Northfelt attempted to escape from Switzerland near Geneva in September 1944, but he was apprehended by border guards and confined at Wauwilermoos. After his arrival at the punishment camp, Northfelt quickly tired of the \\"meager rations of coffee, bread, and thin soup\\" which he blamed in part for his weight loss of forty pounds during his time in Switzerland. Northfelt said that \\"he was only able to get enough food to survive by purchasing it off the black market\\". Northfelt was also ill; sleeping on dirty straw had caused sores all over his body, and he had problems with his prostate gland. Medical care was given by a doctor, Northfelt said, who \\"specialized in women‚Äôs cases\\". Northfelt said B√©guin was a \\"pro-Nazi\\" who \\"only cleaned up the camp when inspections by high ranking officers or American dignitaries were announced\\".Deposition of 1st Lt. Wallace O. Northfelt for the War Crimes Office, Judge Advocate General‚Äôs Department, War Department, dated 17 September 1945, NARA, RG 153, E279, File 23-6. In: Dwight S. Mears: Interned or Imprisoned? On 3November 1944 the US embassy was informed of conditions by three American soldiers who had escaped from Wauwilermoos. Delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who visited Wauwilermoos \\"failed to notice much amiss\\", and ICRC member Fr√©d√©ric Hefty wrote: \\"If iron discipline is the norm, there is also a certain sense of justice and understanding that helps with the re-education and improvement of the difficult elements sent there\\". The reports contained statements from internees that the camp was \\"a relaxing place that they would happily return to\\". However, \\"the internees provided their statements in return for favours from B√©guin\\". The conditions in the camp were not reported correctly. \\"Switzerland‚Äôs wartime general, Henri Guisan, demanded that all Red Cross reports about the internment camps be submitted to army censors first if delegates wanted access\\" notes historian Dwight S. Mears. The American military attach√© in Bern warned Marcel Pilet-Golaz, Swiss foreign minister in 1944, that \\"the mistreatment inflicted on US aviators could lead to 'navigation errors' during bombing raids over Germany\\". The ICRC inspected the camp on several occasions, headed by Swiss Army Colonel Auguste Rilliet. The inspection team simply noted that sanitary conditions could be improved, and that prisoners were not aware of the length of their sentences or why they were in the camp in the first place. Immediately prior to the removal of the commandant in September 1945 Rilliet rated the camp conditions unsatisfactory. Wauwilermoos was the subject of official protests by the United States, Great Britain, Poland, and Italy, as well as a barrier to the normalisation of diplomatic relations with the USSR. Numerous Swiss citizens reported that the conditions at Wauwilermoos were in violation of the 1929 Geneva Conventions, including a Swiss Army medical officer, an officer on the Swiss Army's General Staff, and the editors of two Swiss newspapers. Starting in 1942 on-site inspections had been carried out by the Swiss officials. For instance Major Humbert, army doctor (Milit√§rarzt) and head physician in the Seeland district of the Swiss Federal Commissioner of Internment and Hospitalization (FCIH), menitioned in three reports in January and February 1942, the \\"enormous morbidity\\" in the penal camp: \\"The moral atmosphere in the camp is absolutely untenable\\". Major Humbert also noted the despotic punishment catalogue and psychological deficits of the commandant of the prison camp, Captain Andr√© B√©guin. His complaints resulted in no action by the authorities, and in February 1942 Humbert was dismissed. In the same year an investigation of B√©guin was conducted because of possible espionage in favour of Nazi Germany. Although Colonel Robert Jaquillard, chief of the counterintelligence service of the army, spoke against the retention of Captain B√©guin as commander of the camp, his report came to the chief of the legal department of the Swiss federal internment department, Major Florian Imer. After an inspection of the camp, Imer noted that \\"in particular the allegations of Major Humbert were exaggerated for the most part\\". Another report in January 1943 noted the camp's poor sanitary condition. At the end of 1944, Ruggero Dollfus, interim Swiss Federal commissioner for internment (Internierungskommiss√§r), complained again about the poor sanitation. Among others Dollfus noted that the Red Cross auxiliary packets were confiscated by B√©guin, and nearly 500 letters from and to the airmen had been withheld by the commandant. B√©guin, was suspended and banned from entering the camp effective 5September 1945. On 24September he was taken into custody. On 20February 1946, a military court sentenced B√©guin to three and a half years in prison.  Andr√© B√©guin  B√©guin with Swiss Army officers Captain Andr√© B√©guin was a member of the National Union. He had previously lived in Munich, Germany. \\"He was known to wear the Nazi uniform and to sign his correspondence with 'Heil Hitler. He was investigated by the Swiss counter-intelligence service for his pro-Nazi political views. Nevertheless, he was retained in command at Wauwilermoos. While in command B√©guin \\"publicly berated Americans, sentenced them to solitary confinement, and denied them Red Cross parcels and mail\\". Despite his tarnished record, in 1940 B√©guin obtained work as a civilian employee of the Swiss Federal Commissioner of Internment and Hospitalization (FCIH) There he translated artillery manuals, which led to his second commission in the Swiss Army as an orderly officer. In July 1941 B√©guin was appointed commandant of the Wauwilermoos penal camp, where he had no sympathy for the prisoners under his charge, particularly Americans. As his correspondence revealed he found \\"American internees to be undisciplined and ungrateful\\", claiming that they were \\"too spoiled by their stay in hotels in the mountains and do not understand purely military treatment\\". B√©guin also scorned the American airmen because of their common background, saying that: In B√©guin's view there was an absence of \\"elementary courtesy and politeness... as painful for us as it is for them\\".Letter from Andre B√©guin to Captain Baumgartner, Magistrate Ter.Ger. 2B, dated 25 Jan 1944, SFA, Box E5791, Vol. 1000/949, 687, and \\"Der Fall des Hptm.

Mears: Interned or Imprisoned?Peter Kamber, Sch√ºsse auf die Befreier: Die \\"Luftguerilla\\" der Schweiz gegen die Alliierten 1943‚Äì45. Rotpunktverlag Z√ºrich 1993, p. 200. In: Dwight S. Mears: Interned or Imprisoned? Captain B√©guin was suspended and banned from the camp on 5 September 1945, because he had apparently burned files in the camp on 3September 1945. On 24September he was arrested and taken into custody. On 20February 1946, the Divisionsgericht Z√ºrich military court sentenced him to prison for 42 months, and he lost his civil rights. In its decision the Swiss military court (Divisionsgericht) described B√©guin as a \\"crook, embezzler, con-man and inhuman\\". He was convicted of dishonoring Switzerland and its army, administrative misdemeanors, embezzlement, and abuse of authority. The US War Crimes Office also collected \\"multiple war crimes accusations\\" against B√©guin, but the Allied authorities never attempted to prosecute the commander of the Wauwilermoos camp \\"due to lack of jurisdiction\\".  Aftermath  Under pressure from the United States, in late 1944 Switzerland improved the conditions for American internees. Although B√©guin was sentenced for misconduct, he was never charged for his actions as commandant of the penal camp from spring 1941 to September 1945. The responsible Swiss authorities were also never accused. Only in 1949 did internees receive the same rights as prisoners of war. Then President of the Swiss Confederation Kaspar Villiger expressed his \\"deepest regrets\\", and said that the camp commander had lacked \\"subtle leadership qualities\\", while offering his apologies on the occasion of an official visit by Dan Culler in 1995. For 70 years there was no memorial to the horrors of the prison camp until a plaque was installed in late 2015. US Army Major Dwight Mears's grandfather, Lt. George Mears, was also held at the Wauwilermoos prison in 1944. Major Mears was injured in a helicopter crash during a security mission in Iraq in 2003. While still at West Point, a history class motivated him to conduct first-person historical research. He sought out his grandfather's surviving crew members, researched the story of his grandfather, and photographed approximately 30,000 documents from archives in Bern, Berlin and Washington D.C. Major Mears fought diligently for 15 years to get the Wauwilermoos airmen recognised as POWs. Major Mears published his work in 2012 in a PhD thesis on the American internees in Switzerland. US Prisoner of War Medal According to Mears, when the POW Medal was created in 1985: Mears said in an interview to the Air Force Times in November 2013 that his efforts had gained the support of Ann Petersen, former Air Force general counsel, as well as Eric Fanning, acting Secretary, and General Mark Welsh III. The fiscal 2013 National Defense Authorization Act included an amendment allowing the award of the POW Medal to \\"any service member held captive under conditions 'comparable to those circumstances under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict'\\". General Mark A. Welsh III hosted an office call for the eight Army Air Corps members before presenting them with the Prisoner of War Medal during a ceremony at the Pentagon on 30April 2014. The Pentagon awarded 143 posthumous POW Medals to World War II veterans who were held in the Wauwilermoos punishment camp: On 30April 2014 eight survivors of the camp were awarded the Prisoner of War Medal, \\"thus being recognized for the suffering they endured during their imprisonment... the first time that the medal was granted to soldiers that were held prisoners in a friendly country\\". General Mark A. Welsh III, the 20th Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, hosted an office call for the eight Army Air Corps members before presenting them with the Prisoner of War medal during a ceremony at the Pentagon. The eight aviators who received the medal were: Sgt. William G. Blackburn, Tech. Sgt. Alva H. Moss, 1st Lt. Paul J. Gambaiana, retired Lt. Col. James I. Misuraca, retired Maj. James V. Moran, 1st Lt. James F. Mahon, Staff Sgt. John G. Fox and Sgt. George E. Thursby. \\"They served each other and our country proudly,\\" the Chief of Staff said, \\"They saved a world and they inspired a nation.\\"  Wauwilermoos penal camp in film and television  The 1993 Swiss documentary Helden vom Himmel first mentioned that dark chapter of Swiss history. On 27October 2015 the Swiss television channel Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF broadcast Wauwilermoos: Kriegsgefangene im Luzerner Mittelland. One day later it broadcast the Swiss documentary film Erzwungene Landung, or Notlandung, (Forced Landing) by Daniel Wyss. The fates of the internees in Wauwilermoos are widely unknown to the public. In publications on Swiss history the internment in Wauwilermoos has not been explored in depth. In reports Wauwilermoos is rarely mentioned, and Swiss politics has hardly taken notice, except to the 1944 interpellation from M. Brawand, and the reports by two Swiss newspapers in 1944 and 1946. Daniel Wyss, the documentary director, contacted Major Dwight Mears, participated in the ceremony in April 2014 in Washington D.C., and met the eight survivors of the camp.  Strafanstalt Wauwilermoos  From September 1945 Swiss prisoners were housed in the barracks. Since 1947 Wauwilermoos has been the site of a prison that was rebuilt in the early 1980s as a semi-open institution. The Wauwilermoos penitentiary (German: Strafanstalt Wauwilermoos) also serves as a deportation centre.

It lies in the center of the town, in front of Santander Park and close to the city hall. It is considered to be the historic and cultural heart of the city. The cathedral is the headquarters of the Bishop of C√∫cuta, and became the main church of the Diocese of C√∫cuta on May 29, 1959, when it was consecrated by Pope Pio XII. It is predominantly of pure Romanesque style, with an imposing facade of stone veneer. History Not much is known about its construction. The foundation stone was laid on 12 May 1889, and the building commemorates the creation of the parish in 1734. The church was destroyed by the 1875 C√∫cuta earthquake. The restoration of the temple was demanded by the community of Cucuta, but due to economic difficulties and the rising conflict by the two principal parties in Colombia, its reconstruction was delayed by several years. It was only in 1905 that the recently elected priest Demetrio Mendoza decided to begin construction of the new temple.http://www.cec.org.co/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=122:diocesis- de-cucuta&catid;=28:diocesis&Itemid;=326 In 1956 it was given the category of Cathedral of Diocese.

The mark system sought to limit official discretion to the greatest extent possible and to make the release process transparent for prisoners. It was a determinate sentencing scheme in that the number of marks prisoners needed to earn, tabulated according to the seriousness of their offense, would be disclosed to them upfront. The mark system was implemented by Walter Crofton in Irish prisons and was also tried by Elmira Reformatory and other U.S. prisons. Prisoners were allowed to advance through grades as they earned marks.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 5, 2015. The building opened in 1915, served its last orphan in 1967, and was abandoned in 1982. Since being abandoned, the facility has been cited as an allegedly haunted location. Facilities At its peak, Holy Family Orphanage housed approximately 200 orphans from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and nearby areas. The building includes classrooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry facilities, kitchen facilities, and a chapel. The building is mostly constructed of brick, but does include a decorative front entrance made of South Marquette Sandstone. History Construction on Holy Family Orphanage began in 1914, and cost approximately . The building opened immediately after construction in 1915. Initially the facility accepted mostly children between second and eighth grade, but later infants and older children were accepted as well. While it was intended originally to only serve white children, some of its first residents included 60 Native American children transferred from a Catholic home named after St. Joseph in Assinins. The Native American children had been placed in the Assinins home after being taken away from their parents to accommodate their integration into white culture. Also notably, in 1963, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette decided to host a group of child refugees from Cuba as a part of Operation Pedro Pan. The orphanage provided care to hundreds of children from its opening in 1915 until its closure in 1965. The administrative offices of the complex continued operating until 1981, when they too were closed and the facility was considered abandoned. In 1998, the building was purchased by local businessman Roger Rinne. His original intention was to convert the abandoned structure into an assisted living facility, but this plan was never realized. Rinne eventually placed the property for sale at a firm minimum price of $1.6 million, despite the City of Marquette estimating its value at just over $200,000. In 2008, a purchase agreement with Rinne for the property was signed by Treasure Lampi, who reports she has plans to turn the abandoned structure into a school of performing arts. Lampi stated that renovation costs were estimated to be approximately $3 million. 2016 Renovations In August 2016, A groundbreaking ceremony for the new Grandview Apartments was held at the Altamont Street site. The building is being turned into an affordable housing complex containing 56 one- to three-bedroom units. The project is being led by developer Home Renewal Systems of Farmington Hills, with support from Community Action Alger Marquette, Marquette architect Barry Polzin, and the Wolverine Building Group. An investment of $15.8 million is supported by Low- Income Housing Tax Credits and Federal Historic Tax Credits, as well as the Marquette County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.

The engine sits just forward of the transom while the drive unit (outdrive or drive leg) lies outside the hull. Volvo Penta holds a US patent for the Forward Drive Operation The drive unit transmits power from the inboard engine, generally mounted above the waterline, outboard through the transom and downward to the propellers below the waterline. The propellers lie about 27 inches further forward than the props of a Duoprop and move from an exposed position beyond the transom to underneath the hull, away from people in the water. This causes the thrust to be multi-directional rather than bi-directional. The exhaust exits under the water. The engine can be trimmed up and down which equates to less wetted area. Characteristics The claimed advantages of forward drive propulsion include safety, versatility, fuel economy, comfort and environmental care. Two claimed benefits are the enhanced performance and powertrim. Variable trim angles provide the right thrust for leisure cruising as well as top speeds.

It has been characterized as \\"the most abundant diatom in the Antarctic Seas\\". Description Fragilariopsis kerguelensis is a unicellular, phototrophic, microalga with a range in size of 10 - 80 Œºm. It is encased in a heavily silicified cell wall, called the frustule, and is identified by its unique theca, raphe and striations, which distinguish it from other diatoms. They are native to pelagic environments of the Southern Ocean within a temperature range of -1¬∞ to 18¬∞ C. F. kerguelensis is known to form community chains that consist of 20-100 cells and can be up to 300 Œºm long. Use as a paleoceanographic proxy Fragilariopsis kerguelensis is well preserved in the fossil record and commonly referenced as a paleoceanographic or paleoclimatic proxy. F. kerguelensis comprises the largest deposit of biogenic silica in the world (~75%) despite only accounting for 20% of global production. It is an open water species and is found in its highest abundance between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Subtropical Front. This, along with its tendency to increase valve size near polar fronts, makes F. kerguelensis an ideal indicator of paleoclimate polar front or low-carbon, high-silica exporting regimes. Modern assemblages with F. kerguelensis can be used to calculate past sea surface temperature through the use of transfer functions.

It is intended to reconstruct the language of the Proto-Indo-Aryans. It is descended from Proto-Indo-Iranian and thus from Proto-Indo-European. It is a Satem language. History Proto-Indo-Aryan is meant to be the predecessor of Old Indic (1500‚Äì300 BCE) which is directly attested as Vedic and Classical Sanskrit.

One of these is the representation of Proto-Indo-European *l and *r. Vedic (as also most Iranic languages) merge both as .

The brewery is run by the monks of Andechs Abbey, a priory of St. Boniface's Abbey, a Benedictine abbey situated 40 km away in Munich. It is the only monastic brewery in Germany that brews Bock beer year- round for nationwide distribution. Every year, the brewery produces over of beer. A portion of the beer is served on-site at the abbey; the remainder is exported throughout Germany and worldwide.  History  The earliest documented reference to beer being brewed in Andechs Abbey dates to 1455. The Benedictine monks have continued the brewing tradition in the centuries since. A seven-story malt house was built on the site in 1906, and the first bottling facility was added in 1950. In 1972, the abbey decided to create a separate brewing facility at the foot of the mountain, which was completed in 1974, followed by a new brewing building in 1983. The fermentation and storage facilities were expanded in 2006, and the brewing house was renovated in 2007.  Beers  The best-known beer is the Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel, with an original extract of 18.5% (18.5¬∞ Plato or 1.076 original gravity) and over 7% Alcohol by volume. In addition, the brewery produces a Helles, Spezial Hell, Bergbock Hell, Export Dunkel, Hefeweizen, and Dunkelweizen.

The theory is meant to serve as an extension of property rights theory. Property rights theory has not received substantial theoretical or empirical attention despite its potential to explain various phenomena dealing with business transactions. Diluted property rights theory addresses this lack of progression by approaching property rights theory from the position of approximating the conditions that actually exist when rights are negotiated, exchanged, and handled. This is the same approach that Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase took when discovering and clarifying the significance of property rights. While property rights theory defines property rights and delineates how the rightful owner of such rights may use, enforce, transfer, and benefit from them, diluted property rights theory attempts to define a pervasive violation of a principal of property rights theory. Writing from a legal perspective, Coase explains how property rights should be delimited. According to Coase, such rights should go to the party that can create the most public benefit. However, property rights are often diluted and the party that can create the most public good are not always granted such rights. Diluted property rights are created when: # Rights are not well-defined # Rights are weakened due to some legal or socially accepted event # The diluting event is mediating # The diluting event has a significant and/or reprehensive impact # The diluting event interferes with the use, transfer, enforcement, or residual claim deriving from ownership of the property right The theory holds that the event need not be reoccurring to make a lasting impression. In addition, diluted property rights are not extended to incidental violation of the law that reaves a rightful owner of his rights. Diluted property rights theory is concerned with widespread weakening of rights that are dictated by policy, law, and norms. The concern is that the continued weakening of property rights will have long-lasting wide spread effects that may be disadvantageous to the world economy. This concern is valid in so much as well protected property rights have created long-lasting benefits to corporations. Prior approaches to diluted property rights Diluted property rights have often been approached as a minor topic in traditional business research. For example, in his book Internal Research & Development Markets, Eric Kasper offered two examples of how rights can be diluted: 1) the exploitation of R & D results by a business unit, and 2) the simultaneous sharing of rights by several individuals. However, in trademark law, dilution from a legal and intellectual rights perspective is well-documented. Books LesterMoney: Latest and Greatest Business Research in Layman's Terms.

Early life Awe, the ninth-youngest of eleven children, was born and raised in San Ignacio, Cayo District, Belize (then British Honduras). His childhood home was within walking distance of Maya ruins, where, as a youth, he would amuse himself by digging up ancient Maya artifacts. Courses in Anthropology that he took while a student at St. John‚Äôs College in Belize City rekindled his curiosity about the human past and inspired him to pursue a career in archaeology. Due to the limited educational opportunities available to Belizeans at the time, however, he had no choice but to go abroad in order to continue his formal study of the subject. Before leaving his Central American homeland to further his education, he held the government post of Archaeological Assistant at the Department of Archaeology (then under the Ministry of Tourism and the Environment) and served as a field assistant in excavations at the Maya archaeological sites of Cerros, Lamanai and the Sayab Mai Cenote.Awe, Jaime J.

Education  Awe majored in Anthropology at Trent University in Canada, where he was mentored by Paul Healy and received his B.A. and M.A. in 1981 and 1985, respectively. He began his doctoral studies at the State University of New York at Albany, but later transferred to the University of London, where he became the first Belizean to ever receive a Ph.D. in Archaeology in 1992. Since earning his doctorate, Awe has held faculty positions at Trent University, the University of New Hampshire, Galen University (in Belize) and Northern Arizona University, where he is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology.  Government service  Awe has held the Belizean government posts of Archaeological Assistant, Chief Archaeologist and Acting Commissioner of Archaeology at the Department of Archaeology, and Director of the Institute of Archaeology (formerly the Department of Archaeology, and now under the National Institute of Culture and History).

Fieldwork and publications  BVAR includes multi-year excavations at the Maya archaeological sites of Baking Pot, Cahal Pech, Lower Dover and Xunantunich. Awe has also directed the Western Belize Regional Cave Project (WBRCP, 1997-2008), which involved excavations at Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM) and other Maya cave sites. In addition to his work through BVAR and WBRCP, he has directed excavations at the Maya archaeological sites of Altun Ha, Caracol, Lamanai, Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. Awe has devoted an impressive amount of time and energy to his excavations at Cahal Pech, and his writings have largely focused on the Maya cities of west-central Belize during the Formative, Preclassic and Classic periods. However, he has published on topics related to the archaeology of Belize in earlier and later periods as well. In all, he has authored and co-authored over fifty academic publications, and appeared in several televised documentaries on archaeology and the ancient Maya.IMDb. (2015). IMDb: Jaime Awe, Producer.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple and directed by Stephen Williams. This episode is the second episode in the show's history to feature only one main cast member (after \\"Live Bait\\", which is centered on The Governor), and it focuses on the experiences of Morgan Jones (Lennie James) between the episodes \\"Clear\\" (season 3) and \\"No Sanctuary\\" (season 5). Plot After the Wolves' attack on Alexandria is repelled, Morgan secretly imprisons the Wolf he had captured in the unfinished ground floor of an unoccupied Alexandria townhouse. In an effort to redeem the Wolf by convincing him to renounce his violent ways, Morgan decides to tell him about his past. Flashbacks show Morgan's life some time after Rick's brief reunion with him. Morgan exhibits deranged and obsessive behaviour and accidentally burns his house down when he knocks over a lamp. Morgan then camps out in the forest where he lives with his illness and kills any walkers or humans that intrude upon his marked territory, including a father and son who cross his path. While further exploring the forest, Morgan follows the bleating of a goat, named Tabitha, and finds the remote cabin of Eastman who calls out to him, offering to talk and feed him despite Morgan's attempts to shoot him, eventually knocking Morgan out with a b≈ç stick. Morgan awakens in a cell in the cabin, behind bars, and orders Eastman to kill him. Eastman instead feeds Morgan and gives him a tract, The Art of Peace. Eastman goes about his peaceful life, taking care of Tabitha and trying to make cheese. After giving Morgan a while to adjust, Eastman explains that he was a forensic psychiatrist employed by Georgia to evaluate convicts prior to release. Though Morgan admits to be an unrepentant killer who lives only to \\"clear\\" areas of walkers and the living, Eastman sees that Morgan has PTSD over the loss of his family. He also reveals that the cell was never locked and Morgan is free to go. Morgan attempts to attack Eastman who proves capable of reading intent and defending himself with aikido. Beaten, Morgan returns to his cell. Eastman begins talking about taking a trip, though he has no specific destination in mind, and leaves to scavenge supplies. Morgan leaves the cell to rescue Tabitha from attack by a pair of walkers and discovers a graveyard where Eastman has buried at least two dozen bodies. Eastman thanks Morgan on his return, they repair the damage together, and Eastman gives Morgan a b≈ç stick and begins teaching him aikido. Eastman begins recounting more of his personal life to Morgan, and how his job had him suffering emotional distress over working in close proximity with violent offenders. Practicing aikido helped him, and he came to see that all life is precious. Morgan later recounts how he lost his wife and son to walkers. Eastman tells of the one true psychopath he'd met, Crighton Dallas Wilton, who attacked him during an interview and later escaped to kill Eastman's wife, son, and daughter. Eastman reveals he had the cell built to hold Wilton, but evades whether he actually did it, repeating that he believes all life is precious. To gather supplies for their trip, Morgan takes Eastman to his camp. The setting brings back old feelings and behavioral patterns, and Morgan freezes when the walker of the young man he'd strangled comes at him. Eastman saves Morgan but is bitten, and Morgan lashes out at Eastman, wanting to die again. Eastman subdues Morgan, and the two part ways. Morgan regresses and resumes patrolling his territory, killing a walker and inadvertently saving a couple who reward him with a large can of soup and an ammunition cartridge. Morgan takes up the b≈ç staff, recognizing that Eastman's way is better, and returns to the cabin only to find a walker feasting on Tabitha. Morgan kills the walker and takes its body and Tabitha's to the graveyard where he finds Eastman succumbing to the bite. Morgan spots a grave marker with Wilton's name and Eastman confesses to kidnapping Wilton and starving him to death over 47 days, over which Eastman lost himself, and when he went to Atlanta to turn himself in he found that society had collapsed. Eastman bequeaths all he has to Morgan, including a rabbit's foot his daughter gave him, but advises Morgan to find more people and live. After burying Eastman and Tabitha, Morgan begins searching and finds a sign that leads to Terminus. In the present, Morgan finishes his story. The Wolf prisoner reveals that he has a gut wound and probably doesn't have time to change, though he doesn't really want to, and isn't repentant about following his code to kill everyone in Alexandria. Morgan locks the door as he exits the townhome. In the street, Morgan hears Rick screaming to open the gate. Production Lennie James who portrays Morgan Jones was praised by critics for his performance in this episode. Showrunner and executive producer Scott M. Gimple wrote the episode in July 2015, during San Diego Comic-Con, and said about \\"Here's Not Here\\": \\"Working on that episode was one of the great pleasures of the season for me.\\" The episode was Stephen Williams' first directing credit for the series. Out of 17 credited series regulars, only Lennie James appears. Andrew Lincoln's voice is briefly included at the end, and the episode features a guest appearance by John Carroll Lynch. Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn, is removed from the opening credits with this episode; commentators speculated whether this was done intentionally to further indicate Glenn's fate (dead or alive). Despite airing as the fourth episode of the season, this was actually the ninth episode filmed. The episode was also the second expanded 90-minute (with commercials) episode this season, after the season premiere. Reception =Critical reception= Upon airing, the episode received widespread critical acclaim, earning a 93% rating with an average score of 8.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus that \\"'Here's Not Here' is a stand-out installment of The Walking Dead, using Morgan's backstory as a powerful reminder of what it means to be human.\\" Particular praise was given for the performances of Lennie James as Morgan Jones and John Carroll Lynch as Eastman. Jonathon Dornbush of Entertainment Weekly notes that during the episode, \\"The Walking Dead becomes a two-man play that succeeds or fails based on the performances of Lennie James and guest star John Carroll Lynch...And wow, does it succeed.\\" For his role as Eastman, Lynch was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role on Television. =Ratings= The episode averaged a 6.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 13.339 million viewers overall, a rise from the previous episode, which averaged a 6.7 rating and 13.143 million.

He is best known for his work as the chief ceramics decorator at Rookwood Pottery, and for his watercolor paintings of botanical subjects. In 1908, he accepted a commission from philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps to illustrate the botanical diversity of California. Over the next ten years, he produced approximately 1200 watercolor \\"plant portraits\\" of native California wildflowers, grasses, ferns, and trees.  Biography  Valentien was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on 11 May 1862, to Anna Marie Wolter and Frederick Valentine. He studied art at the School of Design of the University of Cincinnati (later the Art Academy of Cincinnati), working with Thomas S. Noble and Frank Duveneck. With fellow student John Rettig, Valentien studied decoration of china, learning underglazed pottery decoration from T(homas) J. Wheatley.

It has also represented three distinct stages in the history of the British \\"Pacific\\" steam locomotives designed by Nigel Gresley. For the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a constituent company of the London and North Eastern Railway before the amalgamation of 1923, for which they became a standard design. Eventually Great Northern was completely rebuilt as Class A1/1. History Great Northern is historically significant because it was the first Pacific to be built by the Great Northern Railway as a prototype of the new '1470 class'. It was also the only original A1 to not be rebuilt by the LNER as an A3. However it was still renumbered by replacing the first two numerals to '44' making the number 4470. The locomotive was named Great Northern in honour of the GNR (Great Northern Railway). Just after WWII, Great Northern was completely rebuilt by Edward Thompson as his A1/1. Liveries As built, Great Northern was painted in GNR apple green with brown framing. In October 1923, it was repainted into LNER lined apple green with black framing. This livery had two variations, one with 'LNER 1470N' on the tender, and the other variant had only \\"LNER\\" on the tender and 4470 on the cab sides. Finally, in February 1942, it was repainted plain black, lettered \\"LNER\\". In July 1942, the LNER started using the simplified lettering \\"NE\\" on black locomotives, and 4470 may have been so treated after that date. The locomotive originally bore its number 1470 on the cab side. When first repainted into LNER livery, the number was altered to 1470N, which was placed on the tender, below the letters \\"LNER\\". In March 1925, it was renumbered 4470, and at some point after May 1928, the number was moved back to the cab sides. Rebuild Great Northern was rebuilt once in its career, by the LNER to the design of Edward Thompson to become his A1/1. Models Hornby released a OO gauge model of Great Northern as built in early LNER style apple green livery with black framework, and original tender with \\"LNER 1470N\\" written on both sides. L.H Loveless & Co also released an O gauge model of Great Northern in its original GNR Apple Green Livery with a brown chassis and framework.

O'Day moving along the Yal√≠‚ÄìCondega trail was ambushed by a force of Sandinista rebels led by Miguel Angel Ortez. The Sandinistas opened fire from all along the mule train's right flank at 1:30 PM, while some other rebels managed to seal off \\"the trail to the front and rear of the convoy.\\" These Nicaraguan insurrectionists were estimated to be \\"at least\\" 600 rifles strong, armed with \\"a minimum\\" of four machine guns and \\"a large quantity\\" of dynamite bombs.

At 8:30, the firing from the Sandinistas decreased as the insurgents began to withdraw, although about 200 of them remained to continue harassing the Marines. Some of the guerrillas spoke \\"irregular English\\" and taunted the Americans with \\"slurs and insults\\" during lulls in the fighting. At dawn of the following day, of the 28 February, a force of 88 Marines led by Captain William K.

All in all, the Marines suffered three killed, two died from wounds, and eight non-fatally wounded (in addition, four of their \\"muleros\\" were wounded). One-third of their mules were killed, wounded, or captured. Sandinista losses for February 28 were about 10 killed and 30 wounded (this was MacNulty's \\"conservative estimate\\").

Together they continued to create buildings using innovative new materials, for example using lightweight fabric for the Mound Stand at Lord's Cricket Ground (1987). In 1994 Patty and Michael Hopkins were jointly awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, with the medal citation saying \\"What best characterises the work of Michael and Patricia Hopkins is an equal appeal to ordinary people and to architects.\\" Patty Hopkins had a major role in the new Glyndebourne Opera House project, completed the same year. She became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) in 1996 and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1997. She gave the keynote speech to the Women in Architecture luncheon at the Langham Hotel in 2014. On her work as a woman architect Hopkins said in 2011 \\"When I was younger, older men would be rather patronising. You still find certain clients uncomfortable with women architects, but I can't say it exercises me. I'm not a feminist. I'm an architect, trying to concentrate on my work.\\"  2014 incident  In 2014 the BBC was criticized when it allegedly removed Patty Hopkins from a photograph used as an illustration in the third programme of the BBC's series The Brits Who Built the Modern World. The series focused on the five male architects, Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Nicholas Grimshaw, Terry Farrell and Michael Hopkins, her husband. The criticism focused on the fact that Hopkins was a full partner in the Hopkins firm alongside her husband. The BBC were accused of ignoring women architects, though the BBC responded by saying they had met with Patty Hopkins to agree on her level of involvement. The photo had been edited by the photographer. All six architects were the subject of the associated RIBA exhibition, also called The Brits Who Built the Modern World.

Adolph's mother was Henrietta Bondij. In 1843, his family converted to Christianity through the Jewish mission of the Free Church of Scotland. In the autumn of 1843 his father sent him to train as a Christian minister for the Free Church of Scotland at New College, Edinburgh. This proved impractical due to his age and lack of English. He attended a Gymnasium in Berlin from 1844 to 1848 much improving his English. From 1848 he studied at Glasgow University graduating MA in 1854. Saphir travelled to Edinburgh with Rabbi Duncan and Alfred Edersheim. He then studied at the Marischal College, Aberdeen. In 1854, Saphir was appointed a missionary to the Jews. He worked briefly in Hamburg before moving to England where he served in South Shields, at St Mark's in Greenwich's South Street, and Notting Hill. Saphir became a minister of the Presbyterian Church of England, and received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the University of Glasgow in 1878. He died of Angina pectoris on 3 April 1891.

As Pablo Escobar's cousin and right-hand man, Gaviria controlled the Medell√≠n cartel's finances and trade routes. He and Escobar had collaborated in their criminal careers since the early 1970s. Though he was the owner of a fortune comparable to Escobar's and even had a military apparatus to his service, Gaviria was not as well known, as he kept a low profile. The events leading to his death are unclear. It is speculated he was killed by Search Bloc and the incident was covered up to prevent retaliation. Gustavo's death deeply affected Escobar, given their deep personal and professional relationship. Nonetheless, Escobar did not attend his cousin's funeral but instead listened to the funeral mass via a radio his assistant had attached to the officiating priest. After Gustavo's death, Escobar decided to turn himself in but to stay at La Catedral, a jail of his own making, guarded by his own guards. Since Gustavo died five days after President C√©sar Gaviria took office, at the time, the media and the country in general thought the president had begun his term with an offensive against the narcoterrorists. Gustavo's death triggered a counter-offensive by Escobar that initially destabilized the new president's administration.

The term is derived from the Japanese term , meaning something tattered or repaired. The term typically refers to cotton, linen and hemp materials, mostly hand-woven by peasant farmers, that have been stitched or re-woven together to create an often many-layered material used for warm, practical clothing. Historically, it was more economical to grow, spin, dye, weave and make one's own clothing over buying new garments, and equally as economical to re-use old, worn-out clothing as fabric for new garments; warmer fibres such as cotton were also less commonly available, leading to the development of layering as a necessity in the creation of lower-class clothing. textiles are typically dyed with indigo dyestuff, historically having been the cheapest and easiest-to-grow dyestuff available to the lower classes. Many examples of feature dyework, and most extant examples of today are antiques or modern reproductions made as a craft project, with the introduction of cheaper ready- to-wear clothing to early 20th-century Japan rendering the creation of mostly unnecessary. History During the Edo period, fine silk and cotton fabrics were reserved for a select portion of the upper classes, either through official edicts of dress, or the simple factor of cost; silk fabrics were also unsuitable for working clothes, leading to most practical clothing being developed with the aim of practical wear. Many working class people grew, spun, dyed and wove their own clothing, leading to the development of other fabrics such as . Due to the economic nature of repairing, re-using and re- weaving old clothing and fabrics, also developed out of a working-class need for inexpensive textiles, predominantly coming to signify the clothing of the peasant farming classes over time. Garments and textiles were repaired with spare fabric scraps out of necessity, and in many cases, the usage of repaired clothing lasted for several generations, leading to garments eventually resembling a complex and many-layered patchwork spanning decades of mending. The usage of indigo dyestuff () and indigo dyeing techniques () was common, with indigo dyes often being the only dyestuff available to use by the peasant classes. Indigo dye would often be grown and processed by the peasant classes themselves, being generally easy to grow, and also added a layer of protection to garments due to its moth-repelling properties. Dyeing fabrics with indigo was also incredibly economic, as one indigo dyebath could be used to dye fabric a number of times, in contrast to the average dyebath having just one use. A weak dyebath also provided benefits; a fabric dyed just a handful of times in a strong indigo dyebath would quickly fade, with the dye literally rubbing off from use in certain areas, whereas a fabric dyed repeatedly in a weak dyebath would be resistant to wear and more colourfast, also adding to the economical nature of indigo-dyed textiles. Preservation Following the Meiji period and the general increase in living standards amongst the entire Japanese populace, most pieces were discarded and replaced by newer clothing. To many working class Japanese people, these garments were an embarrassing reminder of their former poverty, and little effort was expended by government or cultural institutions at the time to preserve such artifacts. Over time, textiles came to exemplify the Japanese aesthetic of , with the fabric's reflection of natural wear and use considered beautiful. Many extant examples were preserved through the efforts of folklorists such as , who personally collected over 20,000 pieces of during his lifetime, including 786 items now designated as Important Tangible Cultural Properties. 1,500 of these items are on permanent exhibition at Amuse Museum in Asakusa, Tokyo.

However, after city officials discovered she was African American, they canceled the float, denied her ride in the parade, and denied her other benefits associated with the position. In 2013, nearly 60 years later, Chapman interviewed Williams for a Pasadena Weekly cover story and brought her story to light.http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/beauty_and_the_beasts/12621/ The story ultimately resulted in an official apology from former Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard and an offer from Tournament of Roses Association executive director Bill Flynn for Williams to ride in the 2015 Rose Parade, which she did.

Published book  In January 2015 Rare Bird Books published Chapman's first book, Saturnalia: Traveling from Cape Town to Kampala in Search of an African Utopia, about his travels through Africa. Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said this about the book: \\"The best and most arresting travel books are the ones that also take us on the author's inner journey. Justin Chapman's memoir is a perfect metaphor for contemporary American youth, painfully trying to work through its own baggage, and openly and sincerely seeking to engage with the world beyond the USA's established physical and cultural borders. Don't miss this one.\\" Here is the book's description: \\"In the Spring of 2012, reporter and travel junkie Justin Chapman threw his cares to the wind and, by himself, set off on an epic journey across eight countries in Africa ‚Äî from Cape Town, South Africa, to Mityana, Uganda ‚Äî by bus, train, and boat. Along the way, he narrowly escaped being locked away in a mental institution, visited an impoverished township that is changing its future with the help of an art-based nonprofit, got into a life-threatening car crash, explored the mystical island of Zanzibar, lived with a group of Catholic priests, witnessed a witchcraft healing ceremony, discovered a pygmy opium den, and chased down riveting stories with a local journalist. He crossed cultural boundaries, found love and companionship in unusual places, and stared death ‚Äî with all its visceral stench and gore ‚Äî directly in the eyeballs. Saturnalia is an engrossing cultural and anthropological treatise like none other. By embarking on a journey of self-discovery and survival, Chapman explores what Africa really has to offer, and in the process, discovers surprising and unexpected relationships between people and places.\\" Chapman has traveled to 30 countries. He became interested in traveling in the 8th grade, when he was accepted into the People to People Student Ambassador Program founded by President Eisenhower.

The largest of the city's 7 commercial districts. The Downtown district of Port of Spain is also the oldest district of the city, between South Quay (to the south), Oxford Street (to the north), the St. Ann's River (to the east), and Richmond Street (to the west). Christopher Columbus Square and water fountain, Independence Square East, Port of Spain, April 2009 Woodford Square The heart of downtown is Woodford Square - formerly Brunswick Square (renamed in the 19th century for British Governor, Sir Ralph James Woodford). On its northern side are City Hall and the Hall of Justice, seat of the Supreme Court; on its western side is the Red House, seat of Parliament; the Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral is on its south side, and on the block south-west of the square is the National Library. A number of government offices are located in the immediate vicinity, and the blocks north and west of the Red House are home to many lawyers' chambers. Another busy area in Port Of Spain is Independence Square, located closer to the waterfront and to most of the high rise structures of the city. Woodford Square itself is a green oasis in the heart of the city, with a late-Victorian fountain and bandstand, trees, benches, and lawns. It has famously been the site of many political rallies over the decades; former Prime Minister Eric Williams gave many public lectures here, dubbing it \\"the University of Woodford Square\\", and near the eastern gate is a spot which has become Port of Spain's Speakers' Corner. Independence Square Two blocks south of Woodford Square is Independence Square (formerly Marine Square), which runs along the breadth of downtown Port of Spain from Wrightson Road to the west to the Roman Catholic Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in the east. The section of the square immediately behind the cathedral is called Columbus Square. Before extensive land reclamation in the early 19th century, the city's shoreline ran through Independence Square. In the early 1970s, illegal vendors who had set up shop in the middle of the square were evicted and major repaving and landscaping was undertaken. The new pedestrian area in the middle of the square was named the Brian Lara Promenade in honour of Trinidad and Tobago's star cricket batsman. Where Independence Square is bisected by Frederick Street there is a roundabout with a statue of Captain A.A. Cipriani, the early 20th-century populist politician and mayor of the city. South of the square, Frederick Street widens and becomes Broadway, which terminates at the waterfront and the Port of Spain lighthouse, no longer used as a navigational aid but considered a major landmark. (For Trinidadians born and bred in Port of Spain or its northern and north-western suburbs, \\"past the lighthouse\\"‚Äîeast of the lighthouse on the Beetham Highway‚Äîmeans outside the city proper.) On the southern side of Independence Square are the twin towers of the Eric Williams Financial Complex (home of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance) and the new Nicholas Tower, a commercial office building. Recently completed was the Richmond street Government Campus Plaza and the International Waterfront Centre Towers including the Hyatt Regency Hotel, with Towers C and D standing as the tallest buildings in Trinidad and Tobago and seventh and eighth tallest in the entire Caribbean region. Frederick Street Frederick Street, which runs north through the city to the Queen's Park Savannah, is Port of Spain's major avenue, connecting the two downtown squares with the uptown park, and very approximately dividing downtown into retail (east) and office (west) districts. One block east, lower Henry Street is the location of a number of shops selling cloth, mostly owned by members of Trinidad's Syrian-Lebanese community. Another block over, Charlotte Street at its lower end is Port of Spain's Chinatown in all but name, home to dozens of general emporia known for bargain shopping.

Designed by Sir William Goscombe John, the memorial was commissioned by Sir George Renwick, 1st Baronet, and unveiled in 1923. It primarily commemorates the Territorial Army \\"Pals\\" battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers raised by the local Chamber of Commerce in late 1914 for service in the First World War, which became known as the \\"Commercials\\". It also commemorates the safe return of Renwick's five sons from service in the war, and his 50 years in business as a ship-owner (he was also elected as the Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne and then Newcastle upon Tyne Central on three occasions between 1900 and 1922). The memorial was designed by Sir W. Goscombe John, who also designed the Port Sunlight War Memorial. It has a large base of Shap granite, with three steps up to a rusticated plinth and screen wall. A large bronze statue group on one side was founded by AB Burton at the Thames Ditton Foundry of Thames Ditton; the group includes many figures, some marching along with two drummer boys, while others say goodbye to their loved ones, with flags above, and an angel blowing a trumpet. The scene recalls the mobilisation of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers in April 1915, and their march down the Great North Road through Newcastle to Newcastle railway station. To the rear, the granite is formed into pylons at either end, with three figures carved into the granite: St George in the centre, supported on a bracket formed from two seahorses (the supporters in the arms of Newcastle), with the arms of Newcastle and Gateshead to either side, and then two soldiers in the uniform of the Northumberland Fusiliers: one from the First World War to the right, and one from the founding of the regiment in 1674 to the left. An inscription to the front reads (), followed by the name of the sculpture, 'The Response 1914'. On the rear face, inscriptions read (), the motto of the Northumberland Fusiliers, and: The memorial was the gift of Sir George and Lady Renwick and unveiled on 5 July 1923 at a ceremony attended by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). After restoration, it was rededicated on 25 October 2007 in the presence of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and descendants of the Renwick family. It became a listed building in 1971 and was advanced to Grade I listed status in October 2014.

I was trying to figure out if it'd be ridiculous, or sound like shit. I just tried and then eventually showed the stuff to Ty. He was stoked on it and then we tried to jam together. It was really more to have fun. He mentioned playing drums. We wanted to play music like that, just to see if it was possible.\\" The band's first, self-titled album was released in 2013. =Addition of Chad Ubovich and II (2015)= Upon joining the band, bass guitarist Chad Ubovich noted that the writing process for II differed from their previous collaborations and projects with one another: ‚ÄúWe all kind of did something we‚Äôve never done before, which was write together as a band.

He has been described as \\"the father of Italian sociology\\". Biography Born in Palazzolo Vercellese, Piedmont (Italy) on April 7, 1926, Ferrarotti studied at the Universities of Turin, London and Chicago. In 1951, together with Nicola Abbagnano, he founded the Quaderni di Sociologia, which he edited until 1967 when he started La Critica Sociologica. In 1960 he was awarded the first full-time chair of sociology established in the Italian academic system. A prolific writer and a worldwide traveller, he has taught in many universities all over the world, from Columbia University, The New School and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tokyo University, Universit√© Laval in Qu√©bec, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona and Universit√© la Sorbonne in Paris. Between 1945 and 1963 he was active in four fields: a) as an editorial consultant and translator for Giulio Einaudi in Turin; b) as a collaborator of Adriano Olivetti, concerning mostly industrial relations; c) as director of the ‚ÄúSocial Factors‚Äù, of the OECE in Paris; d) as an independent member of Parliament (1959-1963). In 1963 he did not stand for reelection because the electoral law made it impossible to run as an independent, and more importantly, because he had decided to devote himself completely to teaching and research. In this perspective, he is widely regarded as the founder of postwar Italian sociology. Ferrarotti was awarded the Knight Grand Cross from the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2005.

Plot  Georges Vallier is a famous screenwriter author of vaudevilles. He jealously keeps the secret from the existence of his \\"ghostwriter\\" Pierre Renaud, without frustrating him. However, he invites Pierre to replace him at a cocktail given by Aldo Barazzutti, an Italian filmstar. While thinking he is Georges Vallier, Barazzutti asks him to go with him in Tunisia for the screenwriting of his film. Taking the opportunity, Pierre Renaud tells Georges Vallier that he quits working for him and leaves with Barazzutti for Tunisia. He will later reveal the truth by telling him that he is not Georges Vallier. Pierre leaves temporarily his wife Charlotte, about to give birth, in Paris. He ignores that Barazzutti was using this trip as a pretext to be with his mistress Val√©rie and Pierre has never had the occasion to reveal his real identity or be part of his project of screenwriting, where he would abandon the vaudeville for more political subjects. Having disputed with her lover and being attracted for what represents the famous Georges Vallier, Val√©rie takes refuge with Pierre, even if he rejects her. Barazzutti then sets his sight at Anne-Marie, a customer of the hotel married to a military. The arrival at the hotel of the real Georges Vallier messes the plans of Pierre : he has to multiply the stratagems to hide from Vallier while avoiding that he meets Barazzutti. He then discovers that the presence of Georges Vallier comes from the fact that he is the lover of Anne-Marie. It is while she both hides them in a closet that Georges Vallier finally meets Pierre.

The ship was originally named Brasil for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. 's South American service, but was renamed a number of times. During its history the ship served as a cruise ship and later served in the Semester at Sea program as Universe Explorer. The ship was scrapped in Alang, India, in 2004 sailing under the name Universe for the final voyage.  Design and construction  Brasil was a replacement for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. 's . Brasil and her sister ship, , used MARAD Design P2-S2-9a. Construction was subsidized by the United States Maritime Administration under title V, sections 501 and 504 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. At the time of her construction, Brasil was said to be the largest ship built in the \\"deep south\\". Ingalls Shipbuilding had the lowest US bid at $24,444,181 ($ today) for each of the two ships. The Maritime administration subsidized the cost of construction by paying $19,528,362 ($ today) to support the US shipbuilding industry. Meaning that the ships would have cost nearly $20 million less if they had been built outside the United States. As of 2015, Brasil and Argentina were among the last luxury liners built in the United States. Design included Denny-Brown stabilizers, a system of retractable fins to stabilize the ships in heavy seas. The ship design originally included a solarium for nude sun tanning inside the false funnel.  History  Naming history: Brasil ‚Üí Volendam ‚Üí Monarch Sun ‚Üí Volendam ‚Üí Liberte ‚Üí Canada Star ‚Üí Queen of Bermuda ‚Üí Enchanted Seas ‚Üí Universe Explorer ‚Üí Universe. Brasil was launched December 16, 1957 and christened by Mrs. Emmet J. McCormack, wife of a Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. lines board chairman. The ship was named for Brazil and was spelled with an \\"s\\" at the suggestion of the Brazilian Ambassador to follow the Portuguese spelling. Pulitzer prize winning correspondent Hal Boyle was invited to press the button that launched Brasil as the ship was christened. Boyle also sailed on the ship's maiden voyage. The ship was delivered September 4, 1958 and departed on her maiden voyage September 12, 1958. In 1969, a Cuban refugee stowed away on Brasil, but was refused entry on arrival to the United States. The refugee was eventually allowed entry after three months, a return trip to Brazil and 16,000 miles traveled on the ship. SS Brasil Stateroom 168, November 1958. Brasil and Argentina were sold to Holland America Line in 1972 for a total of $20 million ($ today).Considering inflation, this was actually less than the total amount originally subsidized for construction of the two ships. ($ sale vs $ subsidy) At that time the ship was flagged under Netherlands Antilles. A law was required to be passed to permit the sale since the ships were subsidized by the Maritime administration. In 1977, Congressman Edward Garmatz was indicted for allegedly taking a bribe from the president of Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. in exchange for pushing through the legislation that allowed the sale. However, the charges against Garmatz were dropped in early 1978 just prior to the case going to trial after a key witness had been found to have fabricated documents. In September 1976, the ship was registered under the Panama flag. While the ship was named Monarch Sun, it received passengers from sister ship Monarch Star (ex-) after it suffered an engine failure in January 1977 of the coast of Cuba. She served Commodore Cruise Line under the name Enchanted Seas and operated weekly cruises based out of New Orleans from 1990 to April 1995. In May 1994, it was reported that Enchanted Seas was delayed by 15 hours because the crew discovered a long, diameter pipe filled with marijuana attached to the ship underwater. The crew heard banging on the hull and feared damage to the rudder housing so they sent divers to investigate the noise during a visit to the Cayman Islands. In July 1995, the name was changed to Universe Explorer for use in the Semester at Sea program. The ship had conducted a single semester at sea from February to May 1996 and began a pleasure cruise, not related to the Semester at Sea program, from Vancouver to Alaska on July 23, 1996. On July 27, 1996, after rounding retreat point in the Lynn Canal, Alaska, a fire broke out in the laundry room around 3 AM. 1,006 were aboard at the time of the fire. 5 crew members died, 55 crew members and one passenger were injured and 69 were transported to hospitals. Estimated damage to the ship was $1.5 million. The fire originated in a laundry basket in the laundry room, but the exact cause of the fire could not be determined. The NTSB could not rule out, discarded cigarette smoking materials, spontaneous combustion or a deliberate human act. In October 2000, Universe Explorer was damaged on the Saigon River in Vietnam during a collision with a container ship. Universe Explorer sustained damage to five cabins and a had long gash in the hull. Over 600 students were on board for the Semester at Sea program.  Fate  The ship was renamed Universe and sailed from Hong Kong under its own power to India for scrapping. The ship was beached at Alang during high tide on December 7, 2004 and was scrapped over the following months.

Although no candidate has ever requested an appearance on Saturday Night Live due to equal-time, concerns were raised over whether SNL qualified for an exception to the rule as a live entertainment program. ** After the episode with Donald Trump hosting was aired, it quickly drew criticism for not being very humorous, largely because of Trump being cautious about offending voters in Iowa. * The Elizabeth Banks episode featured no comedic cold open; instead, cast member Cecily Strong issued a solemn address to the city of Paris, as the episode aired the day after the November 2015 Paris attacks, offering condolences in English and French. * Amy Poehler and Tina Fey co-hosted the season's December 19 episode, marking the first time an episode has featured multiple hosts since 2004 (the season 29 episode hosted by Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson), as well as the first time two female cast members have hosted, and the first time since season 12's Christmas episode hosted by Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short that two former cast members have hosted. * Larry David's hosting on February 6, 2016, marks the first time a cast member from the early 1980s sketch show Fridays hosts Saturday Night Live, as well as the first time since season 26 that a former SNL writer who was never a cast member has hosted (Conan O'Brien was an SNL writer from 1988-1991 and hosted in 2001). * Following the death of Prince (who had been a musical guest on the show in 1981, 2006, and 2014 and performed during SNL's 15th anniversary special) in April 2016, a planned rerun of the episode hosted by Peter Dinklage was replaced with a retrospective hosted by Jimmy Fallon called Goodnight, Sweet Prince, showing Prince's musical performances (including a never-before-seen-on-TV one from the show's 40th anniversary special and three The Prince Show sketches: one from the season 30 episode with Queen Latifah as host and musical guest, another from the season 31 episode with Steve Martin as host (and Prince returning as musical guest for the first time since the 15th anniversary special in 1990), and one from the season 32 episode hosted by Shia LaBoeuf. * Tina Fey and Amy Poehler received a historic co-nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a comedy for their roles as co-host of the Christmas episode, which they ultimately won. *Fred Armisen is now the fourth former SNL cast member to host SNL for the first time (he is the 33rd former cast member to host), and it's the fourth time a former SNL cast member has hosted a season finale, the others being Dan Aykroyd, Will Ferrell, and Andy Samberg. *This was also the final season for veteran cast members Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, who both left after six years. Rookie cast member Jon Rudnitsky was also let go at the end of the season. =Problems with election coverage= As usual during election seasons, SNL has placed particular emphasis on the 2016 presidential election. Given the unusually large field of candidates, some impressions of candidates shift or have shifted based on who remains in the race. On the Democratic side, Kate McKinnon is the show's current Hillary Clinton. McKinnon debuted as Clinton in Season 40, Episode 15 (though she previously portrayed an actress portraying Clinton). While they remained in the race, cast members Taran Killam and Kyle Mooney portrayed Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee, respectively, both debuting in Season 41, Episode 3. Former candidate Jim Webb was portrayed by Alec Baldwin, also debuting in the aforementioned episode. Larry David has made recurring appearances to portray Bernie Sanders. There was media speculation as to who would play whom for the upcoming election prior to the season. The casting was made problematic because many of the candidates were played by the same impressionists prior to the election. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul had all been portrayed by Taran Killam. Chris Christie was portrayed by Bobby Moynihan, who had also played Cruz. Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush were both portrayed by Beck Bennett. Additionally, Pete Davidson and Colin Jost were not considered by speculators to be generally desired for the job, since neither was an impressionist. Carly Fiorina had been portrayed by McKinnon on one occasion, while Ben Carson was portrayed by Kenan Thompson. No one on the current cast had portrayed John Kasich. More issues further complicated the matter. Just prior to the start of the season, SNL announced that Killam would be portraying Donald Trump for the upcoming election, which meant that Killam would be portraying four of the candidates in the main Republican race. SNL ultimately was forced to wait until their ninth episode to tackle a Republican debate, when the field was sufficiently narrowed. For the December 19 episode, the first to feature a debate, several impressions were ultimately moved permanently to new cast members. Jimmy Fallon was initially offered the role of Trump on a recurring cameo basis, but a last-minute change resulted in announcer Darrell Hammond portraying him as he had done for fourteen seasons in the cast. Killam ultimately portrayed Cruz, while Moynihan portrayed Christie. Rubio was played by Davidson, Bush by Bennett, and Paul by Kyle Mooney. Cecily Strong and Jay Pharoah portrayed Fiorina and Carson, respectively, while Colin Jost acted as a stand-in for Kasich, with no lines. Rudnitsky portrayed debate moderator Wolf Blitzer. The following episode, on January 16, featured another debate, with a slightly smaller Republican field. Carly Fiorina had been demoted to the earlier undercard debate, and while Paul and Kasich remained on the mainstage, SNL chose not to include them in the sketch. Trump, Cruz, Christie, Rubio, Bush, and Carson were all portrayed by the same people that portrayed them in the earlier episode. Despite Hammond's acclaimed impression, speculation remained as to whether he was playing the role because he was needed (as Killam was playing Cruz) or because his impression was superior. The show ultimately confirmed that Hammond was going to be portraying Trump indefinitely; the following week, he appeared alongside Tina Fey's Sarah Palin in a sketch without Killam, confirming that he would continue to play Trump even if Killam were available (for the time being). Killam, in turn, was confirmed as the show's indefinite Cruz, in a sketch where he portrayed him when Moynihan was not present. 2016‚Äì2017 season Season 42 was indirectly confirmed via advertising plans from NBC's sales division. The announcement revealed that the program will contain 30% less advertisement time in the coming season. Additionally, select NBC advertising clients will be given the opportunity to have their brand appear in promotional sketches, called \\"pods\\". Six of these pods will air each season. The season premiered on October 1, 2016 with host Margot Robbie and musical guest The Weeknd, and concluded on May 20, 2017, with host Dwayne Johnson and musical guest Katy Perry. = Cast = On June 24, 2016, Lorne Michaels announced that Michael Che and Colin Jost would continue as the anchors of \\"Weekend Update\\". Both were featured on SNL special editions of \\"Weekend Update\\" for the Democratic and Republican Conventions. It was also announced that Michael Che, Pete Davidson, and Leslie Jones would all be upgraded from featured players to repertory status. The above-named changes kept the cast membership for this season at 16 members, with four African American cast members and one Hispanic cast member. As in previous seasons, the cast is listed in two separate groups: repertory and featured players. = Opening montage = The opening montage is the same as in previous seasons, except this time the still photos of the musical guest and host are replaced by short video clips of them. =Repertory players= * Vanessa Bayer * Beck Bennett * Aidy Bryant * Michael Che * Pete Davidson * Leslie Jones * Colin Jost * Kate McKinnon * Kyle Mooney * Bobby Moynihan * Cecily Strong * Kenan Thompson * Sasheer Zamata =Featured players= * Mikey Day * Alex Moffat * Melissa Villase√±or = Notes = *Starting with this season, Donald Trump is now played by frequent host Alec Baldwin instead of former cast member and current show announcer Darrell Hammond. *Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah (who were cast members for 6 seasons) were fired. Killam was fired due to scheduling conflicts with his movie Killing Gunther, and both had one year left on their contract, featured player Jon Rudnitsky (who only lasted one season) was let go as well, and they were replaced by SNL writer (and writer/voice actor on Adult Swim's stop-motion series Robot Chicken) Mikey Day, Chicago improv comedian Alex Moffat, and stand-up comedian/impressionist Melissa Villase√±or. *Melissa Villase√±or is the first fully Latina cast member and the fourth Hispanic cast member overall, joining Horatio Sanz (who is Chilean), Fred Armisen (who is half Venezuelan) and No√´l Wells (who is a quarter Mexican. Coincidentally, Melissa Villase√±or is also Mexican, making her the second Latina cast member to be Mexican). *At the end of this season, Vanessa Bayer (cast member since 2010), Bobby Moynihan (cast member since 2008), and Sasheer Zamata (who joined the cast in 2014) all left the show. *At the time Vanessa Bayer left SNL, she was the longest-tenured female cast member, having been a cast member for 149 episodes over the span of 7 seasons (2010-2017). She surpassed the record from Maya Rudolph, who also was on the show for seven years (2000 to 2007), but was only credited for 146 episodes. The record was later surpassed by Kate McKinnon. *Some hosting milestones include: **Alec Baldwin hosting SNL for the first time since 2011 (for the premiere of season 37). **Scarlett Johansson, Melissa McCarthy, and Dwayne Johnson all got into the Five-Timers Club this year, making this the season with the most hosts inducted into the club. **Tom Hanks hosted the show for the first time since the 2005-2006 season. =Election coverage= On September 28, SNL announced that while Kate McKinnon would return as Hillary Clinton for its parodies of the 2016 presidential election, Alec Baldwin would play the role of Donald Trump, replacing Darrell Hammond, who continues as the show's announcer. 2017‚Äì2018 season During the last episode of Weekend Update Summer Edition (on August 24, 2017), it was confirmed that SNL had been renewed for season 43, and would debut on September 30, 2017, with host Ryan Gosling, and musical guest Jay-Z, and concluded on May 19, 2018 with host Tina Fey and musical guest Nicki Minaj. As was the case in the previous two seasons, this season had a cast of 16, with four African-Americans (Thompson, Jones [the only African-American female cast member of this season], Che, Redd) and one Hispanic (Villase√±or). As usual, the cast in listed in two separate groups: repertory and featured. Due to his return for a 15th consecutive season, Kenan Thompson became the show's longest-running cast member, surpassing the previous record of 14 seasons set by Darrell Hammond. = Opening montage = The montage is exactly the same as in the previous three seasons. =Repertory players= *Beck Bennett *Aidy Bryant *Michael Che *Pete Davidson *Leslie Jones *Colin Jost *Kate McKinnon *Kyle Mooney *Cecily Strong *Kenan Thompson =Featured players= *Mikey Day *Heidi Gardner *Alex Moffat *Luke Null *Chris Redd *Melissa Villase√±or = Notes = *During the week of the last episode of season 42, it was announced that Bobby Moynihan (who had been with the show since 2008), Vanessa Bayer (who has been with the show since 2010), and Sasheer Zamata (who joined SNL in early 2014), would not be returning for season 43. *Due to his return for a 15th consecutive season, Kenan Thompson became the show's longest-running cast member, surpassing the previous record of 14 seasons set by Darrell Hammond (who had been a cast member from 1995-2009). *Alec Baldwin announced in early September that he would continue his Donald Trump impersonations on the show, but noted that his busy schedule would result in such appearances occurring on a much smaller scale. *On September 26, it was announced that Heidi Gardner of The Groundlings, Luke Null of iO Chicago (the second cast member to have been born in the 1990s, though Pete Davidson is still the youngest cast member, as Null was born in 1990 while Davidson was born in 1993), and stand-up comedian Chris Redd from Second City would be added to the cast. Redd was originally announced as joining the cast the previous season, but did not end up doing so. On that same day, the return of the remaining cast members from Season 42 (repertory and featured) was confirmed as well.This link verifies that information. It was also announced that Sam Jay, Gary Richardson, Erik Marino, Andrew Dismukes, Steven Castillo, Claire Friedman and Nimesh Patel would all join the writing team. *With Bobby Moynihan's departure, Kenan Thompson is now the only cast member who was hired in the 2000s to still be a cast member. *With Vanessa Bayer's departure, Kate McKinnon is now the longest-tenured current female cast member, as she joined SNL in early 2012. **Also, with Moynihan's departure, McKinnon is now the second longest-tenured current cast member, after Thompson. *Some milestones include: **John Mulaney (who was a writer on SNL for 5 years: 2008-2013), came back to host this season, making him the third former SNL writer who was never a cast member to come back and host the show, after Conan O'Brien (who wrote for the show from 1988 to 1991) and Dick Ebersol-era writer Larry David (who hosted the show earlier in the season) **Natalie Portman came back to host SNL for the first time in over 12 years. The last time she hosted the show was during season 31 in 2006. **With the season finale on May 19, 2018, which featured host (and SNL former cast member) Tina Fey and musical guest Nicki Minaj, the show came full circle for the second consecutive season with a single host and solo musical guest beginning and ending the season, while it marked the seventh consecutive season finale with a solo musical guest. In fact, this season produced the most solo musical acts (16) of any one season in the series‚Äô history. **Tina Fey is now the fifth former cast member to host an SNL season finale, after Dan Aykroyd, Will Ferrell, Andy Samberg, and Fred Armisen. Fey is also the first former female cast member to host a season finale, and, like Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, has hosted a season premiere, a Christmas midpoint episode, and a season finale. **Tina Fey's hosting the finale marked the first time a female had done so in over ten years, with the last being Lindsay Lohan at the end of season 30 in 2005. *For the first time in the show's history, every episode aired this season has had at least one cameo appearance by a celebrity (be it live or pre-filmed). *On August 15, 2018, it was announced that Luke Null would not be returning for the show's 44th season.https://www.vulture.com/amp/2018/08/luke-null-will-not-return-to- saturday-night-live-next-season.html 2018‚Äì2019 season Prior to the premiere of the 44th season of Saturday Night Live, Ego Nwodim was announced as a new featured player for the show.Ego Nwodim Joins ‚ÄòSaturday Night Live‚Äô, Variety, 21 September 2018. Retrieved 12 September 2019. The season premiered on September 29, 2018 with host Adam Driver and musical guest Kanye West, and concluded on May 18, 2019, with host Paul Rudd and musical guest DJ Khaled. For the fourth straight season, there are 16 cast members, with five African- Americans (Che, Jones, Nwodim, Redd, Thompson) and one Hispanic (Villase√±or). As always, the cast is listed in two separate groups: repertory and featured. =Opening montage= The intro changed this season, after having been the same for the past four seasons. It featured black and white video which showed each cast members' whereabouts through New York City, which changed to color and a freeze frame over which the names of each cast member would appear in white text with a color background. The SNL logo that debuted in 2014 remained and the theme music is a rearrangement of the 2014 theme. Also, the host and musical guest portions are the same as in the past two seasons, in which they are live short video clips. =Repertory players= *Beck Bennett *Aidy Bryant *Michael Che *Pete Davidson *Mikey Day *Leslie Jones *Colin Jost *Kate McKinnon *Alex Moffat *Kyle Mooney *Cecily Strong *Kenan Thompson *Melissa Villase√±or =Featured players= *Heidi Gardner *Ego Nwodim *Chris Redd =Notes= *On August 15, 2018, it was announced that featured player Luke Null would not be returning after just one season. *The entire cast of the previous season minus Null returned to the show, with Mikey Day, Alex Moffat and Melissa Villase√±or being promoted to repertory status. Guest star Alec Baldwin also reprised his role as U.S. President Donald Trump. *The show hired actress and Upright Citizens Brigade alum Ego Nwodim as a new featured player. Nwodim is the seventh African-American female cast member in the show's history, the third hired in the last five years, the second one to be born in the 1980s (after former cast member Sasheer Zamata; Nwodim was born in 1988), and the youngest female cast member currently in the cast (she was born six months after Villase√±or). *Michael Che, Colin Jost and Kent Sublette continued as co-head writers while Bryan Tucker had stepped down to become a senior writer. In addition, four new writers had been added to the writing staff: Alison Gates, Alan Linic, Eli Coyote Mandel and Bowen Yang (who appeared on the Sandra Oh episode as Kim Jong-Un in a sketch where Beck Bennett's Vladimir Putin worries about his influence over his country now that the Mueller Report states that Trump did not collude with Russia over the 2016 election). *Some milestones this season included: **Jonah Hill became the latest member of the Five-Timers Club. **Steve Carell came back to host for the first time in over 10 years. The last time was the season 33 finale in 2008. **Jason Momoa is now the second Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian celebrity to host after Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson. **Matt Damon came back to host for the first time in over 16 years. The last time was the season 28 premiere in 2002. **John Mulaney became the second SNL writer who worked under Lorne Michaels and was never hired as a cast member to come back and host (after Conan O'Brien). Mulaney is also the second SNL writer who was never hired as a cast member to host more than once (joining short-lived Dick Ebersol writer Larry David). **Awkwafina became the second Asian-American female to host SNL in over 18 years. The first host was Lucy Liu in 2000 (coincidentally, Awkwafina mentioned in her monologue that the Lucy Liu episode inspired her to one day be famous enough to host SNL). ***Sandra Oh became the third Asian female (joining Lucy Liu and Awkwafina), the first Asian-Canadian to host SNL (though, as mentioned in the monologue, Oh recently obtained American citizenship), the fourth East Asian overall (following Jackie Chan, Liu and Awkwafina), and, if one were to count Middle Eastern and Southeastern Asian countries, the eighth Asian overall (joining Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Fred Armisen, Aziz Ansari, Gal Gadot, Kumail Nanjiani, and Awkwafina). ***Oh's hosting also marked the first time in SNL history that two Asian females have hosted separate episodes within the same season. **BTS was the first K-Pop band to be a musical guest on SNL and the first East Asian musical guests. **Adam Sandler became the latest SNL cast member to come back and host. Sandler is also tied with Dan Aykroyd for longest gap between leaving Saturday Night Live as a cast member and coming back to host an episode at roughly 24 years (Aykroyd left the show in 1979 and came back to host in 2003 while Sandler was fired from the show in 1995 and returned to host in 2019). It should also be noted that both Dan Aykroyd and Adam Sandler made cameo appearances on various episodes (including anniversary specials) before returning to host. **This is the third consecutive year a season came full circle, beginning and ending with a host and solo musical guest, and was the eighth consecutive season the final episode of the season featured a host and solo musical guest, although the finale's musical guest, DJ Khaled, was joined in all his performances by guest artists. **This season featured the second-highest number of solo musical acts in one season (15), one show shy of tying last year's record of 16. **This season had the fewest former cast members who have come back to host, with only two (Seth Meyers and Adam Sandler) who did so. That said, a fair number of former cast members cameoed in sketches throughout the season's run. * As of May 4, 2019, Kate McKinnon has surpassed her former SNL castmate Vanessa Bayer as the longest serving female cast member in history, as this was Kate's 150th episode as a cast member.

However, almost immediately, Gillis' hiring was met with backlash after video clips of him making racially and sexually offensive remarks (including anti-Asian slurs against 2020 election hopeful Andrew Yang) had surfaced, and he was subsequently fired just four days later, less than two weeks before the season began.'SNL' fires Shane Gillis over racist comments, four days after hiring him, USA Today, 16 September 2019. Retrieved 16 September 2019. On September 24, 2019, it was confirmed that featured players Heidi Gardner and Chris Redd would be upgraded to repertory status this season. This season has 17 cast members (which is one shy of the 17th season [1991-1992] for the most number of cast members in a season), with four African-Americans (Thompson, Che, Redd, Nwodim), one Latina-American (Villase√±or) and one Asian-American (Yang). On March 16, 2020, the season was indefinitely halted due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The show returned with a SNL at Home Special on April 11, 2020. Hosted by Tom Hanks and musical guest Chris Martin. =Opening montage= The intro is the exact same as in the previous season, except there's an \\"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 45\\" or \\"SNL 45\\" title card to celebrate the show's 45th anniversary. Also, the shot of the couple making out is replaced by a shot of a traffic light that flashes purple (stop), then blue (go), the cast card for Leslie Jones is gone (as Jones is no longer on the show), and the ones for new cast members Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman were added in, and the background for the host/musical guest clips were completely white, until the Scarlett Johansson/Niall Horan episode, when the background is now completely black, like the previous season. For the Saturday Night Live at Home episodes, the opening montage was adjusted to show scenes of each cast member at their homes. =Repertory players= * Beck Bennett * Aidy Bryant * Michael Che * Pete Davidson * Mikey Day * Heidi Gardner * Colin Jost * Kate McKinnon * Alex Moffat * Kyle Mooney * Chris Redd * Cecily Strong * Kenan Thompson * Melissa Villase√±or =Featured players= * Chloe Fineman * Ego Nwodim * Bowen Yang =Notes= *With the departure of Leslie Jones (b. 1967) from the show, Kenan Thompson (b. 1978) became the oldest current cast member. Because of this, the show has come full-circle in the demographic changes to the cast. In 2003, Thompson was then the show's youngest cast member (being 25 years old at the time) and was, at that time, the first cast member to have been born after SNL's 1975 premiere. Also, with Jones' departure, this will be the first full season of the show in which all the cast members have birth dates after Saturday Night Live's premiere in 1975. *Bowen Yang is now the fourth Asian cast member hired (after Rob Schneider, Fred Armisen, and Nasim Pedrad), the third male Asian cast member hired, the first full-blooded East Asian-American cast member (the East-Asian cast members the show has had before were part- Asian. Rob Schneider is Filipino and Jewish-American while Fred Armisen is German, Korean, and Venezuelan), and the first one to be Chinese. **Yang is also the third gay male cast member after Terry Sweeney (from the 1985-1986 cast) and John Milhiser (from the 2013-2014 cast), the sixth homosexual cast member hired (joining Denny Dillonhttps://www.vulture.com/amp/article/denny- dillon-snl-interview.html?__twitter_impression=true, Terry Sweeney, Danitra Vance, John Milhiser, and Kate McKinnon), the second homosexual person of color after Danitra Vance, the first homosexual male of color, and the first East Asian male homosexual. **With Yang hired and McKinnon still on the show, this is the third time in SNL history that a homosexual male and a lesbian cast member appeared at the same time (the first two times were in 1985 with Sweeney and Vance and in 2013 with McKinnon and Milhiser). **Yang (born 1990) is also the third cast member to have been born in the 1990s, after Pete Davidson (born 1993) and former cast member Luke Null (who, like Yang, was also born in 1990). **Yang is also the seventh cast member to be born outside of North America (Yang was born in Queensland, Australia before his family moved to Quebec and then Colorado), joining Tony Rosato (who was born in Italy before his family emigrated to Canada), Pamela Stephenson (born in New Zealand and now has Australian citizenship), Morwenna Banks (who was born in England), Horatio Sanz (who was born in Chile), Nasim Pedrad (who was born in Iran) and Sasheer Zamata (who was born in Japan), and the second after Zamata to be born in another country, but not be a native to that country (Zamata was born in Japan because her father was in the military and he and his wife moved around). *Chloe Fineman (born July 20, 1988) is the new youngest female member of the current cast, as she was born four months and ten days after Ego Nwodim (born March 10, 1988), though Nwodim is still currently the youngest African- American cast member overall (beating out Chris Redd, who was born March 25, 1985) and the youngest African-American female overall (beating out former cast member Sasheer Zamata). * The hiring of Shane Gillis was met with online backlash after videos and podcast clips resurfaced of him making racist, sexist, Islamophobic, and homophobic remarks. Because of this (and Gillis trying to defend his use of those words and not apologizing for any of it), Gillis was let go before the start of the season, making him the second cast member after Emily Prager to be hired as a cast member, but not appear in an episode and the second after Catherine O'Hara to be hired on the show and immediately let go (though O'Hara quit before she appeared on SNL whereas Gillis was fired). * After being featured players for two years, Heidi Gardner and Chris Redd were upgraded to repertory status. *Some milestones this season include: **Billie Eilish became the youngest season premiere musical guest (at age 17) and the first celebrity born in the 2000s to appear on SNL. ** On November 23, 2019, Will Ferrell hosted SNL for the fifth time, becoming the fourth former cast member to enter the Five-Timers Club after Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Tina Fey. ** For the first time in several years, Ferrell's Five-Timer's milestone was neither acknowledged on-screen or marked in any special way (though when they showed his picture as the host of the episode in the opening credits, he was in a leather chair, smoking a pipe with a robe that says \\"5\\" on it, meaning that his induction into The Five-Timers' Club was at least acknowledged, even if there was no sketch about it). **Also, on November 23, 2019, Weekend Update with Colin Jost and Michael Che became the longest-running iteration of Update with 112 shows and counting, surpassing Weekend Update with Dennis Miller, which had 111 installments between 1985 and 1991. ** Former cast member Eddie Murphy hosted on December 21, 2019, his first time hosting in 35 years, breaking the record for longest span of time between solo hosting appearances, set by Jeff Bridges in 2010 at 27 years. Murphy also surpasses Mick Jagger's 34-year span between hosting appearances, who hosted with The Rolling Stones in 1978 and as a solo host in 2012. Murphy last hosted the show in December 1984 during the show's tenth season (which, coincidentally, was a Christmas episode), though he did make an appearance on SNL's 40th anniversary special. Murphy is the third cast member, after Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Martin Short, from Dick Ebersol's tenure as showrunner to host an episode under Lorne Michaels' tenure. Murphy is also the first and only African-American from that era to host, as well as the first Jean Doumanian-era cast member to host a Lorne Michaels episode, making Murphy one of five cast members (joining Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, and fellow Jean Doumanian cast members Denny Dillon and Yvonne Hudson) who appeared on the show in some capacity (whether as a host, a cast member, or in a cameo appearance) under all three showrunners (Lorne Michaels, Jean Doumanian, and Dick Ebersol). ** As of January 26, 2020, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Cecily Strong are the first female cast members to have officially been on the show for eight full seasons. Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph left during what would've been considered their eighth full season, as they both left mid- season, during different times. ** RuPaul became the first drag queen to host on February 8, 2020. * As mentioned in his monologue, John Mulaney's third time hosting (on February 29, 2020) marked the first time SNL has ever aired on a leap day. **Mulaney is also, as of his third time hosting, the most frequent former SNL writer who was never a cast member to host the show, beating Larry David. * On March 16, 2020, the season was put on hold indefinitely due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in the postponement of an episode originally planned to air on March 28 (which would have been hosted by John Krasinski, with musical guest Dua Lipa).

Between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday, there are ten major processions, six during the evening and four during the day. Most processions are about two and a half kilometers long and take about two hours to complete. These commemorations date back to at least 1622 when they were begun in the atrium of the Church of the Ex monastery of San Bernardino de Siena. Now these processions and ceremonies center of the Santa Prisca Church. They begin on Palm Sunday, when vendors, mostly from the small outlying village of Tlamacazapa, crowd around the church to sell palm leaves woven into intricate designs. Most designs are variations of a crucified Christ but there are others, like floral designs, as well. A wooden carving of Christ on a donkey leaves another outlying village, Tehuilotepec, and marches into Taxco to arrive to the Santa Prisca Church with much fanfare. The first sign of the procession is a large number of children on bicycles, each with palm leaves attached to the front. Next come drummers and people dressed as the Twelve Apostles, walking barefoot. Last comes the sculpture of Christ, with a canopy of flowers and palms, which is surrounded by a crowd of people waving palms to be sprinkled by holy water by the priests. An ‚ÄúAnimas penitente‚Äù Processions occur each day of the week and grow more solemn as Good Friday approaches. The conquistadors brought the old medieval practice of painful and bloody self- penitence to Mexico from Spain about 500 years ago. Since this concept was very similar to Aztec blood rituals, this practice was easily adopted. Despite efforts by authorities in most parts of Mexico to suppress this tradition, it still reappears. However, in Taxco, this practice is not only not suppressed; it has evolved into forms unique to the city. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Holy Week is dedicated to processions made by three major religious cofradias, or brotherhoods, who spend this week doing penance, and thus called ‚Äúpenitentes.‚Äù There are three main cofradias in Taxco, Animas, Encruzados and Flagelentes. All penitentes wear long black robes cinched at the waist with a horsehair belt, and a black fabric hood with only eyeholes. These penitentes are never seen in public without the hood as to remain anonymous. Animas penitentes have chains attached to their ankles that rattle as they walk. These walk bent at the waist 90 degrees carrying small crosses or lighted candles. Because of this, members of this cofradia are referred to as the ‚Äúbent ones.‚Äù If the procession stops, they are allowed to rest only by going down on hands and knees. This is the only cofradia that permits women as members, who drag individual chains in the procession. The men are chained together in groups of twenty. Since they must always face the ground, these penitentes have attendants which guide them during the procession. An ‚ÄúEncruzado penitente‚Äù The Encruzados walk in procession, not nailed to a cross but rather with a bundle of thorned blackberry canes tied across their bare back and outstretched arms. The bundles typically weigh between 40 and 50 kilos. In each hand, the penitente carries a lighted candle. The weight and position of the bundle forces the penitente to stoop slightly. The only rest is through attendees who help with the weight for the periods when the procession does not move. A ‚ÄúFlagelante penitente‚Äù The Flagelantes walk the entire procession shirtless and carry a large wooden cross, which can weigh over 100 pounds in the crook of their arms. In their hands they carry a rosary and a whip with metal points on the end. At certain times and places, they hand the crosses to attendees, kneel and swing the whips over and onto their backs. This is done on alternating sides, creating two bloody areas. This is repeated every night during Holy Week, reopening the wounds from the night before. Another type of ‚Äúpenitente‚Äù are those who carry the large wooden statues of the major figures of Holy Week. In other parts of Mexico, these personages are played by townspeople, but in Taxco, they are represented by large wooden statues that are kept in various neighborhoods and villages in and around Taxco. These statues are carried in processions on Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. The morning of Maundy Thursday is dedicated to a recreation of the Garden of Gethsemane in the front atrium of the Church of Santa Prisca, done with laurel branches, flowers, caged birds and a statue of Jesus. In the afternoon, the quiet is broken by men dressed as Roman soldiers looking for Jesus, as he has been sentenced to death. A townsperson playing Judas Iscariot also roams the streets, with greasy hair, a yellow tunic and rattling thirty pieces of silver. The Jesus statue in the Garden is replaced by one depicted blindfolded and with hands bound behind its back. This statue is taken to a ‚Äújail.‚Äù Penitentes and the Roman soldiers watch over this Christ statue all night rattling chains. The ‚ÄúProcession of the Christs‚Äù also happens this night with over 40 representations of the crucified Christ wandering the streets until morning. On Good Friday, the Christ statue is taken from the ‚Äújail‚Äù and brought to the Santa Prisca Church for a reenactment of the Crucifixion. Inside and outside the church, the penitentes continue the penance they started earlier in the week. After the crucifixion, the statue is taken for its ‚Äúsacred interment‚Äù which is a very solemn procession through the streets. That night, hundreds move through the streets carrying candles. Saturday is quiet until the mass of the resurrection late in the evening at the Santa Prisca Church. The church overflows with people. Outside in the main plaza are the Roman soldiers. When they receive word from the Church that the Christ has risen, they fall to the ground en masse, becoming believers. Most of Easter Sunday is a day of recovery from the events of the past week. Some youths will sing and walk through the streets accompanied by the ‚ÄúSavior Shepherd‚Äù However, most people spend the day at home.

Kuching Main Bazaar shophouses between 1900 and 1930. Early transportation in South East Asia were heavily dependent on rivers. Therefore, Chinese settlers usually named the first street near the river as \\"Hai Gan Street\\" (Êµ∑‰πæË°ó) which means \\"at the edge of river/sea\\". However, Hai Chun Street (Êµ∑ÂîáË°ó, meaning lips of the sea) was given for the first street in Kuching (now popularly known as \\"Main Bazaar\\") near Sarawak River. It is the oldest street in Kuching. Wharves and jetties can be found nearby the street for loading and unloading of goods. Hong San Si Temple (È≥≥Â±±ÂØ∫) is located in the east while the Old Court House is located in the western part of the street. In 1839, while Sarawak was still under the Bruneian Empire administration, the area was inhabited by only a few households while the surroundings were covered by forests. According to official Chinese documents, there were about 20 Chinese pioneers managing vegetable farms at Satok area. After James Brooke took Sarawak (present day Kuching) from the Bruneian Empire, security in the area improved. This has attracted an influx of Chinese immigrants into this place. The earliest settlers in the area were the Hokkien businessmen who stayed near the Tua Pek Kong temple (Âè§ÊôâÂ§ß‰ºØÂÖ¨Âªü). Teochew businessmen later built more shophouses along the street and named the western part of the street as \\"Shun Feng Street\\" (È°∫‰∏∞Ë°ó) which means \\"smooth and abundant\\". Shophouses at the Hai Chun Street were made of wood and attap dwellings. Near the present day Chinese History Museum was the first market in Kuching selling fish, meat, and vegetables. Therefore, the Hai Chun Street is also known as Main Bazaar. In 1863, Frederick Bayle described the Hai Chun Street as follows: By 1872, when the name \\"Sarawak\\" was changed to \\"Kuching\\", Hai Chun Street shophouses were rebuilt by using red bricks and clay tiles. However, Shun Feng Street retained its wooden attap shophouses. On 20 January 1884 at 1:05 am, a big fire started from the intersection between Attap Street (present day Carpenter Street) and China Street. The fire continued to spread and consumed much of the shophouses on the Shun Feng Street. Only at 6:00 am, the fire was put out by rain. A total of 160 shophouses were burnt. After the fire, Rajah Charles Brooke announced that all the new shophouses should be rebuilt with non-flammable brick walls and grey tiles. Many of the rebuilt shophouses still retained their old architectures. Nowadays, grocery stores, large trading companies, banks, and coffee shops has become a rare sight on the street. They are replaced by shophouses specialised in selling handicrafts to tourists. In the 1880s, Rajah Charles Brooke built a new market at Gambier Street while trying to shift traders from the old market at Hai Chun Street to here. In 1898, Charles Brooke through a Chinese Xin'an pastor, encouraged Xin'an people to migrate from Guangdong, China to plant rice and vegetables at Kuching. Therefore, Xin'an people become a majority of traders in this new market. To ensure Chinese labourers remained healthy and productive, Charles Brooke ordered a cannon to be fired from the Astana at 5 am and 8 pm every day to remind them to ensure their hygiene by taking a bath. Hainanese people came later than Hokkien and Teochew people. Since businesses were already dominated by other ethnic groups, the Hainanese people left with little choices but to become helpers of colonial officers and doing household work. They mastered skills of making coffee, kaya, bread, curry, and chicken rice. At first, they sell the food items as mobile vendors but later set up coffee shops at Carpenter Street. The first Siang Ti Temple (‰∏äÂ∏ùÂªü) was built by the Teochews at the Carpenter Street but was razed to the ground in 1884. A new temple was built in 1889 with Chinese opera theatre (named Yang Choon Tai) built directly opposite the temple. The Chinese Opera was built to hold thanksgiving ceremonies to the deities on the first day and the middle of every month. The theatre is still used to stage Chinese opera to this day especially on the birthday of the deity \\"Hiang Thian Siang Ti\\" (ÁéÑÂ§©‰∏äÂ∏ù). In the olden days, the Chinese opera was also used as a sanctuary for the homeless who arrived from mainland China. The homeless people could sleep under the stage until they find their own lodging. Back alleys of Carpenter Street was once a warm bed for brothels, opium dens, and gambling houses. The British eventually clear up the illegal activities here. Present day Chinatown In the present day, several families staying in Main Bazaar still pursue tin-smithing, carpentry and petty trading while majority of the shops here are antique and handicraft shops with a few coffee shops. Several notable outlets in Main Bazaar are: Native Arts, Nelson's Gallery, Rainforest, Sarawak House, Atelier Gallery and Arts of Asia. Carpenter Street is lying parallel to Main Bazaar. The street is considered backstreet to the Main Bazaar. The street was formerly known as \\"Attap Street\\" (‰∫öÁ≠îË°ó) because shophouses there were once covered by attap dwellings. There were also carpenters working in their workshops here, thus giving the street its name. The Tua Pek Kong temple is located at Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman. Built in 1876, it is oldest Chinese temple in Kuching. The Chinese History Museum is located near the waterfront, opposite the Tua Pek Kong temple. The museum shows the history of Chinese community in Sarawak. The Chinese shophouses at Jalan Padungan were built between 1920 and 1930s when rubber plantation businesses flourished at the time.

Its area of use can include skilled nursing facilities and hospitals aimed at acute, sub-acute and rehabilitation care. Performed on admission to and departure from a rehabilitation hospital, it serves as a consistent data collection tool for the comparison of rehabilitation outcomes across the health care continuum. Furthermore, it aims to allow clinicians to track changes in the functional status of patients from the onset of rehab care through discharge and follow-up. The FIM's assessment of degree of disability depends on the patient's score in 18 categories, focusing on motor and cognitive function. Each category or item is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = <25% independence; total assistance required, 7 = 100% independence). As such, FIM scores may be interpreted to indicate level of independence or level of burden of care. The scale is used to assess how well a person can carry out basic activities of daily living and thus how dependent he or she will be on help from others. Other areas assessed include the physical like how well patients move and walk, and the cognitive, how well they interact with others, communicate, and process information. FIM was originally made for people who had had strokes, but is used to assess disability in other cases as well.

They produce a range of milk products, including varieties of milk, cream, ice cream and butter. The company is best known for its brand of chocolate milk, which in 2014 sparked a frenzied, nationwide shortage. 2014 chocolate milk shortage In October 2014, Lewis Road Creamery in conjunction with Whittaker's Chocolate launched a new brand of chocolate milk. Initial production was staffed by around five people and totaled around 1000 liters, sold in 750ml and 300ml bottles. Reaction to its release was overwhelmingly positive, centering on its remarkable richness and creaminess. Due to its immense popularity and cult appeal, nationwide demand was greater than the quantity supplied, resulting in a shortage that often saw stores sell out of supplies before the end of the morning. This shortage prompted local supermarkets and retailers to take extreme measures to secure stock and ensure fair purchasing. In some cases, rationing was implemented so as to limit the purchase to two bottles per person, and security guards were hired to monitor shoppers and fridges containing chocolate milk. The shortage also resulted in the emergence of chocolate milk black markets, ranging from scalpers attempting to resell bottles on TradeMe at three to four times their original price to counterfeit chocolate milk production.

He was a well-known \\"heel\\" in the National Wrestling Alliance and considered a future wrestling star at the time of his death. Professional wrestling career He started his career in the American Wrestling Association in Minnesota. Eventually winning titles in the Mid-west and Hawaii. By 1968 he went to Georgia where he became popular. In 1970, he was the masked Challenger teaming up with The Professional (Doug Gilbert) winning the NWA Georgia Tag Teams titles in a tournament. Later that year he defeated Nick Bockwinkel for the NWA Georgia Television Championship. In 1971 he moved to the NWA's Florida territory where he became a big name. He won the Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship from George Gaiser, as well as the NWA Florida Television Championship winning it two times from Bob Roop and Tim Woods in 1972. Shane won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship with Chris Markoff, Bearcat Wright and Gorgeous George, Jr. from 1972‚Äì1974. Jack Brisco would have a feud with Shane during his time in Florida. He became known as the \\"King of Wrestling\\". In 1974 he went to World Championship Wrestling in Australia and feuded with Mario Milano.  Death  On February 20, 1975, Shane was accompanied by Gary Hart, Austin Idol and Buddy Colt, who was piloting the Cessna 182, when they took off from Opa Locka Airport, located in Miami to Peter O. Knight Airport, located in Tampa. The aircraft crashed into the Tampa Bay following a stall after Colt attempted a go-around. Amidst the crash, the Tampa Police Department retrieved the aircraft from the water where they found Shane's body and announced that Shane had died from drowning. It is believed his foot was caught in the wreckage of the aircraft. Shane died at 29 years old and the other wrestlers survived with minor and critical injuries. Hart was thrown from the plane and had suffered serious injuries (broken arm, wrist, knee, back, sternum, collarbone and vertebrae; right eye knocked loose; a partially severed nose; head trauma). Despite this, he managed to locate McCord and swim him to shore, then swim back and rescue Colt. However, swimming out a third time, Hart was unable to find Shane; reportedly he was plagued by the memory and for decades wondered whether he had done everything he could.

The Shout Your Abortion campaign was started on September 19, 2015, by American activists Lindy West, Amelia Bonow, and Kimberly Morrison, in response to efforts by the United States House of Representatives to defund Planned Parenthood following the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. The hashtag has received both positive and negative attention within social media and the mainstream media. Background and origin On September 18, 2015, the U.S House of Representatives passed legislation to suspend funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America for one year, pending investigation of allegations regarding Planned Parenthood's practices with respect to fetal organ and tissue donation. Shout Your Abortion co-founder Amelia Bonow reported she ‚Äúcried all day‚Äù in response to the House of Representatives attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. On September 19, 2015, Bonow turned to social media, speaking out in defense of Planned Parenthood on her Facebook page. Bonow expressed gratitude for what she described as an ‚Äúincredibly positive experience‚Äù of an abortion procedure she had at a Planned Parenthood facility and Bonow publicly discussed her abortion without ‚Äúsadness, shame or regret.‚Äù Two other activists, Lindy West and Kimberly Morrison, became involved. West took a screen shot of Bonow‚Äôs Facebook post, added the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion, and then sent Bonow‚Äôs Facebook post out to her over 60,000 Twitter followers with the introduction: ‚ÄúThe campaign to defund PP relies on the assumption that abortion is something to be whispered about.‚Äù An image of Kimberly Morrison's unshaved armpit with a tattoo that reads \\"fuck the patriarchy\\" was used as the logo for the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign. The hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion soon trended worldwide, including in the US, Australia, UK, and Ireland. On September 22, 2015, the #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag was used over 100,000 times in a 24-hour period. While 2015 is acknowledged as the start of #ShoutYourAbortion as a social media campaign, the efforts of Sue Perlgut and other second-wave feminists who suggested that women confess their abortions publicly provides historic precedent from the 1970s.Baumgardner, Jennifer (2008). Abortion & Life. Akashic. Support for abortion rights Lindy West, Amelia Bonow, and Kimberly Morrison encouraged other women to share positive abortion experiences online using the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion in order to ‚Äúdenounce the stigma surrounding abortion.‚Äù On September 19, 2015, West tweeted: ‚ÄúMy abortion was in '10 & the career I've built since then fulfills me & makes me better able to care for kids I have now #ShoutYourAbortion.‚Äù West said, \\"I set up #ShoutYourAbortion because I am not sorry and I will not whisper.\\" Within days, tens of thousands of other women worldwide shared their personal abortion experiences. Tweets included: ‚ÄúI've never wanted to have children, so I had an abortion. I'm thriving, without guilt, without shame, without apologies. #ShoutYourAbortion‚Äù; ‚ÄúI've had 2 abortions. I don't have to justify or explain them to anybody. My life is more valuable than a potential life. #shoutyourabortion‚Äù; \\"In 1988 a late-term abortion got a teenage me back on track for college, career, & motherhood. #ShoutYourAbortion\\"; ‚ÄúMy abortion was the most compassionate option for the baby and me. #ShoutYourAbortion‚Äù, and \\"I had an abortion. My body, my life, my choice. End of story. #shoutyourabortion.\\" Planned Parenthood's executive vice present, Dawn Laguens, publicly supported the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign saying: \\"We're happy to see more and more people coming forward...these stories are a powerful reminder that women should never feel shamed or judged.\\" In an interview with The New Yorker, Bonow expressed that perhaps she and her friends, whom Bonow described as \\"irreverent, foul-mouthed ladies\\" were better able than those currently inside the traditional abortion-rights organizations to talk frankly about their positive experiences with abortion. Within days of the launch of the social media campaign, Bonow was contacted by NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood with advice for harnessing the current outpouring of attention in order to turn Shout Your Abortion into something bigger and more organized. In November 2015, an official Shout Your Abortion web site and YouTube channel were launched.  Criticism and backlash  In addition to positive abortion stories and support for the abortion- rights movement, the social media campaign received backlash and criticism as anti-abortion, AKA, pro- life activists also began using the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion to combat these beliefs. CNN reported: ‚Äúit should surprise no one that this has turned into a bit of a fight.‚Äù Pro-life activist Gianna Jessen tweeted: ‚ÄúMy medical records: 'Born during saline abortion.' I didn't have an abortion. I Lived through one. #shoutyourabortion.\\" Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin urged her Twitter followers to \\"Shout this LOUDER: #PPSellsBabyParts.‚Äù Former Republican member of the House of Representatives, and 2012 presidential candidate Michele Bachmann said, ‚Äú#ShoutYourAbortion gives a new meaning to macabre.‚Äù Other critical tweets included: \\"When did making someone else pay dearly for your mistakes become empowerment for women? #shoutyourabortion\\"; \\"All of humanity past and present looks upon what has become of modern feminism and shakes its head in disgust & disbelief #shoutyourabortion\\"; and \\"All great genocides start by dehumanizing the victim. #ShoutYourAbortion.\\" Some users who identified as pro-choice also questioned the approach. Tweets included: \\"I am pro choice. However, abortion is a difficult decision and not something to ‚Äòshout‚Äô about.\\"; \\"Ladies there are so many wonderful ways to celebrate being a strong independent & intelligent woman, #ShoutYourAbortion is not one of them.\\"; and \\"Regardless of your stance on abortion, why can't we all agree it's not something to brag about?‚Äù On Twitter, the hashtag #ShoutYourAdoption was created in response to #ShoutYourAbortion, to promote adoption instead of abortion. In response to online criticism, actress Martha Plimpton, co-founder of the pro-choice organization \\"A is for\\" created a ‚ÄúMean Tweets‚Äù style video along with comedian Margaret Cho and other prominent contributors to the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign. The video shows the women ‚Äúlaughing off the trolls‚Äù on Twitter. Critical tweets included: threats, references to racism, and calling the women ‚Äúbaby killers.‚Äù Media attention Media responses to the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign were mixed. Mic.com, a media company focused on millennials described Shout Your Abortion as Twitter users ‚Äúbravely fighting stigma in the most inspiring way‚Äù, while The Blaze, a conservative news outlet, responded to the campaign by stating: ‚Äúthere is a stigma rightfully associated with abortion...knowingly deciding to end human life for your life‚Äôs sake resonates poorly in the minds of humanity.‚Äù Writing for The Guardian, Shout Your Abortion co-founder Lindy West said, \\"there are no 'good' abortions and 'bad' abortions, because an abortion is just a medical procedure\\" and ‚Äúa foetus is not a person.‚Äù Ian O‚ÄôDoherty writing for The Irish Independent commented on the social media campaign saying abortion is ‚Äúnot really something to shout about‚Äù describing abortion as ‚Äúthe only medical procedure which deliberately ends a life‚Äù, saying it can at best be described as ‚Äúa necessary evil.‚Äù Voicing a pro-choice position, O‚ÄôDoherty said ‚Äúabortion should be legal, safe and rare‚Äù concluding ‚Äúit‚Äôs not an act of patriarchial misogyny to say that.‚Äù Writing for The Seattle Times, Nicole Brodeur commented that ‚ÄúIf abortion is a political football, #ShoutYourAbortion is a Hail Mary pass - women publicizing an extremely personal decision in order to save what they believe is every woman‚Äôs right.‚Äù Writing for Jezebel, Shout Your Abortion co-founder Amelia Bonow summarized the social media campaign by saying: ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt figure out how to shut us up‚Äù furthering, ‚Äúthere are too goddamned many of us and you cannot reverse a viral shift in cultural consciousness. ‚Äú Co- founder Lindy West said that getting the discussion out in public is the whole point of the social media campaign, saying: \\"you never have to feel ashamed of your personal medical decisions,\\" ‚ÄúYou can speak about them at full volume.\\" Shout Your Abortion was described as marking a significant tonal shift in the cultural conversation about abortion in The Washington Post, by Caitlin Gibson. She described Shout Your Abortion as a shift away from describing abortion as a less-than-desirable outcome and a distancing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs frequently-quoted 2008 remark that abortion should be ‚Äúsafe, legal and rare,\\" saying the campaign moves the discussion away from extreme cases involving rape, incest, medical emergencies or severe birth defects. 2019: #YouKnowMe The You Know Me Movement is a similar 2019 internet movement against abortion stigma and a response to the Fetal heartbeat bill in the United States, specifically the passing of anti-abortion laws in 2019 in Georgia (U.S. state) , Ohio and Alabama.

As of 2010, it had a population of 3,172.http://www.microrregiones.gob.mx/catloc/contenido.aspx?refnac=120550180 It is located approximately ten kilometers south of the city of Taxco. History The name Taxco is most likely derived from the Nahuatl place name Tlachco, which means ‚Äúplace of the ballgame.‚Äù However, one interpretation has the name coming from the word tatzco which means ‚Äúwhere the father of the water is,‚Äù due to the high waterfall near the town center on Atatzin Mountain. ‚ÄúDe Alarc√≥n‚Äù is in honor of writer Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n who was a native of the town. Like many municipalities in central Mexico, the municipality‚Äôs coat- of-arms is an Aztec glyph. This glyph is in the shape of a Mesoamerican ballcourt with rings, players and skulls, derived from the most likely source of Taxco‚Äôs name. Before the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, Taxco el Viejo was known simply as \\"Taxco\\". In pre-Hispanic times, this village was the most important in the area as it was the seat of the Aztec governor who presided over tribute collection in the surrounding seven districts. The modern Spanish city of Taxco was founded by Hern√°n Cort√©s in an area previously known as Tetelcingo. Ex Hacienda de San Juan Bautista The Ex Hacienda de San Juan Bautista is a colonial silver mining hacienda in Taxco el Viejo. The first thing that makes it notable is that the main structure is built in the style of a medieval castle. This structure was built in 1543 and was ordered by Hern√°n Cort√©s, but he never saw it built as he returned to Spain for good in 1540. His son, Mart√≠n Cort√©s, 2nd Marqu√©s del Valle de Oaxaca, inherited it but he probably never set foot in it as he arrived to Mexico in 1563 and was practically deported back to Spain in 1566. Like the \\"El Chorrillo\\", it used large quantities of water and mercury to extract silver from mined ore, but this method eventually contaminated the large reserves of groundwater in this part of Guerrero. The state is now the home of the Regional School of Earth Sciences on the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero. This facility has a small museum with fossils and geological specimens.

The aqueduct built in 1534 is ruined but still preserved. During the colonial period, this hacienda passed through a number of hands, including those of the Almeida-Carbajal and Ruiz de Alarc√≥n families. In the early 20th century, it was bought by the American Sullivan family, who ran it as a guest house. In the 1980s it was acquired by the State of Guerrero, who converted it into the Center of Fine Arts of the Institute of Culture of Guerrero. In 1992, the state leased the property to UNAM to create the Centro de Estudios para Extranjeros (Learning Center for Foreigners) and a campus of the Fine Arts School of UNAM. In exchange for use of the grounds, UNAM pays for its maintenance. The main building houses studios and classroom for painting, sculpture, languages and more.

Majority of the island's inhabitants depend on fishing for subsistence and livelihood. Recently, salt- making, basket-weaving and marine tourism were also introduced as alternative sustainable livelihoods. As a barangay, the island has a health clinic, elementary school and barangay hall. With its white sand beaches and rich aquatic resources, Silinog was declared a marine reserve by the local government of Dapitan. In April 2000, the Philippine government through Proclamation No. 276 established the Selinog Island Protected Landscape and Seascape covering the whole island and surrounding reefs to better manage its resources.

History On April 13, 1861, Northampton County residents held a public meeting at Easton to discuss the secession of southern states from the United States of America. Several in attendance, including Charles Heckman and Captain Samuel Yohe, began recruiting local militia members and other volunteers willing to support and protect the federal government. Yohe, the owner-operator of a local distillery, mill and store, previously served his community as an associate judge, county treasurer and prothonotary, as well as the commanding officer of the Washington Grays, an Easton-based militia unit.

Lititz and Cleona: Holzapfel Publishing Co., 1912. Two days later, when President Abraham Lincoln issued his call for 75,000 volunteers to defend Washington, D.C., community leaders in Easton and neighboring cities offered the services of the local residents they had begun recruiting. Three days later, these volunteers left their respective cities and headed for Dauphin County, where they mustered in at Camp Curtin, a military training camp on Agricultural Society land in northern Harrisburg.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. On April 20, the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment was officially organized at the camp with Yohe commissioned as colonel and appointed commanding officer. The Washington Grays were designated as Company C while the men recruited by Heckman were assigned to company D. Commissioned as captain, Heckman was then placed in charge of that unit.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Lehigh County native Tilghman H. Good, commanding officer of the Allen rifles, a highly regarded militia unit based in Allentown, was named lieutenant colonel and second in command of the regiment. During the summer of 1861, as the war intensified, Good went on to establish another new regiment, the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry.\\"Good, Tilghman H., in \\"Registers of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1865,\\" vol. 1: 1st-25th Regiments (3 months' service, April‚ÄìMay 1861).

Also commissioned as officers on the regimental command staff were Thomas W. Lynn (major) and James W. Militmore (adjutant). The regimental band, composed of musicians from the city of Lancaster, was led by Daniel Clemens.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. That evening, after being equipped with muskets and twelve rounds of ball cartridge, haversacks and food rations (bacon and hard tack) and placed under the command of Brigadier General George C. Wynkoop, the members of the 1st Pennsylvania marched to Harrisburg's train station and boarded Northern Central rail cars. Transported to Maryland, they disembarked near Cockeysville.Condit, The History of Easton, Penn'a, p. 226. Within short order, they were pulled back to York, Pennsylvania, where they trained at Camp Scott until May 14. At this point, they were assigned to guard the Northern Central Railroad from Pennsylvania to Druid Park in Baltimore, Maryland.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. The regiment was ordered to Catonsville, Maryland and then onward on May 25, once again assigned to guard duty protecting roads leading to Harpers Ferry and the cities of Frederick and Franklintown.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Transported back to Pennsylvania on June 3, the regiment underwent additional training at Chambersburg before reassignment to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Army of the Shenandoah commanded by General Robert Patterson. Ordered back to Maryland, the regiment moved between Hagerstown, Funkstown and Williamsport before occupying Frederick from June 22,Schaadt, Company I, First Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, p. 546. where they continued to drill until receiving orders two weeks later to head for Martinsburg, Virginia. Moving through Boonsboro and Williamsport, the 1st Pennsylvanians forded the Potomac River, advancing toward Falling Waters and then reaching Martinsburg.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Yohe and his 1st Pennsylvanians were ordered to assume garrison duty in the vicinity of Martinsburg by army Assistant Adjutant General Fitz John Porter on July 8, in order to protect Union supplies and railroad lines. They remained there when the remainder of Patterson's army moved on to Bunker Hill on July 14. Two days later, they rejoined the army at Charlestown. Ordered to Harpers Ferry on July 21, the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers marched to Sandy Hook, boarded train cars to return to Harrisburg on the evening of July 23, where they were honorably discharged. Many then promptly chose to re-enlist for three-year terms of service.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers. According to official historian Samuel P. Bates, \\"During the time that the regiment was in service, it did not participate in any battles; but its timely arrival in the field accomplished much good by checking any rash movement on the part of Rebels in arms along our borders. The duties it was called upon to perform were faithfully done, and its good conduct, under all circumstances, was appreciated and acknowledged by its superior officers.\\"Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers.

Biography Teodor Pavloviƒá, son of Paul Pavloviƒá and Jelisaveta Matiƒá, was born on 14 February 1804 in a small village called Dragutinovo, now known as Karlovo, in today's municipality of Novo Milo≈°evo in Banat, Vojvodina. Upon completing grammar school, his father sent him to the best high schools in the region, first to Hatzfeld in former Torontal county, then Temisvar, Velika Kikinda, Sremski Karlovci and finally in Segedin. When he graduated in Segedin he was fluent in Latin, Church Slavonic, German, Hungarian, and Romanian. At the suggestion of a friend, Konstantin Peiƒçiƒá, he then went to Pozun (Bratislava) where he studied law and liberal arts, graduating in 1827 with a law degree. Pavloviƒá was more devoted to the cause of Serbian cultural development than to his own law practice. He was named editor-in-chief of Letopis (the official organ of Matica srpska) in 1832, a post he held until 1841. As a vehicle to champion human rights, he established the Serbski Narodni List, a Serbian political newspaper, inaugurated on 1 June 1835 in Buda (now Budapest). Later, the name of the paper was changed to Serbske Narodne Novine which continued publishing with minor interruptions until 1849. Pavloviƒá became the first secretary of Matica Srpska in 1837. Thanks to the efforts of Pavloviƒá, and his friends, Sava Tekelija, Jovan Nako, Baron Fedor Nikoliƒá of Rudna, Petar Carnojeviƒá, Vladika Platon Atanackoviƒá, Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, Metropolitan Stefan Stankoviƒá, Bishop Evgenije Jovanoviƒá, Aleksa Simiƒá, and others, who joined the venerable institution, and made it what it is today. Works He translated from the German of Adolph Freiherr Knigge's \\"Uber den Umgang mit Menschen\\" (On Human Relations) into Serbian (Buda, 1831) and two works by Christoph Martin Wieland (1733-1813) entitled \\"Sympathien\\" (Sympathies) and \\"Dialogen des Diogenes von Sinope\\" also into Serbian, published in Buda, 1829). In his original writings he gives finished portraits of his contemporaries; and he chronicled in his articles the many political scandals of which Vienna and Budapest were centers. They are invaluable for their social, political and literary history of the time.

It is the only government-sanctioned charity within Korea. It is Korea's largest welfare institution. With a community-based fundraising effort, it supports various welfare centers, community projects, and collaborates with other non-profit organizations and NGOs. The honorary ambassador of the Community Chest in South Korea is Kim Sung-Joo, an announcer and host. Activity Community Chest of Korea's main activities are raising, distributing, using and managing funds; investigating, studying and promoting fund-raising; and enhancing cooperation with organizations who collect other donations. The collection is distributed by accepting ongoing applications. It is carried out by presentation to the board of directors that consists of experts from many fields, including the business community and religious circles, and the charity's chairman to raise the transparency and efficiency of distribution. History of community In July 1998, Community Chest of Korea started to develop a welfare organization in South Korea. Kang Yeong- hoon who was the first chairman was elected. In February 1990, the first donation system was started and Kim Seong-soo, the second chairman, was elected. The third chairman elected was Han Seung-heon. and next chairman elected was Kim Young-Jun in April 2004. In December 2007, Community Chest of Korea started an honor society for individuals who have raised over 100 million won. In March 2009, Yun Byeong Chul was appointed chairman and in May, people began to be able to donate online. Heo Dong Soo was elected the 14th chairman in 2014. That same year, Condoleezza Rice visited this organization and donated ten million won. In September 2015 a United Way Worldwide Roundtable on Philanthropy was held in Seoul by the Community Chest of Korea to explore ways to improve community welfare organization throughout the world. The roundtable hosted about 150 influential business donors and community leaders from around the world who signed a \\"Letter of Intent\\" to create more opportunities for \\"caring communities.\\" History of Donation *In December 2012 Community Chest of Korea began the organization of donations in local groups. In November a welcoming ceremony was held to announce the possibility of international donation to the Community Chest at the Seoul Branch. *In July 2013 Community Chest Of Korea held a general meeting for the international donation community at Incheon. In December the chairman held a second general meeting for the international donation community.o * Community Chest Of Korea established a new group called the \\"Sharing Corps\\". The purpose of this group is develop desirable communities, and support funding and allocation decisions, as well as cultural events. Honor Society Since the aim of the Community Chest is to further a culture of donations and charity, it established the Honor Society in December 2007. In Community Chest of Korea, Honor Society is for individuals who donate at least 100 million won. The society members care deeply about social problems and contribute to social developing by donation and volunteering. Especially, through Honor Society, Community Chest of Korea makes an effort to solve problems like social and economic inequality and polarization of classes. Members of Honor Society make a declaration to make an effort to help society develop through donation and participation in this group and create a culture for the continual distribution of charity to those in need. Current members of the Honor Society include celebrities Im Yoona, Bae Suzy, and Park Hae-jin. Kind Store Independent businesses often donate to Community Chest of Korea through the Kind Store campaign. Kind Store is an effort through which stores can donate some percentage of their total sales. Independent businessmen, small businesses, franchises, academies, and hospitals participate each year in the Kind Store. If some store does a Kind Store campaign, Community Chest of Korea sends stickers that symbolize donation and a signboard. Controversy In 2006, this organization was found by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to have several cases of corruption and embezzlement. A total of 164 workers, out of a total 250, were punished for some sort of violation. CCK restructured its staff and appointed new executives. After this information was published publicly the government restricted CCK's activities for a time period. Because of this problem many people of South Korea refused to support the organization and there was a large drop in donations up through 2010. In 2015, Community Chest of Korea came under controversy for giving a monthly stipend to a celebrity ambassador in South Korea. Because of these many problems, mass media referred to CKK's logo not as symbolizing the \\"Fruit of Love\\", but rather the \\" Fruit Of Corruption \\".

Classically, the magnetic anisotropy favors neither of the two states with opposite magnetization, so that the system has two equivalent ground states. Because of the quantum spin tunneling, an energy splitting between the bonding and anti-bonding linear combination of states with opposite magnetization classical ground states arises, giving rise to a unique ground state separated by the first excited state by an energy difference known as quantum spin tunneling splitting. The quantum spin tunneling splitting also occurs for pairs of excited states with opposite magnetization. As a consequence of quantum spin tunneling, the magnetization of a system can switch between states with opposite magnetization that are separated by an energy barrier much larger than thermal energy. Thus, quantum spin tunneling provides a pathway to magnetization switching forbidden in classical physics. Whereas quantum spin tunneling shares some properties with quantum tunneling in other two level systems such as a single electron in a double quantum well or in a diatomic molecule, it is a multi-electron phenomena, since more than one electron is required to have magnetic anisotropy. The multi-electron character is also revealed by an important feature, absent in single-electron tunneling: zero field quantum spin tunneling splitting is only possible for integer spins, and is certainly absent for half-integer spins, as ensured by Kramers degeneracy theorem. In real systems containing Kramers ions, like crystalline samples of single ion magnets, the degeneracy of the ground states is frequently lifted through dipolar interactions with neighboring spins, and as such quantum spin tunneling is frequently observed even in the absence of an applied external field for these systems. Initially discussed in the context of magnetization dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles, the concept was known as macroscopic quantum tunneling, a term that highlights both the difference with single electron tunneling and connects this phenomenon with other macroscopic quantum phenomena. In this sense, the problem of quantum spin tunneling lies in the boundary between the quantum and classical descriptions of reality.  Single spin Hamiltonian  A simple single spin Hamiltonian that describes quantum spin tunneling for a spin S is given by: \\\\hat{H}= D\\\\hat{S}_z^2 + E (\\\\hat{S}_x^2 -\\\\hat{S}_y^2) [1] where D and E are parameters that determine the magnetic anisotropy, and \\\\hat{S}_x, \\\\hat{S}_y, \\\\hat{S}_z are spin matrices of dimension 2S+1 . It is customary to take z as the easy axis so that D<0 and D>> E. For E=0, this Hamiltonian commutes with \\\\hat{S}_z , so that we can write the eigenvalues as E(S_z)= DS_z^2, where S_z takes the 2S+1 values in the list (S, S-1, ...., -S) describes a set of doublets, with E=0 and D<0 . In the case of integer spins the second term of the Hamiltonian results in the splitting of the otherwise degenerate ground state doublet. In this case, the zero field quantum spin tunneling splitting is given by: \\\\Delta \\\\propto E \\\\left(\\\\frac{E}{D}\\\\right)^{(S-1)} From this result, it is apparent that, given that E/D is much smaller than 1 by construction, the quantum spin tunnelling splitting becomes suppressed in the limit of large spin S, i.e., as we move from the atomic scale towards the macroscopic world. The magnitude of the quantum spin tunnelling splitting can be modulated by application of a magnetic field along the transverse hard axis direction (in the case of Hamiltonian [1], with D<0 and E>0, the x axis). The modulation of the quantum spin tunnelling splitting results in oscillations of its magnitude, including specific values of the transverse field at which the splitting vanishes. This accidental degeneracies are known as diabolic points.  Observation of Quantum Spin Tunneling  Quantum tunneling of the magnetization was reported in 1996 for a crystal of Mn12ac molecules with S=10. Quoting Thomas and coworkers, \\"in an applied magnetic field, the magnetization shows hysteresis loops with a distinct 'staircase' structure: the steps occur at values of the applied field where the energies of different collective spin states of the manganese clusters coincide. At these special values of the field, relaxation from one spin state to another is enhanced above the thermally activated rate by the action of resonant quantum-mechanical tunneling\\". Quantum tunneling of the magnetization was reported in ferritin present in horse spleen proteins A direct measurement of the quantum spin tunneling splitting energy can be achieved using single spin scanning tunneling inelastic spectroscopy, that permits to measure the spin excitations of individual atoms on surfaces. Using this technique, the spin excitation spectrum of an individual integer spin was obtained by Hirjibehedin et al. for a S=2 single Fe atom on a surface of Cu2N/Cu(100), that made it possible to measure a quantum spin tunneling splitting of 0.2 meV. Using the same technique other groups measured the spin excitations of S=1 Fe phthalocyanine molecule on a copper surface and a S=1 Fe atom on InSb, both of which had a quantum spin tunneling splitting of the S_z=\\\\pm1 doublet larger than 1 meV. In the case of molecular magnets with large S and small E/D ratio, indirect measurement techniques are required to infer the value of the quantum spin tunneling splitting. For instance, modeling time dependent magnetization measurements of a crystal of Fe8 molecular magnets with the Landau-Zener formula, Wernsdorfer and Sessoli inferred tunneling splittings in the range of 10‚àí7 Kelvin.

Her professional experience centered on teaching, institutional management, theory and practice related to architecture. She was the first woman student of the College of Engineering and Architecture at the National Polytechnic Institute. Biography Ruth Mar√≠a Rivera Mar√≠n was born in Mexico City on 18 June 1927 to parents Diego Rivera, a prominent Mexican muralist, and mother Guadalupe Mar√≠n Preciado, a well-known actress and writer. Her elder sister was Guadalupe Rivera Mar√≠n. She completed her primary education at the Escuela Alberto Correa and finished her secondary education at Secondary School N¬∞ 8. Rivera was the first woman to study architecture at the College of Engineering and Architecture of the National Polytechnic Institute and graduated in 1950 with the degree title of engineer-architect of the College of Engineering and Architecture (ESIA). Simultaneously with her studies of architecture, Rivera studied dance with Waldeen Falkenstein and acting with Seki Sano and appeared in stage productions. She married Rafael Coronel, well known Mexican painter and they had three children, Ruth Maria, Pedro Diego and Juan Rafael. In 1947, Rivera began teaching visual arts at the Teacher's training college and at the La Esmeralda School of Painting and Sculpture. She participated in the Social Service Brigades of 1948, doing her public service in Celaya, Guanajuato and drafting a master plan for the city before heading to Italy in 1950 for further studies. She studied urban rehabilitation at the Institute of Restoration in Rome for two years. After her graduation, Rivera returned to Mexico and began teaching in 1952 at the EISA. She taught subjects related to theory of Architecture, Architectural Composition Workshop Planning and Urban and planning theory. During the early years of her career she also pursued in subjects such as literature, anthropology, theater, dance and fine arts. She actively interacted with Diego Rivera (her father), Juan O'Gorman, Pedro Ramirez Vazquez and Enrique Yanez and furthered her intellectual acumen and nationalist ideas. Anahuacalli Museum in Coyoacan. From the early 1960s to 1964, Rivera was head of planning for the SEP on the National System of Regional Rural Schools. Rivera was involved with the building of the National Medical Center (). She worked on the Museum of Modern Art Chapultepec in close collaboration with Pedro Ramirez Vazquez. Rivera also worked with Luis Barrag√°n on the Museum \\"El Eco\\" in Mexico City. Her most noted work was the creation of the Anahuacalli Museum in Coyoacan in association with her father, Diego Rivera, and Juan O'Gorman. In 1962, she designed the Mexican Pavilion for the Century 21 Fair in Seattle alongside Carlos Mijares Bracho. She was a delegate in the 1964 International Architects Congress held in Budapest. She was the head of the Architecture Departments at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes from 1959-1969 (which ran the Museo Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.) However, she had been involved with INBA almost since its foundation, assisting Enrique Y√°√±ez in archiving Mexico's modern architecture. Rivera published many articles and books. She managed the Journal Cuadernos de Arquitectura y Conservaci√≥n del Patrimonio Art√≠stico of the INBA, which initially had a supplement called the Cuadernos de Arquitectura (Notebook of Architecture). The Notebook became a separate publication under Rivera and evolved into \\"one of the most important publishing projects for the Institute\\" discussing both technical and artistic components of architecture. Though its publication lasted only from 1961 to 1967, its theoretical and practical significance and value as the basis for teaching spurred an effort concluded in 2014 to collect all 20 volumes and digitize them as a lasting reference. Rivera died on 15 December 1969 in Mexico City. Posthumously, the Architecture Center at INBA was renamed in her honor. Memberships Rivera was a member of many institutions. Some of her active work in both national and international organizations were in the College of Architects of Mexico, the Mexican Society of Architects, the Mexican Association of Art Critics, and ICOMOS, the Subcommittee on UNESCO Museums.

The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by Giles Lamb. The trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a positive reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone. Criticism was reserved for its lack of gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. Retrospectively, the trailer has been considered as being vastly superior to the actual game and seen as one of the best video game trailers ever made. Plot The story is presented in reverse chronological order and in slow motion. The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected zombie outbreak occurs. The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus. The father opens the door and picks up a fire axe to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck. To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies. The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game. Development Dead Island, originally announced in 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement. The trailer was produced and made by the Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in- game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting. The team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly. They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the \\"discovery\\" of the outbreak, its inevitability, and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story. The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies. The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling. Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in slow motion, as they believed that it could make the action feel \\"balletic\\" instead of purely violent. The trailer is made up of computer imagery, and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of Dead Island. The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of \\"artwork\\", stating influence from the Carousel trailer from Philips. The trailer was also designed to showcase \\"great zombie moments\\" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters. The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island. The trailer's music was composed by Giles Lamb, who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas. The music was designed to be \\"somber\\", \\"melancholy\\", and \\"elegant\\", in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer. The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a \\"juxtaposition between beauty and horror\\". Popular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy. Reception A week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through YouTube, exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views. Dead Island also became one of the most searched items on Google, YouTube, and Twitter for several days. Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity. Following the trailer's release, Dead Island became a widely anticipated game. Many critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from The Guardian compared it favorably to Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience. Mike Fahey from Kotaku called the trailer's use of the dead girl \\"heartbreaking\\" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game. Its graphics and pacing also received commendation. The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse. Jason Schreier from Wired said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again. The trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually \\"shy away from\\", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer. Ben Parfitt from MCV found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark. Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative. Robert Rath from The Escapist also liked the segment, calling it \\"deliberate and necessary\\", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer. The lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations. The trailer was given a gold award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made. =Legacy= A live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans. The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver. The announcement trailer for Dead Island: Riptide, released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone. A trailer for Goat Simulator in 2014 also mimicked the format of the Dead Island announcement trailer. A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by Lionsgate, though the project was ultimately cancelled. Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of Dead Island: Definitive Edition in May 2016.

Yazan is best known for his public art displays, including graffiti, murals, and sculptures. His murals can be found on buildings across Beirut, and often depict portraits of important Lebanese and Middle Eastern figures. Halwani, a graduate of American University of Beirut and Harvard Business School, started painting to protest against Lebanon's traditionally-sectarian politics and the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). His art celebrates Lebanon's unique cultural heritage and the creation of a unified national identity of secularism. Yazan's most recognizable work is the Eternal Sabah mural in Beirut's Hamra neighborhood, portraying the famous Lebanese singer and artist, Sabah. Artwork and style Eternal Sabah Mural by Yazan Halwani on Assaf building in Hamra, Beirut In 2007, Yazan started experimenting with graffiti benefiting from the loose regulation towards graffiti in Beirut. In 2011, Yazan decided to change his style and create a mural style that is independent of the west, by leveraging Arabic calligraphy and portraits of Arab people. He frequently reports that his shift in style was accompanied by a shift in attitude: \\"Graffiti has a strong connotation of vandalism, but in my city most people do vandalism: Lebanese Civil War, corrupt politicians. This is why I try to make my murals a constructive expression of the city.\\" Yazan's calligraffiti style uses Arabic letters to form intricate, modern and stylized Arabic calligraphy compositions that are an essential element of his art work. His calligraphy does not focus on the meaning of the words but on their shape, movement, or the composition: traditional Arabic calligraphy for him has always been formed by the meaning of the words (usually excerpts from the Koran, poems, or sayings) and the shape of the calligraphy; Yazan challenges tradition by removing the meaning of the words to focus solely on the task of the calligrapher. Hence his calligraphy is used as a \\"pixel\\" for a portrait, a way to note music, or a way to show movement. Yazan was initially influenced by the western hip hop and graffiti scene from the US and Europe. But living in the Middle-East, he soon turned his attention to Middle Eastern art and Arabic calligraphy through an Arabic calligraphy book that his uncle shared with him. Yazan subsequently evolved his style to paint images, words and letters that have an oriental touch and inspiration. Another distinctive element of Yazan's art is the focus on portraits as a central element within a mural or a painting In addition to his murals, the artist has recently started installing sculptures made of cement on the street. Yazan's murals are characterized by their size, themes and portraits that include portraits of Arab and Lebanese artists, cultural icons, and faces of Arabs. His biggest murals is a full building painted with the portrait of Lebanese singer Sabah at the heart of Hamra, Beirut, on a building that housed before the Lebanese Civil War the Horseshoe cafe, a popular hangout for Arab artists and writers such as Paul Guiragossian, Nizar Qabbani and Mahmoud Darwish. Another mural in Germany that attracted international attention was entitled \\"The Flower Salesman\\" which depicts a Syrian child called Fares that used to sell flowers in Beirut and died during the Syrian Civil War.

Before the discovery of Megamastax, it was thought that jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) were limited in size and variation before the Devonian period. Megamastax is known only from jaw bones and it is estimated that it reached about long. Discovery and naming Fossils of Megamastax were found at Kuanti Formation in Qujing, Yunnan, China. The holotype of Megamastax amblyodus is IVPP V18499.1, a complete left mandible. Two additional specimens, IVPP V18499.2 (a partial left mandible) and IVPP V18499.3 (a right maxilla) have been referred to the species. The generic name of Megamastax is Greek for \\"big mouth\\", derived from megalos (big) and mastax (mouth). The species name, amblyodus, translates to \\"blunt tooth\\".  Description  The lower jaws of Megamastax (F,G) compared to other Silurian jawed fish Although Megamastax can be safely considered a sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) due to having cosmine on its jaws, coronoid plates, a prearticular bone, and a biconcave glenoid, it is unique among early jawed fish for its jaw and teeth structure. Although most early osteichthyans have only one row of sharp marginal teeth along the edge of the jaw, Megamastax has two rows of small marginal teeth. In addition, Megamastax uniquely has a row of large, blunt teeth fused to four coronoid bones on the inside edge of each mandible. Similar genera such as Psarolepis and Guiyu have sharp fangs on their five coronoids while poroplepiformes and tetrapodomorphs have tusk-like teeth and three coronoids. Using the body plans of Devonian osteichthyans as a guide, it can be estimated that the mandibles of Megamastax occupy between a fifth and a seventh of the total body length. If this is true, then IVPP V18499.1 had a length of and IVPP V18499.2 had a length of . Given these large estimates, Megamastax was the largest known Silurian vertebrate.  Paleobiology  Life restoration of Megamastax feeding on Dunyu With rounded coronoid teeth, Megamastax could have fed on hard-shelled animals. Extant fish with crushing teeth, such as wolf eels and horn sharks, generally have such teeth at the front of the jaw, separate from the coronoids. Although Megamastax differs from these fish by having its teeth and coronoids run the entire length of the jaw, this could simply be a result of having a different method of prey capture. While low body sizes for Silurian vertebrates has traditionally been seen as a result of the Silurian having low levels of atmospheric oxygen (as large vertebrates are susceptible to hypoxia), recent analyses have shown that terrestrial plant life was more well established in the Silurian than once thought, providing a previously unknown source of oxygen. In addition, new Paleozoic atmospheric models indicate that oxygen levels were actually around modern levels by the end of the Silurian period. Although it is not certain that Megamastax's large size is a result of this atmospheric trend, the presence of such a large fish at this period does weaken the argument that a lack of large Silurian vertebrates can be used as evidence of low oxygen levels.  Paleoecology  Various hard-shelled animals were present in the late Silurian of China, including brachipods, molluscs, trilobites, and even armored fish like placoderms and galeaspids. Due to its large size and predatory lifestyle, Megamastax could be considered the first vertebrate apex predator.

She is a clinical sexologist and award-winning author of several books on sexual health, self-empowerment, and breast cancer. A pioneer in the field of sexual health and empowerment, Dr. Ferrer began her journey providing workshops on sexual health and empowerment to women in Evergreen State College and across the Pacific Northwest. Her first book, The W.I.S.E. Journal for the Sensual Woman became an international success and lead to her invitation to lecture throughout the US and Latin America; where she taught medical providers and mental health practitioners the value of respecting their patients‚Äô sexual orientations and preferences to enable physicians to provide the best care possible. Since receiving her Masters in Counseling Psychology from Saint Martin's University in 1996 and her Doctorate in Human Sexuality in 2000, Dr. Ferrer has made it her mission to educate the medical community, as well as, men and women on a healthier perspective of sexual health, sexual orientation, and sexual identity. Dr. Ferrer worked with various organizations providing mental health and therapeutic assistance to those affected and infected by HIV; as well as, educating individuals on how to incorporate safe sexual practices into their lifestyle to decrease the risk of infection. Dr. Charley was among those who helped pave the way for this discriminated population to have a voice and empower themselves. In 2005, Dr. Charley Ferrer spoke before the World Association of Sexual Health providing education an on another group of men and women who were discriminated against due to their sexual practices and self-identity; this being the dominance and submissive lifestyle, better known as the BDSM Community. (BDSM stands for Bondage, Discipline, Sadomasochism). Her educational platform provided a greater understanding to the medical community on the practices of this alternative lifestyle who faced discrimination so great that they were at risk of losing their children, their financial stability, even their family support and acceptance. Her pioneering lectures were a call to action for the medical and mental health practitioners to educate themselves on sexual orientation, preferences, and lifestyles to enable them to provide treatment without prejudice. Her controversial lectures and call to action prompted much discussion with attendees at the World Association of Sexual Health Congress. During that event, she was invited to lecture before the XIII CONGRESO VENEZOLANO DE SEXOLOG√çA in Venezuela in 2005, and again in 2008. Her dedication to the sexual empowerment of men and women facilitated a collaboration between her and medical providers from Venezuela and Argentina to establish the Institute of Pleasure (Instituto de Placer). Dr. Ferrer has also worked for over a decade providing sexual behavioral education to individuals with developmental delays within the OMRDD community of New York City. In the summer of 2010, the State of Falcon in Venezuela invited Dr. Ferrer to join a group of respected physicians and sexologists from across Latin America to tour throughout the state of Falcon and provide sexual health education to the populace there. She was the only American Latina Sexologist to be invited. For three days, her group drove out of the capital of Falcon to the outskirts of the state, sometimes driving for three hours to reach their destination--a small town--where they conducted interactive discussions on sexual health and STD/STI risk reduction, and self- empowerment. Dr. Ferrer‚Äôs innovative approach to sexual health and acceptance of alternative sexual lifestyles prompted numerous invitations to lecture throughout the US and Latin America. In March 2013, she was invited to speak before the Chinese Sexology Association in China. Dr. Ferrer was among a handful of representatives from the Institute of Advanced Studies of Human Sexuality (IASHS) and sexologists around the globe to exchange ideas on sexual health and reform before the Chinese Sexology Association in Guangzhou and Hangzhou, China. An excerpt of her lecture, and those of other presenters, was published in the book, Yin Rising: The Chinese Sexual Evolution. This monumental conference opened the door to collaboration on sexual health between the US and China‚Äôs sexologist and health practitioners in association with IASHS. Dr. Ferrer returned to China in 2014 to conduct further educational lectures. Over the past two decades, Dr. Charley Ferrer has taught psychology and human sexuality courses as well as lectured on self-empowerment and breast cancer at various colleges and universities. Below are just a few of the colleges and Universities she‚Äôs taught or lectured at: Rutgers University, Centralia Community College, Evergreen State College, Tacoma Community College, Brandis University. Dr. Charley Ferrer leverages her expertise and her notoriety to bring professionalism and respect to a world of sexuality and alternative lifestyle which faced blatant discrimination and established workshops and educational programs to education medical providers and mental health practitioners concerning the lifestyle of dominance and submission; better known as the BDSM community. Since 1996, Dr. Ferrer has lectured and provided education on this community. In the summer of 2012, Dr. Ferrer established BDSM Writers Con, a three-day conference which provides accurate education on BDSM to authors and readers of this genre/lifestyle. It‚Äôs her hope that BDSM Writers Con will help reduce the discrimination faced by men and women who embrace this lifestyle. It wasn‚Äôt until the book, 50 Shades of Grey by E.L. James that BDSM became a popular discussion topic and the world began to loosening its deeply held prejudices toward the men and women who embrace this alternative lifestyle. Though dominance and submission is still a taboo lifestyle, some strides have been made to lessen the prejudices faced by this community. Currently, BDSM Writers Con is the only conference in the world dedicated to educating authors and readers on dominance and submission. Dr. Ferrer‚Äôs passion for education goes far beyond classrooms, workshops, and books. She‚Äôs been sourced in hundreds of articles throughout the world for her expertise in sexual health and her innovative pioneering educational outlook on sexual health and self-empowerment. In 2006, Dr. Charley Ferrer was recognized as one of the \\"Groundbreaking Latina Leaders‚Äù for her work in the field of Sexology and Sexual Health by the National Association for Latina Leaders in the US. And she‚Äôs been featured in the NY Post, NY Times, Cosmo, and Latin Magazine just to name a few. Dr. Charley Ferrer dedication to advocating for the underdog and bringing sexual health and empowerment to the world has taken many turns and paths and she herself face numerous obstacles and discrimination for her adamant defense of sexual freedom in all its forms. In February 2016, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she came face to face with a new form of discrimination which was so invasive and subtle that it has gone unnoticed or perhaps purposely overlooked for almost half a century. Dr. Ferrer witnessed and personally experienced the apathy and misogyny associated with breast cancer. Her anger at the behavior of many of the medical professionals she observed or interacted with lead to her establishing Cancer Tamer‚Äîa new voice in the struggle with cancer. Cancer Tamer is based on the philosophy that, ‚Äúyou should not be at war with your body!‚Äù Cancer Tamer provides education on ways to cope with the challenges women and their loved-one‚Äôs face while dealing with the complexities of breast cancer. Her book, Breast Cancer: From Diagnosis to Surgery provides valuable information to assist an individual in preparing for the road ahead, physically, mentally, and financially. Her popular television show providing information on cancer can be seen on YouTube and on the Cancer Tamer website. Surprised by the lack of attention and the reluctance of physicians to discuss sex and sexual dysfunction directly caused by treatments received and medications prescribed to cancer patients, Dr. Ferrer has combined her expertise in sexuality and her personal experience with breast cancer in her upcoming book, Sex AFTER Cancer. Dr. Charley‚Äôs objective to provide women with ways to reclaim their sensual identity after breast and ovarian cancer, as well as other forms of this disease, can be seen in her Body Love Retreats. Thus, continuing her dedication to bring sexual and sensual health to all. Check below for a list of books written by Dr. Charley Ferrer.

He is variously recognized as a writer of traditionalist or conservative historiography in his country.G√≥ngora et al., pp. 201‚Äì202 Early life and marriage Eyzaguirre was born into a religious upper class family in Santiago. As young man he studied law in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) and was member of the Catholic student organization Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Estudiantes Cat√≥licos. During his studies he was influenced by the Jesuit Fernando Vives and the writings of Manuel Lacunza. Eyzaguirre started to court Adriana Philippi in 1929 and married her in 1934.G√≥ngora et al., pp. 140‚Äì142 Essayist, historian and teacher The PUC founded its Pedagogy School (Escuela de Pedagog√≠a) in 1943 and contracted Eyzaguirre to be in charge of the History of Chile (Historia de Chile) classes. Most of the students of the time were priests, nuns and brothers. He was assisted by Mario G√≥ngora is some classes.G√≥ngora et al., pp. 177‚Äì178 Apart from this part-time work Eyzaguirre was also part-time teacher at Liceo Alem√°n. At the Pedagogy School Eyzaguirre met Ricardo Krebs, who was also history teacher but had rather few contacts, and introduced him to the Catholic intellectual elite of Santiago. His salary is reported to have been low at PUC and when \\"raised\\" it mostly had to do with the currency inflation experienced in Chile. Nevertheless he was allowed to rent a small local owned by the Archbishopric of Santiago at a relatively low price. Here, Eyzaguirre ran a small bookshop called El Arbol until the late 1950s when it was closed. Despite his economic hardships he twice refused to be assigned ambassador to Spain. Eyzaguirre thought any diplomatic work he did would need to compete with his work as historian and therefore he would not be able to accomplish a dedicated work in diplomacy. At the same time the writings of L√©on Bloy provided him with comfort about his economic hardship.G√≥ngora et al., pp. 156‚Äì160 =O'Higgins and Spain= A milestone in the work of Eyzaguirre was his essay O'Higgins that won a prize in 1946 to commemorate the centenary of the death of Bernardo O'Higgins. This was the first written work that granted Eyzaguirre some income. The prize reward helped Eyzaguirre to finance a trip to Spain in 1947.G√≥ngora et al., p. 194 This seven months long journey reinforced his leanings for Spanish heritage in his historiography.G√≥ngora et al., p. 154 In Spain Eyzaguirre held a course on Chilean political and constitutional history at Universidad Central de Madrid. His stay in Spain made him target of attacks in Chile from those critical of Francoist Spain, in particular from people associated with the National Falange party (not to be confused with the Spanish movement). Personally, Eyzaguirre admired the stoic stance of the isolated Francoist Spain against both Soviet and Western pressure but did never propagandize for Francoist Spain in Chile.G√≥ngora et al., pp. 225‚Äì226 =Back in Chile= For a time he was teacher of Jaime Guzm√°n. When the journal Historia was established in 1961 Eyzaguirre served as its first director. Generally Eyzaguirre dealt with similar topics as Lewis Hanke. He despised 19th century writers such as Jos√© Victorino Lastarria and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento because he considered they \\"ruptured\\" the historical links to Spain and characterized their views as \\"apostasy\\".G√≥ngora et al., pp. 221‚Äì222 The work of Eyzaguirre was criticized by left-wing historians.

Krishnamachari, former Finance Minister of India, Ranganathan was widowed in 1979, at the age of 33, when her husband died of health issues related to alcohol addiction. This prompted her to focus her attention to the problem of substance abuse and addiction. In order to prepare herself, Shanthi, holder of a Master's degree in Social Work from the Madras School of Social Work, joined the Hazelden Addiction Treatment Centre, Minneapolis for training in de- addiction programmes and started a day care centre in one of the family properties in Chennai, in 1980. The modest beginning, with a few assistants, grew to become the T. T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation, which now includes TTK Hospital, a 65 bedded treatment facility, the first Indian hospital dedicated for the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction. The institution works in coordination with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and is a participant of the anti-substance abuse programmes of the Government of India. She is also associated with the Swami Dayananda Saraswati Educational Society, and sits on its Board of Directors. The Government of India included her in the 1992 Republic Day Honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Shri. In 1999, when United Nations instituted the United Nations Vienna Civil Society Award, she was selected for the award for her Outstanding Contributions in the Fight Against Drug Abuse and Crime, making her the first recipient of the award. She is the recipient of the Avvaiyar Award by the Government of Tamil Nadu for the year 2015.

History On 27 November 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia decreed to abolish the Abkhazian KGB and to establish the State Security Service. On 4 December 1992, the Supreme Soviet shortened its name to Security Service of Abkhazia. Until 1992, the State Security Service was led by Grigori Komoshvili. After the outbreak of the 1992-1993 war with Georgia, Komoshvili's Deputy Gennadi Berulava became the new head. In early October 1993, after the war had ended, he was dismissed and succeeded by Astamur Tarba. On 20 November 1992, during the war, the Abkhazian border guard was established. =Government of President Ardzinba= On 5 May 1997, President Vladislav Ardzinba decreed to rename the Service back to State Security Service of Abkhazia. After a bomb attack on 13 December 1999 in Sukhumi targeting government officials, Ardzinba dismissed Astamur Tarba and replaced him with First Deputy Chairman of the State Customs Committee Raul Khajimba. On 18 June 2001, Khajimba also became First Vice Premier, and on 1 November he was replaced as State Security Service Head by Interior Minister Zurab Agumava. On 2 April 2003, Agumava was replaced by Advisor to the President on Military Matters Givi Agrba. Agrba handed in his resignation on 15 June 2004 along with Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba and First Vice Premier Astamur Tarba following the murder of opposition politician Garri Aiba. Agrba's resignation was accepted by Ardzinba on 7 July and he was replaced by Mikhail Tarba. =Governments of Presidents Bagapsh and Ankvab= Following the Tangerine Revolution and the election of President Sergei Bagapsh in 2005, he appointed Iuri Ashuba as Security Service Head on 28 February 2005. After his December 2009 re-election, he replaced Ashuba with Aslan Bzhania on 23 February 2010. Bzhania remained Security Service Head following the death in office of Bagapsh and the 2011 election of Alexander Ankvab. =Government of President Khajimba= After the May 2014 Revolution and Ankvab's forced resignation, Bzhania became the candidate representing the outgoing government in the August 2014 Presidential election. After his loss to opposition candidate Raul Khajimba, he was replaced as Security Service Head by his deputy (and head of the Border Guard) Zurab Margania on 29 September.

It is classified as critically endangered. Description The Mangareva kingfisher has a cream-coloured head and neck, with blue ear-coverts, a white chin and frequently a rufous band across the breast. The crown has a variable amount of blue feathers. Mantle, back, rump, wings and tail are blue. Distribution and habitat The species only occurs on the island of Niau in the Tuamotus, French Polynesia. It prefers semi-open habitat, including coconut plantations, limestone forests, and cultivated areas around villages. Foraging may take place in wetlands and coastal areas. Ecology Like many kingfishers, the Mangareva kingfisher is a terrestrial perch hunter. Hunting takes place from elevated positions, particularly in coconut plantations with open understory and exposed ground. The species takes insects and small lizards, the latter being the main food for chicks. Breeding takes place primarily from September to January in nest cavities excavated from dead and decaying coconut palms. Threats and conservation The population of the Mangareva kingfisher appears to have never been very high in recent decades, and has fluctuated heavily in the 2000s. Total numbers of 400-600 birds were reported in 1974, with a drop to 39-51 individuals in 2003 and 2004, and as subsequent rise to an apparently stable population of 135 individuals in 2009. The species is currently classified as critically endangered by the IUCN due to the very small population size and heavily restricted distribution. The main threats contributing to the species' decline are thought to be predation by cats on nestlings, food competition with rats, a lack of suitable nesting trees (particularly old coconut palms), and generally favourable hunting habitat, as it prefers landscapes cleared with regular burning, a practice that is seeing less use.

Introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine and all round independent suspension. It has undergone continuous development, though the basic concept has remained unchanged.Corlett, p. 12 The engines were air- cooled until the introduction of the Type 996 in 1998, with the 993, produced from 1994‚Äì1998 model years, being the last of the air-cooled Porsche sports cars. The 911 has been modified by private teams and by the factory itself for racing, rallying, and other forms of automotive competition. It is among the most successful competition cars. In the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won major world championship sports car races, such as Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Daytona, even against prototypes. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979 and Porsche won World Championship for Makes titles in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 with 911-derived models. In the 1999 international poll to determine the Car of the Century, the 911 came fifth. It is one of two in the top five that had remained continuously in production (the original Beetle remained in production until 2003),Paternie, p. 7 and was until 1998 a successful surviving application of the air- (now water-) cooled opposed rear-engine layout pioneered by its ancestor, the Porsche 356. It is one of the oldest sports coup√© nameplates still in production with one million manufactured as of May 2017. 911 nomenclature Although Porsche changes the internal codes for its models, all 911 models were and are currently sold as a \\"911\\".

Air-cooled engines (1963‚Äì1998) =911, 911E, 911L, 911S, 911T= 2019 Geneva Motor Showalt= The 911 traces its roots to sketches drawn by Ferdinand \\"Butzi\\" Porsche in 1959.Paternie, Red Book, p. 8 The Porsche 911 was developed as a more powerful, larger and a more comfortable replacement for the 356, the company's first model. The new car made its public debut at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show ().Paternie, p. 11 The car was developed with the proof-of-concept twin-fan Type 745 flat-six engine, but the car presented at the auto show had a non-operational mockup of the single-fan 901 engine, receiving a working unit in February 1964. It originally was designated as the \\"Porsche 901\\" (901 being its internal project number). A total of 82 cars were built as which were badges as 901s. However, French automobile manufacturer Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. Instead of selling the new model with a different name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. Internally, the cars' part numbers carried on the prefix 901 for years. Production began in September 1964, with the first 911s exported to the US in February 1965. The first models of the 911 had a rear-mounted [1] Type 901/01 flat-6 engine, in the \\"boxer\\" configuration like the 356, the engine is air-cooled and displaces as compared to the 356's four- cylinder, unit. The car had four seats although the rear seats were small, thus it is usually called a 2+2 rather than a four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). A four or five-speed \\"Type 901\\" manual transmission was available. The styling was largely penned by Ferdinand \\"Butzi\\" Porsche, son of Ferdinand \\"Ferry\\" Porsche. Butzi Porsche initially came up with a notchback design with proper space for seating two rear passengers but Ferry Porsche insisted that the 356's successor was to use its fastback styling. 7 prototypes were built based on Butzi Porsche's original design and were internally called the Porsche 754 T7. Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who initially objected, was also involved later in the design. The 911-based 912, powered by a flat-4 engine (1967) Production of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market for a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the US. The 912, introduced in the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, , boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodywork with Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual transmission was optional). In 1966, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S with Type 901/02 engine having a power output of . Forged aluminum alloy wheels from Fuchs, with a 5-spoke design, were offered for the first time. In motorsport at the same time, the engine was developed into the Type 901/20 and was installed in the mid-engine 904 and 906 with an increased power output of , as well as fuel injected Type 901/21 installed in later variants of the 906 and 910 with a power output of . In August 1967, the A series went into production with dual brake circuits and widened (5.5J-15) wheels still fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 165HR15 CA67 tyres., and the previously standard gasoline-burning heater became optional. The Targa (meaning \\"plate\\" in ItalianPaternie, Red Book, p. 9) version was introduced. The Targa had a stainless steel-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open convertibles to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \\"Targa\\" came from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered from 1968). Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe (1964) at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart The 911 R (1967) The 911T was also launched in 1967 with Type 901/03 engine. The model was renamed the 911L with Type 901/06 engine and ventilated front disc brakes. The brakes had been introduced on the previous 911S. The 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited production (20 in all), as this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass reinforced plastic doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin overhead camshafts, and a power output of . A clutchless semi-automatic Sportomatic model, composed of a torque converter, an automatic clutch, and the four-speed transmission was added in Autumn 1967. It was canceled after the 1980 model yearPaternie, p. 36 partly because of the elimination of a forward gear to make it a three-speed. The B series went into production in August 1968, replacing the 911L model with 911E with fuel injection. It remained in production until July 1969. The 911E gained 185/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36. and 6J-15 wheels. The C series was introduced in August 1969 with an enlarged 2.2-litre engine (84 mm bore x 66 mm stroke). The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from , to help as a remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine). The D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971. The 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine ( at 6,200 rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 ( at 6,500 rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to . The E series for 1972‚Äì1973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger engine. This is known as the \\"2.4 L\\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres. The 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was carbureted, except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130 hp) to 140 hp commonly known as a 911T/E. With power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \\"dog-leg\\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \\"Oil Klapper\\", \\"√ñlklappe\\" or \\"Vierte T√ºr (4th door)\\". The F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from Bosch on Type 911/91 engine. 911S models also gained a small spoiler under the front bumper to improve high- speed stability. The cars weighed . The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either or displacement, having a power output of at 8,000 rpm. Weight was down to . The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the Sebring 12 Hours, the 1000 km N√ºrburgring, and the Targa Florio. =911 Carrera RS (1973 and 1974)= 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 touring RS stands for Rennsport in German, meaning race sport. The Carrera name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet motorsport homologation requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2,687 cc) developing with Bosch (Kugelfischer) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \\"ducktail\\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 & 215/60VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres. In RS Touring form it weighed , in Sport Lightweight form it was about lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the FIA Group 4 class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with engines rated at . The 911 RSR For the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \\"whale tail\\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres. In 1974, Porsche developed the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection rated at . Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the 917 racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around . The Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974 and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's commitment to turbocharger applications in its cars. =911 and 911S 2.7 (1973‚Äì1977)= Model year 1974 (G Series August 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2,687 cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact bumpers conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up-- the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine rated at and , respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to for Model Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10 hp between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at . =Carrera 2.7 MFI and CIS (1974‚Äì1976)= The Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced . The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup√©s weighed in at , the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring. For the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \\"ducktail\\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T√úV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced 930 Turbo. The Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model year, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup√©s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine. =912E (1976)= For the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the Volkswagen 2.0 engine also used in the Porsche 914 for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine Porsche 924 for the 1977 model year. =Carrera 3.0 (1976‚Äì1977)= Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 For the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994 cc engine (minus the turbocharger). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's . The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased. The new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, in 6.1 seconds and in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately . Weight increased marginally by to . The 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup√© (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatic cars. =930 Turbo and Turbo Carrera 3.0-litre (1975‚Äì1977)= Porsche 911 Turbo (930) For the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production turbocharged 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide 205/50R15 & 225/50R15 Pirelli P7 tyres, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \\"whale tail\\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine and four-speed manual transmission. The Porsche 934, one of the first racing versions of the 930 Turbo The Porsche 935 known for its signature \\"slant nose\\" front Production of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the Porsche 934 of 1976 participating at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and other races including battles with the BMW 3.0 CSL \\"Batmobile\\". The FIA Group 5 version called Porsche 935 evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \\"slant nose\\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed. =930 Turbo 3.3-litre (1978‚Äì1989)= Porsche 930 3.3-litre, distinguished by its raised \\"whale-tail\\" rear wing For the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre turbocharged engine with intercooler rated at . To fit the intercooler a newly designed \\"tea-tray\\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \\"Carrera\\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models. In 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the 964 turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then. =911SC (1978‚Äì1983)= 1983 Porsche 911 Super Carrera, the last production year of the Super Carrera Henri Toivonen at rallye des 1000 pistes in 1984 on a Porsche 911 SC RS In 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \\"SC\\" stands for \\"Super Carrera\\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was , later and then in 1981 it was increased to . The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The convertible body design also featured four-wheel drive, although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the 356 of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.P. 77 Paternie, P (2000). Porsche 911 Red Book 1965‚Äì1999 Motorbooks International. Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since. In 1979, Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new 928 company flagship. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars. Peter W. Schutz (CEO Porsche AG 1981‚Äì1987) wrote: =Carrera 3.2 (1984‚Äì1989)= 1987 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet and \\"Carrera Targa\\" The replacement for the SC series came in 1984 as the 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies. A new higher-displacement engine, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder unit, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.Corlett, p. 13 The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from Getrag, model number G50 with proven BorgWarner synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch. With the new engine, power was increased to (at 5,900 rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to (at 5,900 rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of as measured by Autocar. Factory figures were more modest: 0‚Äì60 mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market. The brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan. Driving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control components to an L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to (at 5,900 rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany. Three basic models were available ‚Äì coup√©, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboard featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986. In 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \\"Turbo-look\\". It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \\"tea tray\\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the turbo and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available. 1988 Porsche Carrera CS In 1985, Porsche introduced the first Carrera Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a 911 Club Sport Row (Rest Of World) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered for a Porsche driver that was particularly inspired by the CS prototype on the track. From 1987 to September 1989, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera purposely built for club racing, it gained engine and suspension modifications. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two units), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \\"Carrera\\" logo, all in order to save an estimated in weight. With the exception of CS cars delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \\"CS Club Sport\\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS cars did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all have a \\"SP\\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK cars were all finished \\"Grand Prix White\\" with a red \\"Carrera CS\\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the standard 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989. In 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas), 250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries. For 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup√©s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic), and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \\"silk grey\\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \\"25th Anniversary Special Edition\\" badges Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Speedster The 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104 units) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171 units. The Speedster started as a design under in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.Corlett, p. 45 Total production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup√©, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).Corlett, p. 74 According to the manufacturer in 2014, an estimate of around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road at that date. =964 Series (1989‚Äì1993)= 1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 For 1989 the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the 959 flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing recession and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \\"4\\" indicating four-wheel-drive, demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. Drag coefficient was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, ABS brakes and power steering made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3,600 cc and was rated at 250 PS (184 kW). The rear-wheel-drive version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later. The 964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3 L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6 L engine of the other 964 models was introduced. In 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time Tiptronic automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual airbags standard (from 1991), the first being the 944 Turbo (from 1987). Porsche 964 Carrera RS In 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 units were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RS America cars were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300 PS (221 kW) engine. Since the RS/RS America was intended as a no-compromise, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a limited-slip differential, AM/FM cassette stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism. 964 Turbo (1990‚Äì1994) Porsche 964 Turbo In 1990 Porsche introduced a Turbocharged version of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a stillborn project that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3 L engine, improved to have a power output of 320 PS (235 kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6 L engine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare. =993 Series (1994‚Äìmid 1998)= The mid-nineties Type 993 had sleeker bodywork. This is the high-performance GT2 variant The 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the air-cooled 911 first introduced in 1964. Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series. As Car & Driver noted, \\"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\\" with an \\"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\\" Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \\"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\\"http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesand services/classic/models/993/993/ \\"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\\"James Edition, 28 April 2015, \\"The Classic Porsche 911 Market Continues to Surprise.\\" The exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the 959. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief Harm Lagaay and was completed in 1991. Along with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn Porsche 989's rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree. The Porsche 993 Carrera RS continued the tradition of a light weight and minimalist 911 beginning with the 1973 Carrera RS The new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6 L, but power rose to 272 PS (200 kW / 268 hp) due to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286 PS (210 kW / 281 hp). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \\"Varioram\\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12 hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the rear-wheel-drive versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS variant had a 3.8 L engine rated at 300 PS (221 kW / 296 hp), and was only rear-wheel drive. The Porsche 993 Targa had a departure from the classic Targa design, incorporating an expensive glass sliding roof mechanism The Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window. The expensive air-cooled 993 Targa had a limited production run between 1996 and 1998. [Production numbers: 1996: US/Can: 462 ROW: 1980, 1997: US/Can: 567 ROW: 1276, 1998: US/Can: 122 (100 Tiptronic / 22 Manual)] As an investment, the 1997 and 1998 Carrera S version has proven the most desirable (apart from even rarer models such as the RS and Turbo S). \\"Many find that they are the best looking 911 there is and used prices have always seemed to reflect this. They command a hefty premium in today's market and the very best example wide body cars can be priced more than the higher mileage Turbos.\\"993 Buying Guide, www.jackals- forge.com/lotus/993/993_buy_guide.html. Of the widebody 993 series, \\"The purists will want 2 wheel drive and nothing else will do.\\"993 Buying Guide; Id. Similarly, purists will insist upon the manual transmission over the automatic \\"Tiptronic\\" version; this is even more true in the case of the 993 as compared with other models, because Porsche 993s were the first production model (apart from the 959 flagship sports car) to feature a 6-speed manual transmission. The C2S wide-body 993 models are in scarce supply, with none built in 1995 or 1996, and just 759 units made for North America in 1997, with a final supply of 993 in 1998, for a total of 1,752 C2S examples overall. 993 Turbo (1995‚Äì1997) Porsche 993 Turbo A Turbocharged version of the 993 was launched in 1995 and became the first standard production Porsche with twin turbochargers and the first 911 Turbo to be equipped with permanent all- wheel-drive (the homologated GT2 version based on the Turbo retained RWD). The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the 959.(f.e. Car and Driver, July 1997, p. 63) The 3.6 L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at 408 PS (300 kW / 402 hp). The performance was outstanding at the time, as 0 to 97 km/h (60 mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the same speed. The car's top speed was measured at at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produced in 1996 and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices. In 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24 PS (17.7 kW) over the regular Turbo's 408 PS (300 kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added. Water-cooled engines (1998‚Äìpresent) =996 (1998/9‚Äì2005)= 996 Carrera 4S The Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a water-cooled flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34 years, and the body shell received its first major re- design. Changing to a water-cooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who noted this as the end of the 'true' 911. The 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine entry-level Boxster. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003. The Carrera variant had a 0.30 coefficient of drag. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s. The Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented GT3 and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the forced-induction 996 Turbo and GT2. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and had a twin-turbocharged engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale. The Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained. Engine displacement was 3.4 L and power output was featuring a change to an \\"integrated dry sump\\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6 L and power received an increase to 320 PS (235 kW). The folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120 km/h (75 mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch. Starting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear limited-slip differential, except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220. 996 GT3 (1999‚Äì2004) 996 GT3 996 GT3 RS Porsche introduced a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the 911 GT1 '98 sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm. The engine used was a naturally aspirated flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at at first and later improved to at the end of the 996 series' revision. 996 Turbo (2001‚Äì2005) 996 Turbo 996 Turbo S In 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type 996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of . Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that increased the engine output to with of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0‚Äì100 km/h (0‚Äì62 mph) in 3.91 seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power-- 450 PS (331 kW) and 620 N¬∑m (457 lb¬∑ftf)-- than the standard Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of .Paternie, p. 92 The styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper. =997 (2005‚Äì2012)= 997 Carrera 997 Carrera S 997 Carrera 4S The 996 was replaced with the 997 in 2005. It retains the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it. Initially, two versions of the 997 were introduced-- the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera had a power output of 325 PS (239 kW) from its 3.6 L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8 L 355 PS (261 kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S. Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19 inch (48 cm) \\"Lobster Fork\\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and a sports steering wheel. In late 2005, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76 inches (32 mm) to cover wider rear tyres. The 0‚Äì100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time for the Carrera 4S with the engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8 seconds. The 0‚Äì100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the was noted to be as fast as 4.2 seconds in a Motor Trend comparison, and Road & Track has timed it at 3.8 seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively. The Targas (4 and 4S), released in November 2006, are 4-wheel-drive versions that divide the difference between the coup√©s and the cabriolets with their dual, sliding glass tops. Porsche 997 GTS The 997 received a larger air intake in the front bumper, new headlights, new rear taillights, new clean-sheet design direct fuel injection engines, and the introduction of a dual-clutch gearbox called PDK for the 2009 model year. They were also equipped with Bluetooth support. The change to the 7th generation (991) took place in the middle of the 2012 model year. A 2012 Porsche 911 can either be a 997 or a 991, depending on the month of the production. 997 Turbo 997 Turbo The Turbocharged version of the 997 series featured the same 3.6 L twin-turbocharged engine as the 996 Turbo, with modifications to have a power output of and of torque. It has VTG (variable turbine geometry), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo. The 997 Turbo features a new all-wheel- drive system, similar to the one found on the Cayenne. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions. For the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009, the PTM system was tweaked to give a more rearward power bias. The paddle shifters for the PDK double-clutch gearbox debuted on the Turbo. The turbo uses a different engine. The previous water-cooled turbo models (996 and 997) measured 3,600cc. This new engine measures 3,800cc (3.8 litres) and was first developed for the Carrera that was launched in 2008. The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system were uprated. The engine has a power output of which is 20 hp more than the outgoing model. The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package. Porsche claimed that the new 911 turbo will accelerate from in 3.4 seconds, or 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds and could attain a top-speed of . As with the 996 Turbo, the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carrera models including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit. A new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard. It also comes with re engineered turbo chargers to give an extra 30 horsepower increase to a total of . 997 GT3 997 GT3 The 911 GT3 was added to the 997 lineage on 23 February 2006. Performance figures include a acceleration time of 4.1 seconds and a top speed of , almost as fast as the Turbo. Porsche's factory reports were proven to be conservative about the performance of the car; Excellence magazine tested the 997 GT3 and recorded a 0‚Äì100 km/h of 3.9 seconds and a top speed of . It was at that time crowned \\"the best handling car in America\\" by Motor Trend. 997 GT3 RS 997 GT3 RS 4.0 The 911 GT3 RS was announced in early 2006 as a homologation version of the GT3 RSR racing car for competition events like Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The drivetrain of the RS is based on the 911 GT3, except for the addition of a lightweight flywheel and closer gear ratios for further improved response under acceleration. Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track. Visually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme ‚Äì bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973. The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing. The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator. The European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage. Production of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009. An estimated 413 units were delivered to the US and the worldwide production run is estimated to be under 2,000 vehicles. In August 2009, Porsche announced the second generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 3.8-litre engine having a power output of , a modified suspension, dynamic engine mounts, new titanium sport exhaust, and modified lightweight bodywork. In April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine having a power output of , Porsche designed the GT3 RS 4.0 using lightweight components such as bucket seats, carbon-fibre bonnet and front wings, and poly carbonate plastic rear windows for weight reduction, while using suspension components from the racing version. Other characteristics include low centre of gravity, a large rear wing and an aerodynamically optimised body. The lateral front air deflection vanes, a first on a production Porsche, increase downforce on the front axle. Aided by a steeply inclined rear wing, aerodynamic forces exert an additional 190 kg, enhancing the 911 GT3 RS 4.0's grip to the tarmac. The GT3 RS 4.0 weighs . 997 GT2 997 GT2 The Type 996 911 GT2 was superseded by the Type 997 GT2 in 2007. The new car was announced on 16 July of that year, but was launched during the 62nd Frankfurt Motor Show, held every other year in Frankfurt, Germany. It arrived in dealerships from November 2007. The 997 GT2 has a twin-turbocharged 3.6-litre flat-6 engine, which generates at 6,500 rpm, and of torque from 2,200 to 4,500 rpm. It has a 6-speed manual transmission and is rear wheel drive. With a curb weight of , the 997 GT2 accelerates from in 3.6 seconds, and from 0 to 161 km/h (100 mph) in 7.4 seconds, and has a top speed of . This makes it the first street-legal 911 to exceed 322 km/h (200 mph) barrier, with the exception of the 1998 911 GT1 road car (which is broadly considered not to be a true 911 due to its mid-mounted engine). Motor Trend tested a 2008 Porsche 911 GT2 and found the 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration time at 3.4 seconds, and 11.4 seconds at for the quarter mile. The GT2 also recorded a braking distance from of and recorded 1.10g lateral grip. The GT2 made an appearance on Top Gear, where it had a lap time of 1:19.5, faster than a Carrera GT by .3 of a second. Its appearance differs slightly from its sister-car, the 911 (997) Turbo, in a few ways. It does not have fog lights in the front bumper, it has a revised front lip, it has a different rear wing (with two small air scoops on either side), and it has a different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes). The 997 GT2 is also different from the 997 Turbo in that it is rear- wheel-drive rather than all-wheel-drive. 997 GT2 RS 997 GT2 RS On 4 May 2010, an RS variant was announced to German dealers in Leipzig. The GT2 RS develops and of torque and weighs less than the standard GT2, allowing for a top speed of and the 0‚Äì100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration time of 3.4 seconds. Sport Classic 997 Sport Classic Unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show, the Sport Classic is a limited (250 units- all sold in under 48 hours) version of 911 Carrera S coup√©, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7. The engine is rated at via newly developed resonance intake manifold with 6 vacuum-controlled switching flaps. It includes 6-speed manual transmission, double-dome roof, wider rear fenders, SportDesign front apron with a spoiler lip and a fixed 'duck tail' rear wing (similar to the one found on the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7), PCCB Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, lower PASM sports suspension, mechanical rear axle differential, 19-inch black fuchs wheels, Porsche Exclusive woven leather seats and door panels, dashboard with Espresso Nature natural leather upholstery, and a specially developed Sport Classic Grey body colour. Carrera GTS For the 2011 model year, Porsche introduced the first ever GTS model for the 911. Designed as a drivers car, the GTS was more powerful than the S, better handling via a bespoke suspension design, and positioned as a more street friendly alternative to the GT3, Porsche's track-focused 911 variant. The GTS featured race-inspired center lock wheels, unique styling including a Sport Design front bumper, special rear bumper, blackout trim, side skirts borrowed from the GT2 model, brushed stainless steel \\"Carrera GTS\\" door sills and Alcantara trim. Many GTS' were ordered with the Alcantara delete, instead being built with leather. The GTS was very rare in that is was a rear wheel drive Wide-Body design (44 mm wider than a standard 911), 20 mm lower and offered 408 HP (versus 385 HP for the S) like the similar, limited volume Sport Classic and the Speedster. Porsche built approximately 2,265 total GTS models for the world market, as well as a handful designated as 2012 models. The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from both the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line beginning in 2015, with the \\"type 991\\" 911 successor. Speedster 997 Speedster In 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling the iconic car of the 1950s. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the 930 and 964 generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS which is rated at . It accelerated from 0 to in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around . Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \\"loyal customers\\".) The Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle. =991 Series (2012 ‚Äì 2019)= 991 Carrera S The 991 introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since the original 911. Porsche revealed basic information on the new Carrera and Carrera S models on 23 August 2011. The Carrera is powered by a 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at . A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output to . The new 991's overall length grows by and wheelbase grows by (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track ( wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer. At the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the Carrera GT and adopted by the Panamera. The 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly aluminium construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0‚Äì97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0‚Äì97 km/h in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0‚Äì97 km/h in as little as 4.2 seconds and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds. Porsche 991 Turbo S Apart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On vehicles produced in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is available on the 7 speed manual transmission when equipped with the Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the manual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear. One of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system. The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models. The new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N√ºrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology. In January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911. The 991 Targa features an all-new electronically operated roof mechanism which allows it to have the original Targa design In May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to on the 'Turbo', and on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0-97 km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A rear-wheel steering system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling. During low- speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility. In January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models. These new models come equipped with an all-new roof technology with the original Targa design, now with an all-electric cabriolet roof along with the B-pillar and the glass 'dome' at the rear. Porsche 991 (post face-lift) In September 2015, Porsche introduced the second generation of 991 Carrera models at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Both Carrera and Carrera S models break with previous tradition by featuring a 3.0-litre turbocharged 6-cylinder boxer engine, marking the first time that a forced induction engine has been fitted to the base models within the 911 range. 911 GT3 Porsche 991 GT3 Porsche introduced the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013. The 991 GT3 features a new 3.8 litre direct fuel injection (DFI) flat-six engine developing at 8,250 rpm, a Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) double-clutch gearbox and rear-wheel steering. The engine is based on the unit fitted in the 991 Carrera S, but shares only a few common parts. All other components, particularly the crankshaft and valve train, were specially adapted or developed for the 991 GT3. The dual-clutch gearbox is another feature specially developed for the 991 GT3, based on sequential manual transmissions used in racing cars. The 911 GT3 is claimed to be able to accelerate from 0-97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.1 seconds or less, and the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds at . The GT3 has a claimed top speed of . Porsche unveiled the facelifted 991.2 GT3 at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9,000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission. A touring version was also introduced which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual transmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear wing instead. 911 GT3 RS Porsche 991 GT3 RS Porsche launched the Renn Sport version of the 911 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015. Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power output of and 460 Nm (339 lbft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The car accelerates from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0-200 km/h (124 mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \\"paddle neutral\\" ‚Äî comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox ‚Äì and a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear- axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock are available as standard. In February 2018, Porsche introduced a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and a and increase over the outgoing model, NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2 GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the GT2 RS) for increased downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs, lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed tyre compound. A Weissach package was available that included additional carbon fibre body and interior parts as well as magnesium wheels and stiffer suspension settings is available as an option. 911 R Porsche 911 R In 2016, Porsche unveiled a limited production 911 R based on the GT3 RS. Production was limited to 991 units worldwide. It has an overall weight of , a high-revving 4.0 L six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine from the 991 GT3 RS, and a six-speed manual transmission, while air conditioning and audio systems are removable options to save weight. The car accelerates from in 3.7 seconds and has a top speed of . 911 GT2 RS Porsche 991 GT2 RS The high performance GT2 version made a return to the 991 lineage but now as an RS variant only with no standard variant being produced unlike the previous generations. It was initially unveiled at the 2017 E3 along with the announcement of the Forza Motorsport 7 video game. The car was officially launched by Porsche at the 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed along with the introduction of the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. The 991 GT2 RS is powered by a 3.8 L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine that produces a maximum power of at 7,000 rpm and of torque, making it the most powerful 911 ever built. Unlike the previous GT2 versions, this car is fitted with a 7-speed PDK transmission to handle the excessive torque produced from the engine. Porsche claims that this car will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.7 seconds, and has a top speed of . The car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, front and rear spoilers and boot lid made of carbon, front and rear apron made of lightweight polyurethane, rear and side windows made of polycarbonate and features a titanium exhaust system. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of . A Weissach package option is available, which reduces the weight by , through the use of additional carbon-fiber and titanium parts. These include the roof, the anti-roll bars and the coupling rods on both axles made out of carbon-fiber while the package also includes a set of light-weight magnesium wheels. Speedster (2019) Porsche 911 Speedster Concept At the 2018 Paris Motor Show held in October on the occasion of the 70th anniversary celebration of the marque, Porsche unveiled the Speedster variant of the 991 generation for the 911, as a concept. Utilising the chassis of the GT3 and the body shell of the Carrera 4 Cabriolet, the Speedster includes the GT3's 4.0-litre naturally aspirated Flat-6 engine generating a maximum power output of and having a red-line of 9,000 rpm coupled with a 6-speed manual transmission and titanium exhaust system which are claimed to be lighter than the 7-speed manual transmission found on the standard 991 models. The car also features the signature \\"hump\\" shaped double bubble roof cover along with a shorter windshield frame, side window glass and the analogue roof folding mechanism retaining the \\"Talbot\\" wing mirrors and the central fuel cap from the 911 Speedster concept unveiled earlier at the Goodwood Festival of Speed harking back to its use on the 356 Speedster. Other highlights include a leather interior with perforated seats, red tinted daytime running lights, carbon fibre fenders, engine cover and hood and stone guards. Production will begin in the first half of 2019 and be limited to 1,948 units in honour of the year in which the 356 \\"Number 1\\" gained its operating license. The final production version of the Speedster was unveiled at the 2019 New York Auto Show in April and dropped the \\"Talbot\\" wing mirrors in favour of standard 991 wing mirrors. The speedster will be available for sale in May 2019. =992 Series (2019‚Äìpresent)= Porsche 992 The 2019 version of the 911, under the internal name Type 992, made its debut at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. During the actual debut, a presentation of the history of the 911 series was shown, along with a lineup of 911s with different generations. On 30 July 2019 Porsche have started marketing the non 'S' model of the new 992. The exterior is almost identical to the 991 'S's models with the exception of having 19\\" wheels front and 20\\" wheels at the rear, compared to the 'S' Models 20\\" front and 21\\" rear. Models are advertised for configuration with an advertised recommended price of ¬£82,793 in the UK. 911 GT1 Porsche 911 GT1 on display at the Porsche Museum The Porsche 911 GT1 is a race car that was developed in 1996 for the GT1 class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In order to qualify for GT racing, 25 road-going models were built to achieve type homologation. The engine in the GT1 is rated at ( for the road version) and accelerated from 0‚Äì97 km/h in 3.3 seconds. The top speed stood at . Both the road and race cars carried the same twin-turbocharged engine as used in the 962, and the race car was a match for the then dominant McLaren F1 GTRs. A redeveloped version of the 911 GT1 race car was later built, winning outright at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car is not considered to be a real 911, as it is derived from the 962 with the 993 and later the 996 911's front section. It was the most powerful and fastest road-going Porsche until the introduction of the Carrera GT in 2004 and later the 918 Spyder in 2013. Awards In 1999, the 911 placed fifth in the Global Automotive Elections Foundation's Car of the Century competition, trailing mass market cars: Ford Model T, BMC Mini, Citro√´n DS, and Volkswagen Beetle. In 2004, Sports Car International named the 911 number three on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, the Carrera RS number seven on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s, and the 911 Carrera number seven on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s. In addition, the 911 was voted Number 2 on Automobile Magazine's list of the \\"100 Coolest Cars\\". Motor Trend chose the Porsche 911 Carrera S as its Best Driver's Car for 2012. It also won \\"World Performance Car Of The Year\\" in 2014. In 2015, Car and Driver named the Porsche 911 \\"the best premium sports car on the market\\".

Roughly cone-shaped and covered in Iron Age La T√®ne designs, it was discovered broken in several pieces, partly buried close to a Bronze Age stone circle, inside which it probably once stood. The stone is now housed in the Cavan County Museum, while an imperfect replica stands near the road about 300 metres from the original site. Although now much damaged, the stone can be reconstructed from the different surviving pieces. It was at least 6 feet high. At the base of the stone there were four rectangular adjoining panels measuring 90 cm each in width giving a circumference of 3 m 60 cm when it was first carved. The height of each panel was about 75 cm. Find site and associations The stone was found in 1921 at Killycluggin, County Cavan. The site has several associations with St. Patrick. Nearby is Tobar Padraig (St. Patrick's Well), and Kilnavert Church, which is said to have been founded by Patrick. The current town of Kilnavert was originally called Fossa Sl√©cht or Rath Sl√©cht, from which the wider area called Magh Sl√©cht was named. The 14th century Book of McGovern, written in Magh Sl√©cht, contains a poem which states that Crom was situated at Kilnavert beside the road and that the local women used to tremble in fear as they passed by. There is still a local tradition in the area that the Killycluggin stone is the Crom stone. Interpretation and speculations A different Celtic stone sculpture, the M≈°eck√© ≈Ωehrovice Head which was found in the Czech Republic, is thought to be similar in type to the carved Killycluggin stone before it was damaged. The Killycluggin Stone has been interpreted by some as the cult image of the pre-Christian native god Crom Cruach. O'Kelly, however, refers to this image as Crom Dubh. When excavated and placed upright on its flat base, it was found to lean obliquely from the vertical, perhaps explaining the name Crom, \\"bent, crooked\\". The top of the stone has a hair-motif which is found on other La T√®ne sculptures, such as the Celtic hero head from M≈°eck√© ≈Ωehrovice in the Czech Republic. The inference is that the Killycluggin stone was an anthropomorphic figure with a human face, which was the part that was smashed to pieces. Support for this is given by: * Fran√ßoise Henry in her book Irish Art in the Early Christian Period, p. 11 wherein she states, \\"the ornaments engraved on the stone of Killycluggin sides seems to be the edge of a garment.\\" * The Quarta Vita of Saint Patrick written c. 800 A.D. states, \\"But the demon, who was in the idol, fearing St. Patrick, turned the stone towards its right side, and the mark of the staff still remains in its left side.\\" A cone-shaped stone would not have a left or right side unless it had a human face. * The Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii written c. 1100 A.D. states, \\"But the idol leaned over towards the sunset on its right side, for it is southwards its face was, i.e. to Tara. And the mark of Patric's staff still remains in its left side.\\" Again this reference to a face. * The Metrical Dindsenchas written c. 1160 A.D. states: \\"Patrick of Armagh plied a sledge-hammer on Crom from his head to his foot: he removed with rough soldier-deed the weak image that was here.\\" * By the human figure incised on the Killinagh Crom Cruaich stone. * The stone head of Crom in Cloghane, Co.

She was most active in London and Oxford, where she designed a variety of schools, university buildings and public housing projects. Early life and education Ledeboer was born in 1901 in Almelo, the Netherlands. She was one of six children born to Willem Ledeboer, who worked as a banker, and Harmina Engelbertha van Heek. Her family moved to London shortly after her birth. She attended Wimbledon High School, Cheltenham Ladies' College and Bedford College (a constituent school of the University of London). She studied history at Newnham College at the University of Cambridge from 1921 to 1924. She moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to complete a master's degree in economics at Radcliffe College in 1925, and returned to London the next year to train at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, graduating in 1931. Career One of Ledeboer's early inspirations was the architect Elisabeth Scott, whom she assisted on the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (now the Royal Shakespeare Theatre) in Stratford- upon-Avon. Ledeboer went into practice with David Booth in 1939 as Booth and Ledeboer, where she mainly worked on small residential projects. She left the firm in 1941 to work for the Ministry of Health through World War II. She was the first female employee of the ministry to be responsible for housing, and was secretary of the Dudley and Burt committees on public housing. In 1946, Ledeboer left the Ministry of Health and returned to practice with Booth. In 1956, John Pinckheard became a partner in the firm and it became Booth, Ledeboer, and Pinckheard. The firm was based in London and Oxford and its main clients were universities and in the public sector. Some of the university projects on which Ledeboer worked were the Institute of Archaeology and Classical Studies at the University of London (1953‚Äì1958), the Waynflete Building of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford (1961‚Äì1964), and Magdalen College School (1966), also part of Magdalen College. Booth and Ledeboer's work in the public sector included hospitals, factories, offices and a number of schools, including the Dragon School and Headington School, both in Oxford. Ledeboer designed several housing complexes in London for the Lewisham and Newham Borough Councils. The project for which she is best known is the elderly home on the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, London, which she designed for the Festival of Britain in 1951. She designed a neighbourhood unit in Hemel Hempstead in 1950‚Äì1955, comprising houses, flats, maisonettes and shops. Ledeboer left private practice in 1970 but remained an active member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Landscape Institute until the mid-1970s. She died in 1990 at her home in Hambledon, Hampshire. Legacy Ledeboer was described by Lynne Walker in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as \\"one of the most significant voices in post-war housing policy\\". She was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1966.

She was part of the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships and the 2016 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships, in which she won world titles in the T37 100m and C4 500m time trial respectively. Competing for Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, in both athletics and cycling, she won a bronze medal in the Women's 100m T38 sprint, before winning a gold medal in the Women's C4-5 cycling time trial, and another gold in the T38 400m sprint, becoming the first British Paralympian to win golds in multiple sports at the same Games since Isabel Barr at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. Personal life Cox was born in Leeds, England in 1991 to Jamaican immigrants. Her first school was Bracken Edge Primary in Chapeltown, Leeds. She attended Wetherby High School before matriculating to Manchester Metropolitan University where she studies physiotherapy. She appeared on Celebrity Mastermind in December 2016, scoring just 3 points with her specialist subject Arsenal F.C., and no points at all in the general knowledge round. She won the second Celebrity Robot Wars 2016 episode later that month with her collaboration with Ellis Ware (who drove Pulsar in the preceding regular series), with a robot called Kadeena Machina, a robot with a vertical disc, which won all four of its fights, the only robot to do so. In 2017 she took part in the British television winter sports show The Jump, but had her funding suspended whilst on the show due to the amount of injuries contestants sometimes suffer. In April 2018, Kadeena took part in The Great Celebrity Bakeoff on Channel4 in aid of Standup to Cancer [Episode 5/5] Sporting career =As an able bodied athlete= Cox began sprinting competitively at the age of 15 after her hockey coach suggested she try the sport. Over the next three years she competed at regional under-17 meets gaining several podium finishes in the 100m events. In 2007, she added the 60m and 200m to her repertoire, taking bronze in the U17 events at both the Manchester Open and the England Athletics Open Championships in the 60m that year. By 2009 Cox was competing throughout the athletics season, recording personal bests of 12.60s in the 100m and 25.58s in the 200m, both at the Yorkshire & Humberside County Championships. In 2012 Cox was entering national events and recorded a new personal best in the 200m in the BUCS Championships held at the Olympic Park, a result which saw her take bronze. In 2013, she broke the 12 second barrier in the 100m for the first time, recording a time of 11.97 at the Northern Athletics Championships. She subsequently set a personal best of 11.93s for the 100m the same year. In addition to running, before her illness Cox was vying for a place on the British skeleton team. On the 18 May 2014, Cox entered the Loughborough International: two days later she was rushed to hospital after showing odd symptoms and was diagnosed as having suffered a stroke. After two months of physiotherapy she recovered back to normal health and began training again. Then on 15 September 2014 she experienced burning sensations in her right arm, which over the following few days worsened to numbness in her arm and right leg and she was again taken to hospital with suspicions of a stroke. After extensive tests she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. =As a parasport sprinter= Intent on making the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Cox was classified as both a T37 track and field athlete, to continuing her sprinting career, and a C2 track cyclist. A month later Cox was selected for the Great Britain athletics team to compete at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, where she entered the T37 100m and 200m sprints. In the heats leading up to the final of the 100m sprint, Cox posted a time of 13.59s to beat the world record set by France's Mandy Francois-Elie. Later that day she ran in the 100m T37 final, taking the gold medal in a time of 13:60, beating team mate Georgina Hermitage into second place. Her final event of the championship, the T37 200m sprint, ended in controversy after she missed registration by a minute and was disqualified from the race. In June 2016, after securing a place at the 2016 Summer Paralympics as a T37 athlete, Cox was reclassified as a T38 category athlete, a classification for less-disabled athletes. This threw her hopes to race at Rio into jeopardy as Britain already fielded two other athletes, Sophie Hahn and Olivia Breen, who had posted faster times as T38 sprinters. Despite the classification change, Cox was selected for the Rio Paralympics in July 2016. At the Games she took a gold in the T38 400m, a silver in the T35-38 4x100m relay and a bronze in the T38 100m. She also set a new world record of 1:00.71 to take the gold medal in the T38 400m. Cox was subsequently selected as the flag-bearer for the British team at the closing ceremony. Cox was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to athletics. =As a para-cyclist= In September 2015 Cox entered the British National Track Championships where she took the gold medal in the C1-5 Mixed Gender Sprint Time Trial. In March 2016, Cox represented Great Britain at the UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Montichiari. Despite being reclassified as a C4 cyclist the day before the event, she still went on to win gold in the 500m time trial with a world record of 37.456s. On 1 August, Cox was named in the Great Britain team to compete at the Rio Paralympics with the potential to race in the 500m time trial (C4/C5) and the road race (C4/C5). Cox won gold in the 500m time trial in the 2016 Paralympics: her time of 34.598 seconds also set a new world record. Awards In March 2017, Cox was awarded the Sporting Equals Sportswoman of the Year at the Lycamobile British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards (BEDSAs) held at the London Hilton on Park Lane.

The 2016 shows were the sixth time that NJPW and CMLL had co-promoted shows in Japan under the Fantastica Mania name. Much like the previous year, the 2016 tour featured six shows in total. The first five events featured seven matches each with the final event featuring eight matches. Six of the matches were contested for championships owned by CMLL. The 2016 tour was the first time the joint show was held in K≈çchi, K≈çchi, while it had previously been held in the other three cities; Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo. Background The 2016 Fantastica Mania series was the sixth year in a row where Japanese wrestling promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) had promoted a series of shows in Japan along with their Mexican partner promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The 2016 series of shows were show 19 through 24, a total of six shows. The final three shows aired live on NJPW World. The opening show in K≈çchi, K≈çchi on January 17 would be the first time Fantastica Mania had taken place in the city. The tour was announced October 24, 2015, with the CMLL participants announced on November 16.

On their way back across the sea, the pirates captured their ships, took their belongings, and killed all but one man, the cook, who managed to survive by hiding under the deck. After the incident, Vietnam shores went stormy and the flock of crows was crowding the king's palace. The seer of the king said that those crows had foretelling a great crime which was about going unpunished. After a long search, the king heard a news about a pirate which was captured at the market. One of Hainan people recognized the ring which was used by a stranger, the same ring that he entrusted to the 109 Hainan for the wedding gift of his brother. After a fight, both of them was arrested and the stranger admit his crime. The king ordered to capture the rest of the pirates and confiscated their loot. After that, the king performed a ritual prayer to appeased the unrest souls of the 108 Hainan brothers and the flock of crows was gone from his palace. The tragedy of the 108 Hainan brothers had reached Hainan. The local people built a memorial temple for them and annually commemorating their death day on 27th day of the 5th lunar month. Hainan people worship them as the protectors of seafaring. The seafarers who want to go abroad usually pray to Xiongdi Gong and bring a cook as their witness.

This includes applying industrial and organizational psychology to team selection, individual and team mental preparation, team training, and ongoing psychological support,Freiberg, Peter. (1998). \\"Psychology keeps astronauts well grounded.\\"Monitor, American Psychological Association, March Edition, p. 17 and applying human factors and ergonomics to the construction of spacecraft to ensure sufficient habitability. Components of industrial/organizational psychology The field is necessary for planning for and accomplishing successful human spaceflight missions by ensuring readiness for the unique physiological and psychological challenges posed by spending extended time in closed isolated environments like spacecraft. It is critical that each team member functions individually and as a team in order to avoid human error, overcome unforeseeable challenges, and complete the mission. Due to the importance of team reliance on mission success, the field has focused on team composition and cohesion in spaceflight missions ever since 1957's Project Mercury. This involves applying and conducting research from social psychology, group dynamics, group performance and team psychology, and applying it to select team members that will be able to live together in close quarters for an extended amount of time, and create team training programs that improve team performance.Novotney, Amy. (2013). \\"I/O psychology goes to Mars\\" Monitor on Psychology In addition to teamwork, there is an assortment of psychological and sociological effects of spaceflight that needs to be addressed in order to plan for successful space missions, such as loneliness, unavailability of familial mental health support, elevated levels of stress due to demanding tasks, and reduced material comforts. Components of human factors and ergonomics To ensure habitability of constructed spacecraft, human factors and ergonomics specialists must advise on environmental requirements such as lighting, room layout and design, sound requirements, and solutions for the physiological challenges posed by being in an environment without gravity.Whitmire, Alexandra. (2014). \\"The Use of Psychology to Inform the Design of Future Space Vehicles and Habitats\\". American Psychological Association Convention Presentation Human Factor in space has to deal not only with adapting to different physical habitats, but also to different social habitats and different communication settings. New activities such as performing human extravehicular activity (EVA) beyond the low Earth orbit environment require complex synchronization methods. The ergonomic approach to these environments has to include new variables, such as time delay in communication due to speed of light transmission limitations. Astronauts will become increasingly isolated from Earth-based mission support and thus will rely heavily on their own decision-making capabilities and onboard tools to accomplish proposed EVA mission objectives. Research Most published research specific to space psychology has been conducted by NASAs Human Systems Integration Division.Caldwell, Barrett. (2006). \\"Group Performance and space flight teams: Chapter 8\\" in Bowers, Salas and Jentsch. (2006). \\"Creating High-Tech Teams: Practical Guidance on Work Performance and Technology.\\" American Psychological Association Tests conducted to ensure team success include putting a team in airtight quarters on earth for an extended period of time: in the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test.Nasa Lunar-Mars Life Support Test In the context of space flight, teamwork is an essential ingredient in successful missions. A variety of adverse influences may negatively impact the performance of mission teams both on the ground and in flight. Such influences may include physical stressors on the organism such as diurnal disruption, effects of microgravity, injury, or task overload as well as psychological factors such as social isolation, role overload, or interpersonal conflict among team members. Given the importance of team effectiveness, NASA's Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) has identified a need to monitor the functioning of teams, primarily using unobtrusive means. The purpose of such monitoring lies in providing a stream of indicators that can serve several operational goals: # Monitoring during personnel selection activities can provide input for the selection of compatible team members and of individuals with psychological profiles suited to teamwork in extreme environments and situations. # Monitoring during training activities can provide diagnostic information useful in guiding further instruction and coaching as well as in determining the composition of teams prior to mission deployment. # Monitoring during missions can provide forewarning of potential operational failures due to disruptions.Veronica Maidel, & Jeffrey M.

In her first seven races she failed to win but was placed in several major races including the May Hill Stakes, Epsom Oaks and Ribblesdale Stakes. She then recorded her first win in the Lancashire Oaks before recording her biggest win in the Yorkshire Oaks and then finished third in the St Leger. She won the Jockey Club Stakes as a four-year-old and later had some success as a broodmare. She was involved in two of the major racing controversies of the late 1980s: the dismissal of Dick Hern and the Aga Khan's boycott of British racing. Background Roseate Tern was a bay mare bred by her owner Henry Herbert, Lord Porchester, the racing manager of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1987, Herbert inherited the title Earl of Carnarvon on the death of his father. She was sired by Blakeney, who won The Derby in 1969 before being retired to the National Stud. His other major winners included Julio Mariner, Juliette Marny and Tyrnavos. Blakeney was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Roseate Tern's dam, Rosia Bay, showed modest racing ability, winning two minor races from eight attempts in 1979 and 1980. She was a daughter of the broodmare Ouija, who was also the dam of Teleprompter, the grandam of Ouija Board and the great-grandam of Australia. Rosia Bay herself had previously produced Ibn Bey. The filly was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley. Hern had been based at the yard since 1962 and was the principal trainer of the Queen's racehorses. Racing career =1988: two-year-old season= Roseate Tern began her racing career in a Graduation Race (for horses with no more than one previous win) over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 28 July 1988. She started the 8/13 favourite but after taking the lead a furlong out she was overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck by Grey Spectre. In a similar event at Haydock Park in August she again started favourite but after leading for most of the way she was overtaken on the line and finished second, a head behind the winner Prince Ibrahim. On 7 September the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster. Ridden by Willie Carson, she started an 18/1 outsider in a field headed by the Henry Cecil-trained Tessla. After racing close behind the leaders she took the lead in the straight, but for the third time in succession she was caught in the closing stages and was beaten a short head by Tessla. On her final appearance of the year, Roseate Tern was moved up to Group One class for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse. She started 5/1 second favourite, but after leading in the early stages she finished fourth of the eight runners behind Tessla, Pick of the Pops and Rain Burst. In late 1988 it was announced that Lord Carnarvon had decided that Hern would lose his job as the Queen's trainer and be replaced at West Ilsley by William Hastings-Bass. A compromise was subsequently reached, whereby Hern would share the premises in 1989 as he sought an alternative base. The treatment of Hern, who had been partially paralysed by a riding accident in 1984 and who was recovering from heart surgery at the time of the announcement, caused much adverse comment in the British racing community. In his own defence, Carnarvon said that he was acting in the monarch's best interests as Hern was no longer physically capable of running the stable. =1989: three-year-old season= Despite the ill-feeling between her owner and trainer, Roseate Tern remained in Hern's care in 1989. She began her campaign in the Listed Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 4 May. Starting third choice in the betting behind Snow Bride and stayed on in the closing stages to finish third, a neck and a head behind Rambushka and Always On A Sunday. The placings of the first two were reversed following a stewards' inquiry. On 10 June Roseate Tern, still a maiden after five starts was one of nine fillies to contest the 211th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse and started a 25/1 outsider. The Aga Khan IV's filly Aliysa started favourite ahead of Musical Bliss, Snow Bride and Tessla, with Rambushka and Always On A Sunday among the other runners. Roseate Tern was in sixth place entering the straight and then made steady progress to finish third, beaten three lengths and a short head by Aliysa and Snow Bride. Aliysa was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a metabolite of a banned substance, with Snow Bride and Roseate Tern being promoted to first and second. The decision led to the Aga Khan to remove all of his racehorses from training in Britain. Twelve days after her run at Epsom Roseate Tern started second favourite behind the previously undefeated Nearctic Flame in the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. She came from last place on the final turn to finish second of the six runners, two and a half lengths behind the winner Alydaress. On 8 July, Roseate Tern was dropped in class for the Group Three Lancashire Oaks at Haydock and started 7/4 favourite against seven opponents. As Carson was partnering Nashwan in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown the filly was ridden for the first time by Tony Ives. Her main rival in the betting was Knoosh, who had finished two places behind her at Epsom, whilst the other runners included the Cheshire Oaks winner Braiswick. After being fifth early in the straight she took the lead a furlong out and belatedly recorded her first success, beating Lucky Song by half a length with Wrapping two and a half lengths back in third. Roseate Tern reappeared on 23 August for the Group One Yorkshire Oaks in which she was reunited with Carson. Alydaress, who had beaten Aliysa in the Irish Oaks was made the odds-on favourite with Roseate Tern second choice at odds of 11/2. The other three runners were Petite Ile (third in the Irish Oaks), Lady Shipley (runner-up in the Nassau Stakes) and the Oaks d'Italia winner Nydrion. Carson restrained the filly at the rear of the five-runner field as Lady Shipley made the running from Nydrion, Petite Ile and Alydaress. She began to make steady progress in the straight, overtook the fading Lady Shipley a furlong out and won by one and a half lengths and a head from Alydaress and Petite Ile. On her final start of the season Roseate Tern was matched against colts in the St Leger Stakes and started the 5/2 second favourite behind the Henry Cecil-trained Michelozzo. The St Leger meeting at Doncaster was abandoned owing to the poor state of the course and the race was run a week later at Ayr Racecourse. After being held up by Carson in the early stages the filly made steady progress without looking likely to win and finished third behind Michelozzo and Sapience, with Terimon in fourth place. At the end of the year, the filly was bought privately by the American businessman Peter Brant and moved to the stable of Luca Cumani at Newmarket. =1990: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old Roseate Tern was ridden by Frankie Dettori in the Group Two Jockey Club Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket on 4 May and started third choice in the betting behind Brush Aside (an eight length winner of the John Porter Stakes on his previous start) and Assatis (Hardwicke Stakes, Gran Premio del Jockey Club). The other runners included Ile de Nisky (fourth in The Derby) and Sesame (St Simon Stakes). Brush Aside led the field before Assatis went to the front three furlongs out, but Roseate Tern gained the advantage a furlong from the finish and won by two lengths from Ile de Nisky. Five weeks later she started 5/2 second favourite for the Group One Coronation Cup at Epsom but finished fourth behind In The Wings, Observation Point and her half-brother Ibn Bey. After a three month break, Roseate Tern returned for the September Stakes over eleven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse for which she started favourite but was beaten two lengths into second by three-year-old colt Lord of the Field. In October she was sent to Canada to contest the Rothmans International at Woodbine Racetrack but made little impact, finishing ninth of the ten runners behind French Glory. Breeding record Roseate Tern was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm. She died in 2007. Roseate Tern produced at least nine foals between 1993 and 2005: *Min Elreeh, a dark bay or brown filly, foaled in 1993, sired by Danzig. Unplaced on only start. *Siyadah, chestnut, filly, 1994, by Mr Prospector. Raced in Britain and the United States: won Pretty Polly Stakes. *Fakhr, dark bay or brown colt, 1995, by Riverman. Won one race. *Za Aamah, chestnut filly, 1996, by Mr Prospector. Unraced. *Nabadhaat, dark bay or brown filly, 1997, by Mr Prospector. Failed to win in five races. *Esloob, bay filly, 1999, by Diesis. Won three races including the Pretty Polly Stakes and Hoppings Stakes. *Tarwij, dark bay or brown filly, 2000, by Diesis.

Allmusic critic Phil Freeman wrote that \\"even as Wormrot's songs blur into a single massive assault, they have a punk rock catchiness that some of the more metallic grindcore acts don't share,\\" concluding: \\"It's possible to have a favorite Wormrot song, something that can't be said about the legions of lesser grindcore bands out there.\\" Revolvers Chris Krovatin stated: \\"Vocalist Arif and drummer-singer Fit utilize a twin growl/shriek attack that maintains a sense of violent panic, but it‚Äôs guitarist Rasyid‚Äôs toxic riffs and overdriven leads that give Wormrot their impressively dark atmosphere, a nihilistic malaise that hangs somewhere south of Pig Destroyer and north of Exhumed.\\" Krovatin also further wrote: \\"The album is not a crossover darling‚Äîthe band does little to evolve its sound, and if you don‚Äôt particularly like grindcore, you‚Äôll hate this‚Äîbut within their grimy musical crawlspace, these guys are kicking ass.\\" Greg Pratt of Exclaim! commented: \\"It's a sound they nail to perfection on this excellent album, which has as its only downfall the monotony that, if history has taught us anything, we know that all classic grind carries with it.\\" Track listing All songs written by Wormrot. ;Limited edition LP bonus tracks Personnel Album credits as adapted from Allmusic: ;Wormrot * Arif ‚Äî vocals, inlay artwork * Rashid ‚Äî guitars * Fitri ‚Äî drums ;Other personnel * Ah Boy ‚Äî engineering, recording, production, mastering * Andrei Bouzikov ‚Äî artwork * Summer Lacy ‚Äî layout References External links * Category:2011 albums Category:Wormrot albums Category:Earache Records albums Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner ","title":"Dirge (album)"},{"id":"48346249","text":"Abhishek Hegde (born 1 July 1987) is an Indian first-class cricketer who plays for Kerala.
