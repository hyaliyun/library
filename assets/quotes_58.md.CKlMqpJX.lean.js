During his rein, the state was invaded by Kalhoras and Talpuras of Sindh several times. Early life Godji was the son of Rao of Cutch state, Lakhpatji. At the age of sixteen, he demanded from his father a share in the management of the state as his father did with his grandfather Deshalji I. He was stirred by his mother and Punja, the former minister of his father. Godji was refused by his father and he retired to Mundra with his mother leaving Bhuj. Before moving to Mundra, Punja planned to ruin his rival minister Gordhan Mehta who was later executed under suspicion of treachery. Godji lived in Mundra independent of his father. Though chiefly advised by Punja, he trusted much to one Mirza Amir Beg whom he made his army chief. About this time, a certain Shah Madanji, a very rich merchant, died in Mundra, and to his funeral ceremonies some of the wealthiest men in Cutch came. Acting on his Jamadar's advice, Godji, who was badly off for funds, shut the city gates and refused to let the merchants go till they paid large sums of money. Enraged at his son's conduct, Lakhapatji sent a force against Mundra. Godji fled to Morbi, and being supplied with troops, came back, drove off the attacking force, and relieved the town. The Rao at length compromised with his son allowing him to keep Mundra on condition that he would dismiss Punja. To this Godji agreed, and in 1758 Punja retired to Mothala in Abdasa, on a monthly pension of about ¬£25 (1000 koris). Rule In 1760, Lakhapatji who had been suffering from leprosy and other diseases, died. On his death-bed Lakhpatji tried to induce the officers of his troops to appoint one of his six illegitimate sons. They refused sent message to Godji who came and succeeded without opposition and began to rule at the age of twenty-six. He continued as minister a Lohana named Jivan Seth, who had held the post during the last years of his father's reign and refused Punja the post who had hurried from his retirement in Junagadh with expectation of reward of his former help. After denied entry at various places and saving his life from cavalary troops in Jativada, he retired to Virawah in Parkar, Sindh. Punja corresponded with Gidomal, the minister of Sindh, who was of his own caste. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro, then reigning in Sindh, had invited Hyderabad; sent him ¬£1500 (1000 mohars) for his expenses and a palanquin with an escort of 100 men; and on his arrival received him with every honour. Kalhora explained his wish to conquer Kutch, and gain the Rao's sister in marriage. Punja was not encouraged by the idea of conquest but agreed to the idea of marriage. He advised that his proposal would be entertained only if he defeat the Rao of Cutch. Rao heard about the incoming army and directed Jivan to summon the Abdasa and Vagad Girasias to defend the country. The whole Bhayat, except the Mothala chief who was friendly to Punja, readily answered the summons, and took the field under the minister. Godji remained in command at Bhuj which he garrisoned with 1000 men from Navanagar and a body of Radhanpur troops. =First Sindh invasion and Battle of Jara= Ghulam Shah and Punja, at the head of the Sindhi army, quit Hyderabad accompanied by an immense body of followers, who, it is said, raised the strength of the expedition to about 70,000 men. Crossing the Rann, the Sindh army, after a heavy march of twenty seven miles, found Nara deserted, and the wells filled with stones. So great was their distress from thirst and fatigue, that had Jivan marched against them, they would have fallen an easy prey. But the minister was no general, and, quietly encamping in a strong position close by on the Jara hills, allowed the Sindh troops to refresh themselves. After two days' rest Ghulam Shah marched to Jara and attacked the hill. The approach was defended by a large gun round which the Cutch army were gathered. At the first shot the gun burst doing much injury and causing great confusion in the Kutch ranks. Taking advantage of the disorder, the Sindh soldiers climbed the hill sword in hand, and destroyed almost the whole army, leaving among the slain Jivan the minister, three sons of the Thakor of Nara, and many other leading chiefs. According to Cutch accounts their total loss was not less than a hundred thousand slain. From Jara, Ghulam Shah, marching to Tera, levied a heavy fine, and plundered and burned the country. Learning of this crushing defeat, the Rao, sending a private agent to Punja, confessed his unjust conduct, stated that he had been deceived by Jivan, and entreating Punja to arrange that the Sindh army should be withdrawn, invited him as his minister to Bhuj, and promised to ratify any agreement he should make with Ghulam Shah. His return to favour at Bhuj secured, Punja was not less anxious than the Rao to get rid of the Sindh army. To arrange this without losing credit with Ghulam Shah seemed well high hopeless. But affairs took a turn that made his part easier to play. News that the wells on the straight road to Bhuj had been poisoned led Ghulam Shah to advance by a longer route. As he went, he succeeded in levying sums of money from several chiefs. But a force sent against Sandhan was repulsed. When the news of this check reached Ghulam Shah, Punja was with him. Affecting a keen alarm, he warned Ghulam Shah that there were 360 forts each as strong as Sandhan, and that Bhuj itself was guarded by the choicest troops of Navanagar and Radhanpur. So far, he urged, Ghulam Shah's success was complete, and he engaged that if Ghulam withdrew, he would go to Bhuj and arrange the marriage with the Rao's sister. To this Ghulam Shah agreed, and, taking with him Punja's son as a hostage, retired to Sindh. On reaching Bhuj the Rao received Punja with every sign of respect, and at once made him minister. After fulfilling his preliminary agreement with Ghulam Shah, Punja's first measure was, partly by firmness and partly by paying their arrears, to dismiss the Radhanpur army which held the gates, and in defiance of Godji showed every wish to remain masters at Bhuj. During the next two years Punja was occupied in an expedition into Vagad where he levied a fine on Kanthkot and the chiefs of the district. All this time, though Punja never ceased urging him, the Rao had failed to give his sister in marriage to Ghulam Shah. From this constant subject of dispute, and perhaps from the manner in which he had regained his post, the Rao was never well disposed to Punja; and, when he had repaired his forts, raised a militia, and established his power, he determined to rid himself of his minister. By his order Punja was seized, confined in irons for ten days, and, by the Rao himself, was presented with a cup of poison. =Second Sindh invasion= On hearing of Punja's murder, Ghulam Shah gathered another army of 50,000 men, and re- entered Kutch by the Nara route. Nara he again found deserted, and except at the small fort of Muru, where a Rajput garrison of eighty men resisted and were all massacred, he advanced unopposed within sight of Bhuj. Encamping at Rodar Mata within five miles of the town, he despatched his minister, Gidomal, with some men of distinction to demand, as had before been promised, the Rao's sister in marriage. Godji, well supplied with troops and resources, received the envoys with little courtesy, and refused to give any satisfactory answer. During the night the envoys passed in Bhuj, the Rao ordered that, at the same moment, every gun in the city should be fired. This caused the strangers such alarm that they took back with them the most exaggerated accounts of the height of the walls and the strength of the town. After a few days skirmishing, Ghulam Shah was induced to listen to a compromise, by which, instead of the Rao's sister, he received in marriage the daughter of the chief of Khakhar, a near kinsman of the Rao. After remaining for some time inactive he recrossed the Ran, leaving at Lakhpat a post of 5000 men. About this time by building at Ali Bandar a bank across the Kori mouth of the Indus, Ghulam Shah stopped the source from which the great rice-lands of Lakhpat drew their water supply; and the rice tract gradually became a salt waste like the rest of the Rann, leaving the Cutch state poorer by a yearly sum of about ¬£20,000 (8 lakhs of koris). In 1772, seven years after his return to Sindh, Ghulam Shah died, and was succeeded by his son Sarfaraz. This prince was soon involved in troubles at his own court, and was obliged to withdraw his outpost from Lakhpat. At the same time he allowed Devji, the son of Punja, to leave his court and return to Bhuj. Devji was well received by the Rao, aod offered employment. But warned by the fate of his father and grandfather, he asked leave to retire and re-people Lakhpat. This was granted, and from the respect in which his family was held, he succeeded so well that the Rao, having the highest opinion of his abilities, anxious to get him as minister, ordered him to Bhuj. He started for the capital, but, on his way, was poisoned by some of the Darbar people who dreaded his influence. After Punja's death a succession of ministers followed, most of whom were murdered and their property seized by the Rao. During these changes the Rao, without a struggle, lost Balamba in Kathiawar. Godji, naturally of a suspicious temper, had for some time entertained a continued dread of assassination. This fear led him to collect a small body of Sidis who continued to increase in number till all the power of the Darbar rested with them. So overbearing were they that, at last, the ladies and principal officers of the palace, to free the Rao from their power, seized his person and kept him in confinement till the whole body of Sidis, more than 400 in all, were driven from Kutch. Enraged at this insult Godji retired in disgust to Mandvi where he stayed building a palace and paying no heed to public affairs. =Third Sindh invasion= About 1775, Miyan Sarfaraz Khan (1772-1777), Ghulam Shah's son, the Kalhora ruler of Hyderabad in Sindh, entering Cutch, took the route of Khavda and Sumrasar, intending to march to Bhuj, but the accounts of its strength frightened him, and leading the army to Chobari and Kanthkot, he married the daughter of the Thakor, and levying fines at Adhoi and other places returned to Sindh. =Fourth Sindh invasion= At this time (1776-1786), in Sind, the struggles between the Kalhoras and Talpuras divided the country into two factions. Abdul Nabbi Khan, who succeeded in 1771, had appointed Mir Bijr his minister. On Mir Bijr's elevation to power, two Beluchis, who had assassinated his father, sought refuge in Kutch, and, as the Rao refused to give them up, the province was again invaded and much of Abdasa plundered and laid waste. The Rao's mercenaries, at this time a very formidable body, sent under the command of one Mirza Kurpa Beg against the Sindh army, fell in with a detachment of it and cut it to pieces, and the people of the country aiding the Rao's troops, the invaders were forced to retreat across the Rann with considerable loss and disgrace. Elated by his success, Mirza Kurpa Beg, upon his return to Bhuj, threw off all subjection to the Rao and began to act with great insolence, especially towards the two Sindh refugees. Complaining to the Rao, the refugees were encouraged, if the chance offered, to assassinate Mirza Beg. Not many days after the Mirza sent for them and being refused a sum of money, ordered their wives and children to be sold. Enraged at this insult the Beluchis attacked him and slew him on the spot. For this deed of valour the Rao rewarded them with handsome grants of land. =Death= Soon after this Godji sickened, it was said of leropsy, and died at the age of forty-four, in 1778. He left two sons, Rayadhan III who succeeded, and Prithvirajji. He had married one of his sisters to Damaji Gaekwad of Baroda State.

Pfluger Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge is a shared use bridge for pedestrians and cyclists spanning Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, Texas. Opened in 2001, the bridge connects the north and south sides of the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail and features an unusual \\"double curve\\" design. The bridge runs parallel to the Lamar Boulevard Bridge, which carries road traffic across the lake roughly 200 feet (61 m) to the west. History The Lamar Boulevard Bridge is one of the main routes across Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, but it offers no dedicated bicycle lanes and only narrow sidewalks separated from the street by low curbs. As the growth of Austin in the 1980s sent ever-increasing traffic across the bridge, near misses between vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians became increasingly common. In 1991, a drunk driver hit and killed a cyclist on the bridge. By the mid-1990s concerns about the safety of the crossing prompted the city to raise funds through a municipal bond issuance and a federal matching funds grant to widen the Lamar bridge and improve its safety design. Early in the design process, however, the Texas Historical Commission indicated that the overall design of the existing bridge could not be changed, since it had been designated as a historic structure and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Community members in stakeholder meetings also generally opposed adding new traffic lanes to the bridge. Instead, in March 1998 city council directed the engineering contractor to explore the possibility of building a separate bridge for pedestrian use. A city design session in May 1998 gathered local architects, engineers, and citizens to propose designs for a pedestrian crossing. The workshop produced, among other options, a design for a bridge with a \\"double curve\\" deck connecting the trails on the north and south shores along natural \\"paths of travel,\\" giving the bridge an hourglass shape and curved connectors. This design was ultimately selected by city council, and construction began on May 15, 2000; the bridge was officially opened to pedestrian and cyclist traffic on June 16, 2001, whereupon it was named for James D. Pfluger, a notable Austin-area architect who designed parts of the city's hike and bike trail system. =Extension= The original design of the bridge had called for a long northwestern ramp to stretch over Cesar Chavez Street and connect to the Lance Armstrong Bikeway and downtown, but budget limitations led to the elimination of that section from the original construction in 2000‚Äì2001. In 2010, however, city council approved funding for the completion of that final section of the bridge. Construction on the new connector began on March 15, 2010 and was completed on March 1, 2011. Design Substructure viewed from the southwest at shore level While exploring possible designs for the bridge in May 1998, the city held a public workshop, which generated fifteen proposed concepts, including typical cable- stayed and arch bridges, relocation of an existing historical truss bridge, and several types of beam bridges. A group of five workshop participants developed a \\"double curve\\" design in which the deck would follow logical \\"paths of travel\\" connecting the trail system along the south shore of Lady Bird Lake to the trails and bikeway on the north shore. This resulted in two curved avenues crossing each other over the lake, intersecting and overlapping to create a wider space in the middle that could serve as a gathering place and look-off point. Building on this concept, the architects designed a structure with a double-hourglass-shaped deck and featuring helical ramps and curved connector spans at each end ‚Äî a bridge with no straight lines. For ease of construction, the structure was designed like a typical highway bridge, using steel plate girders (the architects chose weathering steel for aesthetic and maintenance reasons). In the central portion where the two curves intersect, the girders have a complex reverse curvature with variable spacing to match the curvature of the deck and maintain a constant overhang and reasonable interior deck spans. Atop this base sits a reinforced concrete deck ‚Äî again, a design feature typical of highway bridges. The substructure of supporting piers consists of cast-in-place reinforced concrete bents standing in the lake.

She wrote prolifically, with over 400 publications to her name. She moved to Liverpool in 1933 and, with a short interruption due to her marriage in 1937, worked for the Liverpool Museum until her retirement in 2000 at the age of 92. By the time of her death in 2003, she had become almost the last direct link with two generations of Irish and British Victorian conchologists who brought distinction to the subject through their personal research and field collecting. Largely self-taught, she was conferred an Honorary MSc by the University of Liverpool in 1991, was President of the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1970. She received an MBE for her life's work in 1992.Julia Nunn (2006), In conversation with Nora McMillan MBE, Mollusc World 11, July 2006, http://www.conchsoc.org/MolluscWorld11/10 Scientific career Educated as a child in Ireland by governesses and in private schools, she was later sent to board at the Liverpool College for Girls in Huyton. Typhoid fever as a teenager terminated her formal education. However her interest in shells had been sparked by summer visits to the beach at Millisle at the age of six years and, encouraged by a family friend, H.C. Lawlor, who introduced her to the photographer and malacologist Robert Welch, she joined the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club. There her career began as a young girl in the Junior Section, where she gained a good knowledge of marine animals and flowering plants. During the 1920s her growing expertise in conchology was nurtured by Welch and other prominent members of the Field Club such as Robert Lloyd Praeger, the geologist J. K. Charlesworth, and especially Arthur Stelfox, who was a major influence on her. From 1929 to 1933 Nora McMillan worked in the Belfast Municipal Museum, when she was active in working out the local distribution of plants and animals. Moving to Liverpool in 1933, she joined the staff of the Liverpool Museum, looking after their shell collection and working in particular on their fossil shells. She was forced to leave in 1937 when she married William McMillan, a local dental surgeon, and from about 1938‚Äì1956 she held two part-time posts in the Geology Department and Dental School of the University of Liverpool, returning to the Liverpool Museum full- time thereafter. In 1973 she reduced to part-time at the Liverpool Museum, by now a respected curator, researcher and author, and finally retired in 2000 at the age of 92, though she continued to be in demand for her expertise. Nora McMillan curated the British mollusca marine species collection of the Liverpool Museum from 1950 until 2000. In 1941 a fire had devastated the Liverpool Museum, and much was lost. Among the surviving collections were those of Olive Shells and netted dog whelks assembled by the conchologist, F. P. Marrat, who described many species new to science in the 19th century, and about whom Mrs McMillan wrote a book, Frederick Price Marrat, 'conchologist, Etc.' for the Liverpool Museum in 1985. A small part of the huge H.C. Winckworth British Marine Shell Collection was also saved, and remains the major component of the British mollusca marine species collection. But it was Nora McMillan‚Äôs influence which persuaded several conchologists to pass their collections to the museum, so that it once again had one of the largest regional collections, with a good representation of the popular groups. Nora McMillan travelled widely in Europe, to Lake Chad in Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and went alone on a shell collecting expedition to a whaling station in the Arctic Ocean in the early 1970s. In 2000 a species of mollusca, Chrysallida macmillanae, was named for her. Over a period of years, Nora McMillan undertook research on the career of Dr Cuthbert Collingwood FLS, the British naturalist, who worked in Liverpool in the 1850s and 1860s. Mrs McMillan published her work as a paper, Picture Quiz: Cuthbert Collingwood (1826‚Äì1908) in The Linnean 17, 9‚Äì20, in June 2001 along with her correspondence about Dr Collingwood with Mrs Brigit Sanders (a descendant of one of Dr Collingwood's brothers). She deposited her research papers on Dr Collingwood with the University of Liverpool thereafter. Personal life Nora McMillan lived for most of her life in a bungalow, 'The Nook,' at Bromborough on the Wirral, commuting to the museum in Liverpool. Her husband died in 1954 and she stayed in the house for another half century until her death in 2003. The house backed onto Dibbinsdale nature reserve, whose flora and fauna she recorded over more than sixty years. Known by many as 'Mrs Mac,' she lived in some chaos, surrounded by heaps of papers and books on every floor, table and any other surface, and climbed over by dozens of 'rescued' stray cats. For many years she kept goats which she used to walk through the neighbourhood. Much of her personal life was an extension of her academic interests, and she wrote prolifically on many subjects, including local history; she was a member of the Bromborough Society. An avid collector of books relating to natural history and local history, in 1980 she presented the Zoology Library of the Natural History Museum in London with a collection of her papers. Nora McMillan was interviewed by Julia Nunn and Dr Peter Crowther of the Ulster Museum, in the final year of her life, about her early days in Northern Ireland. The interview appeared in the July 2006 edition of Mollusc World, the journal of the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Plans to interview her about her time in Liverpool were cut short by her death. Selected publications Nora McMillan wrote prolifically on zoology and botany as well as local history, with over 400 publications to her name. Many of her writings were in the form of short papers and notes, in various English and Irish publications. Her first published paper was in 1926, in the Irish Naturalists' Journal (1:69‚Äì70) on 'Piddocks (Pholas) at Greenisland, Belfast Lough', with two further papers in the same journal in the same year 'Living sea horse (Hippocampus) at Greenisland, Belfast Lough' (1:70) and 'Helicella itala from County Down' (1:91). The following is an illustrative selection and is far from exhaustive. *On the occurrence of Pliocene shells in Wicklow (Proc. Liverpool Geol. Soc., 17, 255‚Äì266, plate), is an interesting contribution to the study of fossils in that area of Ireland. *The Natural History of Lough Foyle, North Ireland (Proc. Royal Irish Academy, 54, 67‚Äì96), with Ranald MacDonald is a full-scale survey of that inland lake. *James Stuart Francis Fraser Mackenzie (1845‚Äì1927) and his natural history books (Arch. Nat. Hist., 21:3, 415‚Äì416) memorialises a forgotten Colonel and botanist, one of whose books is named Wild Flowers and How to Name Them at a Glance without Botany. Even in the late 1990s she was still submitting articles to the Irish Botanical News, in this instance about botanical books she had inherited from Arthur Wilson Stelfox, the Belfast-born architect and naturalist who wrote many papers on Botany, Malacology and entomology. Her articles referred to interesting marginalia Stelfox had added, showing her interest in the history of natural history. She published two books: British Shells (1968),McMillan N F (1968), British Shells, Wayside and Woodland Series, F Warne, and the popular Observer's Book of Seashells of the British Isles (1977).McMillan N F (1977), Observer's Book of Seashells of the British Isles, F Warne/Observer, References Category:1908 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Belfast Category:British naturalists Category:Women naturalists Category:British curators Category:Academics of the University of Liverpool Category:Members of the Royal Irish Academy Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:20th-century British women scientists Category:20th-century naturalists ","title":"Nora Fisher McMillan"},{"id":"48274111","text":"Aristotelia antipala is a moth of the family Gelechiidae.

Early life Juan Roig was born on 8 October 1949 in Valencia. He studied in a Jesuit school in Valencia, then at a boarding school, and graduated in economics at Valencia, but was not an outstanding student. Eight years after graduating, he studied a postgraduate at IESE Business School, University of Navarra. His parents ran a chain of eight butchers' shops (C√°rnicas Roig) in La Pobla de Farnals, later converted to grocery stores. Business career With three of his five brothers, Juan Roig bought the shops from his parents in 1981. He largely bought out his brothers in 1991, and went on to build up the Mercadona supermarket chain, which now runs over 1,400 stores. His success in retail has been based on a risky strategy of competitive pricing, and on technological innovations such as barcode scanners and automated distribution facilities. He introduced full-time contracts for all employees in the late 1990s. Roig was awarded the Prince Felipe Prize for Business Excellence in 2010. Personal wealth Forbes magazine in October 2013 reported that Roig was worth 5,800 million euros, the second largest fortune in Spain. This in fact is the estimated value of the 78% stake in Mercadona jointly owned by himself and his wife. But since Mercadona shares are not publicly quoted, the figure is somewhat speculative. As of July 2018, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$4.3 billion. The shareholding yielded dividend income totalling over $400 million between 2006 and 2013 for Roig and his wife jointly. Personal life At university he met Hortensia Herrero, and they married in 1973. They have four children, and live in Valencia, Spain. His wife is now vice-president of Mercadona. He is said to favour family ownership in business, provided that the family members contribute positively. Roig teaches at a school for young entrepreneurs on Saturdays. He plays table tennis and watches basketball. He has been described as \\"shy, but a tough businessman\\" and as \\"a practical man, direct, austere, takes things seriously, his manner may appear cold if he does not trust the person he is talking to\\". Many aphorisms are ascribed to him, such as \\"in Spain we have to imitate the hard-working culture of the Chinese bazaars\\" and \\"you do not have to do a job that you like, but you have to make your job something you like doing\\". Philanthropy Through his wholly owned company Alquer√≠a Capital, Roig supports Proyecto Lanzadera, which helps young entrepreneurs set up their businesses and offers them space within the Lanzadera Business Centre, in Valencia. He also sponsors a professional basketball team, called Valencia Basket.

The revolt, which began in September 869 in southern Iraq, was initially limited to the region around the port city of Basra, as well as the southern districts of al- Ahwaz to the east. Efforts by the Abbasid caliphs in Samarra to crush the rebellion proved ineffectual, and several towns and villages were occupied or sacked. Basra itself fell in September 871 following an extended blockade, after which the city was burned and its inhabitants massacred. A retaliatory campaign undertaken by the caliphal regent Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil (known by his honorific of al-Muwaffaq) against the rebels in 872 ended in failure, and the Zanj remained on the offensive over the next several years. The continuing inability of the Abbasid central government to suppress the revolt, caused in part by its preoccupation with fighting against the Saffarid Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's advance into Iraq, eventually encouraged the Zanj to expand their activities to the north. A campaign by the rebels to occupy the marshlands between Basra and Wasit in 876 proved successful, and soon they made their way into the district of Kaskar. By 879, the rebellion reached its furthest extent; Wasit was sacked and the rebels advanced northwest along the Tigris, coming to within fifty miles of Baghdad. The Abbasid government finally regained the initiative in the war in late 879, when al-Muwaffaq sent his son Abu al-'Abbas (the future caliph al-Mu'tadid) with a major force against the rebels. Al-Muwaffaq himself joined the offensive in the following year, and over the next several months the government forces succeeded in driving the rebels back toward their \\"capital\\" of al-Mukhtarah, to the south of Basra. Al-Mukhtarah itself was put under siege in February 881, and its fall in August 883, combined with the death or capture of most of the rebel commanders, brought the revolt to an end. In the opening stages of the war, the Zanj were personally led by the revolt's leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad. Following the construction of al-Mukhtarah, however, 'Ali seldom went into the field himself, and the rebels armies in Iraq came to be led by several of his deputies, such as Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Bahrani and then, after the latter's capture and execution in 872, Sulayman ibn Jami', Ahmad ibn Mahdi al-Jubba'i, and Sulayman ibn Musa al-Sha'rani. The Abbasid government, for its part, rotated a number of officers to prosecute the war against the Zanj, but few of these made significant progress in quelling the rebellion prior to 879. The Zanj armies, bolstered by allied Arab tribesmen, included a mix of both infantry and cavalry troops, and were able to repeatedly score victories against the government forces in both pitched battles and ambushes. Both sides were also heavily reliant on watercraft to navigate the extensive canal system of lower Iraq and the waterways of the marshlands, and barges were frequently used to transport both men and supplies. The rebels also undertook other activities in the districts under their control, such as constructing fortresses, securing agreements with neighboring villages, collecting taxes and supplies, digging canals, and minting their own coins.  Background  The leader of the rebellion was one 'Ali ibn Muhammad, a man of obscure background. Prior to the outbreak of the revolt, 'Ali had traveled to the province of al-Bahrayn in eastern Arabia 863, where he gained a number of followers, including Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Bahrani and Sulayman ibn Jami', and attempted to form an imamate in opposition to the Abbasids. This scheme, however, floundered due to opposition from the local inhabitants, and in 868 he decided to depart for the port city of Basra in southern Iraq.; ; At Basra 'Ali again proclaimed a new revolt, but this also failed when the populace refused to support him. He was forced to flee Basra for the nearby marshlands, where he was arrested and transported to the city of Wasit. After a short time, however, 'Ali was able to convince the local governor to release him and his companions, and he afterwards made his way to Baghdad. There he remained for the next year, during which time he gained additional followers for his cause.; ; In 869 'Ali learned that his family, who had previously been incarcerated in Basra, had been released. He therefore decided to return to the Basra region, arriving there with his followers in August/September of that year. Upon his arrival he began to induce the local slave laborers, including Zanj slaves originating from eastern Africa, to join him, and adopted a heterodox slogan to give religious justification for a revolt.; ;  869  = Initial operations = Map of the Basra region (red), the initial area affected by the Zanj Rebellion in Iraq. The dry bed of the Nahrawan Canal in central Iraq. The canals of the Basra region were the scene of many battles during the rebellion, and were used by both the Abbasid government and the rebels to transport men and supplies. Map of the canals (nahrs) of the Basra region: 1. Abu al-Asad; 2. al-Marah; 3. al-Dayr; 4. Bithq Shirin; 5. Ma'qil; 6. al-Ubulla; 7. Abu al-Khasib; 8. al-Amir; 9. al-Qandil. In early September 869, 'Ali and his followers began seizing slaves in the Basra region and encouraged them with promises of plunder if they sided with his rebellion. After several hundred slaves joined him in this manner, he crossed the Dujayl and set up a camp, where he continued to recruit more followers. A few days later, the rebels defeated a detachment just after Eid al-Fitr, thus winning their first victory.; ; The local authorities and magnates quickly scrambled to suppress the revolt, and a force of four thousand men was sent to attack the Zanj. Despite being poorly equipped for combat, the rebels defeated this army and took a number of prisoners, who 'Ali ordered to be beheaded. 'Ali then made his way to several villages in the region, where the inhabitants either submitted to him or fled, and at the same time gained his first booty. Following several further defeats in battle, the locals attempted to buy 'Ali off if he agreed to return the slaves to their owners, but this was indignantly rejected by the rebel leader and fighting between the two sides went on.; ; Over the course of the next several weeks, the rebels continued to grow in strength. The efforts of the Basran authorities and landowners to put down the revolt proved ineffective, and several detachments sent against the rebels were defeated. With no force capable of stopping them, the Zanj continued to pillage their way through the region, and a number of villages either voluntarily submitted or were sacked.; ; = Battle of the Barges = By mid-October the Zanj had grown strong enough to attempt an advance on Basra. As the rebels approached the city, however, they were met by a large group of Basrans and suffered a serious defeat. Encouraged by their success, the Basrans organized a fresh expedition to fight the rebels, who had retreated to a camp on the Nahr Shaytan. The force consisted of a number of barges and galleys, and was escorted on land by a large crowd, which included a number of unarmed civilians.; ; Upon learning of the Basran advance, 'Ali ibn Muhammad set up an ambush, placing detachments on both banks of the canals. When the Basran force arrived they were suddenly attacked by the Zanj on all sides and were soon overwhelmed. The battle continued until almost the entire Basran force was annihilated; only a few managed to escape the rout.; ; The Zanj victory on the Nahr Shaytan, known as the Day of the Barges, was a watershed moment in the war, and transformed what had previously been a largely local affair into one requiring the intervention of the central government. In the aftermath of the battle, the residents of Basra became convinced that the rebels had become too strong to be defeated by local forces and abstained from engaging in further fighting. At the same time, the Abbasid government in Samarra realized that it would have to become more involved in suppressing the revolt, and decided to dispatch additional government troops to the region.; ;  869-870  = Arrival of Ju'lan al- Turki, construction of al-Mukhtarah = Following the Zanj victory over the Basrans, the Abbasid government sent a force under the command of Ju'lan al- Turki to southern Iraq to fight against 'Ali ibn Muhammad.; ; Ju'lan spent the next six months in the field, but he soon found that his mounted troops could not easily move through the dense landscape, and he was unable to make any headway against the Zanj. After the rebels undertook a devastating night- time raid against his camp, he decided to abandon the campaign and return to Basra. Ju'lan's withdrawal convinced the government that he was unsuitable for the task of defeating the rebels; he was therefore dismissed and his command was given to Sa'id ibn Salih al-Hajib instead.; ; Around the same time, 'Ali ibn Muhammad made his way to the western side of the Nahr Abi al-Khasib and began construction on a settlement there.; ; Known as al-Mukhtarah, it became the \\"headquarters\\" of the Zanj for the duration of the revolt, serving as the primary residence of the Zanj leader and as a place of refuge for the rebels. From this point forward, 'Ali ibn Muhammad largely refrained from personally leading the Zanj into battle, and instead remained in al-Mukhtarah and delegated the command of his forces to his lieutenants. = Occupation of al- Ubulla = Julan's withdrawal to Basra and the weakness of the government forces allowed the Zanj to continue their raiding activities in lower Iraq unimpeded.; ; Soon after Ju'lan left the field, 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided to undertake an expedition against one of the cities of the region. He initially intended to send his troops against 'Abbadan; after his army began their march, however, he was advised that al-Ubulla would be a better target. As a result, he recalled his men and ordered them to head toward that city instead.; Upon arriving at al-Ubulla, the Zanj found the city to be defended by Abu al-Ahwas al-Bahili, whom Ju'lan had appointed as its governor.Al- Tabari, p. 67; Ibn al-Athir, p. 212 Nevertheless, the rebels initiated their assault, attacking the city both on land and from commandeered boats. Fighting between the Zanj and defenders continued until the evening of June 28, 870, at which point the Zanj stormed the city from the direction of the Tigris and the Nahr al-Ubulla. The defenders were soon overwhelmed, and both the governor and his son were killed during the fighting.; ; As the Zanj spread throughout the city, they put it to the torch. Many buildings in al-Ubulla were made of teakwood and were constructed close together; as a result, the fire soon spread throughout the city, destroying much of it. Many residents were killed; others attempted to flee into the waterways and drowned. The Zanj then began to plunder al-Ubulla and collected large number of spoils, but by that point most of the city's goods had been destroyed by the flames. News of the sack of al-Ubulla spread terror throughout the region. The residents of 'Abbadan, fearing that they would suffer a similar fate, decided to surrender to the Zanj. 'Ali ibn Muhammad sent troops to the city, where they were allowed to seize any weapons and slaves that they could find.; ; The people of Basra were also panicked by the news; the fall of al-Ubulla, together with that of al-Ahwaz later that year, caused many to flee the city, moving to safer areas not subject to Zanj attack.; ;  870-871  = Campaign of Sa'id ibn Salih = Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate. In mid-871, the Abbasid government desired to initiate a new offensive against the Zanj, and sent Bughraj to press Sa'id ibn Salih on the matter. Sa'id accordingly set out for the Tigris in June and advanced toward the headquarters of 'Ali ibn Muhammad, eventually reaching the Nahr Ma'qil. There he encountered a rebel army on a tributary canal, and despite being wounded he succeeded in routing the Zanj. The victorious government troops gained loot and freed a number of women who had been taken captive by the rebels.; ; After the battle, Sa'id proceeded to set up a new camp and spent several days preparing for further engagements. While there, he received word of a nearby Zanj force, which he attacked and defeated. He next set out for the western side of the Tigris and engaged the Zanj in several skirmishes, after which he returned to his camp and began directing the activities of his army from there.; ; In mid-July, 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided to strike back against Sa'id, and ordered his lieutenant Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Bahrani to send a contingent against him. The rebel force, which consisted of a thousand men and was commanded by Sulayman ibn Jami' and Abu al-Layth al-Isbahani, proceeded from the Nahr Ma'qil by night and managed to catch the government army unprepared. The Zanj inflicted a severe defeat on Sa'id, killing a large number of his men and setting fire to his camp.; ; The attack succeeded in bringing an end to Sa'id's campaign. The government troops were extremely disorganized after the battle, and they were unable to make any further advances against the rebels. At the same time, a delay in a scheduled shipment from al-Ahwaz caused further problems, and Sa'id was forced to withhold the allotments for his soldiers as a result. Determining that Sa'id was incapable of continuing the operations against the Zanj, the central government decided to relieve him of his command. He therefore handed over his army to Mansur ibn Ja'far al-Khayyat and returned to Samarra, while Bughraj remained behind to protect Basra against the rebels.; ; = Blockade of Basra and campaign of Mansur ibn Ja'far = By mid-871 the city of Basra was effectively under blockade from the Zanj. The rebels had been able to largely cut off the flow of supplies to the city, having by this time taken control of several of the surrounding districts and destroying a number of nearby villages. The canals to Basra were also unsafe for travel, and ships attempting to reach the city were vulnerable to attack. The loot seized from ships not only deprived the city of needed provisions, but also provided an important source of supplies for the Zanj. With the rebels closing in on Basra, shortages appeared in the city, and its residents began to suffer from hunger.; ; Upon taking up his command in the region, Mansur ibn Ja'far attempted to break the blockade of Basra by establishing a convoy system, assigning barges to escort supply ships until they reached the city. This strategy temporarily relieved the Basrans from the shortages that they had been suffering, and also made it more difficult for the rebels to secure provisions for themselves. Once this was accomplished, Mansur decided to go on the offensive and advanced toward the headquarters of the Zanj leader with his troops and barges. The Zanj, however, were prepared for him, and when the government army entered the camp they were ambushed by the rebels. Many of Mansur's men were killed during the fighting, while others attempted to flee by jumping into the Tigris and drowned, and Mansur himself was forced to withdraw. Approximately five hundred severed heads were sent to the camp of Yahya ibn Muhammad at the Nahr Ma'qil and were put on display.; ; As a result of the defeat, Mansur decided that he was unable to directly engage the Zanj; he therefore refrained from further attacks and instead focused on protecting the Basran supply ships. Following the Zanj advance on Jubba, however, he turned his attention away from the convoys and allowed the ships to go unescorted. The rebels were consequently soon able to cut off the flow of provisions to the city, and supplies once again became scarce for its inhabitants. = Sack of Basra = In August 871, 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided that the time had come for a full-fledged attack against Basra. Messages were sent to both 'Ali ibn Aban al-Muhallabi, who was then encamped in Jubba, and Yahya ibn Muhammad, who was overseeing the blockade of the city, to combine their forces and coordinate an assault. The two commanders accordingly abandoned their positions and set out for the city. Despite receiving some notice that the Zanj were advancing against them, the Basrans were in a poor state to defend themselves, having been weakened by the effects of the blockade. As Mansur ibn Ja'far was not in the city, the only government force available was a fifty-strong cavalry force under Bughraj, which was supplemented by the Basran militia under the command of Burayh.; ; The Zanj began their attack on Basra on September 7. After three days of intense fighting, Bughraj and Burayh decided to abandon the city and fled, allowing the Zanj to enter it unopposed. The rebels proceeded to massacre many of its inhabitants, and plundered and destroyed a large portion of the city.; ; The devastation on Basra was one of the Zanj's greatest accomplishments during the early stages of the rebellion, and the city's fall was celebrated by 'Ali ibn Muhammad. The Abbasid government, for its part, became more committed to suppressing the rebels, and news of Basra's fate prompted the Abbasid prince Abu Ahmad to go on campaign against the Zanj in the following year.; ; = Campaign of Muhammad al-Muwallad = In the immediate aftermath of the conquest of Basra, the Abbasid government dispatched Muhammad al-Muwallad against the Zanj. He departed from Samarra on September 20 and established himself in al-Ubulla. The Zanj commander Yahya ibn Muhammad, meanwhile, had withdrawn from Basra following the sack, and set up camp on a nearby canal. After receiving instructions from 'Ali ibn Muhammad, he advanced against al- Muwallad and engaged him in battle.; ; After ten days of fighting between the two sides, Yahya was reinforced with barges commanded by Abu al-Layth al- Isbahani and ordered a night assault against the government army. The battle continued until the following afternoon, at which point al-Muwallad conceded defeat and withdrew, allowing the Zanj to enter and plunder his camp. Yahya then pursued al-Muwallad as far as al-Hawanit, but eventually decided to let him escape. He therefore proceeded back toward the Basra region, attacking and plundering the villages along his route, before reestablishing his camp on the Nahr Ma'qil.; ;  871-872  = First Abu Ahmad campaign =  Battle at Nahr Abi al-Khasib  Around the end of February 872, the Abbasid prince Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil, the brother and virtual regent of the caliph al- Mu'tamid, decided to personally go on campaign against the Zanj in response to the recent \\"atrocities\\" committed by the rebels. A large and well-equipped army led by himself and Muflih al-Turki accordingly set out from Samarra, intending to fight against 'Ali ibn Muhammad in the Basra region. After first passing through Baghdad, where it was enthusiastically met by the local residents, the army made its way south and eventually reached the Nahr Ma'qil. There they found that Yahya ibn Muhammad and the Zanj forces stationed in the area had fled, so they continued toward the Nahr Abi al-Khasib, to attack the headquarters of 'Ali ibn Muhammad.; ; The approach of Abu Ahmad and Muflih caught 'Ali ibn Muhammad by surprise, as most of his forces were stationed elsewhere at the time. He urgently sent a message to 'Ali ibn Aban, who had returned to Jubba after the sack of Basra, to hasten back to the Nahr Abi al- Khasib with whatever men he could. 'Ali ibn Aban therefore set out for the Basra region, but he was unable to reach 'Ali ibn Muhammad's headquarters before the arrival of the government forces, and by the time he appeared the battle was already over.; ; With no reinforcements available to him, 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided to engage the government army on his own, and ventured forth on foot. Abu Ahmad and Muflih, for their part, reached the Nahr Abi al-Khasib on April 1 and ordered their men to attack. The assault on the Zanj headquarters initially instilled a state of panic among the rebel noncombatants, and many women and children drowned while attempting to flee across the canal. Nevertheless, the battle ended in complete disaster for the government forces. Muflih was mortally wounded by an arrow early in the fighting, and soon the army was overwhelmed by the rebels; many men were killed and their heads were collected by the Zanj, while others were taken prisoner, and Abu Ahmad was forced to retreat.; ; Muflih died of his wound the day after the battle, and his body was returned to Samarra. Abu Ahmad, meanwhile, withdrew to al-Ubulla in order to reassemble his army.; ;  Capture of Yahya ibn Muhammad  While recovering at al-Ubulla, Abu Ahmad received word that the Zanj commander Yahya ibn Muhammad was heading for the Tigris. He decided to advance to the Nahr Abi al-Asad and establish camp there, in order to cut off the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Yahya. Upon arriving at the canal, he dispatched Tashtimur al-Turki with an army to track down Yahya and defeat him.; ; Yahya ibn Muhammad's forces, meanwhile, had been progressively weakened since his withdrawal from the Nahr Maqil; an engagement with the forces of Asghajun, the governor of al-Ahwaz, had left many of his men injured, and he was lacking in cavalry after he granted his horsemen leave to return to 'Ali ibn Muhammad's camp. After learning of Abu Ahmad's movements, he abandoned his march toward the Tigris and attempted to withdraw through a swamp, but many of the Zanj fell sick during the journey. After emerging from the swamp, the Zanj vanguard under the command of Sulayman ibn Jami' found their path blocked by barges and troops sent by Asghajun, so they abandoned their own boats and decided to head for the road back 'Ali's camp. Unaware of the fate of his vanguard, Yahya ordered his men to begin crossing a canal and towing their boats across. During the crossing, however, Tashtimur suddenly arrived with his army on the western side of the canal. Panic broke out among the Zanj, and many of the rebels hurriedly crossed over to the eastern side and escaped. Yahya, left with only a few dozen men, attempted to charge against Tashtimur's position, but the government forces quickly stopped the rebels with a hail of arrows. Yahya was wounded in both his arms and his left leg, and his remaining followers quickly decided to flee. The government troops proceeded to both banks of the canal, where they plundered and burned the boats abandoned by the Zanj.; ; Despite his wounds, Yahya was able to escape the battlefield. Now completely abandoned by his army, he attempted to head back to 'Ali's camp on a galley, but he found the way blocked by government barges. He therefore decided to continue on foot, but his injuries hampered his progress. His flight was finally brought to an end after an informant revealed his location to some government troops, who captured him and took him to Abu Ahmad.; ; Yahya's capture was celebrated as a significant achievement by the Abbasids. He was transported to Samarra, where the caliph al-Mu'tamid ordered the construction of a platform near the city racecourses for the rebel commander to be tortured on. On May 22, in an event attended by the caliph and the public, Yahya received 200 lashes, after which his hands and legs were cut off. He was then beaten with swords, drawn and quartered, and finally his body was burned.; ;  Withdrawal of Abu Ahmad  Following Yahya's capture, Abu Ahmad's camp at the Nahr Abi al-Asad was temporarily crippled by the outbreak of disease, and the government army was forced to wait until the afflicted soldiers had either died or recovered. After the disease had passed, Abu Ahmad ordered his troops to proceed to Badhaward, where he prepared his troops and barges for a new offensive against the Zanj.; ; Once his forces were ready, Abu Ahmad dispatched several commanders to advance against the Nahr Abi al-Khasib, while he remained behind with a handful of his troops. As the battle began, the government army was able to burn several of the rebels' dwellings and free a number of female captives, but the superior numbers of the Zanj eventually prevailed. Abu Ahmad's own position came under attack, and he eventually gave the signal for retreat. Most of the government troops were able to extract themselves, but a detachment of men was cut off from the barges and ambushed by the rebels; 110 men were killed and their heads were sent to 'Ali ibn Muhammad.; ; After the battle, Abu Ahmad made his way back to Badhaward, where he prepared for another advance against the Zanj. Before long, however, a wind storm caused a fire to break out in his camp and destroy it, and this brought an end to the campaign. In June or July 872 Abu Ahmad decided to make the return journey to Wasit, and upon reaching the city the majority of his troops dispersed.; ;  872-875  = Campaign of Musa ibn Bugha = In 873, following the Zanj's occupation of Suq al-Ahwaz, the central government decided to appoint the general Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir to direct the war effort against the rebels. On September 14, a public procession for Musa's departure was held; the caliph accompanied Musa through Samarra, and rewarded him with robes of honor at the city walls. Musa then departed to take up his command, and sent 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muflih to al-Ahwaz, Ishaq ibn Kundaj to Basra, and Ibrahim ibn Sima to Badhaward to fight against the Zanj.; ; Ibn Muflih was soon able to make progress in al-Ahwaz, forcing the Zanj commander 'Ali ibn Aban to withdraw from the province and return to Iraq. Once this was accomplished, Ibn Muflih advanced to Bayan, whereupon the two sides became stuck in a period of stalemate. Ibn Muflih and Ibrahim ibn Sima began to launch successive attacks against 'Ali ibn Muhammad's headquarters, while Ishaq ibn Kundaj worked to cut off the flow of supplies to the rebels; in response, 'Ali ibn Muhammad began sending out his forces to hold off the government armies, after which he would send a detachment to the outskirts of Basra, where Ishaq ibn Kundaj would fight them off. This series of attacks and counterattacks continued for ten months, until Musa ibn Bugha was replaced with Masrur al-Balkhi in mid-875.; ;  875-877  = Occupation of al-Batihah and Dast Maysan = Map of the Bata'ih region (orange). The wetlands of southern Iraq. Map of the canals to the south of Wasit: 1. (A)ban; 2. Quraysh; 3. al-Sib; 4. Barduda. The invasion of Iraq by the Saffarid amir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth in early 876 provided the Zanj with a new opportunity to advance to the north. In order to stop the Saffarid army, the caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi had been obliged to withdraw from the region of Wasit and recall his troops from the Tigris districts. This allowed him to join up with the main Abbasid army and halt Ya'qub's advance at the pivotal Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul, but in the process he had left the region south of al-Mada'in vulnerable to the Zanj, allowing them to expand without major hindrance.; ; Even prior to Masrur's withdrawal, the campaign against the rebels had suffered several recent setbacks. The government officer Musa ibn Utamish, stationed at al-Badhaward, had suffered losses at the hands of the Zanj commander Sulayman ibn Jami'; when Musa was consequently replaced by Ju'lan al-Turki, a certain Tha'lab ibn Hafs attacked and inflicted casualties on his cavalry and men. 'Ali ibn Muhammad, meanwhile, dispatched Ahmad ibn Mahdi al-Jubba'i with a fleet to the Nahr al-Mar'ah, which advanced to the neighborhood of al-Madhar and proceeded to plunder and destroy the villages in the area.; After returning to the Nahr al-Mar'ah, al- Jubba'i informed the Zanj leader that the region of the marshlands (al-Batihah was undefended by government troops, on account of their withdrawal by Masrur. The Zanj leader therefore decided to send his own forces into it and ordered Sulayman ibn Musa al-Sha'rani and Sulayman ibn Jami' to set out, instructing the latter to proceed to al-Hawanit. Al-Jubba'i was also told to go ahead of Sulayman ibn Jami' and establish camp at al-Hawanit, and a local guide was provided to help him navigate the roads and byways of the marshlands.; ;  Advances of Sulayman ibn Jami' and al-Jubba'i  After receiving his orders from 'Ali ibn Muhammad, Sulayman ibn Musa set out for al-Batihah. On the way he received a message from 'Ali, instructing him to stop a government fleet of thirty barges that was heading for the Zanj leader's headquarters and which had destroyed a village that had made peace with the rebels. Sulayman spent a month dealing with the enemy force, after which he resumed his advance and eventually reached the marshlands.; ; Al-Jubba'i, meanwhile, advanced until he encountered an army headed by Rumays. Al-Jubba'i defeated him, forcing Rumays to flee and capturing over fifty of his boats. During their retreat, Rumays's men were intercepted by Sulayman ibn Jami' and were again defeated. Several of the men and galleys defected to Sulayman, and told him that area between him and Wasit was clear of any government forces. Trusting in this information, Sulayman was unprepared for an attack by a Abu Mu'adh al-Qurashi, who routed him and captured one of his officers.; Following the battle, Sulayman returned to his camp, where he was informed by the deserters that Abu Mu'adh was the only force defending Wasit. He therefore sent notice to 'Ali ibn Muhammad and set out for the Nahr Aban. Abu Mu'adh attempted to block his way, but in the resulting battle he was forced to retreat. The way to the Nahr Aban now cleared, Sulayman proceeded toward it and began burning and plundering and taking women and children captive. A government detachment, however, eventually intercepted him and killed a large number of his men, and Sulayman and al-Jubba'i were compelled to flee back to their camp.;  Withdrawal from al-Hawanit  Upon being informed that Masrur al-Balkhi had departed from Wasit and was heading in his direction, Sulayman grew concerned that his position was exposed to attack by land and water. After consulting with his men, he decided to transfer to the area of Nahr Tathitha, which had dense thickets and an escape route back to the central Zanj camp. This move successfully threw the government forces off of his trail; upon Masrur's arrival he only found Sulayman's deserted camp, and attempts to locate the rebel's new position were unsuccessful.; After arriving at his new location, Sulayman sent notice of his movements to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, who approved and ordered him to send any food supplies and animals back to the central Zanj camp. This caused a dispute to break out between Sulayman, who attempted to send the supplies back on barges, and al-Jubba'i, who believed that any supplies they found should be burned in order to deny their use by the government. Al-Jubba'i began ignoring Sulayman's commands, prompting the latter to write to 'Ali and complain. The Zanj leader therefore intervened and sent orders to al-Jubba'i, instructing him to obey Sulayman and follow his commands.;  Killing of Khushaysh  After receiving word that a government army under the command of Aghartmish and Khushaysh was headed his way, Sulayman prepared his men for battle and sent al-Jubba'i to gather intelligence. Upon learning that the enemy force was only half a farsakh away from his position, he ordered al-Jubba'i to block Aghartmish's and Khushaysh's path and divert them from Sulayman's camp. He then crossed the Nahr Tahitha and ordered his black troops to conceal themselves; at a given signal they were to attack the government army as it passed them along the waterway. In spite of some difficulties, the Zanj attack was successful; Aghartmish's troops were routed and Khushaysh was killed. The rebels pursued Aghartmish back to his camp and seized a number of barges, but Aghartmish was eventually able to recover these.; ; Following the battle, Sulayman sent Khushayh's head to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, who ordered it to be put on display. Sulayman and al- Jubba'i then proceeded to the district of al-Hawanit. There they encountered a force under one Abu Tamim, who was killed during the fighting. Several of his barges, together with the troops on them, were seized, and news of the encounter was sent by Sulayman to 'Ali.; ;  877-880  = Fighting around al-Hawanit = After remaining in the marshlands for some time, Sulayman ibn Jami' wrote to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, requesting that he be allowed to return to the Zanj leader's camp. While waiting for a reply, he learned that a government force under Takin al-Bukhari was stationed in the region. After consulting with al-Jubba'i, Sulayman agreed to an attack and set out for Takin's position. While al-Jubba'i began attacking the government army with his galley, Sulayman's infantry and cavalry waited in ambush. Al-Jubba'i then faked a retreat and led Takin's men into the trap; the surprised government troops were unable to resist and were compelled to flee, with the Zanj pursuing them over a distance of three farsakhs.; ; Following the battle, Sulayman initially wanted to turn back, but at al-Jubba'i's urging he instead ordered an advance on Takin's encampment, which he reached at sunset. When the attack began, however, the government army put up a fierce resistance, and eventually Sulayman ordered his men to fall back. After spending some time to reorganize his men he ordered another assault, but this time he found that Takin had decided to withdraw and abandon his camp. The Zanj therefore plundered and burned it, and then returned to their own camp. There Sulayman learned that he had received approval from 'Ali to return, so he placed al- Jubba'i in command and set out for the Zanj leader's headquarters, arriving there in January or early February 878.; ; Sulayman was soon forced to head back to the marshlands, however, when a letter arrived from al-Jubba'i, stating that the latter had been defeated by Ju'lan al-Turki and that two other commanders, Manjur and Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-Yashkuri were attacking villages allied to the Zanj. Upon Sulayman's return, he set out from Tahitha with his forces. He first neutralized Ju'lan by sending al-Jubba'i to set up a position opposite him; al-Jubba'i was ordered to make his presence known, but to refrain from battle. Once this was done, Sulayman advanced with the rest of his army and attacked Muhammad ibn 'Ali. The resulting engagement was a major victory for Sulayman, who defeated Muhammad and seized a large amount of booty.; ; Sulayman spent the next several months on the offensive, attacking enemy villages and successively defeating several government commanders sent to stop him. By July 878, he had reached the vicinity of al-Rusafa, to the south of Wasit; the government army under Matar ibn Jami' stationed there was defeated and the town was plundered and burned. After this, however, Sulayman decided to temporarily halt his campaign and ordered a return to 'Ali ibn Muhammad's headquarters, which he reached on August 8.; ; = Occupation of Wasit, al-Nu'maniyyah and Jarjaraya = Map of the Wasit (yellow) and Baghdad (green) regions. Following Sulayman's departure, a government army under Matar ibn Jami' undertook a raid against Zanj villages, advancing to within two and a half farsakhs of Tahitha. Word of this expedition was sent by al-Jubba'i; in response, Sulayman to again set out for the marshlands, arriving on August 31. He spent the remainder of the year there, and continued to score victories against various government forces stationed in the region.; ; Toward the beginning of 879, Sulayman ibn Jami' decided to make a new advance and set out with his elite commanders and troops. He first encountered Takin al-Bukhari at al-Shadidiyyah on the Nahr Barduda, and despite suffering substantial losses he defeated him and seized his barges. News of this engagement caused Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had been appointed as governor of the region, to advance to al-Shadidiyyah himself. The resulting battle went on inconclusively for two days, but on the third day Sulayman drew out Ibn Laythawayh's by ordering his men to fall back. The Zanj then turned around and defeated the government army; Ibn Laythawayh was thrown into the Nahr Barduda and only narrowly escaped being drowned.; Following the victory against Ibn Laythawayh, Sulayman decided to assault Wasit itself. After requesting and receiving reinforcements from 'Ali ibn Muhammad, he advanced toward the city and attacked its governor Muhammad al-Muwallad. The latter was defeated and the Zanj proceeded to enter Wasit. Despite encountering resistance from a government force that held out until the afternoon, Sulayman's well- coordinated troops successfully occupied the city. A large number of people were killed and Wasit was plundered and burned. Afterward the rebels departed from the city and headed in the direction of Junbula' between Wasit and al- Kufa, causing despoliation and destruction on the way.; ; Sulayman spent most of the next month stationed in the district of Junbula', during which time he focused on digging a canal that would enable the shipment of supplies to his camp. Any hopes of maintaining this forward position, however, were dashed when Ibn Laythawayh undertook a damaging attack against the Zanj; several of Sulayman's commanders were killed and his boats were killed. Sulayman was forced to retreat back to Tahitha, which he reportedly stayed in for most of the remainder of the year.; ; ; The year 879 marked the northernmost advance of the rebels; Jabbul was entered and al-Nu'maniyyah was burned. The Zanj also reached Jarjaraya, which caused the residents of the Sawad region to seek refuge in Baghdad.; ;  880-883  = Campaign of Abu al-'Abbas =  First battle, entry into Wasit  The fall of Wasit in 879 finally convinced the Abbasid government of the need to devote more resources against the rebels. The caliphal regent Abu Ahmad (who by now was known by his honorific of al-Muwaffaq) accordingly charged his son Abu al-'Abbas to lead a well- equipped army of some ten thousand cavalry and infantry, together with a number of barges, galleys and ferries, and clear the Tigris districts of enemy troops. Abu al-'Abbas agreed and, after conducting an inspection of his men in late November or December 879 and making his preparations, he set out from Baghdad and headed south.; ; As he passed through the various towns along the Tigris, Abu al-'Abbas received information from his vanguard concerning the movements of Sulayman ibn Jami', al-Jubba'i and Sulayman ibn Musa. After reaching Fam al-Silh, between Jarjaraya and Wasit, he received word that the rebels were advancing against him; he therefore departed from the main road and changed his course. Soon after he made his first encounter with the advance units of the Zanj. The government troops provoked the rebels into pursuing them with a feigned retreat, and when the rebels approached Abu al-'Abbas he ordered his cavalry and infantry to attack. The Zanj were defeated and forced to withdraw; several prisoners were taken a number of barges and galleys were burned.; ; Following the battle, Abu al-'Abbas established himself in Wasit. After reciting the Friday prayers there, he again set out and made camp in al-'Umr, one farsakh below Wasit. There he ordered the construction of barges and ordered his men to conduct raids against the rebels.; ;  Battles in the marshlands and Dast Maysan  A short time after his arrival in al-'Umr, Abu al-'Abbas received word that the Zanj were again planning to attack him, and were approaching his army from three directions. The rebels initially hoped to draw the government troops into an ambush and sent twenty galleys to lure them into the trap, but Abu al-'Abbas ordered his men to hold their positions and not give pursuit. Their ruse having failed, Sulayman ibn Jami' and al-Jubba'i instead decided on a frontal attack, and Abu al-'Abbas responded by ordering his barges and cavalry to advance against the rebels. The battle, which took place in the vicinity of al-Rusafa, ended in another defeat for the Zanj; Sulayman and al-Jubba'i fled, and fourteen barges, as well as the horses of the rebels, were seized.; ; For twenty days after the battle, the government army made no further encounters with the Zanj. Abu al-'Abbas returned to al-'Umr, while al-Jubba'i set about digging traps on the paths usually taken by cavalrymen. Afterwards, the rebels began to harass Abu al-'Abbas' camp in an effort to provoke an engagement, but this strategy failed to produce the desired result, and no fighting took place for about a month.; ; Sulayman next decided to request reinforcements from 'Ali ibn Muhammad; once these arrived, al-Jubba'i established his position opposite Abu al-'Abbas' camp. Al-Jubba'i refrained from engaging the government army and retreated whenever it advanced; at the same time, his men began destroying bridges, shooting at horsemen that came within range of their arrows, and set fire to vessels that they caught while out on patrol. After two months of these activities, Abu al-'Abbas decided to attempt to draw out the rebels, and dispatched galleys as bait to lure them into a trap. The Zanj fell for the trick and seized a number of the galleys, whereupon the government army immediately set out against them. In the resulting battle, the rebels lost a number of their galleys to the government troops and were forced to retreat.; ; Abu al-'Abbas decided to follow up on his victory by scouting out the routes used by the Zanj galleys. He ordered his fleet commander Nusayr Abu Hamzah to go ahead with his barges, and then set ahead in his own boat. Abu al-'Abbas soon became separated from Nusayr, however, and disaster nearly overtook him when a strong Zanj force suddenly appeared on both sides of the canal and attacked his craft. Abu al-'Abbas narrowly escaped from the rebels and returned to al-'Umr. There he ordered three sailors who had left his vessel to seize some cattle be decapitated, and issued a warning that sailors who abandoned their galleys in time of battle would be put to death.; ; Upon learning that a large Zanj army had assembled at al-Siniyyah below Wasit, Abu al-'Abbas ordered his men to march there. The Zanj force was defeated; some of those who escaped made their way to Sulayman ibn Jami's base of al-Mansura in Tahitha, while others went to Sulayman ibn Musa's fortress of al-Mani'a at Suq al-Khamis. Abu al-'Abbas next made his way to 'Abdasi, where two Zanj commanders were stationed. The rebels there were routed; one of the commanders was killed and the other captured, and a number of female captives held by the Zanj there were freed.; ;  Expedition against al-Mani'a  After returning to his camp, Abu al-'Abbas resolved to march against Sulayman ibn Musa's stronghold of al-Mani'a. Despite the difficulties in reaching the fortress, which was accessible only by a narrow canal, he set out with Nusayr in the vanguard. Upon reaching the Nahr Baratiq, which led to al-Mani'a, Abu al-'Abbas remained at the mouth of the canal, about two farsakhs from the walls of the fortress, while Nusayr advanced on a road that ran alongside the canal. While positioned at the canal mouth, Abu al-'Abbas's ships came under attack by a rebel ground force, and the two sides fought for most of the morning. Nusayr, meanwhile, initially lost some of his barges to the Zanj, but he soon recovered them and succeeded in setting fire to al-Mani'a and taking prisoners. Abu al-'Abbas then drew out the rebel army with the lure of an exposed barge; the Zanj fell into the ambush and were defeated. Six Zanj galleys were captured and the rebels fled.; ; After the victory outside al- Mani'a, Abu al-'Abbas returned to al-'Umr, where he remained until the arrival of his father al-Muwaffaq.; ; = Return of al-Muwaffaq =  Arrival of al-Muwaffaq, capture of Mani'a  In September 880, Abu Ahmad al-Muwaffaq received a report that 'Ali ibn Muhammad had ordered his lieutenant 'Ali ibn Aban, who was then in al-Ahwaz, to march to Iraq with his troops and reinforce Sulayman ibn Jami'. Based on this information, al-Muwaffaq decided that Abu al-'Abbas needed additional support; he therefore resolved to organize an army and personally lead it against the rebels. Departing from the suburbs of Baghdad with his troops and watercraft in October, he made his way to Wasit; there he was met by his son and was apprised of the status of the latter's men.; ; Al-Muwaffaq and Abu al-'Abbas now combined their forces and set out to fight the Zanj. As they progressed to the south, Abu al-'Abbas came under attack from Sulayman ibn Musa's men, but he defeated them and decapitated the prisoners he took. The government armies then continued on their path until they reached their intended target, Sulayman's stronghold of al-Mani'a. Al- Muwaffaq ordered his son to advance against the city with a flotilla of barges and galleys, while he himself followed with his barges and army. As they approached al-Mani'a, the rebels engaged Abu al-'Abbas in a skirmish; when Sulayman ibn Musa and the Zanj realized the full strength of the forces arrayed against them, however, they decided to abandon the city and flee. Al- Muwaffaq then pursued the rebels to the marshlands, while Abu al-'Abbas' men scaled the walls of al-Mani'a, killed many of its inhabitants and freed several thousand women held captive there. Al-Muwaffaq ordered that the walls of al-Mani'a be razed and that the plunder gained from its conquest be sold off, using the proceeds to pay his troops.; ;  Capture of al-Mansura  Following the sack of al-Mani'a, al-Muwaffaq paused to gather information on Sulayman ibn Musa and Sulayman ibn Jami'. Upon receiving a report that the latter was at al-Hawanit, he dispatched Abu al-'Abbas to attack him there. Abu al-'Abbas reached al-Hawanit, but instead of finding Ibn Jami' he encountered two of his lieutenants, who were guarding a large food supply. The two sides met each other in battle, and fighting continued until nightfall. Abu al-'Abbas, however, learned from a defector that Sulayman was actually at al- Mansura in Tahitha and forwarded this news to al-Muwaffaq. The latter responded by heading to Barduda, from which led the road to Tahitha.; ; After conducting repairs on his ferries and equipment, paying his troops and gathering workers and materials for blocking canals and repairing roads, al- Muwaffaq set out from Barduda for Tahitha in late November 880, proceeding on horseback with his cavalry. His army advanced until they came within two mils of al-Mansura. Following a delay of several days due to inclement weather, al- Muwaffaq and a group of his officers went forward to the walls of al-Mansura to search for a place to deploy the cavalry. There, however, they were ambushed by the rebels and heavy fighting broke out. During the battle several government officers were captured by the Zanj, but the rebel commander al- Jubba'i was mortally wounded by an arrow and died a few days later.; ; Al- Muwaffaq then returned to his camp and prepared his troops for an assault on al-Mansura. Once the preparations were complete, he ordered his infantry, cavalry and watercraft to advance against the city, and sent orders for Abu al-'Abbas to do the same. The government soldiers successfully overcame the defenses of al-Mansura and entered the city from all sides, while the barges and galleys penetrated the city via a canal and proceeded to sink every rebel ship they encountered. Most of the Zanj were killed or captured, while Sulayman ibn Jami' fled with a small group of men. A large number of captive women and children were freed and dispatched to Wasit, and the captured government officers were freed as well. As with the fall of al-Mani'a, a great amount of stores, money, food and cattle were captured from al-Mansura; al- Muwaffaq ordered these sold and disbursed the proceeds to his men.; ; Al- Muwaffaq stayed in Tahitha for seventeen days following the taking of al- Mansura, after which he ordered that the latter's walls destroyed and its moats filled in. He also established a prize for anyone who managed to capture a Zanj fugitive; any rebel prisoner who was brought to him was treated well and pardoned, thereby enticing them to defect from the Zanj leader. Al- Muwaffaq then dispatched Nusayr Abu Hamzah to pursue Sulayman ibn Jami' and appointed Zirak al-Turki to remain in Tahitha and hunt down any remaining Zanj in the area.; ;  Advance on al-Mukhtarah  With both al-Mani'a and al- Mansura conquered, al-Muwaffaq returned to Wasit, where he prepared for a march into al-Ahwaz to clear the Zanj from that province. Shortly before departing, Zirak arrived and reported that the area of Tahitha was now secure. Al-Muwaffaq therefore instructed Zirak to head down to the Blind Tigris and meet up with Abu Hamzah Nusayr; the two were then to keep watch over the river and attack any Zanj troops travelling en route to al-Mukhtarah. Following this, al-Muwaffaq departed for al-Ahwaz, and over the course of January and February 881 he restored government control over that region.; ; While al- Muwaffaq was occupied in al-Ahwaz, Zirak and Nusayr arrived at the Blind Tigris and marched until they reached al-Ubulla. There they learned from a defector that a large Zanj force was occupying the Tigris and was headed for Nusayr's camp on the Nahr al-Marah. Nusayr then returned to his camp; Zirak, however, moved to intercept the rebels and placed himself in a position which he believed they would pass through. When the Zanj arrived he routed them, captured their commander and seized thirty galleys. Zirak then collected the severed heads of the slain and made his way to Wasit, where he informed al- Muwaffaq of the battle. News of Zirak's victory quickly spread, and two thousand rebels soon requested a pardon from Abu Hamzah. This was granted and the men were integrated into the government army.; ; By mid-February 881, al- Muwaffaq had finished operations in al-Ahwaz and was ready to attack the Zanj headquarters of al-Mukhtarah itself. He therefore set out for the Tigris region in the vicinity of al-Mukhtarah, arriving there on February 19, and also sent instructions to his commanders to meet him at the same place.; ; = Capture of al-Mukhtarah, end of the revolt = Over the course of the next two and a half years, the government forces under al-Muwaffaq laid siege to 'Ali ibn Muhammad and the Zanj in al-Mukhtarah. During this period, both the besiegers and the besieged engaged in numerous stratagems in an attempt to dislodge the other side, and battles took place both inside and outside the city's fortifications. The rebels mounted a fierce defense, conducting several sorties against the besiegers, attempted to repair damage to their defenses and block government ships by sabotaging canals. By the time of the siege most if not all of the Zanj had returned to the city to reinforce it, and most of the remaining Zanj commanders, including Sulayman ibn Jami', Sulayman ibn Musa, 'Ali ibn Aban, and 'Ali's son Ankalay, participated in its defense.; ; On the government's side, al-Muwaffaq was in command of an enormous number of men and ships, and his troops used naphtha in an attempt to burn down enemy structures. In addition, he ordered the construction of a new city, al- Muwaffaqiyyah, which provided provisions and other services for his men. Throughout the siege he utilized a carrot and stick approach with the rebels; Zanj troops that voluntarily surrendered were granted guarantees of safety and rewards, and were paraded in front of al-Mukhtarah to convince others to join them, while rebel soldiers that were killed in battle were at times decapitated and their heads were displayed in view of the defenders. Despite several reverses, including one incident where al-Muwaffaq was seriously wounded in battle, the government forces progressively wore down the defenses of the rebels. The western side of al-Mukhtarah fell in the spring of 883, and the eastern side followed that August. During the final assault by the government army, the rebels were completed defeated and 'Ali ibn Muhammad was killed, bringing the rebellion to a virtual end.; ;  Aftermath  Following the fall of al-Mukhtarah and the killing of 'Ali ibn Muhammad, al-Muwaffaq ordered letters to be written to the centers of the Muslim world, proclaiming that the rebel leader was dead and that the people of Basra, al-Ubulla, the Tigris districts, and al-Ahwaz could return to their homes in safety. Abu al-'Abbas, meanwhile, returned to Baghdad in November 883 and led his troops in a procession through the city; the head of 'Ali was placed on a spear and carried in front of Abu al-'Abbas during the ceremony, allowing the city's residents to see it and celebrate the rebel's death.; ; Several of the rebel commanders who had surrendered, including Ankalay, 'Ali ibn Aban, Sulayman ibn Jami', and Sulayman ibn Musa, were imprisoned in Baghdad following the end of the revolt, and the household and children of 'Ali ibn Muhammad were brought to the city as well. In 885/886, in response to a Zanj riot in Wasit, al- Muwaffaq ordered that the commanders be decapitated and the heads brought to him. The bodies of those killed were initially dumped down a sewer, but were later retrieved and put on display on the west and east sides of Baghdad.; ;  Notes   References   * Category:Zanj Rebellion ","title":"Iraq theater (Zanj Rebellion)"},{"id":"48274286","text":"Bernard Connolly (December 1804 ‚Äì June 9, 1880) was an American newspaperman, politician and writer based in Freehold, New Jersey. As a boy in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, Bernard Connolly learned the printing business at the Westmoreland Republican, becoming proficient in both newspaper and book printing. At 21, he moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where he entered into a partnership in a printing house already in business there. While living in Princeton he married Hannah Ann Downie. In 1834 he moved to Freehold, where he founded a weekly newspaper, the Monmouth Democrat, with an editorial policy supporting Jacksonian democracy. This quickly became the most successful newspaper circulating in Monmouth County at the time. Connolly was proprietor of the Democrat until January 1854, when he sold the business. Political career A loyal Democrat, Bernard Connolly worked hard for many years to promote the party. In 1844, as a candidate for Delegate to the Constitutional Convention, he successfully opposed proposals for equal representation of Whig and Democrat delegates. Monmouth County then elected a delegation consisting solely of Democrats, which tipped the majority at the convention to that party.Obituary, Monmouth Democrat; June 17, 1880 In the 1850 general election, Bernard Connolly was elected as a Democrat to the New Jersey General Assembly, and served during the 1851 Session.Monmouth Democrat; November 14, 1850 During the Pierce Administration he held a position in the New York Custom House. In 1856, with the new Republican Party appearing on the national scene, Connelly changed his party affiliation and supported John C. Fr√©mont for President. Fr√©mont's running mate, William L. Dayton, was a former resident of Freehold. In the 1858 general election, Bernard Connelly was again a candidate for Assembly, this time as a Republican running under the Opposition Party designation; he lost to Democrat Austin H. Patterson. The following year he was an unsuccessful candidate for Sheriff of Monmouth County. In 1872, Bernard Connelly joined the Liberal Republican Party and supported its presidential candidate, Horace Greeley. After Greeley's loss to President Ulysses S. Grant, and subsequent death, the Liberal Republican Party dissolved; Connelly then returned to the Democratic Party and remained a Democrat until his death in 1880. Later years and death After retiring from politics, Bernard Connelly returned to writing, providing the biographical sketches for Woolman & Rose's Historical & Biographical Atlas of the New Jersey Coast in 1878. In the fall of 1879 he moved in with his daughter in New Utrecht, New York, now a part of Brooklyn. In 1880, in failing health, he thought a visit to his son in Long Branch would be helpful.Obituary, Monmouth Democrat; June 17, 1880 While there, he died of heart disease on June 9, 1880.The Matawan Journal, June 19, 1880 References Category:1804 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:People from Freehold Borough, New Jersey Category:People from Princeton, New Jersey Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Jacksonians Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:New Jersey Oppositionists Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:New Jersey Liberal Republicans Category:19th-century American newspaper founders Category:19th-century American newspaper editors Category:19th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:American male journalists ","title":"Bernard Connolly (New Jersey)"},{"id":"48274315","text":"Roger Chapman or Chepman (fl. 1391‚Äì1404) was an English politician.

Alternating planar algebras provide an appropriate algebraic framework for other knot invariants in cases the elements involved in the computation are alternating. The concept has been used in extending to tangles some properties of Jones polynomial and Khovanov homology of alternating links. Definition An alternating planar algebra is an oriented planar algebra, where the d-input planar arc diagrams D satisfy the following conditions: * The number k of strings ending on the external boundary of D is greater than 0. * There is complete connection among input discs of the diagram and its arcs, namely, the union of the diagram arcs and the boundary of the internal holes is a connected set. * The in- and out-strings alternate in every boundary component of the diagram. A planar arc diagram like this has been denominated type-A planar diagram. Applications There are two known applications of the concept of alternating planar algebra. *It was used for extend to tangles the property that states that the Jones Polynomial of an alternating link is an alternating polynomial. *It was used for extend to tangles a result about the Khovanov homology that states that The Khovanov homology of an alternating link is supported in two lines.

It is also the group's first song recorded together; written by lead singer L.E. Doug Staiman before the band had formed, he decided to film a low-budget music video for the song using a pickup band, which would later become The Groggers. Background Staiman conceived of the song while working at a Jewish family law firm, where he often had to deal with couples caught in messy divorces. Staiman wrote \\"Get\\" in 15 minutes while playing for a camp with Aryeh Kunstler. Having received positive feedback on his music from friends but believing it was too niche to go anywhere, Staiman decided to film a low- budget video for \\"Get\\" using pickup musicians, including friend and former Yeshiva University classmate Ari Friedman. After the video became a small viral hit, Staiman, Friedman, and the other musicians decided to form the Groggers. Lyrical content The song satirically addresses the issue of an agunah, a Jewish woman whose husband refuses to grant her a get, or Jewish divorce, effectively preventing her from marrying anyone else. In the song, Staiman encourages such a husband to admit his failings and give his wife the divorce (\\"You gotta get, get, get, get, give her a get/'Cause she don't love you no more\\"). Following its release, the song became a popular tool among agunah activists. Music video The video, directed by then-film student Farrell Goldsmith, was made for $30 and shot in one day. It was released on May 2, 2010; by early 2012, it had 115,000 views on YouTube, an uncommon feat for Jewish music videos. The video depicts a man in a failing marriage being hounded by the band to grant her a divorce, even being tied to a chair. Personnel *L.E.

The community is centered around the historic 152 year old New Harmony Baptist Church. History New Harmony was organized in 1867 after the Civil War had ended and 18 adults realized that their families needed a new place of worship after the Dean community near the Dixie area had disbanded. The 18 adults and one child met on April 20, 1867, and organized the church they called Harmony, approximately 12 miles northwest of Tyler, Texas. Soon they petitioned the Cherokee Baptist Association for membership and learned there was already a church by that name. The members resubmitted the petition and were accepted under the name of \\"New Harmony Baptist Church\\". The first church house was built on the site that later became the New Harmony Cemetery. A second church house was built across the road from that first church. Natural springs behind the church provided baptismal waters. On December 21, 1907, the church family moved into a third building on the same site. A storm damaged that building in 1915, and a fourth church building was erected at a total cost of $330.35. This building served as the worship center for 34 years. The fifth church building was erected in 1949. Since then, there have been seven major additions including a new sanctuary constructed in 1993. The old sanctuary was retained for Sunday School rooms and a library. Having only 37 pastors in its 150-year history, and only 2 pastors in the last 50 years, New Harmony has been greatly blessed by God. Within the church walls, individual members have had a refuge to grow spiritually. Collectively, the church has shared the gospel of Jesus' saving grace and peace on local, state, national, and world levels. Living through World War I and World War II and the wars of Korea, Vietnam, The Gulf, and Iraq, the church has kept a strong faith. History records a praying church for the 40 members who served during World War II and the safe return of every soldier. Prayers for local church members and the needs of neighbors and nations have never ceased. A history of 150 years for the church reveal many personal, local and national challenges that were met as members stood firm on Biblical principles and compassion for mankind. The church has relied on the truth in the scriptures during struggles and hard times and has remembered God as The Source during times of prosperity. New Harmony has never been without faith in God who promised, \\"If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\\" (II Chronicles 7:14).

It is the only high school in the Bessemer City School System. School colors are purple and white, and the athletic teams are called the Tigers. BCHS competes in AHSAA Class 6A athletics. BCHS was constructed in 2010 as a replacement for the aging Jess Lanier High School, which was founded in 1970 and named for the former Bessemer mayor of the same name. The name of the present school was chosen by a poll of Bessemer students and residents. BCHS received 1,981 votes, compared to 671 for \\"Marvel City High School\\" and 665 for \\"Bessemer Millennium High School\\".  Campuses and history  * The present Bessemer City High School (BCHS) is the systems' flagship school and the third descendant school to carry the city's name. It was completed in January 2010 and the 215,000-square-foot facility is perched on the high point of a 72-acre site. The $50 million high school and athletic complex was largely funded by a bond fund issued by the Jefferson County Commission that was financed by a 1¬¢ sales tax increase in Jefferson County. That tax, championed by then Jefferson County Commission President Larry Langford, and supported by others on the Commission who divided its revenues on a formula basis among all the school systems in Jefferson County. The new multi-story school which is visible from Interstate 59 can be accessed via the Academy Drive Exit of I-59. The present BCHS building incorporates a curved steel roof and is clad with three shades of brick. Large expanses of glass wrap the massive L-shaped concourse that connect the three wings, academic, arts, and athletics. The school accommodates 1,500 students with a 760 seat auditorium and a combination PE/competition gym seating 1,500 for basketball games. The facility also has large band, choral, and jazz rehearsal spaces and a two- story career tech wing. * The current high school was preceded by Jess Lanier High School. It operated between 1970 and 2010. That building is still in use by the Bessemer School System and re-named and became Bessemer City Middle School (grades 6‚Äì8) in 2013 replacing Davis Middle School.AL.com, Jesse Chambers, 9/13/2013 That structure is largely a single-story building made of brick and steel and typical of late 1960s style school architecture. Its campus is located near Memorial Drive in the area of the city behind the Medical Center. * The second \\"Bessemer High School\\" was built in 1923 and still exists although the facility no longer belongs to the Board of Education. It faces south on 2nd Avenue between 14th and 15th Street and occupies the entire city block. It is near what would be considered the downtown area. That two-story building primarily has a dark red brick facing with a gray-colored rough stone facing from the ground to the bottom of the first story windows. Most of its entrance ways have arched masonry pediments. For many years after it ceased to be a school, it served as a Jehovah's Witnesses Christian Church facility until it was again sold in February 2019 to another religious organization, Fountain of Life Ministries. * The first facility named \\"Bessemer High School\\" was located on the southeast corner of Arlington Avenue and 19th Street. It was a 3-story yellow brick building with rows of wood-cased windows surrounded by stone edging. Its cornerstone was dated October 23, 1908, and it opened about 1910. Only its cornerstone survives today and can be seen at the Bessemer Hall of History. After that building ceased to be the city high school in 1923, it was re-named Arlington Elementary and served in that capacity for many years. After it ceased to be an elementary school the building was abandoned and allow to fall into disrepair. It was demolished sometime after mid-2014 and the site remains a vacant lot. Today only remnants of a stone retaining wall that run parallel to the sidewalk along the property edge are visible remains. At the same time that the second Bessemer High opened the city system also operated Dunbar High School which was a separate high school for black students. Dunbar's first graduating class was in 1927. It was located at 2715 6th Avenue and named after Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet, novelist, and playwright of the late 19th and early 20th century. Dunbar High School was replaced by Abrams High School (1959‚Äì1987). The Dunbar High School building continued to function as an elementary school from 1959 until 1980. Today it serves as a community center. The Abrams High School building today serves as Abrams Elementary School. The city also operated for many years Carver High School (named after George Washington Carver (also for black students) which was located at 600 2nd Avenue North. That facility closed following the 1969 school year and its students transferred to the then-new Jess Lanier High School. The Carver High School building no longer exists. Also, on site with the current Bessemer City High School are a new synthetic turf football stadium seating 4,500, a nine-lane track, a new restroom/concessions building, and a spacious new field house at the end zone of the new field. Also on site are a new baseball field and press box as well as a new softball field and press box/concessions building.  Student profile  Enrollment in grades 9‚Äì12 for the 2013‚Äì14 school year is 996 students. Approximately 94% of students are African-American, 4% are Hispanic, and 2% are white. Roughly 83% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. BCHS has a graduation rate of 73%. Approximately 57% of its students meet or exceed state proficiency standards in mathematics, and 62% meet or exceed standards in reading. The average ACT score for BCHS students is 20. Athletics BCHS competes in AHSAA Class 6A athletics and fields teams in the following sports: * Baseball * Basketball * Cheerleading * Football * Indoor Track & Field * Outdoor Track & Field * Soccer * Softball * Volleyball BCHS won the 1990 Alabama Football Playoff championship when the school was known as Jess Lanier High School by defeating Murphy High School of Mobile 22‚Äì0 in the title game. The Purple Tigers head coach at the time was Carroll Cox who in 21 years (1979‚Äì1999) as Jess Lanier's coach compiled a record of 162‚Äì77‚Äì2.AHSFHS.org Cox was the school's winningest coach having won just five more games than Snitz Snider. The old downtown campus school on 2nd Avenue was declared state football champions four times in an era in which no playoff existed with Bessemer receiving \\"mythical titles\\" in 1940, 1951, 1952, and 1954. During this era, the school played its games at Bessemer Stadium located at 915 4th Avenue North.

In the collection of the Finnish National Gallery Forest industry in Finland consists of mechanical (timber) and chemical (paper and pulp) forest industry. Finland is one of the world's largest producer of pulp, paper and cardboard and one of Europe's largest producers of sawn timber. The forest industry directly and indirectly employs approximately 160,000 people in Finland. The industry's multiplier effects extend broadly into surrounding society. Log driving had begun by the 17th century in Finland (tukinuitto) with long rivers such as Oulujoki, Iijoki and Kemijoki being used. The total length of timber-floating routes in Finland was 40,000km. Given the economic importance of the activity, the Finnish water act states that \\"unless otherwise provided by law, everyone has the right, without inflicting unnecessary damage, harm or disturbance, to‚Ä¶ float timber in the water body‚Ä¶\\". A log driver competitions is still organised in Finland annually - the Tukkilaiskisat. In 2014 the value of production of forest industry in Finland, including furniture industry, was 20.7 billion euros. This was 18% of all industrial production. Forest industry employed 15% of industrial workers in Finland. The forest industry is the main source of income for many regions in Finland. It accounts for approximately 20 per cent of all Finnish exports. Chemical forest industry (also known as paper and pulp industry) produces paper, cardboard and pulp. Finland has 25 paper mills, 14 cardboard mills and 15 pulp mills. In 2014 they employed 22 000 people. Mechanical forest industry produces wooden items mechanically: sawing, turning and glueing. Sawmills are the largest employer of the sector. Sawmills and board production are highly automatised, but manual skills are still needed in carpentry. Mechanical forest industry employs 26 000 people in Finland. In addition 9000 have a job in furniture production. There are also about 130 industrial sawmills as well as other companies in the wood products industry. The largest companies are Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and Mets√§ Board. In 2005-2015 they had to jettison almost half of their employees as the paper production was declining. The companies search new growth in packaging materials and wood-based chemicals.

McFerrin's experimentation for new and innovative voice improvisations led his composer and producer to Rosler, who translated McFerrin's wordless vocal articulations into rhythmic lyrics using a collage of languages, including McFerrin's own invented one. Rosler was the recipient of a SESAC 2010 Jazz Award in recognition of his outstanding contribution; the most compelling masterpiece, as Jazz Times notes, is ‚ÄúMessages,‚Äù ‚Äúa cornucopia of languages constructed by lyricist Don Rosler that rises like a melodious Tower of Babel, exalting the incomparable beauty of universal harmony.‚Äù Of the many compositions Rosler lyrically wrote for VOCAbuLarieS , \\"Brief Eternity\\" and \\"Messages\\" were originally commissioned by Grant Gershon, Artistic Director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale. These compositions had their world premiere at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003. Rosler and Treece also teamed up to write a vocal rendition of Pat Metheny/Lyle May's \\"September 15th\\" for the Swimming to London album by Grammy-winning King's Singers and a composition called \\"When Love Wins the Day\\" for the Chicago Children's Choir. Rosler is also the co-writer and co- producer of John Margolis‚Äô debut album John Margolis: Christine's Refrigerator, the first of many creative collaborations between these two artists. The title track was awarded Song of the Year by Just Plain Folks Music Organization and was featured on the Kitchen Sisters‚Äô ‚ÄúKitchen Stories‚Äù report (NPR‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Edition‚Äù) and on their audio-book, ‚ÄúHidden Kitchens.‚Äù In 2013 Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Jim Dwyer wrote about \\"Christine's Refrigerator\\" in The New York Times for his ‚ÄúAbout New York\\" column after singer-songwriter Christine Lavin created a video for the song with the help of fans and enthusiasts of the song. Another track from the John Margolis: Christine's Refrigerator record ‚ÄúTanta Belleza (So Much Beauty)‚Äù was prominently featured in the HBO/Cinemax film The Kidnapping of Ingrid Betancourt. Most recently, Don Rosler is the writer and producer of the acclaimed concept album Rosler's Recording Booth (original songs inspired by Wilcox-Gay Recordio and Voice-o-Graph booth records), featuring Spottiswoode, Tam Lin, Terry Radigan, Jeremy Sisto, John Margolis, Jon Albrink, Isabel Keating, Tamara Hey, Kathena Bryant (from The Hippy Nuts) and Rosler. Rosler's Recording Booth was nominated by the Independent Music Awards for \\"Best Concept Album\\" in 2011 and one of the songs \\"Doris From Rego Park\\" was featured in the New York Times. Many other tunes from this record received considerable airplay across the U.S. References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American songwriters Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Don Rosler"},{"id":"48275403","text":"On 18 October 2015, a gunman shot and killed the 19-year-old Israeli soldier Omri Levy in a bus station in Beersheba. After killing the soldier, he took his automatic rifle and fired into a crowd. When more security officers appeared, the gunman fled, but was killed by security personnel. A 29-year-old Eritrean asylum seeker, Haftom Zarhum was mistaken for a second attacker. He was shot eight times by police and was kicked and beaten by four Israelis as he lay wounded, while bystanders shouted profanities at him. Graphic footage of the lynching was filmed by a bystander and spread on social media. At least eleven people, including Zarhum, who died of his wounds a few hours later, and four police officers, were hospitalized. The gunman was the first Israeli Bedouin to be involved in an attack against Israelis. In response to the lynching, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that citizens should not take the law into their own hands. Attack The gunman, armed with a knife and a pistol, used the pistol to shoot a police officer, then grabbed the officer's assault rifle and continued shooting wounding several more police officers, soldiers and civilians. He then attempted to flee but was killed in a shootout with the police. During the attack, security forces shot Zarhum eight times, mistaking him for a second gunman. Bystanders also mistook him for an attacker and kicked him and shouted abuse at him as he lay wounded. A prison officer who took part in the beating told media that he had seen Zarhum lift his hands towards his head, and attacked him in the belief that he was a terrorist who had not been \\"neutralized\\" and that he might have been reaching for a weapon. At least one of the wounded Israeli soldiers, 19-year-old Daniel Harush, was shot and critically injured by a fellow security officers who mistook him for a terrorist. At least four of the injured were police officers. Investigations Initially, Israeli authorities thought that the attacker had accomplices. = Attacker = The gunman was identified by authorities as 21-year-old Muhand al-Okabi (Mohind al-Okbi, Muhannad al-Aqabi), an Israeli from the Bedouin town of Hura in the Negev. His mother was an immigrant from Gaza who gained citizenship under the Israeli family reunification law after marrying an Israeli citizen. The New York Times describes the involvement of Israeli Bedouin in terrorism as \\"unusual\\". Initial Palestinian media reports had misidentified the gunman as one Asam al-Araj of Shuafat. The attacker's cellphone contained photographs of weapons, Hamas militants, and material related to his plan to attack the bus station. According to co-workers, the perpetrator had expressed confidence that ISIS would soon conquer Israel. The shooter's brother, 20-year-old Omar al-Okabi, allegedly knew that Muhand had acquired a gun and that he had increasingly radical beliefs. He was indicted by the Beersheba Magistrate's Court for failing to prevent his brother from carrying out the attack. =Lax Security= Police investigation of the attack found that the contractor operating the bus station didn't provide adequate security. The company was required to have eleven guards, but only seven were on duty, and the guards failed to properly screen individuals entering the bus station. = Lynching and trial = Authorities detained four Israelis, David Moyal, Evyatar Damari, Yaakov Shamba and Ronen Cohen, who were involved in beating Zarhum. According to the footage from the incident, as Zarhum lay helpless on the ground Moyal moved in and dropped a bench on him. Moyal was then drawn away by the crowd that surrounded Zarhum. Two other men moved in and kicked Zarhum hard in the head and upper body. A fourth man then again dropped a bench on Zarhum. An autopsy determined that Zarhum died of gunshot wounds, not of injuries inflicted by the mob. The prosecution dismissed the defendants claim of self defense: \\"the defendants committed serious acts of violence towards the late citizen Haftom Zarhum, who was already shot, wounded and profusely bleeding, from a motive of vengeance and in order to relieve their anger, and not as the defendants claimed from self-defense.\\" In 2018 it offered a plea bargain arrangement with the defendants with downgraded the charge from \\"causing injury with grave intent\\" which entails potentially 20 years in prison to \\"abuse of a helpless person.\\" Moyal and Damari accepted the offer. In July that year Moyal was sentenced to 100 days of community service, 8 months of probation, and ordered to pay NIS 2,000 in compensation.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5303745,00.htmlAlmog Ben Zikri, 'Israeli State's Attorney Offers Community Service to Asylum Seeker's Lynchers,' Haaretz 9 March 2018 and in December Damari was sentenced to four months in prison. The two others, Yaakov Shamba and Ronen Cohen, took the case to trial. They were tried in the Beersheba District Court for causing injury with grave intent. In July 2020, they were acquitted. The court ruled that their claim that they thought the man was a terrorist was enough to create reasonable doubt for an acquittal.https://www.timesofisrael.com/court- acquits-men-who-lynched-eritrean-migrant-they-mistook-for-terrorist/ Early reports said that Zarhum possessed a work visa, but it was later determined that he was an asylum seeker without a residency permit. Despite Zarhum lacking a residency permit, which made his family ineligible for government assistance paid to families of victims of terrorism, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein recommended that the family be given assistance. The Israeli National Insurance Agency, however, rejected Zarhums family's claim for compensation because he entered the country illegally. Response Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leaders of sponsoring social media incitement encouraging young Arabs to attack Israelis, and warned Israelis who witness attacks not to take the law into their own hands, \\"Someone who witnesses an attack needs to leave the scene and allow security and rescue forces to work.... We're a nation of laws. No one may take the law into their hands.\\" Leaders of the Israeli Bedouin community condemned the attack. The Mayor of Hura, Mohammed Alnabati, stated: \\"We utterly and unreservedly condemn this despicable act and reject violence of any sort.... We condemn this act on behalf of the entire Bedouin society and wish to make clear that you cannot be both a terrorist and a citizen of the country; the two are inherently contradictory.\\" ISIS posted a series of videos praising the shooter, with titles including \\"Project Behead the Jews\\", \\"Message to the Mujahedin in Jerusalem\\", and urging Muslims to \\"this jihad against the Jews\\". Taleb Abu Arar, Member of Knesset for the United Arab List asserted al-Okbi's \\"innocence\\", and demanded that the shooting be investigated \\"again and again until the truth is uncovered\\". The Palestinian Authority honored the attacker as a \\"shaheed\\". Impact After the attack, Eritreans in Israel said that the killing of the Eritrean bystander was an example of racism. Two aspects of the attack led to an extended public conversation; the security personnel seen running away from the active shooter, and the bystanders seen kicking and cursing Zarhum mistaken for a second attacker after he had already been shot. A videotape of Zarhum being beaten while lying on the ground bleeding from gunshot wounds shocked Israelis. The shooting was the subject of the 2016 documentary film Death in the Terminal, directed by Tali Shemesh and Asaf Sudril. The film won prizes at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and the Ophir Awards, as well as Best Film at DocAviv.

Later succeeded his father Deshalji I in 1752 and ruled until his death in 1760. Life Cenotaph of Rao Lakhpatji at Bhuj. Lakhpatji was an only son of Deshalji I, Rao of Cutch State. He was freehanded and spent the money freely. He was denied the share of power and was advised to reduce his expenses. Lakhpatji left Bhuj, and threatening to take service with the king of Udaipur, forced his father to yield to some of his demands. Though to appearance satisfied, Lakhpatji secretly continued to scheme to bring the government into his hand. His first step was to get rid of the minister Devkarn, whom he hated as the cause of his exclusion from a share of power, and whose close intimacy with his mother he is said to have had strong reason for believing to have been criminal. Accordingly, in 1738, he raised a disturbance in front of the minister's house, who, coming out to restore order, was attacked and slain by a hired assassin. At first indignant at the loss of his favourite minister, the Rao was by degrees won by Lakhpatji's submission to grant him forgiveness, and in token of their friendship agreed to be present at an entertainment in Lakhpatji's house. The Rao brought with him most of his chief officers, and to show respect to his father, Lakhpatji had all his attendants in waiting. There was much delay in serving the feast, and the young chief, after many impatient messages, himself left the room to hurry on the banquet. As he left every opening from the room was closed, and the Rao and his officers were quietly secured. Placing his father in confinement, Lakhpatji began to rule, receiving the submission of the commandants of all the forts in the province except Mandvi. When Lakhpatji was settled in power, he allowed his father a suitable establishment and greater freedom. And his officers and personal friends were released and sent to distant parts of the country. In 1751, Rao Desalji I died at the age of seventy. In 1741, when he placed his father in confinement and assumed the rule of Cutch, Lakhpatji was thirty-four years old. At the same time many of the Jadejas were displeased at Lakha's treatment of his father, and one of them, Sumraji, Thakor of Tera, Kutch, spoke with open scorn of his conduct. When firmly settled in the government, Lakhpatji determined to wipe out this affront. Collecting the Bhayat, he sent a force against Tera, and as the guns were served by men drawn from British territory, the fort suffered severely. After a few days, the chiefs taking thought that on an equally slight pretext the Rao might destroy all their forts, warned the gunners that, if they continued to damage the fort, they should pay for it with their lives. After this the firing caused little injury, and failing to breach the walls, after a three months' siege, the army withdrew. On the accession of the Rao, Devkarn's son Punja was appointed minister, and so long as he was able to find funds he remained in favour. At the end of five years, by a course of unbounded extravagance, Lakhpatji had wasted his father's treasure, and, finding his income too small for his wants, he dismissed Punja and set a Vania, Rupshi Sha, in his place. Rupshi Sha seized the wealth of Punja and all his relatives. The system of fining, first adopted by Rao Lakhpatji, soon became the regular practice, and ministers were chosen solely on account of their wealth which soon passed to the Rao. For four years (1746-1750) Rupshi Sha continued in power, and Punja was kept in confinement. Then Rupshi Sha fell into disfavour, and Punja, again in power, retaliated on Rupshi Sha, massacring his relations and sparing his life only for prison and the rack. In such disorders affairs soon took another turn, and Punja, driven from power, was succeeded by Gordhan Mehta. Thinking himself ill-used, Punja closely allied himself with Godji II, the Rao's only lawful son. Though but sixteen years of age, Godji, following his father's example and stirred on by his mother and Punja, demanded from his father a share in the management of the state. The Rao refused, and the young chief retired in anger. In his disappointment Punja counselled Godji openly to oppose his father, and the lad and his mother agreed to fly with Punja to Godji's town of Mundra. Before leaving Bhuj, Punja managed to ruin his rival Gordhan Mehta. On the day of his flight, to prevent suspicion, he sent a message to the minister asking for a private interview. That it might afterwards seem that he and Gordhan had together planned some treachery, he went to Gordhan's house with much show of mystery, drew public attention to his visit, and for two hours, with closed doors and windows, contrived to amuse Gordhan with trifling conversation. Shortly after, the Rao was told that his son and wife had fled with Punja. And hearing that a few hours before his flight Punja had a long and secret meeting with Gordhan, he was highly enraged, and ordered Gordhan's instant execution. On Gordhan's death Rupshi Sha was freed and restored to power. He continued minister for a year and a half, when, on his return from Kabul, the post was given to Tulshidas, a favourite of the Rao's. Lakhpat fort gate Meanwhile, Godji was living in Mundra independent of his father. Though chiefly advised by Punja, he trusted much to one Mirza Amir Beg whom he made his Jamadar. About this time, a certain Shah Madanji, a very rich merchant, died in Mundra, and to his funeral ceremonies some of the wealthiest men in Cutch came. Acting on his Jamadar's advice, Godji, who was badly off for funds, shut the city gates and refused to let the merchants go till they paid large sums of money. Enraged at his son's conduct, Lakhpatji sent a force against Mundra. Godji fled to Morbi, and being supplied with troops, came back, drove off the attacking force, and relieved the town. The Rao at length compromised with his son allowing him to keep Mundra on condition that he would dismiss Punja. To this Godji agreed, and in 1758 Punja retired to Mothala in Abdasa, on a monthly pension of about ¬£25 (1000 koris). About this time (1757) the Rao presented the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. (1754-1759) with some Kutch horses and Gujarat bullocks, and in return received the title of Mirza. In the following year he planned an expedition against Thatta and was promised help both by the Peshwa and the Gaekwad but never carried out. As his influence in Sindh and Parkar declined, and in 1760 the posts at Virawah and Parkar were driven out. Though the wealth of the country was squandered, its finances were flourishing. Lakhpat alone, from the cultivation of rice, yielded a yearly revenue of about ¬£20,000 (8 lakhs of koris). The province was at peace with its neighbours, and the only internal disturbance, due to some encroachments on the part of the Dhamarka chief, ended in the Rao's favour, and in the capture and destruction of the Thakor's town. In 1760, Lakha who had been suffering from leprosy and other diseases, died at the age of fifty-four, and was succeeded by Godji II. He patronised navigator and craftsman Ram Singh Malam who built Aina Mahal for him in Bhuj, Old Palace in Mandvi and his memorial cenotaph in Bhuj.

The Malco, which was frequented by Bill Clinton as a boy, has played host to the prestigious Hot Springs Documentary Film Institute (HSDFI). The Art Deco building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 2010. The Malco is currently home to the Maxwell Blade Theatre of Magic & Comedy. The economy of Hot Springs depended on lodging, dining, and entertainment to support its burgeoning tourism industry. In the late 1800s, Hot Springs attracted visitors from around the country to ‚Äútake the waters.‚Äù After their therapeutic bathing, visitors sought amusements and recreation. At first, this was limited to hunting, fishing, and horseback riding, activities they usually did closer to home as well, but the demand increased for diversions such as gambling and entertainment. In 1882, the Opera House on Hot Springs‚Äô Central Avenue was opened to present theatrical productions, including hosting traveling companies from New York. In the early 1900s, motion pictures became a leading form of entertainment across the country. Frank Head, manager of the Opera House, commissioned the construction of the Princess Theatre in 1910 for viewing silent movies as well as attending vaudeville shows. It was built where Bridge Street connects Broadway to Central Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare. Hot Springs resident Sidney Nutt Sr. bought the Princess Theatre in 1927, converting it to sound in 1929 as talking pictures began to replace silent films. Hot Springs‚Äô downtown business district along Central Avenue suffered a number of catastrophic fires in the early 1900s. The Princess Theatre survived until Christmas Eve in 1935, when a blaze destroyed all but its foundation and its masonry entrance on Broadway Street. Those elements would become the cornerstone of the Malco Theatre. Working with architectural firm Brueggeman and Swaim to utilize the shell of the Princess Theatre, Nutt rebuilt it after the fire. When complete, the irregularly shaped theater had a large auditorium, balcony, lobby, and area for offices facing Central Avenue. The front of the theater included striking Art Deco elements that were popular at the time. In 1936, Nutt sold his interest in the Princess to M. A. Lightman of Memphis, Tennessee, a successful theater owner throughout the South and founder of the Malco Theatre group. The Princess was renamed the Malco Theatre, with the name incorporating the initials of Lightman. The building was fronted by an elegant, brightly lit marquee to attract the public. The theater was renovated in 1946. With its orchestra and balcony sections holding more than 1,000 seats, it was considered a showplace of the South, boasting the finest projection and sound equipment. Between 1929 and 1964, entrances were segregated‚Äîthe ‚ÄúColored‚Äù entrance was on the Broadway side of the building, while the ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù entrance was on Central Avenue. The Broadway entrance allowed African Americans to enter the building and go directly to their segregated seating area in the balcony. With advances in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, segregation of entrances and seating arrangements ended. The Arkansas Historic Preservation Program has stated that the Broadway entrance to the theater may be one of only two such formerly segregated entrances still in existence in the United States. Contemporary news reports stated that the management of the building mandated its preservation as a reminder of America's civil rights victories. During the Cold War era, the building's heavy steel beams and fourteen-inch concrete walls led to the Malco being declared a bomb shelter. The Malco was remodeled in 1962 and continued to be the leading Hot Springs cinema through the 1980s, although the rise of multi-screen theaters around the country led to the Malco's single auditorium being divided into twin theaters. The Malco continued showing movies through 1995, when it was renovated and came under new management. Magician Maxwell Blade and his Theater of Magic were housed there, joined in 1996 by the HSDFI, which hosts the oldest all-documentary film festival in North America. The HSDFI became the sole proprietor of the Malco in 2008 after Blade moved to another Hot Springs venue. In 2013, the Malco was purchased by a private owner, Rick Williams, who maintained the Malco's relationship with the HSDFI. In 2016, Hot Springs‚Äô Sentinel-Record reported that Blade was ‚Äúgoing home‚Äù to the Malco Theatre. Blade invested in restoring and renovating the aging theater, ahosting its grand re-opening on December 8, 2017. After its renovation, existing vintage tile in the building was restored. The theater boasts design elements such as ceiling tiles, decorative features, and lighting accents that suggest the Art Deco style of the 1920s when Sidney Nutt bought the Princess Theatre and converted it to showing ‚Äútalking pictures.‚Äù However, Maxwell Blade's magic show has also incorporated twenty-first century components such as digital audio and video projection, including three-dimensional backgrounds. Blade has stated that the interior was restored to the way it looked in the 1940s. It has been returned to having one large auditorium rather than being split into two twin theaters. The Malco can currently hold 320 people in its plush seats, as well as another seventy-five in the balcony.

Moloney, ‚ÄúRecent Johannine Studies: Part One: Commentaries,‚Äù Expository Times 123 (2012) 313-22 Lincoln himself reflected on the commentary in a journal issue that featured it - \\"From Writing to Reception: Reflections on Commentating on the Gospel of John\\" in Journal for the Study of the New Testament.Journal for the Study of the New Testament 29 (2007) 353-372.

Later, an invitation to participate in a symposium on The Divine Courtroom in Comparative Perspective at the Centre for Jewish Law and Contemporary Civilization, Yeshiva University, New York provided Lincoln with the opportunity to update and reflect further on some of the Truth on Trial material, and resulted in the publication of \\"A Life of Jesus as Testimony: The Divine Courtroom in the Gospel of John\\" in The Divine Courtroom in Comparative Perspective.The Divine Courtroom in Comparative Perspective, eds. A. Mermelstein and S. E. Holtz (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2014) 145-66.

Scott D. Mackie (London: Bloomsbury, 2018) 171-183. The Birth of Jesus He has also turned his attention to the birth of Jesus. He wrote an essay ‚Äú‚ÄòBorn of the Virgin Mary‚Äô: Creedal Affirmation and Critical Reading‚Äù for the volume Christology and Scripture: Interdisciplinary Perspectives.Christology and Scripture: Interdisciplinary Perspectives eds. A. Lincoln and A. Paddison (London: T. & T. Clark International, 2007) 84-103.

The Conception of Jesus in Matthew 1.18-25,‚Äù in Journal for the Study of the New TestamentJournal for the Study of the New Testament 34 (2012) 211-31 and ‚ÄúLuke and Jesus‚Äô Conception: A Case of Double Paternity?‚Äù in Journal of Biblical Literature.Journal of Biblical Literature 132 (2013) 639-58 These culminated in a full-scale treatment of the topic in the monograph Born of a Virgin? Reconceiving Jesus in the Bible, Tradition and TheologyBorn of a Virgin? Reconceiving Jesus in the Bible, Tradition and Theology (London: SPCK/ Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2013). that explored historical, hermeneutical, creedal and Christological issues. One review states that the author‚Äôs ‚Äúexecution of his task is superlative‚Äù and holds the book to be ‚Äúa solidly catholic treatment and a fine example of the application of biblical scholarship and theological hermeneutics to a part of tradition too often sentimentalized or passed over with averted eyes.‚ÄùThe Catholic Biblical Quarterly 77 (2015) 374-75. Lincoln also wrote \\"How Babies Were Made in Jesus'Time\\" for Biblical Archaeology Review 40.6 (2014)42-49. Spirituality Yet another interest for Lincoln has been the contemporary phenomenon of spirituality and how that might relate to ways of reading the Bible. He led a Bible Society funded project on the Bible and Spirituality at the University of Gloucestershire and wrote an initial essay on ‚ÄúSpirituality in a Secular Age: From Charles Taylor to Study of the Bible and Spirituality\\" in Acta Theologica.Acta Theologica Supplementum 15 (2011) 61-80 He co-edited the volume, The Bible and Spirituality: Exploratory Essays in Reading Scripture Spiritually,The Bible and Spirituality: Exploratory Essays in Reading Scripture Spiritually eds.

J. Byron and J.N. Lohr (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2015) 145-57. =Some Other Professional and Ecclesial Activities= Among other activities, Lincoln served as General Editor of the monograph series, New Testament Guides, published by Sheffield Academic Press and then T & T Clark International, and was a member of the Editorial Board for the journal Biblical Interpretation.

After World War II, she and her husband moved to Minsk and worked on the restoration of the city. She was involved in many projects ranging from schools and government buildings to parks and reservoirs. In 1989, her name was inscribed in the Book of Honor of the Minsk Project Institute. Biography Usava was born on 6 September 1921 in Irkutsk, Russia. When she was nine, her family moved to Moscow where she attended high school and then entered the Moscow Institute of Architecture. In 1941, the school was changed into a processing facility for the war. Students were required to package and prepare demolition bombs for use against German tanks. Simultaneously, Usava enrolled in nursing courses to be able to assist with helping the war wounded. In October 1942, a decision was made to evacuate the students to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Students were allowed only what they could carry, no excesses, and traveled in freight cars, while the instructors were in the passenger section of the transport trains. It took over a month for the students to reach the Tashkent Institute, where they slept underneath the desks at which they studied during the day. Four days a week they were required to study architecture and the other three days a week they worked in a munitions factory. At the end of the year, Usava was selected to make a study trip to measure monuments in Bukhara and later another trip to Samarkand, on which she met her future husband Vasily Gerashchenko. After the Battle of Stalingrad, when it was clear that victory would defeat Nazi Germany, the students began returning home. Usava returned in the spring of 1944, married and she and her husband moved into the dormitory at the Institute. She graduated with honors in 1947 with a degree in architecture and soon moved to Minsk, Belarus, where her husband was working. Within two days of arrival, Usava became employed in the workshop Yuri Yegorov, which later became the Minsk Project Institute and set about with other architects to restore the city of Minsk. Her first project was the secondary school number 42 on what is now Komsomolskaya Street. That was soon followed by restoration of the Belarusian Society of Deaf-mutes and the building on Dolgobrodskaya Street for the State Archive. She most often worked with Alexander Voinov () and together, they worked on such projects as the Minsk Youth Theatre, the Palace of Pioneers and the building of the regional committee of the PBC (now Minsk Commonwealth of Independent States Executive Secretariat building). She also worked with L. Ryminskim to restore the buildings of the Belarusian Polytechnic Institute. Both alone and in collaborative projects Usava built many houses, schools and kindergartens. She participated in the creation of Victory Park at the National Opera and Ballet of Belarus and she designed the reconstruction of Maksim Gorky Central Children's Park. In the 1970s, as part of a citywide effort to solve the flooding issues of the city, she worked on the and the both on the Svislach River, the largest reservoir in Belarus known as the , and the water/green space plan for the outskirts of Minsk. In 1989, Usava was inducted into the Minsk Project Institute's Book of Honor and she retired in 1990 after 43 years of service.

Strathnaver was launched on 5 February 1931, completed in September 1931, and left Tilbury on her maiden voyage on 2 October 1931, with Strathaird following a few months later. Strathmore was launched on 4 April 1935, completed in September, and entered service in October, to remain afloat for more than thirty years. With a weight of 23,428 tons and a maximum speed of twenty knots, Strathmore was the biggest and fastest vessel ever built for P & O. Two further sister ships launched in 1937, Strathallan and Stratheden, were slightly heavier, at 23,722 tons each, but also slightly shorter.

Somerset Maugham.Tom Keating, Frank Norman, The Fake's Progress (Hutchinson, 1977), p. 34 In August 1939, Strathmore set off on a three-week cruise to the eastern Mediterranean, but shortly after she had passed Gibraltar there came an Admiralty signal ordering non-essential British ships to get out of the Mediterranean. The cruise was diverted to Rabat and from there it was intended to proceed to Bermuda, but after only one day at sea there came a signal that war was imminent, and the ship returned to Tilbury, with a blackout being imposed after dark.Will Iredale, The Kamikaze Hunters: Fighting for the Pacific, 1945 (2015), p. 36 On 31 March 1940, towards the end of the \\"Phoney War\\", the vessel was requisitioned on the orders of the Ministry of Shipping, which later became the Ministry of War Transport, and during the rest of the Second World War she served as a troop ship, with no major incidents in that role. On 21 July 1941 Strathmore sailed from Newfoundland carrying 3,800 Canadian soldiers to Britain.Jean E. Portugal, We Were There: The Army (Royal Canadian Military Institute Heritage Society, 1998), p. 605 In February 1947 she sailed from Southampton bound for Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, carrying some 2,000 people going to China, including missionaries, colonial police, business men, and their families, many returning home after being displaced by the war.Adolphe Clarence Scott, Actors are Madmen: Notebook of a Theatregoer in China, pp. 22‚Äì24 On 15 May 1948 Strathmore was returned to P&O; and in 1948‚Äì49 was refitted at Vickers-Armstrong. In October 1949 she again entered service between London and Australia, now with berths for 497 first class passengers and 487 in tourist class.Miller (2014), p. 39 During this period Felicity Kendal travelled to India on the ship, as a small child.

Passengers Boo As Ship Leaves Them Here' in The Sydney Morning Herald dated 2 May 1952 In 1954 the ship was again refitted, this time as a single-class ship with 1200 berths, for P&O;'s migrant and tourist business. In the late 1950s and early 1960s she was sometimes used for short holiday cruises out of London, in between sailings to Australia. In October 1956, while in the Thames estuary, she hit a Norwegian merchant ship, Baalbeck, with some minor damage.Strathmore at thestrathallan.com, accessed 22 October 2015  With Latsis Lines  In 1963, the ship was sold to John Spyridon Latsis, a Greek shipowner and owner of Latsis Lines, and arrived at Piraeus in November 1963, to be renamed the Marianna Latsi, in honour of one of the new owner's daughters. In 1964 Latsis also bought her sister ship, Stratheden, which became the Henrietta Latsi. Both were used between March and May of each year for pilgrim voyages from West and North Africa to Jeddah, but otherwise remained at anchor, sometimes remaining in port to be used as hotel ships. In 1966 their new names were swapped over, so that the former Strathmore became the Henrietta Latsi and the former Stratheden took over the name of Marianna Latsi. In 1967 both ships were laid up at Eleusis in Greece, then in May 1969 they were scrapped almost side by side at La Spezia, Italy.William H.

It commemorates 251 men from Lewes who died in the First World War, and 126 who died in the Second World War. It was unveiled in 1922 and became a listed building in 1985. The memorial was designed by the artist Vernon March. He also designed the Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa, the Cenotaph in Cape Town, and Diamond War Memorial in Northern Ireland. It was constructed in the centre of Lewes, on a site formerly occupied by an ornate lamppost. It comprises a Portland stone obelisk with bronze statuary. The obelisk stands on a cruciform stone plinth, with steps between the pairs of piers leading up to bronze shields. It is topped by a bronze statue of a winged Victory standing on a globe, facing east towards the fields of Flanders, holding up a laurel wreath. The base features two bronze statues: Liberty seated to the west holding a torch, and Peace seated to the east with a dove on her shoulder. To one side of the figure of Peace is a bronze shield facing south east, inscribed \\"IN MEMORY OF / THE MEN OF LEWES / WHO DIED / FOR THEIR COUNTRY / AND FOR MANKIND / IN THE GREAT WAR / 1914 1918\\". The three shields between the other piers of the memorial bear 251 names of the fallen from the First World War. The memorial was unveiled in 1922 by General Sir Henry Sclater, a local landowner who was also General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Command in 1916 to 1919. It was dedicated by the Bishop of Lewes, Henry Southwell. A quotation from Winston Churchill ‚Äì \\"THIS WAS THEIR FINEST HOUR\\" ‚Äì was carved into the north face of the obelisk in 1950. The monument was rededicated in 1981, after plaques listing the names of 127 fallen from the Second World War were added to the north and south faces of the plinth, with an additional inscription added to the south face of the obelisk: \\"LIKEWISE / REMEMBER / THOSE OF / THIS TOWN / WHO GAVE / THEIR LIVES / IN THE WAR / 1939‚Äì1945\\".

It was built between 1904 and 1906 by Bradshaw, Gass and Hope, the Bolton architectural practice responsible for many of Manchester's iconic buildings such as the Royal Exchange. The first stock exchange in Manchester opened in 1836, and its function was to raise capital through joint stock issues for manufacturers, mineral extractors and railway companies. It cost ¬£86,000 to build. The building A three-storey rectangular Edwardian Baroque building on an island site, the Manchester Stock Exchange was built by Bradshaw, Gass and Hope in Portland stone. The ground floor features the same channelled rock face rustication that one finds at Stockport Central Library. There is a strong cornice and two further floors, with the central five bays having oriel windows surmounted by colonnaded windows. The end two bays are open pedimented with coupled columns, and the square headed doors feature carved shields in their pediments. Pevsner describes the interior as having \\"a magnificent hall with a dome supported at the corners by pilasters clad in sensuous green and cream marble.\\" History The first stock exchange opened in Manchester as a branch of the London Stock Exchange; its purpose was to allow local businesses to raise money for investment locally. Cotton and cotton goods were traded at the Royal Exchange. It fuelled the joint stock company boom that built the Lancashire cotton mills after 1860s Cotton Famine. It was continually short of space, in 1907 Bradshaw, Gass and Hope were commissioned to build a new exchange that reflected the confidence of the community. This was not a propitious moment as the chaos of the Great War was followed by the depression of the 1920s. = Closure = The exchange continued to trade until the year 2000, when it and the Liverpool Stock Exchange were closed as the finance industry retrenched in London. The building resorted to acting as a restaurant until that too changed and the then owners put it up for sale for around ¬£1.5 million. The building was bought by Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, two former Manchester United football stars, in 2013. They have planning permission to turn it into a 35-room boutique hotel with basement gym and spa, also featuring a rooftop private members‚Äô terrace and a ground-floor restaurant and bar. Manchester became the focus of anti-austerity protests in October 2015, when the governing Conservative Party held their annual conference at a venue in the city centre. A direct-action group occupied the building site with the aim of providing accommodation and advice to the homeless and rough sleepers. Messrs Neville and Giggs did not apply for an eviction order, and lent the organisers their moral support and allowed them to stay in the uncompleted building over the winter.

He and Sam fight aggressively resulting in Junior killing Sam. The crystals are soon put in place and the transmitter is ready for use. Dawn activates the crystals but the egg is required and is not available. After taking her captive, Dawn tells Norrie that she can act as the egg since she's one of the four hands who first saw the \\"Pink Stars\\". Joe takes Norrie's place to protect her just as Dawn expected. After Joe triggers the transmitter the Dome comes down. Moments after the Dome disappears, after briefly appreciating their freedom, Julia and Big Jim attempt to kill Dawn but Junior attacks Jim before he can shoot her. During the fight Jim stabs Junior in the side while being strangled and is then forced to stab him again after Junior refuses to give up. Junior then dies in Big Jim's arms.

Barbie survives the fall, but after reuniting with Julia, all the inhabitants of Chester's Mill are taken away by the Army for testing. Everyone not under the Kinship's influence is required to sign a statement that Hektor and Aktaion were responsible for the Dome and the actions inside it, despite Barbie, Julia, Norrie, Hunter, Lily and Big Jim all telling the officials the true story.

We never found out what the dome was for. We don't know where these aliens came from or why they needed to live on Earth. We don't know why Chester's Mill was chosen, and we don't know if there were more aliens coming.

The picture was shot on the studio's back lot along with outdoor locations at Iverson Ranch, 1 Iverson Lane, Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA, USA.The Old Corral B-Westerns Plot In the 1890s town of Blue Springs, Jed Quinlan (Don Costello), the schoolteacher, breaks up a fight between tomboy Boots Hollister (Sylvia Arslan) and Little Beaver (Robert Blake), the Indian ward of Red Ryder's. Each child has taunted the other with names like ‚Äúwildcat‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndian.‚Äù Quinlan ‚Äúdisciplines‚Äù both children and later when the children return to the schoolhouse accompanied by Boots‚Äô older brother Billy (John James) and Little Beaver's Red Ryder‚Äôs (Wild Bill Elliott) aunt, The Duchess (Alice Fleming). Elsewhere, Quinlan meets with Con Hollister's (Francis McDonald) former cohort, Joe Slade (Bud Geary), who reveals that Con was released weeks earlier. Quinlan, who poses as a teacher to cover his criminal activity, reckons that Con should arrive on the next day's stage, and that the upcoming shipment must be Con's old loot, which was never recovered. Con Hollister, released from prison and now reformed, plans to return the $150,000 loot taken in a stagecoach holdup five years previous. Quinlan and his henchman, Slade, entice the hot-tempered Billy into robbing the stage. However, Red prevents the theft and is pleasantly surprised to discover that Con, who is a passenger on the stage, has reformed will return the money to the bank. Boots is overjoyed to see her father when he arrives in Blue Springs, however, her brother is less so, particularly after Con declares that the Hollister family is going to make a clean start. So, when Con and Boots go to town to seek a loan to rebuild their ranch, Billy runs off to join Slade. No one in Blue Springs will provide Con a loan much less give him a second chance, even though Red does his best to vouch for him. Bitter at seeing his father treated so shabbily, Billy agrees to help Quinlan rob the bank. Red manages to break up the robbery but the gang gets away but not before Con Hollister recognizes his son as one of the bandits. Red shoots Slade and wounds Quinlan who escapes to Con's barn where he hides out, unbeknownst to the others. Con finds his horse and the saddlebags containing the stolen money but when Red arrives and sees the money, he suspect Con. Hollister manages to get away by locking Red in a closet before taking off to pursue his son, Billy, whom he saw robbing the bank. Little Beaver arrives at the ranch and frees Red who rides in pursuit of Con Hollister. Boots who was left behind, discovers the wounded Quinlan hiding the barn and when she realizes that he is one of the robbers, she is killed in cold blood with Quinlan using one of Red's pistols as the murder weapon. Afterwards, the bogus-teacher attempts to frame Red Ryder by claiming that he's the killer. Red figures out that Quinlan is the escaped robber and proves his guilt by comparing his wound to a bullet hole in the saddle bags, which he had been carrying over his shoulder. Red captures Quinlan, who is sentenced to hang following Billy's court testimony. Afterwards, Billy is paroled to his father's custody, and later both bid a grateful farewell to Red Ryder and Little Beaver.Great Stagecoach Robbery (1945) (Overview), Turner Classic MoviesDrew, Bernard A.; Red Ryder and Little Beaver: Painted Valley Troubleshooters.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Peter probably died in 1254. He was certainly dead by 1259. His obituary, written by his friend and fellow Dominican Giles of Portugal was contained in the Vitas fratrum (Lives of the Brothers) compiled by Gerald de Frachet in 1258 or 1259. The obituary indicates that Giles was present when Peter died in Zamora: > When a brother, Peter Ferrandi, who from childhood was brought up in the > order of the most holy and learned man [Dominic], and who wrote a life of > the blessed Dominic our father, [and was] a teacher in many areas [and many > fields in Spain], finally fell ill at Zamora, this devoted brother saw Him > standing on a most high mountain, his face resplendent as the sun, and at > his right hand and at his left the two young men standing resplendent also. > When, however, the next day he told me that he had seen this vision, I > understood that the brother Peter in the near future would die.Simon > Tugwell, \\"Petrus Hispanas: Comments on Some Proposed Identifications\\", > Vivarium 37, 2 (1999): 103‚Äì13: Cum frater Petrus Ferrandi, qui a puero in > ordine sanctissime nutritus et doctus fuerat, qui et uitam beati Dominici > patris nostri descripsit, doctor in multis locis [Hyspanie multis amis], > tandem apud Zamoram infirmaretur, quidam deuotus frater uidit ipsum supra > montem altissimum stantem et faciem eius resplendentem ut sol, et a dextris > et a sinistris duos iuuenes stantes splendidos nimis. Cum autem sequenti die > frater michi uisionem hanc dixisset quam uiderat, intellexi fratrem Petrum > in proximo moriturum.. The text \\"in Spain\\" was added later by Humbert of Romans to clarify that Peter did not teach outside Spain. Writing towards 1304, Bernard Gui clarified further that Peter Ferrandi was from Galicia (Hyspanus natione de Galexia). The Regensburg Lectionary further indicates that Peter's Legenda and his liturgy were later approved by the Dominican general chapter before 1300. Peter's Legenda seems to have superseded the Libellus, a short biography of Dominic by Jordan of Saxony, around 1235 before being itself substantially revised by Constantine of Orvieto in the late 1240s.Anita Fiderer Moskowitz, Nicola Pisano's Arca Di San Domenico and Its Legacy (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), 50. In the early fifteenth century Friar Luis de Valladolid identified the author of the Legenda with the logician Peter of Spain, an identification which has been accepted by some modern scholars.Lambertus Marie de Rijk, \\"On the Life of Peter of Spain, the Author of the Tractatus, called afterwards Summule logicales\\", Vivarium 8, 2 (1970): 123‚Äì54.Angel d'Ors, \\"Petrus Hispanus O.P., Auctor Summularum (III): \\"Petrus Alfonsi\\" or \\"Petrus Ferrandi\\"?\\" Vivarium 41, 2 (2003): 249‚Äì303.

It is approximately long and flows through Ross Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The surficial geology in its vicinity consists of Wisconsinan Till, alluvium, alluvial fan, and bedrock. There are a series of wetlands at the stream's headwaters. These wetlands are listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. The drainage basin of the stream is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Wolf Run begins in a valley near the edge of a plateau in Ross Township. It flows south-southwest for several hundred feet before turning south-southeast and flowing down a slope. After a few tenths of a mile, the stream turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching the base of the slope. It then reaches its confluence with Bowman Creek. Wolf Run joins Bowman Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Wolf Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is just over above sea level. The surficial geology near the mouth of Wolf Run consists of alluvium and alluvial fan, which both contain stratified sand, silt, and gravel, as well as some boulders. Further upstream, the surficial geology consists of a till known as Wisconsinan Till. At the headwaters, the surficial geology features bedrock containing sandstone and shale. Watershed The watershed of Wolf Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Sweet Valley. Its mouth is located at Mountain Springs. There are several hydrologically connected wetlands at the headwaters of Wolf Run. History and recreation Wolf Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1191676. Wolf Run was historically used as a water supply for the Lehigh Valley Railroad. At least part of Wolf Run is in Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 57 and a hiking trail is located relatively close by. Biology The drainage basin of Wolf Run is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The wetlands at the headwaters of Wolf Run are listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. The center of the wetlands is relatively open and they are bordered by shrubs. Major plant species at the site include cinnamon fern, highbush blueberry, cotton grass, soft rush, woolgrass, groundberry, huckleberry, cranberry, and swamp candles. Other major species include the sedgees Carex stricta, Carex rustrata, and Carex folliculata, mosses, and red spruce. Two animal species of concern have been observed at the site.

Lanham, Scarecrow Press, p286 was a Nigerian medical doctor and politician who was the first and only Mayor of Lagos. He represented Lagos in the Legislative Council. Life Olorun-Nimbe was born in Lagos to the family of Abdur-Raham and Ramotu Olorunimbe. His father was a member of Herbert Macaulay's Nigerian National Democratic Party and a Lagos- based community group known as the Egbe Ilu. Olorun-Nimbe started his education learning Quranic verses, he then proceeded to study at a government primary school in Lagos. Thereafter, he attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos before transferring to King's College, Lagos. In 1930, he gained admission into Glasgow University to study medicine. He finished his medical studies in 1938 as a qualified medical practitioner and surgeon. He returned to Nigeria in September 1938 and joined the colonial service as a Junior Medical Officer. His appointment was terminated by the colonial service in 1940 and he went into full-time private practice in Lagos establishing Alafia Hospital. =Political career= Olorun-Nimbe's foray into politics started in 1944 when he was elected a councillor in the Lagos Town Council and he was a participant in NCNC's Pan-Nigerian tour. He also contested a December 1945 by-election for the Legislative Council, and was elected with 68% of the vote,Tekena N Tamuno (1966) Nigeria and Elective Representation 1923‚àí1947, Heinemann, p127 and was re-elected in the 1947 general elections. During the same year, he was also a member of NCNC's delegation to London to protest the Richards Constitution which operated on the practice of nomination rather than election to the regional and central assembly. In 1950, the Lagos Local Government Ordinance, N.17 provided for the election of 24 councillors to the Lagos Town Council and for the position of a mayor of Lagos to be selected from those councillors. Olorun-Nimbe was selected the first mayor of Lagos in 1950 and head of Lagos Township council, he was assisted by Mbonu Ojike.Falola, T., & Salm, S. J. (2003). Nigerian cities. Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press. P. 256 He was in the position until 1953. His position as mayor caused a rift between him and the Oba of Lagos, Adeniji Adele. On 31 June 1951, under the Macpherson Constitution, Lagos colony was merged with Western Region for administrative purposes. The law allowed five representatives to represent Lagos in the regional assembly at Ibadan and also two presentatives to be chosen by the regional assembly among the elected representatives of Lagos to represent the colony in the Federal House of Representatives. Olorun-Nimbe's party NCNC won all five Lagos seats and the party decided to send Adeleke Adedoyin and Azikiwe to the central legislature from the Western Assembly. In the Western Assembly, the Action Group which had control of the assembly voted for Adedoyin and Olorun-nimbe as Lagos representatives to the Federal House of Representatives scuttling Azikiwe's plan to move to the center. However, contrary to NCNC's position that Olorun-Nimbe remain in Lagos as Mayor, he decided to combine both roles as mayor and Federal House of Representative refusing to step down for Azikiwe, this left the party leader out of playing any role in the center. Olorun-Nimbe was later expelled from the party.

He was the co-founder and President of the Foundation for Somalia, based in Poland. Farah had announced his intention to run for President of Somalia in the upcoming presidential election, scheduled for 2016. Farah was killed in a terrorist attack in Mogadishu on September 21, 2015, while preparing for his presidential campaign. Education Farah graduated from the Omdurman University, now called Omdurman Islamic University, in Sudan. He spoke fluent Arabic, English, Polish, Somali and Swahili. Career Farah immigrated from Somalia to Poland in the 1990s, becoming the first African immigrant to receive refugee status in Poland since the collapse of the Communist government in 1989. Though he knew virtually no one in Poland, Farah chose the country because it was the polar opposite of Somalia, which was engulfed in the chaos of the Somali Civil War during the 1990s. He initially found his new country to be isolating and distant. There were instances when elderly Polish women, who associated dark skin with the devil, fled when they saw him. Farah sought to learn the Polish language and reach out to the larger community through social activism. He co-founded the Foundation for Somalia (Fundacja dla Somalii), headquartered in Poland, with Jolanta Opali≈Ñska in 2007. Farah became the President of the Foundation on October 2010. The Foundation's initial goal was to fundraise for the renovation of a hospital in Adado, located in the Galguduud region of central Somalia, as well as to provide funding for a children's home in Godenlabe. However, Farah expanded to the Foundation's mission to include programs and services not just for Somalis and other African immigrants, but for all migrant communities in Poland, regardless of country of origin. His organization offers computer classes, Polish language training and other professional courses to help integrate immigrants into Polish society, as well as improve relations with ethnic Poles. Under Farah, the Foundation for Somalia also undertook humanitarian projects in Somalia and Poland. Farah also taught as a lecturer at the Institute for Social Studies, a college in Yemen. He obtained Polish citizenship in 2014. In May 2015, Farah announced his intention to run for President of Somalia in the forthcoming Somali presidential election in 2016. He returned to Somalia to prepare for his presidential campaign. If elected, he would have been Somalia's first President to hold dual Polish citizenship. According to TVP Info, a Polish news channel, Farah's candidacy enjoyed as much as 70% approval among Somali voters, making him a credible presidential candidate in the election, which is scheduled for 2016. Death Abdulcadir Gabeire Farah was killed in a car bomb attack on the grounds of the Somalian Presidential Palace on September 21, 2015. Farah had been in Mogadishu to preparation for his presidential bid. The bombing, which was blamed on the Al-Shabaab terrorist group, killed at least eleven people, including Farah and a second Polish citizen, and injured at least 22 other victims. A delegation from the United Nations, which may have been the intended targets of the attack, escaped unharmed.

Researchers have also debated whether a diagnostic gender bias has played a role in females being underdiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Researchers have also speculated a gender bias in parental reporting due to the expectations and socialization of gender roles in society. Since autism is a largely genetic and hereditary condition, genetic factors that can affect sex disparity with medical conditions come into play and include imprinting and X-linked mutations, which would have the ability to raise the frequency and severity in males and confer the hypothesised genetic \\"protective effect\\" in females, as they do in other conditions. The extreme male brain theory suggests that autistic brains show an exaggeration of the features associated with male brains, such as increased size and decreased relative connectivity as well as systematic thinking over empathetic thinking. Pdf. : Extracted in: :: The imprinted brain theory suggests genomic imprinting is at least partly responsible for the sex differences in autism and points to the evidence for a common genetic cause with schizophrenia. There is evidence of increased incidence of social anxiety, anorexia nervosaBaron-Cohen, S., Jaffa, T., Davies, S., Auyeung, B., Allison, C., & Wheelwright, S. (2013). Do girls with anorexia nervosa have elevated autistic traits? Molecular Autism, 4(1), 24. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-4-24Rhind, C., Bonfioli, E., Hibbs, R., Goddard, E., Macdonald, P., Gowers, S., ‚Ä¶ Treasure, J. (2014).

Molecular Autism, 5(1), 56. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-5-56 and self-harm in autistic females, though the increased rates of anorexia nervosa may be due to confusion or conflation with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is particularly common in autism. Extreme male brain theory Simon Baron-Cohen's extreme male brain theory states that autistic males have higher doses of pre-natal testosterone and on average have a more systemising brain, as opposed to the more empathising female brain. He suggests that autistic brains show an exaggeration of the features associated with male brains. These are mainly size and connectivity, with males generally having a larger brain, which is seen in an exaggerated form in those with ASD. Individuals with ASD were found to have widespread abnormalities in interconnectivity in specific brain regions. This could explain the different results on empathy tests between men and women as well as the deficiencies in empathy seen in ASD, as empathy requires several brain regions to be activated which need information from many different areas of the brain. Pdf. : Extracted in: :: Baron-Cohen therefore argues that genetic factors play a role in autism prevalence and that children with technically minded parents are more likely to be diagnosed with autism.  Imprinted brain theory  The imprinted brain theory suggests genomic imprinting is at least partly responsible for the sex differences in autism and implicates schizophrenia as well, referencing the fact that the current genetic and physiological evidence suggests the two conditions are on a spectrum in which some mutations in certain genes cause lower social cognition but higher practical cognition (autism) while other mutations in the same genes cause lower practical cognition with higher social cognition (schizophrenia). Female protective effect hypothesis According to the female protective effect hypothesis, more extreme genetic mutations are required for a girl to develop autism than for a boy. In 2012, Harvard researchers published findings suggesting that, on average, more genetic and environmental risk factors are required for girls to develop autism, compared to boys. The researchers analyzed DNA samples of nearly 800 families affected by autism and nearly 16,000 individuals with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. They looked for various types of gene mutations. Overall, they found that females diagnosed with autism or another neurodevelopmental disorder had a greater number of harmful mutations throughout the genome than did males with the same disorders.Jacquemont, S., Coe, B., Hersch, M., Duyzend, M., Krumm, N., Bergmann, S., Beckmann, J., Rosenfeld, J., Eichler, E. (2014) A Higher Mutational Burden in Females Supports a ‚ÄúFemale Protective Model‚Äù in Neurodevelopmental Disorders. The American Society of Human Genetics, http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(14)00059-7  Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis  The prevalence ratio is often cited as about 4 males for every 1 female diagnosed. Other research indicates that it closer to 3:1 or 2:1. Some authors, clinicians and experts like Judith Gould, Tony Attwood, Lorna Wing and Christopher Gillberg have proposed that autism in females may be underdiagnosed due to better natural superficial social mimicry skills in females, partially different set of symptoms and less knowledge about autism in females among experts. In his preword to the book Asperger's and Girls, Tony Attwood writes: \\"These tentative explanations for the apparent underrepresentation of girls with Asperger's Syndrome have yet to be examined by objective research studies.\\" Specifically Judith Gould has discussed the idea that a pervasive developmental disorder called pathological demand avoidance, which is not officially included in diagnostic manuals may offer a glimpse about how autism in females may present in some cases. Differences in gender and sexuality identification Sexuality is often discussed within the autistic community, with many observations that identities other than cis- hetero seem to be more common than is observed in the neurotypical population. There have not been many formal studies on this to date, however members of the community speculate that autistic individuals generally have different ideals, perceptions and desires than neurotypicals or simply do not comprehend or agree with society's expectation, making them more apt to diverge from the norm. =Gender identity= A study looking at the co-occurrence of ASD in patients with gender dysphoria found 7.8% of patients to be on the autism spectrum.De Vries, A. L. C., Noens, I. L. J., Cohen-Kettenis, P. T., van Berckelaer-Onnes, I. A., & Doreleijers, T. A. (2010). Autism Spectrum Disorders in Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 930‚Äì936. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-010-0935-9 This is much higher than the estimated 1% of people with ASD in the general population, suggesting a link between autism and gender variance. As of yet, there have been no studies specifically addressing the occurrence of autism in intersex individuals. = Sexual satisfaction = A study conducted by Byers and Nichols (2014), explored the level of sexual satisfaction of high-functioning autistic individuals, with researchers testing the sexual and relationship satisfaction of neurotypical versus high functioning autistic individuals. The results suggest that men with ASD are generally less satisfied with their relationship or marriage compared to neurotypical men and women, and women with ASD.  History  Hans Asperger was one of the first people to study autism, yet all of his four students were male. Another early researcher, Leo Kanner described \\"autistic disturbances of affective contact\\" in the group consisting of eight boys and three girls.Kanner, L. (1943).

Founded in 1968, Radio F√≥rmula programs are broadcast on more than 100 stations in Mexico as well as several stations in the United States. It is the flagship product of Grupo F√≥rmula, which also owns the TeleF√≥rmula cable news network and PM Onstreet, an outdoor advertising firm. History Grupo Formula traces its beginnings to 1968, when several Mexico City stations were split from Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta‚Äôs Radi√≥polis system. Among these was XEDF-AM 970. By 1984, Radio F√≥rmula operated five Mexico City stations: 970 AM, 1470 AM, 1500 AM, 103.3 FM and 104.1 FM. On September 19, 1985, Radio F√≥rmula's headquarters in downtown Mexico City were destroyed by an 8.1 earthquake, which killed several hosts and employees and knocked the AM stations off the air for nearly a month (the FM stations' transmitters are based at the Torre Latinoamericana). The network later relocated to the Polanco neighborhood in the west part of the city. Journalist Pedro Ferriz de Con, who hosted a morning newscast on XEDF-AM, barely managed to survive and spent over a year hospitalized, whereas Sergio Rod and Gustavo Calder√≥n, morning hosts of XEAI-AM, perished. In 1987, Radio Formula was relaunched under the management of Rogerio Azc√°rraga Madero, nephew of Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta. This led to the establishment of a program schedule that offered a wide range of programs in news, sports, finances, entertainment and women‚Äôs talk.

He has recorded with Smokey Robinson, Cher, Larry Carlton, Steve Lukather, Spinal Tap, George Benson, The Manhattan Transfer, Eros Ramazzotti, and The Rippingtons. He has performed with Freddie Hubbard, Boz Scaggs, Oleta Adams, Brenda Russell, Natalie Cole, and Michael Bolton. He is a founding member of Karizma and Los Lobotomys. He has been a songwriter, producer, bandleader, arranger, recording artist, record label owner (Creatchy Records), session and touring musician, musical director and composer of commissioned themes for global organizations.  Biography  In addition to composing and performing music for Perfect Harmony, he has written several songs with Smokey Robinson, including \\"One Like You,\\" which George Benson recorded on his 2009 album Songs & Stories. Garfield, who has been from time to time Benson's musical director since 1986, also arranged and produced Guitar Man. Garfield produced I Play The Piano, a DVD/Blu-Ray of Terry Trotter playing solo piano for AIX Media. Garfield has been commissioned to write and produce theme songs and musical projects for several international organizations, including the composition and CD: \\"Pool of Friendship\\" for the European Aquatics Federation LEN (League of European Nations); the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC); and \\"Deep Within Each Man\\" (co-written with Phil Perry) for the Shorinji Kempo World Karate Foundation. His first international release on Creatchy, 1997's Tribute To Jeff, was dedicated to drummer Jeff Porcaro. Garfield followed its Top Ten chart success with I Am The Cat‚Ä¶ Man, and Giving Back]. He re-released on Creatchy several collections from earlier in his career, including L.A. Keyboard Project, Recollections, and Seasons of Change. Karizma's discography on Creatchy includes Dream Come True, Cuba, All The Way Live, (Forever in the) Arms of Love, Document, and Lost and Found. The other projects he has helmed for Creatchy include albums by guitarists Michael Landau and Michael O'Neill, saxophonists Brandon Fields and Larry Klimas and, most recently, former Toto bassist Mike Porcaro. Another Creatchy release, Los Lobotomys, is a collaboration with prominent members of the pop/rock band Toto, with whom Garfield has collaborated with many times throughout the years. Garfield also frequently does free-lance keyboard and production work for established and up and coming artists from across the U.S. and throughout the world. In addition to his work with George Benson, Garfield continues ongoing musical relationships with numerous musicians, including Boz Scaggs and Natalie Cole. Over the years, he has recorded with Cher, Spinal Tap, The Rippingtons, Ratt, Larry Carlton, and Smokey Robinson; produced for Oleta Adams and Flora Purim; and has performed live with Michael Bolton, The Blues Brothers, Brenda Russell and Rick Braun, among others. Early in 2012, he was presented with the Hall of Fame Award from the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta; Garfield has performed at the Indonesia event several times, most recently with saxophonist Gerald Albright and vocalist Alex Ligertwood. The same trio of musicians later performed at the Blue Note in Tokyo. At the same time as he was performing his first gigs with Karizma in the mid-1970s, Garfield began working with jazz talents such as Willie Bobo, Freddie Hubbard, and Tom Scott. After establishing himself on the L.A. jazz scene, the keyboardist became a key part of the city's vast studio world during its heyday. These experiences ultimately led to composing opportunities for TV, film and commercials for such companies as NBC, Disney, Nippon Television, and RTL Germany. During the 1980s, Garfield arranged and produced many Japanese artists and went on to produce his own projects for release in Japan. Reflecting on his diverse career, Garfield says, \\"It's creatively invigorating to have the opportunity to do so many interesting musical projects, to see so many amazing places throughout the world, and to work with some of the greatest musicians both in L.A. and overseas. I feel as though I am always learning from the artists and musicians I work with, not simply on a musical level, but also benefiting from their wealth of stories and life and career experiences. There are always unexpected thrills along the way, from opening with his band for Sergio Mendes or Jason Mraz to recording in a studio next to Paul McCartney or Alice in Chains and having the opportunity to meet and get to know them. I love being involved in so many different aspects of music and the feeling that I truly never know what's coming up next\\".

The film stars Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, Austin Stowell, and Tim Blake Nelson. In the film, Gloria, an unemployed writer, unwittingly manifests a giant monster in Seoul, while struggling with alcoholism, and an abusively controlling colleague. The film is an international co-production between producers in Canada, Spain, the United States and South Korea. Anne Hathaway signed onto the project in May 2015, which was described as \\"Godzilla meets Lost in Translation\\". Prior to the start of filming, Toho brought a lawsuit against Voltage Pictures, the film's producers, for unauthorized usage of Godzilla's image. However, a settlement was reached in October. Principal photography began on October 18, 2015 and primarily took place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, finishing on November 25, 2015. Colossal held its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2016 and was followed by several festival screenings. It was theatrically released in the United States on April 7, 2017 by Neon, in South Korea on April 20 by Dreamfact Entertainment, in Canada on April 21 by Mongrel Media, and in Spain on June 30 by Versus Entertainment; it aired a day earlier, on June 29, on Movistar Estrenos as an exclusive preview. The film received positive reviews, with praise for the acting, direction, screenplay, and themes. Hathaway was singled out by many critics for particular acclaim. The film grossed $4.5 million worldwide against a production budget of $15 million. Plot Gloria is an unemployed writer struggling with alcoholism. Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in Mainhead, New England, Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria and offers her a job at the bar, which Gloria accepts. Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. After each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control it. Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends by playfully dancing in the playground while they watch a news feed of the monster mimicking her movements. When a helicopter launches a missile at the monster, Gloria petulantly lashes out and destroys the helicopter, killing its pilot. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, she panics and collapses. When she awakens, she discovers that Oscar also manifests in Seoul, as a giant robot. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol. After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands Gloria have a beer, threatening to return to the playground if she refuses. The next morning, a sobered-up Oscar apologizes to Gloria, which she accepts. Tim shows up in town on a pretense to see Gloria, but while he misses her, he can't help but be irritated and dismissive to her life situation. Upon meeting Tim at the bar, Oscar provokes a confrontation by setting off a large firework inside the bar. He boasts that, no matter how he behaves, he knows that Gloria will never go with Tim. Oscar later shows up at Gloria's house, telling her he is there to prevent her from going back with Tim. This triggers a childhood flashback, revealing how Gloria and Oscar are able to manifest their avatars in South Korea: Gloria's school project, a paper diorama of Seoul, is blown over a playground. Oscar retrieves it but, because of jealousy over it being better than his, stomps on it instead. Gloria's anger triggers a lightning flash that strikes them both, as well as his toy robot and her toy reptilian monster. Back in the present, Gloria recognizes that his manipulative behavior, combined with the destroyed photos and other clues around Oscar's house, is sourced from Oscar's self-hatred, and resolves to leave town with Tim. Gloria and Oscar race for the playground but Gloria arrives first, and attempts to fight him again. Oscar incapacitates Gloria and destroys a large portion of Seoul, killing many people. He tells her that she's free to leave if she wishes, but every morning she remains absent, he'll take a walk through the playground. Upon returning to her house, Gloria comes up with a plan to stop Oscar. She flies to South Korea, apologizing to Tim for not coming with him but insisting she owes him no explanations. At 8:05 am, U.S. time, Oscar causes the giant robot to manifest in Seoul. As she heads towards Oscar's avatar, Gloria causes her monster to appear at the playground back home. Gloria's monster flings Oscar into the distance, killing him and causing the giant robot to be launched into the horizon and disappearing. Gloria retreats to a bar and asks the bartender if she would like to hear an incredible story. After being offered a drink, Gloria lets out a long sigh. Cast * Anne Hathaway as Gloria ** Hannah Cheramy as young Gloria * Jason Sudeikis as Oscar, Gloria's childhood friend ** Nathan Ellison as young Oscar * Dan Stevens as Tim, Gloria's ex-boyfriend * Austin Stowell as Joel * Tim Blake Nelson as Garth * Rukiya Bernard as Marie * Agam Darshi as Ash Production Hathaway was the first actress to sign on at a time when the project had no financial backing. Hathaway heard about the script after finding herself \\"in a little bit of an artistic no man's land\\" for inspiration. Director Jonathan Demme screened for her a copy of A Field in England, after which Hathaway decided that it represented exactly the type of movie she wanted to make. After asking her representation to see a similar script that she could join, she was sent the Colossal script. Hathaway found herself attracted to the genre-hopping nature of the script, later comparing it to Being John Malkovich, one of her favorite films. Prior to the start of filming, Japanese company Toho brought a lawsuit against Voltage Pictures for unauthorized usage of Godzilla's image and stills from previous Godzilla films in emails and press documents sent to potential investors. A settlement was reached that October. Principal photography on the film also began in Vancouver on October 18, 2015, and ended on November 25, 2015. No motion captured footage was used for the creation of the monster; rather, footage of Hathaway acting out her parts was given to the CG team, who used this as reference points. The CG artists, as opposed to Vigalondo, were responsible for the look of the monster itself. Vigalondo stated that this was partly due to his lack of artistic skill and partly due to him \\"[wanting] them to feel like characters that felt like a part of the genre we're playing with\\". Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016. Shortly after, an unnamed Chinese company acquired distribution rights to the film, which was later announced as Neon, a newly-founded distribution company.

Originally built for approximately 110 young women, more than 140 first-year students to graduates now live in the building.Decoding the Martha Myth, Michigan Daily, April 11, 2001 Martha Cook has many unique traditions, including weekly teas on Fridays.About Campus: What's cooking, Martha?, Michigan Daily, March 10, 2009 These teas are open to residents and their guests, although all members of the public are invited to Martha Cook's International Tea which is held in early spring each year. Other traditions which residents enjoy include the Dinner for New Women, Handel's Messiah Dinner, and weekly themed buffet dinners. , Martha Cook Website, December 28, 2017 Martha Cook has its own Dining Hall, which is private to those who live in the building. While the pantry has been updated, the wooden tables and chairs, the fireplaces, and the intricate designs allow the dining area to keep its historic appeal. The building is a historic building, and thus while updates have been made over the years, the building still keeps its historic charms. Some of these features include its architectural beauty, the Gold, Red, and Sparking rooms which serve as everything from study spots to the backdrops of Martha Cook events, and the larger sized rooms which accommodate the non-modular furniture. The 100th anniversary of Martha Cook was celebrated over the weekend of October 23‚Äì25, 2015, with many past and present residents in attendance.Residents, alumni mark Martha Cook's 100th year, Michigan Daily, October 25, 2015 Martha Cook is the only University of Michigan dormitory with an alumni association. There is an alumni board, as well as a board of governors, who help in making key decisions about the maintenance and upgrading of the building, raising scholarship money to assist residents with room and board, and helping plan events such as Fall and Spring Tea, which allow alumni to return to Martha Cook for tea once a semester.

Description  The colour of Lucasium stenodactylum varies from reddish brown to brown. The length of most individuals is approximately . Body patterns also vary, although the species is typically found with a cream or white vertebral stripe. The stripe starts at each eye and joins at the back of the neck into a single vertebral stripe. In some individuals the vertebral stripe may be pale or absent. Large and small pale spots may be found on the limbs and sides of the body. Whitish under body. Tail is slender and comprises about 80 percent of snout-vent length. Homogeneous dorsal and flank scales.  Distribution and habitat  L. stenodactylum is distributed in four separate locations in New South Wales, Australia: Sturt National Park, Mutawintji National Park and Thurloo Downs. The habitat of L. stenodactylum is not well known. In NSW, the species has been reported to be found in red and sandy soil habitats, as well as savannah woodlands and shrubby stony areas.  Behaviour and ecology  The species is nocturnal and forages on insects.  Taxonomy  To date there are three well-defined lineages (families) of geckos, the gekkonine geckos, diplodactyline geckos and pygopod legless lizards. However, the taxonomy of geckos and their families have recently been frequently revised. The species we know today as crowned gecko, Lucasium stenodactylum was described under the name of Diplodactylus stenodactylus as early as 1896 by Boulenger in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Boulenger described the specimen as ‚Äúa new species... is allied to and appears to connect Diplodactylus Steindachneri, Blgr., and Cremodactylus damoeus, Lucas and Frost...‚Äù. Oliver et al. claimed that \\"Gekkos have a tendency to show high levels of cryptic diversity\\" and the diversity of the terrestrial genus Diplodactylus had been underestimated by a factor of two. The genus Lucasium Wermuth was originally described by Kluge in 1965. Until recently this genus, Lucasium Wermuth 1965, was mostly included in genus Diplodactylus Doughty and Hutchinson (2008). In 2006, Pepper, Doughty and Keogh generated the first molecular phylogeny for the Diplodactylus stenodactylus species group, that included D. alboguttatus, D. damaeus, D. maini, and D. squarrosus, D. stenodactylus, as well as numerous other groups. Analysis of the moleculary phylodeny results revealed \\"a deep and ancient phylogenetic split\\" within D. stenodactylus distinguishing populations in Pilbara regions from non-Pilbara populations. In 2007, Oliver, Hutchinson and Cooper, revived and revised the genus Lucasium to include D. byrnei, D. steindachneri and the stenodactylus groups.  Conservation status  In New South Wales L. stenodactylum is classified as a vulnerable species according to the New South Wales Threatened Species Act 1995. In Queensland, there is no listing of an EPBC status (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 EPBC Act); and the species has an NCA (Nature Conservation Act 1992) classification of ‚Äòleast concern‚Äô (2). L. stenodacytlum also has a conservation status of ‚Äòleast concern‚Äô within the Northern Territory. Threats to L. stenodacyltum include grazing from introduced animals and predation by foxes and cats. Also, the risk of extinction due to genetic effects and chance events (e.g. drought and fire) increases if populations become fragmented.

He is nephew to Chilean TV celebrity Roberto Nicolini, great grandson of Italian architect Arnaldo Barison, who designed many of the landmark buildings of Valpara√≠so such as Palacio Baburizza, and great great grandson of Italian painter Giuseppe Barison. His brother Pablo Gonz√°lez is an internationally recognised designer and one of the owners of Santiago Motion Graphics (SMOG). Early life and education Gregorio Gonz√°lez Nicolini was born in Venezuela to Chilean parents. He attended primary through the beginning of secondary school at Institutos Educacionales Asociados in Caracas. The family returned to Chile in 1989, settling in Santiago de Chile, where he finished high school at Colegio San Ignacio El Bosque. He studied Mathematical Engineering at the Department of Mathematical Engineering of the University of Chile. His engineering thesis advisors were Chilean National Science Award winners Eric Goles and Servet Mart√≠nez, and his thesis work led to the publication of a \\"short communications\\" article in Springer-Verlag journal Granular Matter. He is a self-taught filmmaker and later studied acting at the Academia Club de Teatro in Santiago, Chile. Career =Finance= Gregorio Gonz√°lez started his career in finance in 1999 as an analyst at financial boutique Vision Advisors, providing quantitative analysis for Chilean pension funds as part of their institutional fund distribution service. In 2003, Gregorio Gonz√°lez was Head of Research at Vision Advisors, where he started the project that led to the creation of the LVA Chilean fixed income indices, a joint venture between Vision Advisors and investment bank Larrain Vial to calculate and provide indexes for the Chilean local fixed income market. The launching of the indices in 2005 led to the launching of the company LVA Indices. He was appointed CEO upon its creation and later made partner for his contribution to the firm. Under his leadership, LVA Indices diversified its business beyond its initial offering of indexes, eventually including evaluated prices for local fixed income instruments, fact sheet generation for local mutual funds, risk measurement tools and others. He also negotiated a joint marketing agreement with Dow Jones Indexes and Proveedor Integral de Precios to create the LATixx indexes, launched in 2009 to cover local Latinamerican fixed income markets, which covered Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru and Chile. The LATixx alliance ended and the indices were discontinued shortly after McGraw Hill Financial acquired Dow Jones Indexes. =Film= In 2000, Gregorio Gonz√°lez began moonlighting as a writer for Roos Film, at the time the most important production company in Chile. His most relevant role during that time was as part of the writers team for documentary TV series Los Patiperros, which earned him a nomination to the 2002 Altazor Award. During this time he also directed two short films: Examen, made with a cast and crew consisting mostly of students and professors from his engineering school, and 2, starring professional actors Marcelo Alonso and Alessandra Guerzoni. \\"Examen\\" screened in the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival 2003 and \\"2\\" competed in the first edition of the Festival de Cine Pobre de Cuba.

He pioneered and mastered the use of leather as a sculptural material, using it to create musical instruments, theatrical costumes, wall hangings and free-standing works. His works are widely represented in public and private collections in Australia and internationally. Works Leather Sculpture by Garry Greenwood Greenwood is considered a pioneer in the use of leather as a sculptural medium. He used wet-formed cowhide as well as exotic leathers including kangaroo, buffalo, emu and ostrich. Stylistically his works were often whimsical and quirky, drawing on folk art and English medievalist fantasy, as well as organic and human forms. A long-running series of Greenwood's works were elaborate and ornate shoes, a number which are on display at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto. He collaborated with a number of theatre groups including TasDance, for which he designed sets, costumes, puppets and masks. Significant collections of his works are held at the National Gallery of Australia, the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery and the Grainger Museum. =Musical instruments= Greenwood is best known for creating musical instruments from leather. A talented folk musician himself (guitar, mandolin & banjo), his first experiment was a leather violin. He went on to create dozens of different instruments including stringed, woodwind and percussion instruments. While some of them are decorative variations of existing instrument forms such as harps, lyres, horns and ocarinas, some are entirely new inventions such as the Tasmanian Mountain Harp. He also collaborated with Joanne Cannon & Stuart Favilla to create hybrid acoustic/electronic instruments, the Leather LightHarp and the Contra- monster. His instruments have also been played by saxophonist Brian Brown, and Tasmanian group The Chordwainers.  Life  Greenwood studied Art and Design at Reigate School of Art in Surrey, England. He immigrated to Australia in 1962, establishing himself as a graphic designer. In 1972 he moved to Deloraine, Tasmania where he converted Bowerbank Mill into a craft gallery and studio. He later established his home and studio on Mount Barrow, near Launceston. Between 1985 and 1989 he was the head of the Leather Workshop at the Canberra School of Art. He had 26 solo exhibitions, in Australia and internationally. His contribution to the arts was recognised in the Australia Day honours of 2005, shortly before his death.

He was a frequent apostolic legate, making four separate trips to Spain in this capacity. In Spain he proclaimed a crusade to re-conquer the Balearics and held several synods to establish the Gregorian reforms. In Turin, he introduced the truce of God to curb private warfare. First mission to Spain Boso was probably from the Piedmont region of northern Italy, which was at the time part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Piedmontese church had connections with Spain. In 1112, the abbot of San Michele della Chiusa in the Piedmont travelled to Spain to summon its bishops to the council of Benevento being held the following year. He also tried to mediate between the warring married couple, Queen Urraca of Castile‚ÄìLe√≥n and King Alfonso of Aragon‚ÄìPamplona.Zelina Zafarana (1971), \\"Bosone\\" Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 13 (Rome: Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana). Boso is first recorded as a deacon at the court of Pope Paschal II in Benevento in early January 1113. Of his life before this we know nothing. Later that year, he went to Pisa as the papal legate responsible for overseeing the joint military expedition of the Pisans and the Catalans against the Almoravid-occupied island of Majorca. A first Pisan fleet sailed to Barcelona in 1113, but Boso went with a second fleet, which joined the earlier fleet that had wintered over in the spring of 1114. This was his first legatine visit to Spain. In Catalonia, he held a church council at Girona and proclaimed the crusade indulgence for those who would take part in the Majorcan campaign (June 1114‚ÄìApril 1115). His role in organizing the expedition is recounted in the Liber maiolichinus (\\"Book of Majorca\\"), a contemporary Pisan account. Return to Italy Boso probably returned to Italy via southern France. He probably convened another church council at the abbey of Saint-Gilles. This council is known only from a letter of Pope Paschal; its acts do not survive. Boso is first recorded as the cardinal-priest of Sant'Anastasia when he attended the non-ecumenical Lateran council of March 1116. The fact that no earlier document refers to him as a cardinal may be no more than an accident of documentary survival, since his legatine work in the preceding three years suggests a very high position in the church. Second mission to Spain Boso's second voyage to Spain as legate came in response to the election by the cathedral chapter of Barcelona of an unwilling abbot from Provence (west of Piedmont) to be their bishop. On 23 May 1116, Pope Paschal wrote to Olegarius, the abbot of Saint-Ruf, to inform him he was sending his legate Boso charged with inducing him to accept his election as bishop of Barcelona. According to the Vita sancti Ollegarii (\\"Life of Saint Olegarius\\"), a 14th- century biography of Olegarius based on a lost 12th-century work, Paschal sent Boso in response to a delegation sent by some Spanish bishops who wanted the pope to force Olegarius to accept his election and also to give the Spanish church support against the Almoravids. En route to Saint-Ruf, Boso joined Count Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona at Pisa. The count was then returning from a trip to Rome, where he had received papal protection in exchange for annual payment to the Holy See, also on 23 May. Raymond Berengar and Boso had surely met previously during the Majorcan expedition, since the count of Barcelona was the leader of the Catalans. From Pisa, the cardinal and the count travelled to Saint-Ruf, where Boso persuaded Olegarius to accept his election as bishop, and thence to Maguelonne, where Olegarius was consecrated. Boso and his charge next moved into the north of the Duchy of Aquitaine, where he assisted Bishop Eustorgius of Limoges in consecrating a church near Uzerche. In the undated record of this action, Boso asserts that he was \\"travelling through [these] Aquitanian parts because of the army gathering over Spain\\" (causa exercitus congregandi super Hispanias per Aquitaniae partes transiens). According to the Anonymous of Sahag√∫n, when Boso finally arrived in Spain he made a round of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, passing through the cities of Burgos, Palencia, Le√≥n, Santiago de Compostela and Braga, in that order. The anonymous chronicler also claims that a primary purpose of his journey was to mediate between Queen Urraca and King Alfonso, whose rocky marriage had finally been annulled in 1114. After his visit to Le√≥n, Boso appears to have left Spain briefly. On 4 November 1116, Boso attended the investiture of Arberto II, provost of Oulx, as archpriest of the church of Santa Maria in Susa in the Piedmont. Boso seems to have been responsible for persuading Meinhard, the bishop of Turin, to give Arberto the promotion. The chronology is unclear on the exact order of the consecration of the church at Uzerche, the tour of Le√≥n and the visit to Oulx. It is possible that Boso did not arrive in Spain until December 1116, making his second and third missions one single trip.Bernard F. Reilly, The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under Queen Urraca, 1109‚Äì1126 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1982), pp. 120‚Äì22. Third mission to Spain On 18 February 1117, Boso presided over a church council at Burgos, the capital of the Kingdom of Castile. The acts of this council were only discovered in 1906. Archbishop Bernard of Toledo, Bishop Hugh of Porto, Bishop Jerome of Salamanca and Bishop Olegarius attended. Queen Urraca did not, but it was convoked in her name and the name of her son, Alfonso VII, already reigning in Galicia. Only bishops from her realms and from Catalonia attended; no bishops of Aragon or Navarre were present. Archbishop Maurice of Braga did not attend, and Boso pronounced a sentence on him in his absence. The council was primarily concerned with carrying out reforms. Canon XIV prohibited consanguineous marriage, probably at the queen's insistence, in order to further nullify her own marriage to Alfonso of Aragon. It also condemned simony and priestly concubinage. In ecclesiastical matters, the absent archbishop of Braga lost the diocese of Coimbra, which was assigned to the province of M√©rida. The boundaries between the diocese of M√©rida, Coimbra, Braga and Porto were also clarified in an agreement signed at Burgos on 24 February. It was probably at this time that Boso wrote to Bishop Peter of Palencia to let him know that Count Pedro Ans√∫rez had donated to Palencia the church of Valladolid and all its possessions. From Castile, Boso moved into Catalonia, where he held his second council at Girona on 22‚Äì23 April 1117. Although the acts of this council do not survive, Boso's letter to Bishop Odo of Urgell announcing the council does. At the council he also passed judgement in a dispute between Olegarius and the abbot of Sant Cugat del Vall√®s, the record of which also survives. It is probable that it was while he was at this council that Boso signed the acts of the diocesan council of Girona held at Vilabertr√°n in November 1100. The ex post facto confirmation of local councils by ecclesiastical superiors was a distinctly Catalan tradition. Travels in France It is unknown when Boso left Spain, but he was at Orange in December 1118, where Pope Gelasius II was staying, having been exiled from Rome since November. He probably remained with Gelasius until the latter's death at the abbey of Cluny on 29 January 1119. He did not summon the Spanish bishops to the council of Clermont, scheduled for March 1119, which one would have expected from his recent work as legate there. Instead, Cardinal Deusdedit of San Lorenzo in Damaso gave the summons. According to Orderic Vitalis, Boso was present at Cluny for the papal election of 2 February 1119 that chose Calixtus II as Gelasius' successor. (Orderic is not completely reliable, however, since he confuses Boso with the bishop of Porto.) Boso spent the first year of Calixtus' pontificate traversing France with the papal entourage. On 18 June 1119, he was with Calixtus at the abbey of Saint-Gilles. In July, he attended the council of Toulouse presided over by the pope. On 24 September, Boso and the papal party were at Tours. The pope held another council at Reims in October, whereat, Orderic records, Boso took part in a vigorous debate. Boso was still with Calixtus at Gap on 11 March 1120, but he was sent on his fourth and final mission to Spain shortly thereafter. Bishop Hugh of Porto, who was also at the papal court, accompanied him as far as the Pyrenees. Boso had entered Spain before the year was out. Fourth mission to Spain The main source for Boso's final legation in Spain is the Historia compostellana, which even incorporates several pieces of correspondence between Boso and Diego Gelm√≠rez, the archbishop of Santiago de Compostela and hero of the Historia. Boso was accompanied in Spain by Bishop Guy of Lescar, and together they visited the shrine of Saint James, a major pilgrimage site, in Santiago de Compostela. Boso and Guy then went to √Åvila, where they attended the consecration of the first bishop of the restored diocese, Sancho (1121). After that, Boso visited the court of Queen Urraca and her son for high-level political discussions‚Äî\\"on the state of the holy church and the Spanish kingdom\\" (de statu Sanctae Ecclesiae et Hispaniae regni), in the words of the Historia. At court he announced a council of the Spanish church to be held at Sahag√∫n in August 1121. The Historia also quotes a letter in which Boso informs Diego of an upcoming council being held at Toulouse on the Sexagesima Sunday next (in dominica sexagesimae), but nothing further is known of this council, if it took place at all. The council of Sahag√∫n ended on 25 August and its acts, drawn up on that date, survive. Mainly they condemn simony and promote clerical celibacy. More dramatically, at Sahag√∫n Boso pronounced an interdict on Spain to take effect from feast of Saint Martin (11 November 1121). Although Boso does not explain himself, recent events in Galicia clearly precipitated his action. Urraca's Galician henchman, Fernando Y√°√±ez, had arrested Diego Gelm√≠rez and, on the queen's orders, several castles belonging to the archdiocese had been seized. Although the incident was quickly patched up and Diego freed, Pope Calixtus was unaware of this when he wrote to Boso on 7 October urging him to take all measures to procure Diego's release, even up to convoking another council. The pope also expressed the wishes of the entire College of Cardinals that Boso should return to Rome. Indeed, Boso seems to have set out for Italy soon after receiving this letter. Bishop of Turin It was probably during his return trip from his last diplomatic mission to Spain that Boso intervened with Bishop Gerald II of Angoul√™me on behalf of the abbey of La Sauve-Majeure. A later papal confirmation of La Sauve-Majeure's privileges is the only record of Boso's detour north in 1122. There is no record of Boso ever arriving in Rome, nor any later reference to his presence at the papal court. After 1123, the priesthood of Sant'Anastasia belonged to Teobaldo Boccapeccus. Although this sudden absence was once frequently attributed to his death, in fact Boso had merely resigned his cardinalate, as required by canon law, to assume the office of bishop of Turin. The date of his election as bishop is unknown, but he is first recorded in office on 13 December 1122. The author of the Historia compostellana was apparently aware of Boso's resignation and election, for he records that Diego had a precious cross made specifically as a gift for Boso as bishop of Turin, in gratitude for the work Boso had done on his behalf during the crisis of 1121. Less is known of Boso's years at Turin than of his legations in Spain, since his episcopate is not covered by any narrative sources. At the castle of Testona on 18 April 1122 or 1123, he made a gift to the abbey of Santa Maria in Pinerolo. He also patronised the abbey of Novalesa in 1122 or 1123, although the only copy of the charter of his gift is mistakenly dated to 1120. In another document dated to 1120 (but, again, pertaining to either 1122 or 1123), Pope Calixtus confirmed a donation made by a certain Countess Adelaide (or Adalasia) to Boso's church. Boso held a local church council to proclaim the truce of God (treuga Dei) throughout the diocese. The \\"truce\\" was a prohibition on making war on certain days of the week. Intended to reduce violence, the \\"truce\\" movement began in France in the eleventh century and soon spread to the Empire. The act proclaiming the truce was stored in the Biblioteca nazionale di Torino until it was lost in a fire in 1904. An edition published in 1749, which contains no date, is the only surviving reference to Boso's diocesan council. Boso signed the record of a placitum held by Olrico da Corte, the archbishop of Milan and Boso's ecclesiastical superior, in December 1125. This is the last recorded action of Boso. He died on 30 April according to the necrology of the church of San Solutore in Turin. The year of death is unknown, but it must have been no later than 1128, when his successor, Arberto, former provost of Oulx, is recorded as bishop. This Arberto, whom Boso had helped as early as 1116, was clearly a prot√©g√© of the bishop, for one of Boso's acts as bishop was to confirm the possessions of Arberto's church.Achille Motta (1933), Vezzolano: Memorie storico-religiose, artistiche, illustrate (Milan: Tipografia delle Missioni), pp. 38, 92 and 128.

He is remembered for his epic poem Gazavatnam Mihaloƒülu which narrates the 15th-century Balkan conquests of the Ottomans, and the battles and glory of the military commander Ali Bey Mihaloƒülu, being one of the most-known poetic works of the 15th century in overall. The Suzi √áelebi Mosque What is known from his early life, beside his birthplace in Prizren, today's Kosovo, is that he was born between 1455-1465. His real name was Muhammad-Effendi, son of Mahmud, son of Abdullah. Suzi was a pseudonym, meaning \\"blazing\\".Suzi Mosque - Database of Cultural Heritage of Kosovo Other names that he is referred with are S√ªz√Æ-i R√ªm√Æ, S√ªz√Æ-i P√ºrzerr√Æn√Æ, Mevl√¢n√¢ S√ªz√Æ, Sozi √áelebi/Efendi/Baba.≈ûahamettin Kuzucular, Suzi √áelebi ve Gazavatnamesi (in Turkish) He founded a waqf in Prizren. He also lived a part of his life in Belgrade. The alternative name Naqshbandi Suzi indicates that he belonged to the Naqshbandi order of Sufism. Suzi √áelebi served as katib of the Ottoman military leader and exploiter Gazi Ali Mihaloƒülu, being testimony of many campaigns and battles. On his return to Prizren he drafted Gazavatnam Mihaloƒülu, an epic poem of around 15,000 verses out of which 2,000 survived and are conserved in the Library of Berlin and in the \\"Oriental Collection\\" of the (former) Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb together with his vakufnama (deed of perpetual endowment), a 50x30 document of 16th century. Although his poem was intended to be an epic military chronicle, the poet infused it with florid language in order to make it as attractive as a lyric one. Suzi √áelebi died in Prizren and was buried in the small Suzi √áelebi Mosque in Prizren's center, on the left side of Bistrica river. It was built in 1513 and is the oldest in town. The grave is surrounded by a small wall and the year of death is signed on it.

Founded by Bimla Arora, who opened her first preschool in 1989, and managed by her family, the group expanded to primary and secondary education in 2009. The Limca Book of Records recognized the group in 2013 for starting the most schools in the shortest time: 100 branches in 17 Indian states by 2010 with 225 preschools and 75 primary and secondary schools.  History  The school group began as a chain of preschools. Bimla Arora sought a preschool for her daughter and opened her own in 1989. She became the founding director of the Shemrock preschool group. Her son, Amol Arora, did the marketing for the school and later became vice-chairman of the chain, and his wife, Meenal, became the preschools' executive director. Shemrock expanded to urban areas with the belief that franchise preschools were in higher demand there. Their classes have 12 students and are designed to be interactive, with individual attention for each child. Amol Arora distinguished the chain's preschools from others by classroom environment, curriculum, and approach to schooling. In one school, new students acclimate to the school in a \\"welcome home\\", with toys including a doll house, television with nursery rhymes, and shaped blocks. The kids progress to an Activity Area with a wooden stage, writing area, sandpit, and technology such as a smartphone and ATM counter. Shemrock teaches the alphabet through objects and tie letters to modern technology, such as ATMs and Blackberry devices. Shemrock preschools use the Chota Bheem cartoon character as their \\"brand ambassador\\" with expectations that the character would engage and motivate children to learn. Their in-house marketing team led a campaign to use the character in class activities, and released their first television commercial with the character in 2013. Shemrock celebrated one school opening in 2013 with a carnival. The Aroras expanded into primary and secondary education in 2009 with Shemford Futuristic Schools. Meenal Arora was their founding director. The first Shemford school was opened in Ashok Vihar and later led to offshoots in Bagh, Noida, Punjab, Rohini, and Patna. By 2012, there were 22 Shemford secondary schools in India, and plans to open 15 more across Tamil Nadu over three years. The secondary schools are either associated with the Central Board of Secondary Education or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. The school follows a proprietary curriculum known as ShemEduMAX that is designed as a \\"child created curriculum\\" with \\"personalized assessment\\". At the school's 2011 opening, Arora said over 160 Indian schools used the curriculum. The Shemrock and Shemford group was recognized by the Limca Book of Records in 2013 for starting the most schools in the shortest time. By 2014, the group had opened 100 branches in 17 Indian states, with 225 preschools across India and over 75 Shemford schools. In 2012, the Shemrock and Shemford schools employed about 3,000 in staff for 20,000 students, and planned to expand to 900 teachers within five years.

By combining these \\"omes\\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association.Tarazona, S., Balzano-Nogueira, L., & Conesa, A. (2018). Multiomics Data Integration in Time Series Experiments. doi:10.1016/bs.coac.2018.06.005 The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic datanalysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.  Single-cell multiomics  A branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures. Methods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single- cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist. A different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA- barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibiodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.  Multiomics and machine learning  In parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).  Multiomics in health and disease  Overview of phases 1 and 2 of the human microbiome project. Multiomics currently holds a promise to fill gaps in the understanding of human health and disease, and many researchers are working on ways to generate and analyze disease-related data. The applications range from understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious diseases to understanding better chronic and complex non- communicable diseases and improving personalized medicine. = Integrated Human Microbiome Project = The second phase of the $170 million Human Microbiome Project was focused on integrating patient data to different omic datasets, considering host genetics, clinical information and microbiome composition The phase one focused on characterization of communities in different body sites. Phase 2 focused in the integration of multiomic data from host & microbiome to human diseases. Specifically, the project used multiomics to improve the understanding of the interplay of gut and nasal microbiomes with type 2 diabetes, gut microbiomes and inflammatory bowel disease and vaginal microbiomes and pre-term birth. = Systems Immunology = The complexity of interactions in the human immune system has prompted the generation of a wealth of immunology-related multi-scale omic data. Multi-omic data analysis has been employed to gather novel insights about the immune response to infectious diseases, such as pediatric chikungunya, as well as noncommunicable autoimmune diseases. Integrative omics has also been employed strongly to understand effectiveness and side effects of vaccines, a field called systems vaccinology. For example, multiomics was essential to uncover the association of changes in plasma metabolites and immune system transcriptome on response to vaccination against herpes zoster.  List of softwares for multi-omic analysis  The Bioconductor project curates a variety of R packages aimed at integrating omic data: *omicade4, for multiple co-inertia analysis of multi omic datasets *MultiAssayExperiment, offering a bioconductor interface for overlapping samples *IMAS, a package focused on using multi omic data for evaluating alternative splicing *bioCancer, a package for visualization of multiomic cancer data *mixOmics, a suite of multivariate methods for data integration *MultiDataSet, a package for encapsulating multiple data sets The OmicTools database further highlights R packages and other tools for multi omic data analysis: * PaintOmics, a web resource for visualization of multi-omics datasets * SIGMA, a Java program focused on integrated analysis of cancer datasets * iOmicsPASS, a tool in C++ for multiomic-based phenotype prediction * Grimon, an R graphical interface for visualization of multiomic data * Omics Pipe, a framework in Python for reproducibly automating multiomic data analysis  Multiomic Databases  A major limitation of classical omic studies is the isolation of only one level of biological complexity. For example, transcriptomic studies may provide information at the transcript level, but many different entities contribute to the biological state of the sample (genomic variants, post-translational modifications, metabolic products, interacting organisms, among others). With the advent of high-throughput biology, it is becoming increasingly affordable to make multiple measurements, allowing transdomain (e.g. RNA and protein levels) correlations and inferences. These correlations aid the construction or more complete biological networks, filling gaps in our knowledge. Integration of data, however, is not an easy task. To facilitate the process, groups have curated database and pipelines to systematically explore multiomic data: *Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database (MOPED), integrating diverse animal models, * The Pancreatic Expression Database, integrating data related to pancreatic tissue, * LinkedOmics, connecting data from TCGA cancer datasets, * OASIS, a web-based resource for general cancer studies, * BCIP, a platform for breast cancer studies, * C/VDdb, connecting data from several cardiovascular disease studies, * ZikaVR, a multiomic resource for Zika virus data * Ecomics, a normalized multi-omic database for Escherichia coli data, * GourdBase, integrating data from studies with gourd, * MODEM, a database for multilevel maize data, * SoyKB, a database for multilevel soybean data, *ProteomicsDB, a multi-omics and multi-organism resource for life science research  See also  * Pangenomics * Hologenomics *DisGeNET *Systems Biology *Network Medicine  References  Category:Biology theories ","title":"Multiomics"},{"id":"48284563","text":"The Harbin-Qiqihar Through Train (Chinese:ÂìàÂ∞îÊª®Âà∞ÈΩêÈΩêÂìàÂ∞îÂä®ËΩ¶ÁªÑÂàóËΩ¶) is Chinese railway running between the capital Harbin to Qiqihar express passenger trains by the Harbin Railway Bureau, Harbin passenger segment responsible for passenger transport task, Harbin originating on the Qiqihar train.

Fort Church was a World War II United States Army coastal defense fort in Little Compton, Rhode Island. Together with Fort Greene near Point Judith, it superseded all previous heavy gun defenses in the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. History Fort Church was built as part of a general modernization of US coast defenses that began in 1940 with the outbreak of war in Europe and the Fall of France. The fort was named for Colonel Benjamin Church (1639-1718), considered a forerunner of the United States Army Rangers and buried in Little Compton.FortWiki article on Fort Church The goal was to replace all previous heavy weapons, many of which were over 35 years old, with long-range 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 guns. Lighter weapons would be replaced by 6-inch guns on high-angle shielded barbette carriages. Ammunition magazines and the 16-inch guns would be in casemated bunkers to protect against air attack. Fort Church also had a rare casemated 8-inch gun battery.Berhow, p. 204 The fort was intended to protect the approaches to Narragansett Bay and its easternmost arm, called the Sakonnet River, as part of the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. It was mirrored by Fort Greene near Point Judith. Three reservations were acquired for Fort Church 1939-1942, which was initially named the Sakonnet Point Military Reservation. The North Reservation was at the Sakonnet Golf Club, the East Reservation was near Briggs Marsh and South Main Road, and the South Reservation was near Sakonnet Point itself. Battery Gray, or Battery Construction Number (BCN) 107, was on the North Reservation and had two 16-inch guns. Battery Reilly was on the East Reservation with two casemated 8-inch guns. BCN 212 with two 6-inch guns was on the South Reservation, along with two \\"Panama mounts\\" (circular concrete platforms) for towed 155 mm guns.Berhow, p. 204 Battery Gray was named for Major Quinn Gray.

It involved a group of volunteers improvising a post-apocalyptic lifestyle. It was time-limited to 18 months, and was originally intended to serve as both a learning community (where everyone had a skill of knowledge they could teach the others) and a working community (where everyone would contribute by working). After 10 months, Evans had become disillusioned with the project and concerned about his mental health. He went to see a doctor who referred him to a psychiatrist. Evans was then detained under the Mental Health Act for his own safety. After 4 weeks in a psychiatric hospital, he returned to the experiment to inform the volunteers that it was over. They, however, wanted the community to continue and renamed it the Phoenix Experiment, under which name it continued for several years.

In 1992, two months after an attempted coup d'√©tat by Hugo Chavez, she became president of the Central Bank of Venezuela. Her appointment seemed a natural choice, given both her extensive experience and her firm belief in Central Bank independence. She resigned in 1994, amid the Venezuelan banking crisis.

In 1964 she obtained the title of economist at the Universidad Central de Venezuela as the first woman to graduate summa cum laude and was a member of the board of directors of the Toronto Leadership Centre. She has been a longstanding President of the Venezuelan-based financial advisory firm, Sintensis Financiera, since 1982.

In the years since their breakup, their work has come to the attention of garage rock fans and collectors and has appeared on several retrospective compilations including the Nuggets 4-CD box set. They are best-remembered for their 1966 song, \\"I Think I'm Down.\\" History The band began in 1963 in Fremont, California in the East Bay area, not far from San Francisco. \\\\- NOTE: Though the AllMusic bio. and certain other sources have the band's name printed with the definite article \\"The...\\" placed in front of the band's name, that does not square with the wording on the label for the Brent single, \\"I Think I'm Down,\\" nor in flyers and press clippings (see Youtube videos for their reproduced photographs), which have the band's name presented without \\"The...\\". In 1966 it would have been the norm for the definite article to be placed in front of a band's name in most publications, unless a band and its management stipulated otherwise. So, this Wikipedia article must present their namesake according to the likelihood of how it actually was. The liner notes to Nuggets written by Mike Stax do not place a definite article in front of their name, and apparently they checked into the matter while researching the project. They were founded by Bob Hoyle III and Ron Rotarius, who had begun playing guitar together several years earlier when they were in the eighth grade.\\\\- \\"Optical Sound: The Technicolor Tales Behind the Various Nuggets\\" (track-by- track liner notes). Rhino Records R2 75466 The two continued to collaborate in high school, where, as sophomores, they recruited friends to put together a band called the Norsemen. In 1965, Hoyle was called, as a Naval reservist, to active duty in Vietnam. By the time he returned in 1966, the band, now called Harbinger Complex, had already been performing under the leadership of Rotarius. Upon re-entering, Hoyle became the band's the band‚Äôs lead guitarist, while Rotarius went to rhythm guitar. During Hoyle's stint in Vietnam, the band had brought in Jim Hockstaff, known for his \\"Dionysian exploits,\\" to become the group's lead singer and front man. The other members were Gary Clark (bass), Jim Redding (drums), and Chuck Tedford (organ). Tedford left the band shortly thereafter, and would not appear on any of the group's recordings. The band, who had developed a large following in Fremont, went to Golden State Records' studio to cut their first single released on the Amber label, ‚ÄúTime to Kill‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúWhen You Know You‚Äôre In Love‚Äù in April 1966. These two songs, as with all of their subsequent recorded material, were written by Hockstaff and Hoyle (credited as \\"Hockstaff and Hoyle III\\"). Right around the time of their first single's release, they opened for Paul Revere & the Raiders, along with the Baytovens. In August 1966, the Harbinger Complex came out with their second single, ‚ÄúI Think I‚Äôm Down‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúMy Dear and Kind Sir,\\" which was released on the Brent label, and like the first was recorded at Golden State studios. In late 1966 the band issued their third single, \\"Sometimes I Wonder\\" b/w \\"Tomorrow's Soul Sound,\\" which was released on Amber Records, a partner-label to Brent. Jim Hockstaff left the band in early 1967, and Gary Clark took over on lead vocals thereafter. Later that year, stereo and mono mixes of three of their previously released songs appeared on a various artists' compilation entitled, With Love: A Pot of Flowers, released by Mainstream Records, the parent label of Brent. By the end of 1967 the band had broken up. Bob Hoyle III died on May 6, 2003.

In 2015 press coverage revealed that it will be demolished due to 'Mr Fluffy' asbestos contamination. History Deasland was commissioned by Ginninderra storekeeper, George Harcourt, between 1890 and 1893 and built by contractors Lazarus and Holland.G. Barrow, Canberra‚Äôs Historic Houses: Dwellings and Ruins of the 19th Century, Hackett, 1998, pp. 12-13. It was a six-room, single-story timber homestead with verandahs and iron roof. There is also a heritage-listed brick dairy. George Harcourt was born in 1842 at Edgbaston, England. He seems to have named the property after ‚ÄòDeasland Farm‚Äô in Worcestershire, where his parents were married in 1819.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòVale Deasland‚Äô, Canberra History News, no. 456 (September 2015), pp. 12-13. But he only enjoyed his new home for a short time, as he died in December 1893. Harcourt had started out as William Davis‚Äô bookkeeper around 1860 and went on to serve as Ginninderra storekeeper and postmaster. The Harcourts also farmed in the district and were prominent in civic affairs.S. Shumack, Tales and Legends of Canberra Pioneers, (ed. by J.E. and S. Shumack), Canberra, 1967, pp. 37, 106-107, 154; L.R. Smith, Memories of Hall, Canberra, 1975, pp. 4-5; L.L. Gillespie, Canberra, 1820-1913, Canberra, 1991, pp. 111, 115, 131. After George's death, Millicent Harcourt (n√©e Ward) and her children, remained in Deasland and grew wheat and sheep on its 685 acres until the land was resumed in 1913 for the new Australian Federal Capital Territory. Deasland, along with many other buildings in Ginninderra, were almost destroyed by bushfire in 1905. Two short-term tenants - Edward Boreham followed by Joseph Burgoyne - occupied Deasland after the Harcourts. Burgoyne had been prominent in the Ginninderra Farmers' Union. In 1916 John and Edith Edmonds took over the lease and farmed the area. The Edmonds family moved to Burrowa in 1926. In January 1927, the Curran family purchased the Deasland lease. Henry Curran, known as ‚ÄòBabe‚Äô, was the local blacksmith's son, who had married Amy Reid of Tallagandra in 1921. They had been living in the Ginninderra convict barracks with their two infant daughters, before they could afford to purchase the Deasland lease. Curran's father's blacksmith shop, which is also heritage-listed, has survived, next door to Deasland. The Currans owned Deasland for 44 years and built up its pasturage to 1,178 acres. Curran became one of Australia's premier woolgrowers, setting a range of world, Commonwealth and NSW record prices for a flock, primarily pastured at Ginninderra in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s.C. Newman, Gold Creek: Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage, Canberra, 2004, pp. 63, 76; J. McDonald, ‚ÄòWhen Ginninderra Grew the Golden Fleece‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, no. 75 (September 2015), pp. 15-23. Curran was also an accomplished sportsman and benefactor of the local community. The Currans improved Deasland's pasture, renovated the homestead itself, and constructed a large woolshed, hayshed, shearers‚Äô quarters and a farmhand's cottage. They sunk a bore, built dams and even laid an ant-bed-clay tennis court. Babe Curran died unexpectedly in 1964. His son, Richard, wound up the estate, with the family finally departing in late 1971.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòWhen Ginninderra Grew the Golden Fleece‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, no. 75 (September 2015), p. 22. The property was no longer operated as a high-yield sheep station. During the 1990s, the homestead and other parts of the former dairy were listed on the former Register of the National Estate. Current status After a few short- term tenants came the MacKinnon family, the current owners, who have lived at Deasland since 1975.The Canberra Times, 25 June 2015, p. 1. During the latter years, many of the outbuildings, including the large shearing shed, were demolished. The property shrank to a few acres around the homestead and dairy, as Canberra's suburbs and golf links encroached. Deasland has been listed for demolition, as it is contaminated by loose fill asbestos insulation, probably introduced around 1973. Deasland Place in the Canberra suburb of Fraser was named after the homestead on 13 April 1976.

Playing career He was educated at Wesley College, Colombo, and played in turn for Moors Sports Club, Colts Cricket Club and Colombo Cricket Club. An off-spinner who sometimes opened the batting, he made his first-class debut in the Gopalan Trophy in 1956-57, taking two wickets and two catches and making 15 runs in a low-scoring victory for Ceylon. In the 1960-61 Gopalan Trophy match he top- scored in Ceylon's first innings with 68 batting at number 10, then took 3 for 44 and 2 for 75 in a 169-run victory for Ceylon. He toured India with Ceylon in 1964-65 and played in all three matches against India but had little success with the ball, taking only two wickets. In the third match, however, when Ceylon needed 112 to win and the regular opener was injured, Fuard opened the batting on a difficult pitch and top-scored with 40 and Ceylon won by four wickets. Against the International XI in 1967-68 he took 6 for 31 in the first innings, but Derek Underwood responded with 15 wickets in the match for 43 runs and the International XI won easily. In single-innings matches against touring sides Fuard took the wickets of many prominent Test batsmen: Bill Lawry and Bob Simpson when the Australians visited in April 1961, Tom Graveney, Peter Parfitt, Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus against MCC in October 1962, Norman O'Neill and Bob Cowper against the Australians in April 1964, Parfitt again, Mike Smith, John Murray and Jim Parks against MCC in October 1966, John Edrich against MCC in January 1969, and Doug Walters against the Australians in October that year. His last first-class wicket, in February 1970, was of Geoff Boycott. Administrative career He served as a cricket administrator, manager, curator, coach and national selector. He was manager and coach for Sri Lanka in the 1975 World Cup and assistant manager when Sri Lanka recorded their first win over a Test-playing nation during the 1979 World Cup. He also managed the team that won Sri Lanka's first Test victory, over India in September 1985, as well as the touring team to England in 1988.Wisden 1989, p. 314. A forceful man, he was one of the principal administrators behind the successful push for Sri Lanka's admission to Test status. However, he could be difficult, and he made enemies as well as admirers. He was behind the appointment of two of the selectors for Ceylon's first-ever tour of England in 1968. The government was already reluctant to come up with the money to support the two-month tour, and when Fuard's two selectors chose themselves and Fuard in the touring team and omitted some prominent players, the resultant uproar among the cricket fraternity led the government to cancel the tour. In his last years he suffered from kidney failure and eventually blindness.

The first part was translated by the writer Harry Mathews, a friend of Perec, and read by him as a voiceover in the English version, released as Ellis Island Revisited: Tales of Vagrancy and Hope, available from the INA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France.

This is followed by an oblique, ochreous or yellowish- orange band, which crosses the wing and is margined with brown before and behind, and followed by an oblique white band, which also crosses the wing, and is rather widely margined behind by an iridescent, brown line, terminating at a smooth tuft of raised scales on the dorsal margin, the tuft or rather smooth elevation being metallic and highly iridescent, as also are the brown margins of the ochreous bands. The dark brown, posterior margin of the second brown fascia is produced backwards along the disc and passes backwards along the disc, inclining towards, but not reaching the base of the dorsal cilia, and containing three smooth, metallic elevations, like the one on the dorsal margin, the wing between it and the costa being white, and between it and the dorsal margin the wing is white and pale ochreous. The oblique streak terminates just before the dorsal cilia at a curved fascia, which is very convex towards the base, is reddish ochreous on the dorsal margin, and brown on the costal margin. This curved fascia is followed by an oblique one, which is nearest to the tip on the costal margin, and the costal portion of it is wide and white, and the dorsal portion brown, and in some lights is brilliant metallic.

After graduation he conducted research of protozoans at the Imperial Health Ministry in Berlin. From 1913 onward, he served as a government zoologist in Kamerun, where he did studies on the biology of the malaria pathogen. From 1916 to 1919 he conducted research at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid, and in 1921 was appointed director of the protozoology department at the Schiffs- und Tropenkrankheiten in Hamburg.

It was formed as a consequence of an agreement reached at the end of September 2015 between Russia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic to \\"help and cooperate in collecting information about the terrorist Daesh group\\" (ISIL) with a view to combatting the advances of the group, according to the statement issued by the Iraqi Joint Operations Command. The statement also cited \\"the increasing concern from Russia about thousands of Russian terrorists committing criminal acts within ISIS.\\" In October 2015, it was suggested that the Russia‚ÄìSyria‚ÄìIran‚ÄìIraq coalition may have been devised during the visit by Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Quds Force, to Moscow in July 2015. During the early days of the operation, the Russian Air Force were backed by the Syrian Armed Forces, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and allied militias. The United States, along with its NATO and Arab allies, all of which have been hostile to the four countries and Hezbollah since the start of the Syrian civil war, have criticized this coalition. Background =Russia and Iran= For two and a half decades, the Russian elite were split on Iran. Some, like Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, saw Iran as a bargaining chip in possible deals with the Western world. On the other hand, Eurasianists like political analyst Aleksandr Dugin wanted a Russo-Iranian alliance to counter Western influence.Dmitry Shlapentokh: Russian Elite Image of Iran: From The Late Soviet Era to The Present, Strategic Studies Institute, Carlisle, September 2009. =Syrian Civil War= Syria's civil war started when opposing groups in the country protested against Assad's rule in early 2011, the protests ultimately turning violent and drawing-in regional opponents and supporters of Assad. The war is being conducted between numerous opponents and government parties. More than 250,000 people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced. With most opponents, and their western allies, demanding Assad's leaving as a Prerequisite for talks, efforts to find a solution have failed thus far. Recently Western countries have said Assad could play some role in a transition. Regarding the transitional period Assad has asserted that it was not western countries' job to decide on Syria's future. He has accused the US and its allies of hypocrisy for their support for insurgents, saying that air raids by Syrian jets, now combined by Russia, have been far more productive than anything performed by the year-long air operations by the US-led coalition. According to Assad the countries involved in US-led coalition, themselves support terrorism, thus they cannot fight terrorism. That is why, he says, several months of fighting against terrorism, has resulted in spreading it. After 2015 After the loss of Idlib province to a rebel offensive in the first half of 2015, the situation was judged to have become critical for Assad's survival. High level talks were held between Moscow and Tehran in the first half of 2015 and a political agreement was achieved. In October 2015, it was suggested that the Russian operation in Syria may have been devised during the visit by Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Quds Force, to Moscow in July 2015, which was then denied by Russian officials. Responding to an official request by Syrian government, in September 2015, Russia sent its warplanes and other military hardware and combat troops to Bassel Al-Assad International Airport near Latakia to be ready for their operation. In 2016, Russia declared it would send humanitarian aid to Aleppo with the help of the Syrian Government. Russia also claimed that it would allow civilians to leave the city, and urged the Syrian Government to offer the chance for militants to surrender. The Russian Air Force has used Iranian airbases for refueling namely the Hamadan Airbase. Agreement At the end of September 2015, a joint information centre in Baghdad was set up by Iran, Iraq, Russia and Syria to coordinate their operations against ISIL. According to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's statement made in mid-October 2015, prior to the start of its operations in Syria, Russia invited the U.S. to join the Baghdad-based information center but received what he called an \\"unconstructive\\" response. Putin's proposal that the U.S. receive a high-level Russian delegation and that a U.S. delegation arrive in Moscow to discuss co-operation in Syria was likewise declined by the U.S. Following an official request from the Syrian government for martial help against rebel and jihadist groups in Syria, the coalition started its work. It was generally thought that Iran would play a leading role in the ground operations of Syria's army and allies, whilst Russia would be leading in the air in conjunction with the Syrian air force, thereby establishing a complementary role. For Western countries and the Russia‚ÄìSyria‚ÄìIran‚ÄìIraq coalition ISIS has been a common enemy, although each country has very different friends and opposing views of how to solve the crisis. In an interview with Iranian TV, Assad said that the success of this agreement was vital to save the Middle East from destruction. He said that the year-long air campaign by US-led coalition had been counterproductive and had helped terrorism to spread and win new recruits, but that the new coalition of Russia, Syria, Iran, and Iraq, could achieve real results. Iran's role Other than being a crucial thoroughfare to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria has been the only consistent ally for Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. Iran has provided significant support for the Syrian Government in the Syrian Civil War, including logistical, technical and financial support.Iran boosts support to Syria, telegraph, 21 February 2014 In April 2014, Hossein Amir-Abdolahian, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, said: \\"We aren‚Äôt seeking to have Bashar Assad remain president for life. But we do not subscribe to the idea of using extremist forces and terrorism to topple Assad and the Syrian government.\\" On 24 July General Qasem Soleimani visited Moscow to devise the details of the plan for coordinated military action in Syria. In October 2015, it was suggested that the Russia‚ÄìSyria‚ÄìIran‚ÄìIraq coalition may have been devised during his visit. Citing two Lebanese sources, Reuters reported on 1 October 2015 that hundreds of Iranian troops arrived in Syria over the previous 10 days and would soon join Syrian government forces and their Lebanese Hezbollah allies in a major ground offensive backed by Russian air strikes. Iran has also been training Iraqi Shia militias who are fighting ISIS.
