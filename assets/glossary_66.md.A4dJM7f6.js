In the Epic of Gilgamesh, (Tablets I-XII) it is used as follows: as, 26 times, a·π£, 25, and az, 21.Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, sign no. 131, p. 158. Amarna letters usage In the Amarna letters, it is rendered differently from the electronic, digitized version. The description for both usages, on letters EA 365, and EA 362 is as follows: the inside sub-parts are found outside the 2-pairs of horizontal strokes; also the right stroke pair, shows the bottom stroke angled down-to-the-right (providing a space for the 2-angled strokes, instead on 362 and 365, a 'coupled- horizontal-sub-pair'). The ending, right 2-strokes made for the 4+4+2 stroke sign, are following the sign, and between the right 2 paired horizontal strokes (in the space between; stroke ten is placed upon stroke 9, making a coupled last two strokes, by final right position). The 4-vertical, short strokes can be seen to lie upon, and between the bottom left-horizontal (its end), and the beginning of the right-horizontal stroke; consequently, either the final group of 4-strokes, or the 'final' 2-strokes, make up the last strokes in the making of the sign. Being that the sign is in a sub-group of \\"coupound signs\\", (signs 'added-to', 'surrounded-by' (enclosed-within) other strokes), it may be assumed the usage of the sa cuneiform is for more specialized, or unique situations. In Amarna letter EA 362, Rib-Hadda to Pharaoh, a long discussion involves the 'territories' (city-states), and other individuals, and unrest in the region surrounding Byblos. The sign is used in the word \\"falsehood\\", ('lie'), (ka-az-bu-te), line 53, Rib-Hadda claiming he is not lying, (or misleading) the Pharaoh. Amarna letter 362, lines 51, and following: :\\"... (51) And my lord knows that (52) I do not write words (53) of falsehood (ka-az-bu-te) to my lord.

It is the bedrock upon which America was founded.

The Palgrave Commission (1876‚Äì1885) was a series of diplomatic missions undertaken by Special Commissioner William Coates Palgrave (1833‚Äì1897) to the territory of South West Africa (modern Namibia). Palgrave was commissioned by the Cape Government to meet with the leaders of the nations of Hereroland and Namaland, hear their wishes regarding political sovereignty, and relay the assembled information to the Cape Colony Government. In the early 1870s, South West Africa was torn by internecine warfare and threatened with impending invasion and colonisation by Portugal, Germany and the Boers. In desperation, several local leaders requested incorporation into the relatively peaceful Cape Colony, with the promise of equal representation in the Cape Parliament. The Cape Government commissioned Palgrave to investigate, and Palgrave recommended that South West Africa be incorporated into the Cape and its inhabitants granted equal political rights. This would have resulted in a new state, comprising the Cape and modern Namibia. However the breakdown in relations between the local Cape government and the British Imperial government prevented it from being implemented. The region remained vulnerable without a unified state structure, and was taken over and colonised by Germany soon afterwards.The Commissions of W History =Background= Early drawing of a camp of Basters or Oorlams, from the Cape frontier. 1872 photograph of the Baster Council. The book on the table is the Baster constitution. In the 19th century, the frontiers of the Cape Colony and the neighbouring Boer republics were inhabited by expanding waves of semi- nomadic farmers. These Afrikaans-speaking nomads included the mixed-race Oorlam, Griqua and Baster nations as well as the white Trekboers. Leaving the colonies, they spilled over into neighbouring territories and entered into clashes with the pre-existing African peoples. In South West Africa, which was as yet uncolonised by Europeans, incursions from the south by mounted gunmen of the Oorlam people began in the late 18th century. After decades of war with the Damara, Nama and Herero people, they established a powerful semi-nomadic state in the area of modern Windhoek, under their dynamic leader Jan Jonker Afrikaner. In 1868, a second group, the Basters, began to push north into South West Africa. In the ensuing conflict with the other nations of the area, they established a republic and parliament in 1872, around the settlement of Rehoboth. From the 1870s however, increasing numbers of white Trekboers began to enter South West Africa from the east, causing even worse internecine warfare. Furthermore, as the scramble for Africa loomed, several observant local leaders became aware that full European colonisation of the territory was probably on the way.The Commissions of W.C. Palgrave: Special Emissary to South West Africa ... - Google Books =Creation of the Commission (1876)= Maharero, the powerful Herero leader, sought to preempt a Boer invasion. In this context, the great Herero leader Maharero, still engaged in a bitter war with the Oorlam leader Jonker Afrikaner, heard rumours of a large body of white Trekboers preparing to leave the Transvaal Boer Republic to invade South West Africa and establish another Boer republic there. These rumours were in fact correct, as the \\"Dorsland Trekkers\\" were mobilising, and their great migration was soon to begin. Motivated by the combined severity of the situation, from 1874 Maharero began sending diplomatic missions southwards, to the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape, under its local system of \\"Responsible Government\\", had recently attained a degree of independence from the British Empire. Its locally elected parliament was viewed by many in southern Africa as being relatively benign and inclusive, as compared to the other more oppressive states of the region. It implemented a multi-racial franchise, laws prohibiting racial discrimination and legal protection of African traditional land from white appropriation. Maharero therefore chose the Cape for his overture, first requesting long-term assistance and protection, and later requesting incorporation of his people into the Cape's parliamentary democracy. The Cape Parliament responded to Maharero's request with a set of proposed scenarios. On the one extreme, some parliamentary factions favoured total non-involvement. On the other extreme, many favoured full annexation to the Cape Colony with all the political rights that would entail. The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno concluded that the final decision would depend on the views and wishes of the various nations of South West Africa, and that a delegation must immediately depart to consult them and report back. Wagons of the Palgrave Mission, travelling near Kunjas. To head the commission, Molteno chose William Palgrave, a gentle and learned man who had spent many years living with the Herero and knew many of the traditional leaders personally. Palgrave initially declined. He claimed that his personal friendships with some of the Herero leaders, such as Maharero and Shikongo, meant that he could not be fully impartial with regard to the region's conflicts. Charles Brownlee was therefore temporarily suggested as a replacement. However, on Molteno's insistence, Palgrave accepted. So finally, in 1876, Palgrave entered the arid vastness of South West Africa as \\"Special Commissioner to Hereroland and Namaland\\", with a multi-ethnic assemblage of personnel and a long train of ox-wagons.JB. Gewald: Herero Heroes: A Socio- Political History of the Herero of Namibia, 1890‚Äì1923. Ohio State University Press, 1999. =Palgrave's 5 missions= Jan Jonker Afrikaner, warlord and powerful leader of the Afrikaans-speaking Oorlam people. Palgrave undertook a total of 5 commissions to South West Africa, of which the first were the biggest. Travel was arduous and dangerous, in a desert country with no infrastructure and unsettled nomads. However Palgrave knew much of the country well from his youth, and many of his personnel were local men who were also knowledgeable of the enormous land. They generally travelled at night, so as to avoid the deadly heat of the desert. When arriving in settlements like Okahandja, Walvis Bay and Otjimbingwe, they were usually expected, and treated as honoured guests by the local leaders. Initially, before leaving Cape Town, Palgrave's opinion had been that a simple bilateral treaty and the posting of a magistrate for each nation would suffice to protect and ensure peace in the region. On seeing the current state of the country though, he personally came to feel that full annexation was the only way to bring about peace.I. Goldblatt: History of South West Africa: From the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century. Juta, 1971. First Commission In his 1st commission, Palgrave visited Maharero and his government, as well as the local leaders of Omaruru and Ameib, the Basters, the Nama, Damaras, Bondelswarts and the powerful and expansionist Oorlam people of Jonker Afrikaner. His report back to the Cape Parliament was that Maharero formally requested full incorporation, with a magistrate specifically to be based in his own town of Okahandja. The other nations, suffering from the internecine strife, likewise requested incorporation by treaty. Notably, he reported that the Oorlam wished to remain sovereign. However his conclusion was that annexation was overwhelmingly favoured by the leaders and people of the region, and that it was the only way of ending the devastating warfare that was engulfing the region. Back in Cape Town, additional recommendations included: * Establishing a magistrate-system, centred on Okahandja, with field-cornets in the smaller settlements. The Cape Parliament would be expanded to represent the additional voters. * A recognition of any customary tribal laws, such as did not conflict with fundamental rights to life and property and which did not involve violence or \\"marauding\\". * The ensuring that, before accession, each tribe's leadership was entirely aware of (and in accordance with) the main body of Cape law as it applied to them * Agreeing with the local leaders on the introduction of additional laws to prevent the flow of liquor imports into the country. The Cape government immediately agreed to incorporation, but other forces were at play in southern Africa that would prevent it.J. H. Esterhuyse: South West Africa, 1880‚Äì1894: the establishment of German authority in South West Africa. C. Struik, 1968. Fall-out between the Cape and Britain British Governor Bartle Frere Cape Prime Minister John Molteno 1876 map from the Palgrave Commission While Walvis Bay and the offshore islands was incorporated into the Cape, the rest of the country remained open to the German colonisers in the 1880s. Palgrave's commission was increasingly undermined by the growing tension between the local Cape government and the British Empire. The Cape Colony had attained a degree of independence, but its first Prime Minister John Molteno was engaged in a growing struggle with the British Governor, Bartle Frere, for control over the Cape's external relations (of which Palgrave's commission formed a part). This caused the British Imperial Government first to push for the annexation, but then to actively forestall it as a way of putting pressure on the Cape government. This fatally undermined Palgrave's work. Nonetheless, aside from any humanitarian considerations, the Cape began to have serious strategic reasons for wanting to secure South West Africa. It correctly predicted the invasion of this area by an imperialist European power (in this case, Germany), and it wished to protect the flank of the new Kimberley diamond fields. It was also very aware of the need to secure the only viable harbour of the region (Walvis Bay) and the trade routes to the north. The British government believed it to be a strife-torn territory, of no significant value. A reflection of its ignorance of the land was Carnarvon's belief that Walvis Bay was the port for Kimberley. The British government wanted to force upon southern Africa a system of Confederation under Britain. The Cape government rejected this Confederation plan, as it predicted (correctly) that it would lead to war with the Boer Republics. However, the British Governor used his ability to obstruct the implementation of Palgrave's work as a tactical tool, to pressurise the Cape government to agree to confederation. Failing to persuade the Cape government, the British Governor overthrew it, and assumed direct control of the country to enforce the Confederation system. The Confederation plan collapsed as predicted, leaving a swath of wars across southern Africa, culminating in the Anglo-Zulu War and the first Anglo-Boer War. In a peculiar step, the incorporation of Walvis Bay and the offshore islands was then authorised by the British in 1878, while the rest of the country remained in legal limbo until the Germans arrived.P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1900 Subsequent Commissions Palgrave's following trips coincided with a sharp deterioration in the conditions in South West Africa. Among the overall rise in violence, notable was the renewed military expansion of Jonker Afrikaner's Oorlam. Meanwhile, the Herero polity began to fragment, the Basters came under growing attack, and the migration of Boer \\"Thirst Trekkers\\" approached from the Transvaal (in the end, in fact, for all the fear they generated among the locals, the trekkers ended up in a state of near starvation in the Kakaoveld, decimated by the harsh climate.) Related to the rise in violence, local leaders' trust in Palgrave declined. Maharero, no longer relying directly on Palgrave, sent his son Willem on a diplomatic mission to Cape Town to negotiate with the new pro-imperialist Prime Minister, John Gordon Sprigg. The Oorlam broke off relations completely, and Palgrave even had to flee the fighting as further fighting broke out between the Herero and the Nama, and his staff largely deserted him. As the various political factions in the British administration of the Cape disagreed and delayed, the unrest in South West Africa continued. Finally, as predicted, the German Colonisers arrived. =German invasion (1884)= The first German settlement at L√ºderitz. German troops in combat with the Herero in a painting by Richard Kn√∂tel. German colonial troops, 1906. In 1883, a German trader, Adolf L√ºderitz bought a section of coast, renamed it after himself, and advised the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to annexe and occupy South West Africa, before the Cape did. In 1884 Bismarck did so, thereby establishing German South West Africa as a colony (Deutsch-S√ºdwestafrika in German). Too late, the Cape tried to forestall the German invasion. Surrounded by bitter accusations from his former staff and in the context of the German expansion, Palgrave departed for his 5th and final commission in 1884. Once again, he conveyed a desperate request for incorporation from Maharero and other leaders. Once again, the British Imperial Government adopted its own course and vacillated, and when Palgrave arrived back in Cape Town he learned that the Imperial government had recognised German authority over the South West African hinterland.K. Dierks: Chronology of Namibian history: from pre-historical times to independent Namibia. Namibia Scientific Society, 1999. =Aftermath and legacy= The failure of the Palgrave Commission was due primarily due to ill-advised interference in the affairs of southern Africa by the British Colonial Office in London, whose obstruction of the commission led to German colonisation of South West Africa. The subsequent wars, rebellions and resulting Herero and Namaqua Genocide all ensued from German colonisation. However, it is difficult to hypothesize on what would have resulted if the Palgrave Commission had succeeded. The hypothetical enlarged state would have included the entire (predominantly mixed-race and Afrikaans-speaking) western half of southern Africa, corresponding largely to the dry, winter-rainfall climatic area, and holding abundant mineral resources. It would also have inherited a relatively liberal, inclusive and multi-racial political system. Had it not been united with the Boer republics and the Johannesburg mines that seeded apartheid, it is possible that this region would have avoided that most unfortunate part of history. A social development akin to that of Brazil might have followed, but with no way of predicting either way, no judgement can be made. Palgrave himself became increasingly critical, both of the Herero and Nama leadership, and of the British authorities he was working for. Having worked for nearly a decade on a project that was now a failure, he retired. The question has yet to be resolved, of whether he was a hard-working and well-intentioned diplomat attempting to pre-empt the German colonial invasion, or whether he was merely another agent of oppressive colonialism.E.

Officially called Zivildienstleistender (ZDL) or Zivildiener it is common to call them Zivi. Since 1975, drafted men may refuse the military service on conscientious reasons and serve in the compulsory alternative community service instead. This generally involves work in social services like hospitals, youth organisations, nursing homes, rescue services, emergency medical services, and care of the disabled. The service usually lasts nine months. About more than 40% of the drafted male citizens in Austria choose this option by declaring a conflict of conscience. There is no conscription for women, therefore women are not obliged to serve as a Zivi, which is just a substitute for the still existing mandatory military service.  History  The compulsory community service was introduced under the Kreisky II cabinet in 1975 due to pressure by pacifist groups. The military was pleased by the development, because it led to fewer disruptions of military service due to pacifists refusing weapons. Once an Austrian has completed compulsory community service, he is exempt from military service for life, and can therefore never be called for military duty. Though compulsory community service is firmly anchored in the constitution together with military service, it is supposed to be reserved for exceptional cases. Originally, conscientious objectors had to explain their doubts in front of a commission, which would determine whether or not they would be sent to the Zivildienst. The compulsory community service lasted eight months, the same length as military service. The law was amended in 1991 so that objectors only need to declare their objection, rather than facing a commission. As a result, the number of objectors rose, so the length of the civilian service was increased in stages: first to 10 months in 1992; then 11 months; then 12 months in 1997 (including two weeks of holidays). Between 1 April 2002 and 30 September 2005, the Zivildienstverwaltungs GmbH, organized as an affiliated limited liability company of the Austrian Red Cross, was responsible for distributing compulsory service personnel on behalf of the then responsible Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior. This ended after the Austrian Constitutional Court demanded this activity as part of government and its integration into the interior ministry. Since October 2005, the Agency for the Alternative Civil Service (in German: Zivildienstagentur), which is responsible to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism since 2020, handles all issues regarding the compulsory community service.https://www.bmlrt.gv.at/zivildienst.html In 2004, the term of military service was reduced to six months, as recommended by a reform commission. Accordingly, the length of compulsory community service was adapted to nine months in 2006. Compulsory community service personnel, however, have the option to add another three months to their service for better pay through a private contract.  Institutions using Zivildienst personnel  The most conscientious objector draftees have to work for the Austrian Red Cross. Beyond that, a higher number of compulsory community service personnel has to work in the care of the elderly and in hospitals. Further organisations are, for example, Emergency medical services, kindergartens, fire brigades, in communities as crossing guards and other social organisations which care for the disabled or refugees. Some small numbers have to work in agriculture.  Area of Operations  * Emergency medical services: 39.2% * Handicapped aid services: 17.5% * Welfare: 12.3% * Nursing home care: 10.6% * Hospitals: 6.8% * Asylum services: 3.8% * Childcare: 2.7% * Disaster relief services and civil protection: 2.6% * Agricultural assistance: 1.1% * Public safety / school crossing guard service: 1.1%https://www.addendum.org/coronavirus/zivildienst- verlaengerung/  Regular Alternative Civilian Service  By 2014, more than 16,600 conscientious objectors enlisted on \\"Regular Alternative Civilian Service\\" (German: Ordentlicher Zivildienst), the number of men enlisted for the mandatory alterative community service personnel has steadily increased. Since 2015 the number is decreasing. In 2019 the percentage of eligible men opting for Zivildienst increased again, but the actual number decreased, due to a year with a low birth rate.https://orf.at/stories/3157018/ Therefore the Austrian government will widen eligibility to the so called \\"partial eligibility\\" (German: \\"Teiltauglichkeit\\"). Starting from January 2021 every men without physical or intellectual disability will be eligible for Zivildienst (and military service) to have the maximum number of men available for all mandatory services.https://www.addendum.org/zivildienst/teiltauglichkeit- oesterreich/https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/oesterreich/2018898-Wehrpflicht- Aus-untauglich-soll-teiltauglich-werden.html = Regional differences of men opting for Zivildienst = There are severe regional differences, while in Vorarlberg (52.8%) and Vienna (53.5%) more than half of the drafted men registered for the mandatory alternative community service (as of 2014), in Carinthia only slightly more than a quarter (26.3%) of eligible male citizens decided to become a \\"Zivi\\".https://kurier.at/chronik/oesterreich/wehrpflicht- wien-hat-meiste-untaugliche-und-zivildiener/400416065 By 2018 already 66% of the male citizens of Vienna opted to become a Zivi.https://wien.orf.at/stories/3035822/https://kurier.at/politik/inland/heer- teiltauglichkeit-soll-anfang-2021-eingefuehrt- werden/400757952https://noe.orf.at/stories/3035259/ =Number of enrolments for mandatory alternative community service= * 2015: 15,888 (48.65%) of 32,659 eligible conscripts * 2016: 14,987 (46.16%) of 32,468 eligible conscripts * 2017: 13,932 (45.79%) of 30,815 eligible conscripts * 2018: 13,466 (43.82%) of 30,728 eligible conscriptshttps://oesterreich.orf.at/stories/2963466/ * 2019: ca. 13.100 (44%) of ca. 29.800 eligible conscriptshttps://orf.at/stories/3157018/  Special Alternative Civilian Service  In times of crisis or during the state of emergency, the government can draft men under the age of 50 again, who already fulfilled their regular obligatory civil alternative service for \\"Special Alternative Civilian Service\\" (German: Au√üerordentlicher Zivildienst).2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first time in history of Austrian Zivildienst, 3.500 men started with Au√üerordentlicher Zivildienst, 2.000 men volunteered and 1.500 men have been drafted to special alternative service for the duration of three months after fulfilling their period of service to assist in the Austrian medical service.https://www.diepresse.com/5785211/was-turkis-grun-fur-zivildiener- miliz-und-grundwehrdiener- planthttps://kurier.at/chronik/oesterreich/oesterreich-macht-mobil-heer- ruestet-sich-fuer- inlandseinsatz/400781756https://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/wirtschaftsticker/virus- oesterreich-setzt-3500-ausserordentliche-zivildienstleistende- ein_id_11836354.htmlhttps://kurier.at/politik/inland/3500-ausserordentliche- zivildiener-treten-ihren-dienst-an/400798529https://orf.at/stories/3162867/ Due to a lack of necessity, the \\"Special Alternative Civilian Service\\" has been stopped at the end of July 2020 .https://kurier.at/politik/inland/coronakrise-ausserordentlicher-zivildienst- endet-am-31-juli/400986374  Voluntary services as an alternative to the regular Zivildienst  = Austrian Service Abroad = Since 1992, Austrian conscripts have the opportunity to work abroad. Andreas Maislinger took the idea from the German Action Reconciliation Service for Peace and founded the Austrian Service Abroad (in German: Auslandsdienst). This service is not part of the regular alternative civilian service, but a substitute to the regular Zivildienst which exempts its participants from the compulsory community service. These positions are very popular, so participants often have to wait for years in order to receive one. The Austrian Service Abroad lasts twelve months and can be served in three different services:  Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service  The German name is Gedenkdienst (for Memorial Service). The organization takes care of victims of Nazism.  Austrian Social Service  The Austrian Social Service supports the social and economic development of a country. It can be done at various deployment locations that are operated by a multitude of partner organisations.  Austrian Peace Service  The Austrian Peace Service service can be provided in five accepted partner organizations, which are in China, Israel, Japan or the Netherlands. Goal is to spend a year in those countries and understand the enormous complexity of the conflicts and to make a little contribution to the lasting assurance of peace. = European Voluntary Service = Volunteering in the European Voluntary Service (EVS) for a minimum of 10 months is accepted as an alternative service to the regular Zivildienst since 2016. = Voluntary ecological year = Since 2013 it is possible to volunteer for the program of the voluntary ecological year (in German: Freiwilliges Umweltjahr / FUJ) for a minimum period of 10 months instead of the Zivildienst. The FUJ is an educational and orientation year for teenagers and young adults. = Voluntary social year = Since 2016 it is possible to volunteer for a minimum of 10 months for the program of the voluntary social year (in German: Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr / FSJ) as an alternative to the regular Zivildienst. The reasons to join this program is, that you have some benefits, but it takes a few months longer than the Zivildienst.  Compensation for Food  There has been years-long controversy in Austria as to the compensation for food of compulsory community service personnel. In 2001, an amendment to the law gave users of alternative civil service draftees a duty to ensure the proper nutrition of Zivildienst personnel, but did not define what \\"proper nutrition\\" entails. As a result, many users of compulsory community service personnel chose to pay only ‚Ç¨6.00 EUR per day in compensation for food, resulting in many protests and complaints. In the opinion of compulsory community service personnel, ‚Ç¨6.00 EUR per day is insufficient to guarantee proper nutrition. As a result, the issue was taken to the courts in October 2005. The judgement agreed that ‚Ç¨6.00 EUR per day is insufficient, and determined that an appropriate amount would be between ‚Ç¨11.26 EUR and ‚Ç¨13.60 EUR per day. This is the same amount to which military personnel are entitled.  Weapon ban  Compulsory community service draftees are banned from owning or carrying weapons for fifteen years after completing their compulsory service, which could impact negatively on their future employability. Those who served the Zivildienst were also forbidden from later joining the police service in Austria. However, the law was amended in 2010 to introduce certain circumstances under which the weapon ban could be lifted to pursue a career with the police forces. This involves former alternative civilian service personnel making a declaration that their conscientious doubts are over.

Fr√∂jel Church may have been built to serve not only as a church, but also as a fortification. Stylistically, it is a mix of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, and contains murals from the early 14th century. It is associated with the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture The church was probably built not only as a house of worship but also a place of refuge in times of danger or conflict. The location on a high point not far from the sea is fortress-like, and close to the church lies the ruins of a defensive tower, dating from the Middle Ages. The church was built close to a pre-Christian maze or Troy Town indicating an ancient site. The church was constructed of limestone. The oldest parts of the church itself, the nave, dates from the late 12th century. The tower is somewhat later, while the large choir is from circa 1300, and in Gothic style rather than the Romanesque of the rest of the church. The intention was probably that the whole church should be rebuilt in Gothic style but for some reason only the choir was rebuilt. The interior of the church displays several medieval murals, depicting dragons, deer, lions and griffins, as well as an angel and a bishop. The murals date from the early 14th century. The base of the baptismal font is made by the master sculptor Byzantios, while the upper part of the font is from the 14th century. There is also a large medieval triumphal cross in Fr√∂jel church.

She was part of an informal school of genetics at Cambridge led by her brother-in-law William Bateson. Her work on the heredity of coat colours in mice and canaries helped to support and extend Mendel's law of heredity. It is also one of the first examples of epistasis. National Institute for Medical Research Early life and career Florence Margaret Durham was born in London, one of six daughters of surgeon Arthur Edward Durham (1833‚Äì1895) and his wife Mary Ann Cantwell. Arthur Durham was an alcoholic and his wife was strongly opposed to alcohol. In 1891 and 1892, Florence Durham achieved second class honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos Part I and II (physiology) at Girton College. She lectured in Biology at Royal Holloway College and the Froebel Institute in London from 1893 to 1899. She also lectured in physiology at Newnham College. From 1900 to 1910, she was a demonstrator in Physiology at the Balfour Laboratory. Towards the end of the 19th century, female students were still facing resistance from Cambridge academics, including a move by some scientists to prevent them from taking introductory biology courses. A letter from Durham published in the Girton Review called on the women's colleges Girton and Newnham to \\"encourage advanced and research work and thus to show the world that women mean to do serious work and have higher aims in view than mere success in examination.\\" The colleges responded to this and other pressure by raising money for more research fellowships. Florence Durham's sister Beatrice first became engaged to William Bateson in 1889, but at the engagement party, Bateson was thought to have had too much wine, so Mrs. Durham prevented her daughters' engagement. Beatrice and William finally married in June 1896, by which time Arthur Durham had died and his wife had either died (according to Henig) or had somehow been persuaded to drop her opposition to the marriage (according to Cock). William Bateson and the Newnham College Mendelians, 1900‚Äì1910 During this period, Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance was rediscovered and caused a bitter controversy between its supporters ‚Äì William Bateson and his group of Mendelians ‚Äì and its opponents, who included Walter Frank Raphael Weldon (Bateson's former teacher) and Carl Pearson. Weldon's group were known as the Biometrics. Bateson's group at Cambridge was very unusual for its time, in that it was made up mainly of women. It was there that Florence Durham, Edith Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Saunders and Muriel Wheldale performed work to show that complex traits could be explained by Mendel's law of segregation. Bateson's wife Beatrice was also actively involved in his research. Florence Durham joined the group as a post-graduate research student who had already published research. She worked on several projects. In 1905 she began a collaboration with Dorothea Charlotte Edith Marrya on sex inheritance and eye colour in canaries. Their published observations in Durham and Marryat (1908) that pink eyes and female sex were inherited together in cinnamon canaries provided a possible mammalian example for sex linkage that had been recorded in moths. Durham continued working with canaries for at least the next decade. In 1906 she attended the Third International Conference on Genetics in London and attended a further international congress in 1911. After Bateson accepted a position as director of the new John Innes Horticultural Institute, which opened in Surrey in 1910, Florence Durham moved there to work with him on plant genetics, including a study of tetraploid primrose hybrids. Epistasis Beatrice Bateson wrote in her memoir that her sister Florence \\"hybridised mice in a kind of attic over the Museums\\". The problem of the heredity of mice coat colours first eluded Mendelian explanation. She began working on this problem in 1903, with Muriel Wheldale. Florence Durham challenged the prevailing view of Lucien Cu√©not, who proposed that it was the combination of factors which explained the different colours of mouse coats. Durham invoked the concept of epistasis to explain that coat colour relied on the relationship between four different factors. The term \\"epistasis\\" was coined by William Bateson, and Durham invoked it to explain how genes could interact in a more complex way than the simple dominant and recessive characteristics identified by Gregor Mendel. She wrote, \\"the terms 'dominant' and 'recessive' should only be applied to express relationship between factors in the same allelomorphic pair\\". She also undertook some chemical analysis of the pigments in mouse skin and hair in the Chemistry Department of Cambridge University with Gowland Hopkins. In 1910 she gave a lecture about 'Mendelism and the Laws of Heredity' to the Girton Natural Sciences Club, illustrated with mice that she had bred. Medical Research Council From 1917 until her retirement in 1930, Durham worked for the Central Research Laboratory (now the National Institute for Medical Research), in its Division of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, working under Henry Dale. Her work mainly focused on neosalvarsan, an organoarsenic compound that was used to treat syphilis. She and her colleague Miss Marchal were responsible for ensuring that preparations of neosalvarsan met the quality standardDurham, F. M.; Gaddum, J. H. and Marchal, J. H. (1929). Reports on Biological Standards II. Toxicity Tests for Novarseno-benzene (Neosalvarsan). London, Medical Research Council Special Report No. 128 and issuing licences on behalf of the Board of Trade. In 1932, Durham published the results of a long-term experiment into the genetic effects of alcohol on guinea pigs, conducted at NIMR. The study was done in response to reports by American researcher Charles Rupert Stockard that the offspring of alcohol-exposed guinea pigs exhibited defects attributable to the parents' alcohol exposure. After breeding 6,983 guinea pigs over the course of several years, Durham found no evidence that daily doses of alcohol had any hereditary effects; the percentage of offspring born with genetic defects was no higher among the intoxicated guinea pigs than among the control group. This was one of several studies that discredited the Lamarckian theory of inheritance that Stockard's work appeared to support. Later life In her later years, Durham lived at Hawkern Otterton near Budleigh Salterton, Devon.

History By January 1979, Bokassa had become such an autocratic ruler that he passed an injunction that all students of high schools should wear a uniform made in his factory. This led to an agitation by the students in Bangui. Bokassa called in the Central African Armed Forces to put down the agitation. In April 1979, Bokassa ordered the arrest of young students‚Äîincluding adolescents and children‚Äîwho threw rocks at his car and put them behind bars. In the following two days, about 100 children were brutally killed and the incident became known as the \\"children's massacre at Bangui.\\" A panel of judges convened and proposed to arrest Bokassa and put him on trial. Bokassa then fled to Libya, seeking Muammar Gaddafi's assistance. The French reacted and soon launched Operation Barracuda to overthrow Bokassa and install David Dacko as president, who was then in exile in Europe. They brought back Dacko with support of French troops who were moved from Gabon and Chad. The coup was successful; Dacko returned to the office of president after a 13-year absence, and restored the Central African Republic (CAR). Bokassa had fled to France. Bokassa eventually returned to the CAR in 1987, where he was immediately arrested, put on trial, and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison a year later. As one of his last acts in office, President Andr√© Kolingba granted a general amnesty for all prisoners, including Bokassa, in 1993. Bokassa died three years later. This operation was known as Operation Caban and the military operation by the French to move four paratrooper units of Troupes de marine, which were given the Squadron name Barracudas and four helicopter, was Operation Barracuda.

Founded in 1911 from Jaffa, Falastin began as a weekly publication, evolving into one of the most influential dailies in Ottoman and Mandatory Palestine. As Palestine's most prominent newspaper, its circulation was estimated to be 3,000 in 1929‚Äìthe year it became a daily. Although a modest figure, it was almost double that of its nearest competitor. However, Falastin's standing was challenged in 1934 by the Jaffa-based Al-Difa' newspaper, which soon surpassed it in circulation. Both dailies witnessed steady improvements, and their competition marked Palestinian public life till 1948. Falastin was founded by Issa El-Issa, who was joined by his paternal cousin Yousef El-Issa. Both El-Issas were Arab Christians, opponents of Zionism and British administration. The newspaper was initially focused on the Arab struggle against Greek clerical hegemony of the Jerusalem Orthodox Church. It was also the country's fiercest and most consistent critic of the Zionist movement, denouncing it as a threat to Palestine's Arab population. It helped shape Palestinian identity and was shut down several times by the Ottoman and British authorities, most of the time due to complaints made by Zionists. Falastin, fleeing the fighting in Jaffa during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, relocated to East Jerusalem in the West Bank which then became under Jordanian control. The newspaper continued to be published until 1967 when it was merged with Al-Manar to produce Jordanian-based Ad-Dustuor newspaper in Amman that is still published to this day. History Falastin's editors and journalists, 1913. Founders Issa and Yousef sitting in the front row. \\"J'Accuse!\\", in a reference to the outrage at French anti-semitism 27 years previously. Falastin was established on 14 January 1911 by Issa El-Issa and Yousef El-Issa, two Arab Christian cousins from the coastal city of Jaffa in Palestine. It was among a handful of newspapers to have emerged from the region following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution in the Ottoman Empire which lifted press censorship. The newspaper was initially focused on the Orthodox Renaissance, a movement that aimed to weaken the Greek clerical hegemony over the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, so that its vast financial resources could be utilized to improve education for the Arab Christians of Palestine. Other topics addressed in the newspaper included modernization, reforms and improving the welfare of the peasants. Its geographic scope of interest focused on the Mutassarifate of Jerusalem, primarily news from Jaffa and Jerusalem, but also less frequently Hebron, Jericho and Gaza. The scope of interest later expanded in 1913 to include all of Palestine. Issa El-Issa, a graduate of the American University of Beirut, worked in several places before establishing Falastin. He came from a Palestinian family known for its 'intellect, politics and literature'. The family was financially independent from the Jerusalem Patriarch's charity as it had historically invested in olive oil and soap trading. Issa's cousin Hanna El-Issa, was editor of the short-lived Al-Asma'i magazine which was first published in Jerusalem on 1 September 1908. Much less is known about Hanna's brother Yousef, who was Falastin's editor-in-chief between 1911 and 1914. During World War I, both Issa and Yousef were exiled to Anatolia. Issa became head of King Faisal's Royal Court after the Arab Kingdom of Syria was established in 1920. After the Kingdom's defeat by French forces the same year, Issa returned to Jaffa where he was allowed to republish Falastin in 1921. Issa's son Raja El-Issa took over publishing the newspaper after 1938. Suspension Herbert Samuel in 1922 18 June 1936 edition showing Zionism as a crocodile under the protection of a British officer telling Palestinian Arabs: \\"don't be afraid!!! I will swallow you peacefully...\\". Working under the censorship of the Ottoman Empire and the British Mandate, Falastin was suspended from publication over 20 times. In 1914, Falastin was suspended by Ottoman authorities, once for criticism of the Mutasarrif (November 1913) and once for what British authorities summarized as \\"a fulminating and vague threat that when the eyes of the nation were opened to the peril towards which it was drifting it would rise like a roaring flood and a consuming fire and there would be trouble in [store] for the Zionists.\\"Mandel, 1976, pp. 179-181 Following the first suspension in 1914, Falastin issued a circular responding to the government charges that they were \\"sowing discord between the elements of the [Ottoman] Empire,\\" which stated that \\"Zionist\\" was not the same as \\"Jew\\" and described the former as \\"a political party whose aim is to restore Palestine to their nation and concentrate them in it, and to keep it exclusively for them.\\" The newspaper was supported by Muslim and Christian notables, and a judge annulled the suspension on grounds of freedom of the press. After the newspaper was allowed to be republished, Issa El-Issa wrote in an editorial that \\"the Zionists still look at this newspaper with suspicion and consider it the greatest stumbling block that hinders their goals and informs people of their aspirations and what is discussed at their Congresses and what their leaders declare and their newspapers and magazines publish.\\" Defending himself in the Ottoman court, he recounted saying \\"when we said 'Zionists' we referred to the political organisation with its headquarters in Europe which aims for the colonisation of Palestine, the usurpation of its lands and its transformation into a Jewish homeland\\". He emphasized his positive attitude towards Jews who he had called \\"brothers\\". The court identified with Issa and Yousef's arguments, the latter having testified in favor of his cousin Issa. The Al- Karmil newspaper reported that the crowds waiting inside and outside the courtroom erupted in applause after the verdict was pronounced, \\"signs of anger appeared on the faces of the Zionists much as signs of joy were visible on the faces of the natives.\\" The French Consulate reported that jubilant crowds had carried the editors on their shoulders after the trial finished. Coverage of sport news Street vendor selling Falastin newspaper in Jaffa 1921 The establishment of Falastin newspaper in 1911 is considered to be the cornerstone of sports journalism in Ottoman Palestine. It is no coincidence that the most active newspaper, also reported on sporting events. Falastin, covered sport news in Ottoman Palestine which helped in shaping the modern Palestinian citizen, bringing the villages and cities together, building Palestinian nationalism and deepening and maintaining Palestinian national identity.Mandel, 1976, pp. 127-130: \\"the Christian editors of Falastin would call on all Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian, to unite against Zionism on grounds of local patriotism\\"Rugh, 2004, p. 138 Nashashibi-Husseini rivalry On the rivalry between the Nashashibi and the Husseini families in Mandatory Palestine, an editorial in Falastin in the 1920s commented: Influence Daoud El-Issa with King Ali of Hejaz at the Jaffa port, 7 November 1933. Yousef El-Issa, the newspaper's editor-in-chief during its infancy, was described by a researcher to be \\"a founder of modern journalism in Palestine\\". Al-Muqattam, one of the most read dailies in Egypt, commented in an editorial when Yousef was editor-in-chief (1911-1914): Albert Einstein's letter On January 28, 1930 Albert Einstein sent out a letter to Falastin's editor Issa El-Issa. :One who, like myself, has cherished for many years the conviction that the humanity of the future must be built up on an intimate community of the nations, and that aggressive nationalism must be conquered, can see a future for Palestine only on the basis of peaceful cooperation between the two peoples who are at home in the country. For this reason I should have expected that the great Arab people will show a truer appreciation of the need which the Jews feel to rebuild their national home in the ancient seat of Judaism; I should have expected that by common effort ways and means would be found to render possible an extensive Jewish settlement in the country. I am convinced that the devotion of the Jewish people to Palestine will benefit all the inhabitants of the country, not only materially, but also culturally and nationally. I believe that the Arab renaissance in the vast expanse of territory now occupied by the Arabs stands only to gain from Jewish sympathy. I should welcome the creation of an opportunity for absolutely free and frank discussion of these possibilities, for I believe that the two great Semitic peoples, each of which has in its way contributed something of lasting value to the civilisation of the West, may have a great future in common, and that instead of facing each other with barren enmity and mutual distrust, they should support each other's national and cultural endeavours, and should seek the possibility of sympathetic co- operation. I think that those who are not actively engaged in politics should above all contribute to the creation of this atmosphere of confidence. :I deplore the tragic events of last August not only because they revealed human nature in its lowest aspects, but also because they have estranged the two peoples and have made it temporarily more difficult for them to approach one another. But come together they must, in spite of all.Einstein, 2013, pp. 181-2Rosenkranz, 2002, p. 98 Falastin's Centennial \\"Falastin's Centennial\\" was a conference that took place in Amman, Jordan in 2011. Twenty-four local, regional and international researchers and academicians examined Falastin's contribution to the 20th-century Middle East at the two-day conference, which was organised by the Columbia University Middle East Research Centre. The conference highlighted the Jordanian cultural connection to Palestine through various articles that featured Jordanian cities and news. The newspaper's founder Issa El-Issa was a close friend of the Hashemite family, Falastin covered the news of the Hashemites from Sharif Hussein to his sons King Faisal I and King Abdullah I and his grandson King Talal. The paper captured the late King Abdullah's relations with the leaders and people of Palestine, documenting every trip he made to a Palestinian town and every stand he took in support of Palestine and against Zionism. Correspondents of the newspaper in Jordan even interviewed the King in Raghadan Palace.

It is also frequently referred to as the Democratic Front, or al-Jabha al-Dimuqratiyah (). It is a member organization of the Palestine Liberation Organization the Alliance of Palestinian Forces and the Democratic Alliance List. The group maintains a paramilitary wing called the National Resistance Brigades. One of the attacks for which the DFLP is best known is the 1974 Ma'alot massacre in which 25 schoolchildren and teachers were killed. Although the National Resistance Brigades have fighters based in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, these fighters have been engaged in relatively few military operations since the Al- Aqsa Intifada. The National Resistance Brigades continue to take part in training exercises at paramilitary camps near Rafah and Khan Yunis.  History  =Formation as the PDFLP= PDFLP poster, the caption of which reads: \\"Solidarity with the people of the Middle East in their struggle against imperialism, feudalism, Zionism and Arab reaction\\"Liberation Graphics ‚Äì PDFLP poster The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was formed in 1967 by George Habash as a left-wing organization. The PFLP split in 1968, leading to the formation of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP)Abd Rabbo, Yasir, pp. 6-7. Michael R. Fischbach, Encyclopedia of the Palestinians. Infobase Publishing, 2005 headed by Secretary-General Nayef Hawatmeh, who had been referred to as a leader of the PFLP's Maoist tendency. He believed that under George Habash the PFLP had become too focused on military matters, and wanted to make the PDFLP a more grassroots and more ideologically focused organization. Another split in the PFLP in 1968 led to the formation by Ahmad Jibril of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command (PFLP-GC), to focus more on the tactical implementation of armed struggle. In May‚ÄìJune 1969, the Palestinian Revolutionary Left League and the Palestine Popular Liberation Organization merged into PDFLP.Demokratiska Folkfronten f√∂r Palestinas Befrielse, Dokument nr. 1, p. 1 The PDFLP soon gained a reputation as the most intellectual of the Palestinian fedayeen groups, and drew heavily on Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theory to explain the situation in the Middle East. Its other leaders included Yasser Abed Rabbo. = Early years and ideological moderation = The DFLP declared that its goal was to \\"create a people's democratic Palestine, where Arabs and Jews would live without discrimination, a state without classes and national oppression, a state which allows Arabs and Jews to develop their national culture.\\"‚Äò‚ÄôAziya i Afrika segodnya‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì cited in edition ‚Äò‚ÄôV√§lispanoraam 1972‚Äô‚Äô, Tallinn, 1973, lk 129 (‚Äò‚ÄôForeign Panorama 1972‚Äô‚Äô) The PDFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and \\"people's war\\". However, it would soon come around to a more moderate standpoint and while preserving a hard-line attitude to armed struggle, the party began theorizing on various compromise solutions. DFLP was badly hit by the 1970 September crack-down in Jordan. The offices of its Amman-based publication Al-Charar was bombed and burned by Jordanian tanks.Al-Charar resumed publication of July 28, 1971. Demokratiska Folkfronten f√∂r Palestinas Befrielse, Dokument nr. 3, p. 1 From the mid-1970s, the group occupied a political stance midway between Yasser Arafat and the PLO hardliners. The DFLP condemned attacks outside Israel (such as the aircraft hijackings for which the Habash PFLP gained notoriety) and was essential in making the binational state the goal of the PLO in the 1970s, insisting on the need for cooperation between Arabs and Jews. Still, while pioneering Palestinian-Israeli peace talks through making early contact with Jewish and Israeli peace campaigners, including Matzpen, the DFLP simultaneously conducted numerous small bombings and minor assaults against Israeli targets, refusing to give up the armed struggle. The Ma'alot massacre of 1974, an attack on Israeli school in which 27 people were killed, was the group's largest attack. = Between Fatah and the Rejectionists = In 1974, the PDFLP changed its name to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). It was also a strong supporter of the 1974 Ten Point Program, which was accepted by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) after lobbying by Fatah and DFLP, and which cautiously introduced the concept of a two-state solution in the PLO, and led to a split in the organization leading to the formation of the Rejectionist Front, where radical organizations such as the PFLP, PFLP-GC, Palestine Liberation Front and others gathered with the backing of Syria, Libya and Iraq to oppose Arafat and the mainstream PLO stance. In 1974 the DFLP perpetrated a major terror attack in Israel, when attacking a local elementary school in the village of Ma'alot. Taking the school-children as hostages, 22 children aged 14‚Äì16 were killed when an army commando engaged them. In 1978 the DFLP temporarily switched sides and joined the Rejectionist Front after clashing with Arafat on several issues, but it would continue to serve as a mediator in the factional disputes of the PLO. In the tense situation leading up to the 1983 Fatah rebellion, during the Lebanese Civil War, the DFLP offered mediation to prevent the Syrian-backed formation of a rival Fatah leadership under Said al-Muragha (Abu Musa), the Fatah al-Intifada faction. Its efforts ultimately failed, and the PLO became embroiled in what was in effect a Palestinian civil war. = Stagnation in the 1980s = From the early 1980s the DFLP was seen as the most pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese of the PLO member organisations. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the growing Islamist trend in Palestinian society during the 1990s sapped the party of much of its popularity and resources. The Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping also began to reduce the PRC's support for revolutionary struggles abroad throughout this period so as to reduce the damage it caused to trade relations with the West. The DFLP continued to cautiously support Arafat's attempts to open negotiations with Israel, but this was not uncontroversial within the membership. The First Intifada (1987‚Äì93) provoked a shift in Palestinian politics towards the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which proved a severe handicap for the largely diaspora-based DFLP. With the swift rise of Islamism and religious groups such as Hamas in the 1980s, the DFLP faded among the Palestinian youth, and internal confusion over the future path of the organization paralysed political decision-making. = 1991 split = In 1991 the DFLP split, with a minority faction led by Yasser Abd Rabbo (who had become increasingly close to Yasser Arafat) favouring the Madrid negotiations that led initially to limited Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Inspired by the USSR's Glasnost and the fall of the Berlin Wall, this group also favored a new political orientation, focused less on Marxism and armed struggle, and more on the democratisation of Palestinian society. It reconstituted itself as the Palestine Democratic Union (FIDA), and Abed Rabbo was officially made an advisor of Arafat. There were reports of armed clashes between the factions in Syria during the split. Essentially the Damascus- headquartered DFLP under Nayef Hawatmeh was able to retain its external branches, whereas the majority of the organization within Palestine, mainly on the West Bank, was taken over by FIDA. = The Oslo period = The DFLP, under Hawatmeh, joined the rejectionist groups to form the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (APF) to oppose the Declaration of Principles signed in 1993. The group argued that the Oslo negotiations were undemocratic, excluded the PLO from decision-making and deprived the Palestinians of their legitimate rights, but in contrast to most other Alliance members they did not oppose a two-state solution as such. Along with the PFLP, it then broke from the APF over ideological differences, and has made limited moves toward merging with the PFLP since the mid-1990s. In 1999, at a meeting in Cairo, the DFLP and the PFLP agreed to cooperate with the PLO leadership in final status negotiations with Israel. In October 1999, the group was dropped from the United States' list of terror organizations.The ‚ÄúFTO List‚Äù and Congress: Sanctioning Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations The DFLP was subsequently represented in the Palestinian delegation at the unsuccessful Camp David negotiations of July 2000. = Second Intifada (2000‚Äì2005) = The DFLP has been largely unable to make its presence felt during the al-Aqsa Intifada, which began in 2000. The leadership is stationed in Damascus, and most of the DFLP organization on the Occupied Territories unraveled in the FIDA split. Its military capacity has been fading fast since the 1993 cease-fire between the PLO and Israel, which the DFLP respected despite its objections to the Oslo Accords. Since the beginning of the Second Palestinian Intifada the DFLP has carried out a number of shooting attacks against Israeli targets, such as the 25 August 2001 attack on a military base in Gaza that killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded seven others. However, its military capabilities in the Occupied Territories remain limited, and the refocusing on armed struggle during the Intifada has further weakened the organization. On September 11, 2001, an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks in the United States on behalf of the DFLP. This was immediately denied by Nayef Hawatmeh, who strongly condemned the attacks. Although the accusations gained some attention in the days following the attacks, they are now universally regarded as false.  Political influence  The DFLP ran a candidate, Taysir Khalid, in the Palestinian Authority presidential election in 2005. He gained 3.35% of the vote. The party had initially participated in discussions with the PFLP and the Palestinian People's Party on running a joint left-wing candidate, but these were unsuccessful. It won one seat in the 2005 PA municipal elections. In the 2006 elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Front formed a joint list called al-Badeel (The Alternative) with Palestine Democratic Union (FIDA), the Palestinian People's Party and independents. The list was led by the historic DFLP leader Qais Abd al-Karim (Abou Leila). It received 2.8% of the popular vote and won two of the Council's 132 seats. The DFLP retains important influence within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was traditionally the third-largest group within the PLO, after Fatah and the PFLP, and since no new elections have been held to the PNC or the Executive Committee since 1988, the DFLP still commands important sectors within the organization. The PLO's role has admittedly diminished in later years, in favor of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), but it is still the recognized representative of the Palestinian people, and a reactivation of the PLO's constitutional supremacy over the PNA in connection with power struggles in Palestinian society is a distinct possibility.  Organization and leadership  The DFLP held its 5th national general congress during a time-span from February to August 2007. The congress was divided into three parallel circle: West Bank, Gaza strip and the Palestinian exiles. The congress elected a Central Committee, with 81 full members and 21 alternate members. Subsequently, after the closure of the 5th national general congress, the Central Committee re-elected Hawatmeh as Secretary-General of the DFLP. The Central Committee also elected a 13-member political bureau: * Qais Abd al-Karim * Fahed Suleiman * Taysir Khalid * Saleh Zeidan * Ramzi Rabah * Hisham Abu Ghosh * Mamduh Abu Ghosh * Ali Faisal * Abdel-Ghani Hellu * Moutasem Hamadeh * Majida Al-Masri * Mohammad Khalil * Abd al-Hamid Abu Jib * Ibrahim Abu Hijleh  Support base  The DFLP is primarily active among Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, with a smaller presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its Jordan branch has been converted into a separate political party, the Jordanian Democratic People's Party (JDPP or Hashd), and the DFLP is no longer active on the political arena there. The DFLP mainly attracts Palestinians with a more socially liberal and secular lifestyle, as well as Palestinian Christians, primarily in cities like Nablus, and Bethlehem. The party publishes a weekly newspaper in several Arab countries, al-Hurriya (Liberty).  External relations  The DFLP is believed to receive limited financial and military aid from Syria, where it is active in the Palestinian refugee camps. The DFLP's leader, Nayif Hawatmeh lives in Syria. The DFLP is not listed as a terrorist organization by the United States government or the United Nations. It was dropped from the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in 1999, \\"primarily because of the absence of terrorist activity, as defined by relevant law...during the past two years.\\"  See also  * Fatah * Hamas * Palestine Democratic Union (FIDA) * Palestinian Islamic Jihad * Palestinian People‚Äôs Party * Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) * List of political parties in the Palestinian National Authority  References  ;Bibliography * Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1998.

Moreover, she is the recipient of eleven honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and the Arab world. She is married to Emile Ashrawi and has two daughters, Amal and Zeina. Early life Ashrawi was born to Palestinian Christian parents on October 8, 1946 in the city of Nablus, British Mandate for Palestine, now part of the occupied West Bank. Her father, Daoud Mikhail, was a physician and one of the founders of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and her mother Wadi‚Äôa Ass‚Äôad Mikhail, was an ophthalmic nurse. 1948 war and education The Ashrawi family lived in Nablus. Then from Nablus, her family moved to the warm city of Tiberias in the north where they remained until Israel became a state in 1948. In 1948, the Mikhail family fled from Tiberias to Amman, Jordan as a result of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Initially, her father, Daoud Mikhail, remained behind in what became Israel, but later rejoined the family in Jordan. In 1950 her family were able to settle in Ramallah, at the time part of the Jordanian annexed West Bank. Here, she attended the Ramallah Friends Girls School, a Quaker school for girls. She was inspired to activism by her father, who favored a greater role for women in society and was repeatedly imprisoned by the Jordanian authorities for his activities with the Arab Nationalist Socialist Party and the PLO. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in literature in the Department of English at the American University of Beirut (AUB) and got the bachelor and master degree. While a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut she dated Peter Jennings of ABC News who was then stationed there as ABC's Beirut bureau chief.Fenyvesi, Charles (December 30, 1991 / January 6, 1992).

When the Six-Day War broke out in 1967, Dr. Ashrawi, then a 22-year-old student in Lebanon, was declared an absentee by Israel and denied re-entry to the West Bank. For the next six years, Ashrawi traveled and completed her education gaining a Ph.D. in Medieval and Comparative Literature from the University of Virginia. Ashrawi was finally allowed to re-join her family in 1973 under the family reunification plan.Worldtrek Ashwrai Biography Personal life On August 8, 1975, she married Emile Ashrawi,A glimpse into the life of Hanan Ashrawi , Muslimedia: April 1‚Äì15, 1997 a Christian Jerusalemite who is now a photographer and a theater director.Israel ‚Äì Palestina: la paz imposible (in Spanish), Solidarios humanitarian organization web site Together, they have two daughters, Amal and Zeina.Conversation with Hanan Ashrawi, University of California publication Ashrawi is the recipient of eleven honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and the Arab world.

On September 26, 2009, in an interview on Riz Khan's One on One on Al Jazeera English, Ashrawi defined her current role in the following way: \\"I think of myself essentially as a human being with a multidimensional mission. Basically, I am a Palestinian, I am a woman, I am an activist and a humanist, more than being a politician. And at the same time I feel that quite often things are thrust upon us rather than come as a result of a calm and deliberate choice.\\" On 12 October 2020, Ashrawi tested positive for COVID-19. Politics and activism Ashrawi in 2008 While voluntarily a student but denied re-entry to the West Bank, she became the spokesperson for the General Union of Palestinian Students in Lebanon, helped organize women‚Äôs revolutionary groups and served as a guide to foreign reporters visiting Palestinian refugee camps. Ashrawi returned to the West Bank under the family reunification plan in 1973 and established the Department of English at Birzeit University. She served as Chair of that department from 1973 to 1978, and again from 1981 through 1984; and from 1986‚Äì1990 she served the university as Dean of the Faculty of Arts. She remained a faculty member at Birzeit University until 1995, publishing numerous poems, short stories, papers and articles on Palestinian culture, literature, and politics. Ashrawi's political activism in the Palestinian territories began almost as early as her academic career at Birzeit. In 1974, she founded the Birzeit University Legal Aid Committee and Human Rights Action Project. Her political work took a greater leap in 1988 during the First Intifada, when she joined the Intifada Political Committee, serving on its Diplomatic Committee until 1993. From 1991 to 1993 she served as the official spokesperson of the Palestinian Delegation to the Middle East peace process and a member of the Leadership/Guidance Committee and executive committee of the delegation. From 1993 to 1995, with the signing of the Oslo Accords by Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, Palestinian self-rule was established, and Ashrawi headed the Preparatory Committee of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights in Jerusalem. Ashrawi has also served since 1996 as an elected member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Jerusalem Governorate. In 1996, Ashrawi was appointed the Palestinian Authority Minister of Higher Education and Research, but she resigned the post in 1998 in protest against political corruption, specifically Arafat's handling of peace talks. In 1998, Ashrawi founded MIFTAHhttp://www.miftah.org/MACT/MIFTAH_STRATEGY_2017_2021.pdf‚Äîthe Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy, an initiative which works towards respect for Palestinian human rights, democracy and peace. In November 2004, Ashrawi gave a lecture entitled \\"Concept, Context and Process in Peacemaking: The Palestinian-Israeli Experience\\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series. In April 2007, Ashrawi visited the Palestine Center in Washington, DC and gave a lecture entitled, \\"Palestine & Peace: The Challenges Ahead.\\" In July 2011, she represented the Palestinian people in a meeting with the Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird and convinced him to visit the Palestinian territories. In August 2020, Ashrawi lambasted the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, writing on Twitter that \\"Israel got rewarded for not declaring openly what it's been doing to Palestine illegally and persistently since the beginning of the occupation.\\" Sydney Peace prize In 2003 Ashrawi was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize. Her selection drew praise from Mary Robinson (former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and former President of Ireland), and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State also supported the selection and said, \\"She [Ashrawi] is a brilliant spokeswoman for her cause.\\" Her selection was controversial among some Jewish political organisations. Michael Kapel, a member of the board of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council called her \\"an apologist for Islamic terror\\". Activist Antony Loewenstein argued in his book My Israel Question that the Australian media, and various Jewish organizations, defamed and vilified Ashrawi in order to prevent her winning the Peace Prize. Of the controversy, Israeli politician Yael Dayan said, \\"And this Hanan Ashrawi... I think she's very courageous, and she contributes quite a lot to the peace process.\\" Baruch Kimmerling, a sociologist from the Hebrew University, wrote, \\"As an Israeli, as a Jew and as an academic I am deeply sorry and ashamed that members of the Australian Jewish community are acting against this rightful nomination.\\" Works published * Anthology of Palestinian Literature (ed). * The Modern Palestinian Short Story: An Introduction to Practical Criticism * Contemporary Palestinian Literature under Occupation * Contemporary Palestinian Poetry and Fiction * Literary Translation: Theory and Practice * This Side of Peace: A Personal Account () Notes External links   * * Lecture transcript and video of Ashrawi's speech at the Joan B.

Poland was the third most productive region in the world in 1900. But, due to occupations by Nazis, it now has only a small, mostly state-owned component, with production from its Permian Basin in the west, small and very old fields in the Carpathians in the south, and offshore in the Baltic Sea. For natural gas the country is almost completely dependent on legacy pipelines from the former Soviet Union. Shale gas and tight oil Production of significant quantities of natural gas or petroleum from shale or tight (low permeability) reservoirs is in large part dependent on the social acceptance and technical and commercial viability of hydraulic fracturing. As of 2013 only 3% of the Poles opposed fracking. Leasing for shale plays in Poland began in 2007. But, as of 2013, the results of exploration efforts, as well as government regulation, have been disappointing, and estimates of the size of the total resource have been substantially reduced. Data indicates a substantial resource, but the permeability of the rocks, combined with the relative complexity of the faulting in some areas, have made success elusive. In 2013, the Energy Information Administration, a U.S. agency, estimated that 146 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and of tight oil could be economically recovered from the shales in Poland using present technology. However, an estimate published in March 2013 of recoverable shale gas reserves by the Polish Geological Institute was 24.8 trillion cubic feet. It remains to be seen whether the lack of reservoir permeability can be overcome. Poland has been dependent on a Soviet era gas pipeline system which brings in only expensive Russian gas. Power generation has been based on Poland's extensive reserves of coal, principally lignite. Development of a domestic gas industry to replace Russian imports is highly desirable as would the use of gas to retire or convert coal fired generation plants. Drilling for shale resources began in June 2010. But, as of July 2013, none of the wells which have been completed have produced gas in commercial quantities. ConocoPhillips, which purchased the most prospective geological area from Lane Energy Poland, was able to produce gas and oil in sustainable volumes. But, their costs were too high to justify the project. ExxonMobil, which positioned itself in the Lublin Basin, a highly faulted area, could never get a sustainable test, despite spending huge sums on geological research. Chevron also stubbed its toe in the Lublin Basin area, after receiving some bad geological advice. Talisman Energy also failed, and Marathon Oil drilled where there was little/no prospective shale resource. All have pulled out, leaving the Polish Oil and Gas Company as the prime company in the shale gas and tight oil plays. In the absence of regulation acceptable to the drillers who have the technology and resources to engage in extensive exploration, as of 2013, the extent of the tight oil and shale gas resource in Poland remains unknown, although it is believed by some informed observers that it has the potential to supply the needs of Poland for hundreds of year. However, using current technology, it is considered likely that it will be more of a national security mandate than a commercial venture any time soon. Polish firms Baltic Beta In addition to exploration for tight oil and shale gas by international firms there is a small Polish oil and gas industry with some oil and gas production: *Polskie G√≥rnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (PGNiG, literally: Polish Petroleum and Gas Mining) is a Polish state- controlled oil and natural gas company, which deals with the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil, natural gas import, storage and distribution and sales of natural gas and crude oil.

(Exploration and Mining of Petroleum and Gas Deposits Joint stock company \\"Petrobaltic\\") was set up in November 1990. On 1 January 1999, the firm was transformed in limited liability company and the only shareholder become the State Treasury. The company is the only firm in Poland performing exploration and production of crude oil and gas in the Baltic Sea. B3 oil field is currently in production and has a 2006 production of 1.9 million bbl/year. The company has its head office in Gda≈Ñsk. Exploration and exploitation of oil and gas deposits are performed with three drilling platforms: Petrobaltic, Baltic Beta and Jacket-type platform called \\"PG-1\\". =Historical firms= Polmin (English: State Factory of Mineral Oils, Polish: Panstwowa Fabryka Olejow Mineralnych) was a Polish state-owned enterprise, which controlled excavation, transport and distribution of natural gas. Founded in 1909,Encyclopedia of Ukraine, Drohobych it was nationalized in 1927, with main office in Lw√≥w.Carpathian Gas Society, history 1920 - 1939 Polmin operated a large oil refinery in Drohobych, which in late 1930s employed around 3000 people. The refinery purified oil extracted from rich fields of southern part of the Second Polish Republic (Gorlice, Borys≈Çaw, Jas≈Ço, and Drohobych). Some Polish- language sources claim that Polmin refinery in Drohobycz was in late 1930s the biggest in Europe. Oil and gas fields in Poland =Oil fields= *The first oil well was drilled at B√≥brka Field in 1853; it was 7 years after drilling the first oil well in Baku settlement (Bibi-Heybat) in 1846 on Apsheron peninsula. *The B3 oil field is an oil and gas field in the Baltic sea. The field is located 80 km off the Polish coastal town Rozewie. The crude oil is also referred to as Rozewie crude. The API gravity of the crude is 42-43 and sulfur content of 0.12 wt%.

''' Family Rae was born in Meriden, Connecticut on January 31, 1934. Eleanor was the youngest of four children, her parents Stella Sandj and Jon Pracon immigrated to the United States from Poland. Her parents named here after First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with the thought that her family would survive the Great Depression. Eleanor Rae is married to Giles Rae and they together have two daughters, a son, and eight grand children. Education Rae first earned a Mathematics degree from the College of New Rochelle. She received a Master's degree from Southern Connecticut State University in early childhood education and a Masters in parish ministry and adult education from Fordham University. Rae earned her doctoral degree from Fordham in contemporary systematic theology. . Work Life After her youngest child entered school, Rae worked as a day care worker, parent cooperative nursery school director, in church ministries, and a public school teacher. In her most recent position as Director of Office of the Laity for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport CT, she developed an interest in women‚Äôs issues and the environment. After seventeen years her controversial and abrupt dismissal from the Diocese led to her founding of the Centre for Women, the Earth, the Divine (CWED). Eleanor also became increasingly involved in The North American Coalition for Christianity and Ecology (NACCE), one of the early organizations in the United States founded to motivate Christians toward eco-logical action, where she was elected president and served as such for several terms. Major works Rae co-authored the book Created in Her Image: Models of the Feminine Divine. Beginning in 1995, Rae has published a quarterly newsletter Weaving the Connections on various women‚Äôs issues. Created in Her Image: Models of the Feminine Divine (Summary) Eleanor Rae uses her feminist perspective, spirituality, and her social concerns to put forth a book that explains the powers of the feminist divine. The book outlines the role that psychology has played in feminism and how it will also play a role going forward. Women, the Earth, the Divine (Summary) Rae puts together three topics of concern in this 1994 novel. The novel focuses on rediscovering feminine principle that is a not a result of male view. Instead, Rae uses real world experiences from women. She ties together eco feminism with religion and relates them to real world issues. The novel examines western tendencies to ignore women's voices and peoples ability to over look women's capabilities across various subjects. Rae compares the feminine principle with four major religions, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism. Philosophical contributions Rae is considered a staple in eco feminist theology. She has had a focus on women‚Äôs oppression and issues around this subject her entire career. Rae is part of a group of eco feminists that contribute to social in justice and attacks philosophical theories that contribute to injustices. Eco feminism as a whole aims to connect, historically and philosophically, the idea of women‚Äôs oppression and nature‚Äôs exploitation. 'Rae is credited as one of these eco feminists. Present Rae has worked with Amazon river dolphins in Peru and leatherback turtles in Suriname. Accomplishments Rae was awarded the Ursula Lauris citation for her leadership achievements.

It refers to one of the forms of capital invested in production, which contrasts with variable capital (v). The distinction between constant and variable refers to an aspect of the economic role of factors of production in creating a new value. Constant capital includes the outlay of money on (1) fixed assets, i.e. physical plant, machinery, land and buildings, (2) raw materials and ancillary operating expenses (including external services purchased), and (3) certain faux frais of production (incidental expenses). Variable capital, by contrast, refers to the capital outlay on labour costs insofar as they represent workers' earnings, the sum total of wages. The concept of constant vs. variable capital contrasts with that of fixed vs. circulating capital (used not only by Marx but by David Ricardo and other classical economists). The latter distinction corresponds to the very common distinction in economics between fixed inputs (and costs) and variable inputs (and costs). It distinguishes inputs from the point of view of their user (the capitalist), in terms of the degree of flexibility that the user has in using them. On the other hand, constant capital refers to the non-human inputs into production, while variable capital refers to the human input (the hiring of labor power to do labor). Measurement Constant capital can be measured as a stock magnitude, i.e., the total value of means of production in use at a specific point in time. It can also be measured as a flow magnitude, i.e., the total value of raw materials and fixed means of production used up in an accounting period. Which measure is used depends on the purposes and assumptions of one's analysis, for example, whether one is interested in the unit-costs of output or in the rate of return on capital invested. The flow value divided by the stock value provides a measure of the number of rotations of the stock (the speed of turnover or turnover time) in an accounting period. It is strongly related to the actual depreciation rate of fixed capital. Alternatively, the stock value divided by the flow value is what Marx called the \\"turnover time\\". The faster the turnover of constant capital (i.e., the shorter the turnover time), other things being equal, the higher the rate of profit. Why \\"constant\\"? Marx calls the constant part of the capital outlay \\"constant\\" because according to his labour theory of value, constant capital inputs - once produced, purchased, withdrawn from the market and used to create new products - do not by themselves add new value to output, or increase in value in the production process. Instead, the value of equipment and materials being used in production is conserved and transferred to the new product by living labor. For example, if a machine that is used to make cars costs $1 million and it is used to make 10,000 cars before it is worn out and replaced, then each car would have $100 worth of that machine in it (constant capital involves both fixed costs and unit costs). It is true that the ruling market prices for constant capital inputs could change after they have been bought for use in production, but normally this cannot affect those inputs (having been withdrawn from the market for use in production), only the market valuation of the outputs created from those inputs. Variable capital Constant capital contrasts with variable capital, v, the cost incurred in hiring labor power. Marx argues that only living labour creates new value. The higher value of output, compared to input costs, is (other things being equal) attributable to the exploitation of living labor-power only. Variable capital is \\"variable\\" because its value changes (varies) within the production process, as the worker can produce value over and above what he needs to live (the \\"necessary labor time\\"), which is paid in wages. As the worker produces more than he is paid in wages, he thus creates new value. Although most commentaries on Marx do not acknowledge this, these changes could be both positive or negative. A misapplication of labour, or the devaluation of types of labour activity by the market can mean the loss of part of the capital invested, or all of it. However, Marx does generally assume that labour will accomplish the valorisation of capital. An example of variable capital would be as follows: a worker is hired for $100 and uses $1000 of materials and components to create a product which is sold for $1300. This would be $1000 constant capital plus $100 variable capital plus $200 surplus value. The $200 surplus value was added solely by the activity of the worker - of the $1100 investment, only the $100 variable capital expanded. The $1000 constant capital was transferred from the materials and components to the product and thus produced no new value. Criticism Critics of Marxian value theory object that labor is not the only source of value-added goods. Examples of such arguments: * devaluations or revaluations of types of assets in response to changing demand conditions, which are influenced by price inflation. In national accounts and business accounts, for example, the change in the value of inventories held is adjusted for changes in their current market prices, affecting the profit calculation. * Steve KeenDebunking Economics; The Naked Emperor of the Social Sciences, 2004, p. 294 argues that \\"Essentially, Marx reached the result that the means of production cannot generate surplus value by confusing depreciation, or the loss of value by a machine, with value creation\\". His argument is, that a machine can add value to new output in excess of the value of economic depreciation charged. Keen uses an analogy with labor to demonstrate the problem: > If workers receive a subsistence wage, and if the working day exhausts the > capacity to labor, then it could be argued that in a day a worker > ‚Äúdepreciates‚Äù by an amount equivalent to the subsistence wage‚Äîthe exchange- > value of labor power. However this depreciation is not the limit of the > amount of value that can be added by a worker in a day‚Äôs labor‚Äîthe use-value > of labor. Value added is unrelated to and greater than value lost; if it > were not, there could be no surplus. *Keen further argues that Marx speculated that machines could have a use-value greater than their exchange-value, much like labor. Keen argues that though Marx did not develop this point, if it was developed then this would mean that the amount of value a machine loses in depreciation will be less than the value it contributes to output, allowing it to be a source of surplus value alongside labor. *Another argument is that Marx's theory does not account for things such as time. For example, yeast is added to crushed grapes to turn them into wine. No human labor is involved yet the value of the wine is higher than that of the grapes. Another example is that wine gains value as it ages, even though for Marx the aging process shouldn't add value. This would indicate value could arise from sources other than labor.Desai, Meghnad, Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism, 2002, Verso Books, page 264Max Gulker, \\"Coffee and Wine: The subjective theory of value at work\\", American Institute for Economic Research, 30 January 2018Albert Whitaker, \\"History and Criticism of the Labor Theory of Value in English Political Economy\\", Batoche Books, 2001 *It has also been argued that Marx's theory ignores time preference (the common preference for goods and services immediately rather than later). Workers generally prefer to paid when their work is completed rather than when it is sold (which could be much later). For workers to be paid immediately, they must be given wages - thus their service has a value. It is argued that the labor theory of value would \\"have it both ways\\" - workers would receive the full future value of their product before it is actually sold.Donald Ernsberger, Jarret Wollstein, \\"The Labour Theory of Value (an analysis)\\", Liberty International, 12 October 1988 * Critics point out that without the supply of means of production, labour also can produce nothing. That is, separated from means of production, workers are also nothing. Marxist response According to some Marxists, the first two types of objection above cut to the heart of the main dispute between Marx and mainstream economic theory‚Äîtheir different conceptions of value. For Marx's critics, value, if it exists at all, is a technical feature of economic calculus or is simply another word for the price of a product. For Marx, however, economic value is a social attribution, which expresses a social relation between people that is specific to certain historical conditions. Inanimate objects can only feature in value relations as tokens of prior human effort, since they are not social beings. Thus, it is not the machine with which new outputs are produced that itself adds value to those outputs, but rather the people operating the machine who permit its value to be conserved and who operate the transfer of part of its value to the new outputs. Another clarification is that Marx may have used the terms fixed and variable capital to emphasize the idea that the input cost of compensation can be varied by the enterprise, which sets the compensation levels of its workers, whereas the price of the other input factors sold to the company is \\"fixed,\\" insofar as it is set by external vendors. The particular fetish of the money commodity as capital The fact that the productive force of labour appears within capitalism as the productive force of capital was for Marx an example of reification of the relations of production or of commodity fetishism. In other words, property (a \\"thing\\") is given human powers and characteristics which it does not truly have. Economists talk about the \\"productivity of capital\\" to describe the yield or return on capital, but capital itself \\"produces\\" nothing, people do that. The fetish of capital is broken as soon as living labour is withdrawn; then it becomes clear that the constant part of capital produces nothing, and declines in value. Because of its role as a traditional money commodity some individuals give a reference display of this fetish by seeing gold as the only 'real' money, even in the current time when most money is lacking any substantial form whatsoever, even paper. Different capital compositions The ratio, c/v is one measure of the organic composition of capital. As noted above, the distinction between constant and variable capital overlaps with the distinction between fixed capital and circulating capital. Constant capital has both fixed and circulating components: for example, the fixed constant capital would include a factory and the machinery in it, while the circulating constant capital would include the raw materials used and the intermediate inputs produced by the factory. Variable capital is almost exclusively a component of circulating capital. However, the salaries of some \\"overhead\\" employees (who have long-term security from being fired or laid off) are in effect, fixed elements of variable capital.

It is a social relationship based on an asymmetry of power between workers and their employers. When speaking about exploitation, there is a direct affiliation with consumption in social theory and traditionally this would label exploitation as unfairly taking advantage of another person because of their inferior position, giving the exploiter the power.Dowding, Keith (2011). \\"Exploitation\\". Encyclopedia of Power. SAGE Publications. pp. 232‚Äì235. . Karl Marx is considered the most classical and influential theorist of exploitation. In analyzing exploitation, economists are split on the explanation of the exploitation of labour given by Marx and Adam Smith. Smith did not see exploitation as an inherent systematic phenomena in certain economic systems as Marx did, but rather as an optional moral injustice.Horace L. Fairlamb, 'Adam's Smith's Other Hand: A Capitalist Theory of Exploitation', Social Theory and Practice, 1996.  Marxist theory  Marx's exploitation theory is one of the major elements analyzed in Marxian economics and some social theorists consider it to be a cornerstone in Marxist thought. Marx credited the Scottish Enlightenment writers for originally propounding a materialist interpretation of history.Andrew Reeve, Modern Theories of Exploitation\\" In his Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx set principles that were to govern the distribution of welfare under socialism and communism‚Äîthese principles saw distribution to each person according to their work and needs. Exploitation is when these two principles are not met, when the agents are not receiving according to their work or needs.Jon Elster, \\"Exploring Exploitation\\", The Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17 This process of exploitation is a part of the redistribution of labour, occurring during the process of separate agents exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received.John E. Roemer, 'Should Marxists be Interested in Exploitation', Philosophy & Public Affairs, Vol. 14, No. 1, 1985, pg 30-65 The labour put forth toward production is embodied in the goods and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth.John E. Roemer, \\"Origins of Exploitation and Class: Value Theory of Pre-Capitalist Economy\\", Econometrica, Vol. 50, No. 1, 1982, pp. 163-192 This labour performed by a population over a certain time period is equal to the labour embodied to the goods that make up the net national product (NNP). The NNP is then parceled out to the members of the population in some way and this is what creates the two groups, or agents, involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited. The exploiters are the agents able to command goods, with revenue from their wages, that are embodied with more labour than the exploiters themselves have put forth- based on the exploitative social relations of capitalist production. These agents often have class status and ownership of productive assets that aid the optimization of exploitation. The exploiters would typically be the bourgeoisie. Meanwhile, the exploited are those who receive less than the average product he or she produces. If workers receive an amount equivalent to their average product, there is no revenue left over and therefore these workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours and the difference between what is made and what that can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to need.Jon Elster, \\"Exploring Exploitation\\", The Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17 The exploited are the proletariat. = Surplus labour and labour theory of value = Exploiters appropriate another's surplus labour, which is the amount of labour exceeding what is necessary for the reproduction of a worker's labour power and basic living conditions. In other terms, this entails the worker being able to maintain living conditions sufficient to be able to continue work. Marx does not attempt to tie this solely to capitalist institutions as he notes how historically, there are accounts of this appropriation of surplus labour in institutions with forced labour, like those based on slavery and feudal societies. However, the difference he emphasizes is the fact that when this appropriation of surplus labour occurs in societies like capitalist ones, it is occurring in institutions having abolished forced labour and resting on free labour. This comes from Marx's labour theory of value which states that the exchange-value of a commodity is proportional to the socially necessary amount of labour time to produce the commodity. In a capitalist economy, workers are paid according to this value and value is the source of all wealth. Value is determined by a good's particular utility for an actor and if the good results from human activity, it must be understood as a product of concrete labour, qualitatively defined labour. Capitalists are able to purchase labour power from the workers, who can only bring their own labour power in the market. Once capitalists are able to pay the worker less than the value produced by their labour, surplus labour forms and this results in the capitalists' profits. This is what Marx meant by \\"surplus value\\", which he saw as \\"an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital, or of the laborer by the capitalist\\".Marx, Karl. [1867] 1967. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, vol. 1. New York: International Publishers. This profit is used to pay for overhead and personal consumption by the capitalist, but was most importantly used to accelerate growth and thus promote a greater system of exploitation. The degree of exploitation of labour power is dictated by the rate of surplus value as the proportion between surplus value/product and necessary value/product. The surplus value/product is the materialized surplus labour or surplus labour time while the necessary value/product is materialized necessary labour in regard to workers, like the reproduction of the labour power. Marx called the rate of surplus value an \\"exact expression of the degree of exploitation of labour power by capital\\".Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. 1, as translated in J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 233, , which also explains the significance of the difference between this translation of Marx's phrase, and the translation reproduced earlier in this Wikipedia entry, which, Furner argues, is wrong. These theories ultimately demonstrate Marx's main issue with capitalism: it was not that capitalism was not an institution where the labour exchange is coercive, but that in this institution one class still becomes significantly more rich while the other becomes impoverished. = Critique and rejection = Many capitalist critics have pointed out that Marx assumes that capital owners contribute nothing to the process of production. They suggest that Marx should have allowed for two things; namely, permit a fair profit on the risk of capital investment and allow for the efforts of management be paid their due. David Ramsay Steele argues that marginal productivity theory renders Marx's theory of exploitation untenable. According to this theoretical framework and assuming competitive market conditions, a worker's compensation is determined by his or her contribution to marginal output. Similarly, owners of machines and real estate are compensated according to the marginal productivity of their capital's contribution to marginal output. However, Steele notes that this does not in any way touch the ethical argument of socialists who acknowledge non-labour contributions to marginal output, but contend that it is illegitimate for a class of passive owners to receive an unearned income from ownership of capital and land. Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai observed that there is also the prospect of surplus value arising from sources other than labour and a classic given example is winemaking. When grapes are harvested and crushed, labour is used. However, when yeast is added and the grape juice is left to ferment in order to get wine, the value of wine exceeds that of the grapes significantly, yet labour contributes nothing to the extra value. Marx had ignored capital inputs due to placing them all together in constant capital‚Äîtranslating the wear and tear of capital in production in terms of its labour value. Yet examples such as this demonstrated that value and surplus value could come from somewhere other than labour.Desai, Meghnad, Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism, 2002, Verso Books, page 264 The theory has been opposed by Eugen B√∂hm von Bawerk, among others. In History and Critique of Interest Theories (1884), he argues that capitalists do not exploit their workers, as they actually help employees by providing them with an income well in advance of the revenue from the goods they produced, stating: \\"Labor cannot increase its share at the expense of capital\\". In particular, he argues that the theory of exploitation ignores the dimension of time in production. From this criticism, it follows that, according to B√∂hm-Bawerk, the whole value of a product is not produced by the worker, but that labour can only be paid at the present value of any foreseeable output. John Roemer studied and criticized Marx's theory by putting forth a model to deal with exploitation in all modes of production, hoping to lay the foundations for an analysis of the laws of motion of socialism. In his works published in the 1980s, Roemer posits a model of exploitation based upon unequal ownership of human (physical labour skills) and non-human property (land and means of production). He states that this model of property rights has great superiority over the conventional surplus labour model of exploitation, therefore rejecting the labour theory of value. In his attempt to put forward a theory of exploitation that also includes feudal, capitalist and socialist modes of production, he defines exploitation in each of the modes in terms of property rights. Roemer rejects the labour theory of value because he sees that exploitation can exist in the absence of employment relations, like in a subsistence economy, therefore backing the model of exploitation that is based on property rights. He tests his theory of exploitation using game theory to construct contingently feasible alternative states where the exploited agents could improve their welfare by withdrawing with their share of society's alienable and inalienable assets. Feudal, capitalist and socialist exploitation all come from the theory of exploitation on the basis of inequitable distribution of property rights. There has been a range of agreement and disagreement from various economists, neo-classical economists favoring the model the most. Some theorists criticize Roemer for his entire rejection of the labour theory of value and the surplus labour approach to exploitation, for they were the central aspects of Marxist thought in regard to exploitation.Khalid Nadvi, 'Exploitation and Labour Theory Of Value: A Critique of Roemer's Theory of Exploitation and Class', Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 20, No. 25, 1985, 1479-1494 Others criticize his commitment to a specifically liberal as opposed to a Marxist account of the wrongs of exploitation.For example, Allen W. Wood, Karl Marx (Routledge 2004) and Nicolas Vrousalis, 'Exploitation, Vulnerability and Social Domination', Philosophy and Public Affairs, Vol. 41, 2013, 131-157  Other theories  = Liberal theory = Many assume that liberalism intrinsically lacks any adequate theory of exploitation because its phenomenon commits itself only to the primacy of personal rights and liberties and to individual choice as the basic explanatory datum. Hillel Steiner provided an argument to refute the claim that liberalism cannot supply an adequate theory of exploitation.Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', Ethics, Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 225-241 He discusses interpersonal transfers and how there are three types: donation, exchange and theft. Exchange is the only of the three that consists of a voluntary bilateral transfer, where the beneficiary receives something at a value greater than zero on the shared scale of value, although at times there can be ambiguity between more complex types of transfer. He describes the three dimensions of transfers as either unilateral/bilateral, voluntary/involuntary and equal/unequal. Despite these types of transfers being able to distinguish the differences in the four types of transfers, it is not enough to provide a differentiating characterization of exploitation. Unlike theft, an exploitative transfer is bilateral and the items are transferred voluntarily at both unequal and greater-than-zero value. The difference between a benefit and exploitation despite their various shared features is a difference between their counterfactual presuppositions, meaning that in an exploitation there is a voluntary bilateral transfer of unequally valued items because the possessors of both items would voluntarily make the transfer if the items to be transferred were of equal value, but in a benefit the possessor of the higher-value item would not voluntarily make the transfer if the items were at equal value. Put simply, the exploitation can be converted to an exchange: both exploiters and exploited would voluntarily become exchangers when benefactors would not. In an exploitation both transfers are voluntary, but part of one of the two transfers is unnecessary. The circumstances that bring out exploitation are not the same as what brings about exploitative transfers. Exploitative circumstance is due to the factors other than what motivates individuals to engage in nonaltruistic bilateral transfers (exchanges and exploitations) as they are not sufficient circumstances to bring about exploitative transfers. To further explain the occurrence of exploitative circumstances certain generalizations about social relations must be included to supply generalizations about social institutions. He says that 'if (i) certain things are true of the institutions within which interpersonal transfers occur and (ii) at least some of these transfers are nonaltruistic bilateral ones, then at least some of these transfers are exploitative.Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', Ethics, Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 229 Steiner looks at the institutional conditions of exploitation and finds that in general exploitation is considered unjust and to understand why it is necessary to look at the concept of a right, an inviolable domain of practical choice and the way rights are established to form social institutions. Institutional exploitation can be illustrated by schematized forms of exploitation to reach two points: :#Despite the mode of deprivation in exploitation, it is not the same as the mode involved in a violation of rights and it does result from such violations and the two deprivations may be of the same value. :#Rights violation (theft) is a bilateral relation, but exploitation is trilateral one. There are at least three persons needed for exploitation. On a liberal view, exploitation can be described as a quadrilateral relation between four relevantly distinct parties: the state, the exploited, the exploiter and those who suffer rights violations. However, it can be argued that the state's interests with the exploiters action can be viewed as unimpeachable because you cannot imply that the exploiter would ever withhold consent from exploiting due to altruistic concerns. So this trilateral conception of exploitation identifies exploited, exploiters and sufferers of rights violations. In terms of ridding exploitation, the standard liberal view holds that a regime of laissez-faire is a necessary condition. Natural rights thinkers Henry George and Herbert Spencer reject this view and claim that property rights belong to everyone, i.e. that all land to be valid must belong to everyone. Their argument aims to show that traditional liberalism is mistaken in holding that nonintervention in commerce is the key to non exploitation and they argue it is necessary, but not sufficient. The classical liberal Adam Smith described the exploitation of labour by businessmen, who work together to extract as much wealth as possible out of their workers, thusly: > What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract > usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means the > same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as > possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter > in order to lower the wages of labour.Adam Smith. The Wealth of Nations, > Book I, Chapter 8. Marxists Internet Archive. = Neoclassical notions = The majority of neoclassical economists only would view exploitation existing as an abstract deduction of the classic school and of Ricardo's theory of surplus-value. However, in some neoclassical economic theories exploitation is defined by the unequal marginal productivity of workers and wages, such that wages are lower. Exploitation is sometimes viewed to occur when a necessary agent of production receives less wages than its marginal product.J. Schumpter, The theory of economic development, Harvard University Press, 1949 Neoclassical theorists also identify the need for some type of redistribution of income to the poor, disabled, to the farmers and peasants, or whatever socially alienated group from the social welfare function. However, it is not true that neoclassical economists would accept the marginal productivity theory of just income as a general principle like other theorists do when addressing exploitation. The general neoclassical view sees that all factors can be simultaneously rewarded according to their marginal productivity: this means that factors of production should be awarded according to their marginal productivity as well, Euler's theorem for homogeneous function of the first order proves this: :f(K,L)= fK(K,L)K+fL(K,L)L The production function where K is capital and L is labour. Neoclassical theory requires that f be continuously differentiable in both variables and that there are constant returns to scale. If there are constant returns to scale, there will be perfect equilibrium if both capital and labour are rewarded according to their marginal products, exactly exhausting the total product. The primary concept is that there is exploitation towards a factor of production, if it receives less than its marginal product. Exploitation can only occur in imperfect capitalism due to imperfect competition, with the neoclassical notion of productivity wages there is little to no exploitation in the economy.Milan Zafirovski, 'Measuring and Making Sense of Labor Exploitation in Contemporary Society: A Comparative Analysis', Review of Radical Political Economies, 2003, Vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 462-484 This blames monopoly in the product market, monopsony in the labour market and cartellization as the main causes for exploitation of workers.  In developing nations  Developing nations, commonly called Third World countries, are the focus of much debate over the issue of exploitation, particularly in the context of the global economy. Critics of foreign companies allege that firms such as Nike and Gap Inc. resort to child labour and sweatshops in developing nations, paying their workers wages far lower than those that prevail in developed nations (where the products are sold). It is argued that this is insufficient to allow workers to attain the local subsistence standard of living if working hours common in the First World are observed, so that working hours much longer than in the first world are necessary. It is also argued that work conditions in these developing world factories are more unsafe and much more unhealthy than in the First World. For example, observers point to cases where employees were unable to escape factories burning down‚Äîand thus dying‚Äîbecause of locked doors, a common signal that sweatshop conditions exist, similar to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. Others argue that in the absence of compulsion the only way that corporations are able to secure adequate supplies of labour is to offer wages and benefits superior to preexisting options and that the presence of workers in corporate factories indicates that the factories present options which are seen as better‚Äîby the workers themselves‚Äîthan the other options available to them (see principle of revealed preference). A common response is that this is disingenuous as the companies are in fact exploiting people by the terms of unequal human standards (applying lower standards to their Third World workers than to their First World ones). Furthermore, the argument goes that if people choose to work for low wages and in unsafe conditions because it is their only alternative to starvation or scavenging from garbage dumps (the \\"preexisting options\\"), this cannot be seen as any kind of \\"free choice\\" on their part. It also argued that if a company intends to sell its products in the First World, it should pay its workers by First World standards. Following such a view, some in the United States propose that the American government should mandate that businesses in foreign countries adhere to the same labour, environmental, health and safety standards as the United States before they are allowed to trade with businesses in the United States (this has been advocated by Howard Dean, for example). They believe that such standards would improve the quality of life in less developed nations. According to others, this would harm the economies of less developed nations by discouraging the United States from investing in them. Milton Friedman was an economist who thought that such a policy would have that effect. According to this argument, the result of ending perceived exploitation would therefore be the corporation pulling back to its developed nation, leaving their former workers out of a job. Groups who see themselves as fighting against global exploitation also point to secondary effects such as the dumping of government-subsidized corn on developing world markets which forces subsistence farmers off of their lands, sending them into the cities or across borders in order to survive. More generally, some sort of international regulation of transnational corporations is called for, such as the enforcement of the International Labour Organization's labour standards. The fair trade movement seeks to ensure a more equitable treatment of producers and workers, therefore minimizing exploitation of labour forces in developing countries. The exploitation of labour is not limited to the aforementioned large scale corporate outsourcing, but it can also be found within the inherent structure of local markets in developing countries like Kenya.  Wage labour  Wage labour as institutionalized under today's market economic systems has been criticized,. especially by both mainstream socialists and anarcho-syndicalists,.... utilising the pejorative term wage slavery. They regard the trade of labour as a commodity as a form of economic exploitation rooting partially from capitalism. As per Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the Enlightenment era. In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, liberal thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt posited that \\"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\\" and so when the labourer works under external control \\"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is\\". Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.. Additionally, Marxists posit that labour as commodity, which is how they regard wage labour,: \\"[L]abour-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself.\\" provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism. \\"It can be persuasively argued\\", noted one concerned philosopher, \\"that the conception of the worker's labor as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatisation of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it\\".

He is an important adviser to former Qatar emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani and to his successor, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad. =Political career= In 1995, Bishara was at the head of a group of young Israeli Palestinian intellectuals who founded the political party National Democratic Assembly, Brit Le'umit Demokratit in Hebrew, short Balad. In 1996 he was elected to the fourteenth Knesset (first seating 17 June 1996) on the Balad-Hadash list. Bishara was planning to be the first Arab to run for Prime Minister in the 1999 election, but dropped out of the race two days before election day, leaving it as a contest between Ehud Barak and Benyamin Netanyahu, with Barak emerging victorious. In 2003, the Central Elections Committee disqualified Bishara from running in the elections for the 16th Knesset, citing a new clause of the Basic Law: The Knesset which banned candidates who supported \\"armed struggle, by a hostile state or a terrorist organization, against the State of Israel\\", and referencing a speech made by Bishara in Syria where he called on Arab states to support Palestinian resistance. His support for resistance was claimed to be an endorsement for suicide bombings, whilst his request for Arab support was claimed to be an \\"invitation to destroy the state\\".Court lifts election ban on Arab Israelis The Guardian, 9 January 2003 However, the CEC's decision was overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court in a 7‚Äì4 vote. In a later case that confirmed the decision, Supreme Court President Aharon Barak explained the reasoning: \\"[Bishara's] speeches did not contain clear support for an armed struggle of a terrorist organization against the State of Israel, although they did contain support for a terrorist organization.\\" After his election, the Knesset voted to remove Bishra's immunity and the attorney-general filed charges against him for supporting a terror organization. The charges were dismissed by the Supreme Court and his immunity restored. 2006 Israel‚ÄìLebanon War During the 2006 Israel‚ÄìLebanon War Bishara criticized the Israeli government for not providing bomb shelters to Arab areas in Israel's north, and said Israel was using Arabs as \\"human shields\\" by putting artillery units next to Israeli Arab villages towns and villages.Patience, Martin. Israeli Arabs caught in middle, BBC News, Jerusalem; accessed 28 December 2016. Bishara also predicted that, because many Arab Israelis opposed the war or applauded Hezbollah's surprisingly strong resistance to the Israeli invasion, there would be negative repercussions for the community when the war ended. \\"We will have to pick up the bill on this,\\" he said. \\"If [the Israelis] lose, they will turn against us, if they win, they will turn against us.\\" In September 2006, shortly after the conclusion of the Lebanon war, Bishara again visited Syria and in a speech warned of the possibility that Israel might launch \\"a preliminary offensive in more than one place, in a bid to overcome the internal crisis in the country and in an attempt to restore its deterrence capability.\\" Bishara and members of his party also visited Lebanon, where they told the Lebanese prime minister that Hezbollah's resistance to Israel during the preceding summer's war had \\"lifted the spirit of the Arab people\\". Soon thereafter at Interior Minister Roni Bar-On's request, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ordered a criminal investigation against Balad MKs Bishara, Jamal Zahalka and Wasil Taha over the visit to Syria. In 2007, Bishara was questioned by police on suspicion of aiding and passing information to the enemy during wartime, contacts with a foreign agent, and receiving large sums of money transferred from abroad. Bishara denied the accusations and said they were part of an effort to punish him because he had opposed Israel's invasion of Lebanon the preceding summer. Resignation from Knesset On 22 April 2007, Bishara resigned from the Knesset via the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, following a police investigation into his foreign contacts, and accusations of allegedly aiding the enemy during wartime, passing information on to the enemy and contacts with a foreign agent, as well as laundering money received from foreign sources. Bishara denied the allegations, and claimed he was staying abroad as he believed he would not receive a fair trial in Israel. Following a petition by Haaretz and other media outlets to lift a gag order preventing publication of information relating to the specific charges being laid against Bishara, on 2 May 2007 the Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court announced the gag order would be fully lifted. One week prior, the court had allowed only for the fact that Bishara was suspected of assisting the enemy in wartime, transmitting information to the enemy, contact with a foreign agent and money- laundering to be publicized.Gag Order on investigation of ex-MK Bishara to be lifted Wednesday , Haaretz.com, 2 May 2007. Bishara was accused of giving Hezbollah information on strategic locations in Israel that should be attacked with rockets during the 2006 Lebanon War, in exchange for money. Wiretaps were authorized by the Israeli High Court of Justice.

Bishara reportedly served as an adviser to Qatar's then emir and crown prince, who succeeded his father in late June 2013. In July 2011, Bishara reportedly said that Assad could have stayed in power had he made the reforms people wanted, writing: \\"The regime chose not to change, and so the people will change it.\\" =Personal life= Bishara is married and has two children. According to The Jerusalem Post, he received a kidney transplant in March 1997 at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. According to his website, he is a citizen of Qatar.

ConQAT is based on a pipes and filters architecture that enables flexible complex analysis configurations using a graphical configuration language. This architecture differs from other analysis tools that usually have a fixed data model and hard-wired analysis logics. A ConQAT analysis block that has been created using the graphical configuration language. Architecture ConQAT's underlying pipes and filters architecture manifests in its analysis configuration, so called ConQAT-blocks. These blocks contain a network of ConQAT processors or additional blocks. This allows configuring analyses that can be adapted to the context of the system to be analyzed with a high degree of flexibility. For example, different kinds of source code (manual written code, generated code, test code) could be treated in different ways. Furthermore, this architecture enables the reuse of blocks and processors in different contexts. For example, graph metrics can be calculated using the same blocks for dependency or control-flow graph of a program or a revision graph from a version management system. Functionality ConQAT analyses are usually executed on a command line in batch mode. Beside the application in software quality audits it is also often used integrated into a nightly build of a system. ConQAT implements processors (so called Scopes) to read data from different sources, such as source code or binary code files as well as from issue trackers or version management systems. For languages such as Java, C#, C/C++, and ABAP, Lexer processors and other preprocessing operations are available. ConQAT implements algorithms for detecting redundancy and architecture analysis in processors/blocks. Furthermore, it integrates established tools, like FindBugs, FxCop etc. using processors that read their output formats. Although ConQAT supports different output formats (e.g. XML), usually generated HTML files are used to present the analysis results. Visualizations include various diagrams and treemaps. Background ConQAT was developed in 2007 at the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen and has received acclaim due to several scientific publications on its architecture as well as analysis techniques for detecting redundancy (clone detection) or architecture conformance analyses.Flexible Architecture Conformance Assessment with ConQAT.

William Bond after George Francis Joseph He was a treasury secretary of obscure origin, characterized by extraordinary diligence, efficiency, persistence, and deep conservatism.Andrew Connell, \\"‚ÄòThe potent spirit of the black‚Äêbrowed Jacko‚Äô: new light on the impact of John R obinson on high politics in the era of the American Revolution, 1770‚Äì84.\\" Historical Research 86.232 (2013): 292-312. Life Born on 15 July 1727, and baptised at St. Lawrence, Appleby, Westmorland, on 14 August 1727, he was the eldest son of Charles Robinson, an Appleby tradesman, who died on 19 June 1760, in his fifty-eighth year, having married, at Kirkby Thore on 19 May 1726, Hannah, daughter of Richard Deane of Appleby. He was educated until 17 at Appleby grammar school, and was then articled to his aunt's husband, Richard Wordsworth, of Sockbridge in Barton, Westmorland, clerk of the peace for the county, and grandfather of the poet William Wordsworth. He was admitted as attorney, practised law in Appleby, and became town clerk on 1 October 1750; he was mayor in 1761. On 2 February 1759 he entered Gray's Inn. Robinson acquired property and local influence, by marriage and inheritance, and Sir James Lowther made him his principal law agent and land steward. He was created a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant of Westmorland in 1762, and through the influence of Lowther was returned as Member of Parliament for Westmorland on 5 January 1764, continuing to represent it until the dissolution in September 1774. In 1765 Robinson rebuilt the White House, Appleby, and entertained Lord North the prime minister there. He was created secretary of the treasury by North on 6 February 1770. A quarrel with Lowther blew up in early 1773, over local patronage;historyofparliamentonline.org, Robinson, John (1727‚Äì1802), of Isleworth, Mdx. it saw a challenge to a duel, which Robinson turned down. Robinson resigned the post of law agent to the Lowther estates, and was succeeded in it by his first cousin, John Wordsworth, the poet's father. Robinson held the secretaryship of the treasury until 1782. He found another seat in parliament, the safe government borough of Harwich, which he represented from October 1774 until his death. In 1780 he was also returned for Seaford, but preferred his old constituency. While in office he was the chief ministerial agent in carrying on the business of parliament, and he was the medium of communication between the ministry and its supporters. The whig satires of the day, such as the Rolliad and the Probationary Odes regularly attacked him, as did Junius and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, when attacking bribery: those whom he seduced from the opposition were known as \\"Robinson's rats\\". He brought, on 3 July 1777 an action against Henry Sampson Woodfall, printer of the Public Advertiser for libel, in accusing him of sharing in government contracts, and obtained a verdict of forty shillings and costs. Robinson declined to back the Fox‚ÄìNorth Coalition. On his retirement from the post of secretary of the treasury, he came into a pension of ¬£1,000 a year. After their quarrel Robinson offered his estates in Westmorland (including burgage tenures in Appleby) to Lowther, who didn't want them, and sold nearly the whole property for ¬£29,000 to Sackville Tufton, 8th Earl of Thanet, who thus acquired an interest in the parliamentary representation. About 1778 Robinson purchased a property in Middlesex from Peter William Baker, Wyke Manor at Syon Hill, Isleworth, between Brentford and Osterley Park. There he modernised what became Wyke House, and added a dining room by Robert Adam (1778‚Äì79). The rest of the house was rebuilt shortly afterwards. Robinson was created a D.C.L. of Oxford on 9 July 1773; he declined a peerage in 1784, but in December 1787 William Pitt the Younger appointed him surveyor-general of woods and forests. A favourite of George III, he planted at Windsor millions of acorns and 20,000 oak trees. In 1794 he printed a letter to Sir John Sinclair, chairman of the Board of Agriculture, on enclosures. Death Robinson had a paralytic stroke in 1782, and he died of apoplexy at Harwich, on 23 December 1802. He was buried at Isleworth on 2 January 1803. Family In 1759 Robinson married Mary Crowe, said to have been daughter of Nathaniel Crowe, a wealthy merchant and planter in Barbados, obtaining with her a fortune. He also inherited from his grandfather, John Robinson, alderman of Appleby 1703‚Äì46, property in the county, and eighteen burgage tenures, carrying votes for the borough, in Appleby. His wife died at Wyke House on 8 June 1805, aged 71, and was buried at Isleworth on 5 June. Their only child Mary Robinson was baptised at St. Lawrence Church, Appleby, on 24 March 1759, and married, at Isleworth on 3 October 1781, the Hon. Henry Neville. She died of consumption at Hotwells, Bristol, on 26 October 1796, and was buried in Isleworth churchyard, where a monument was erected to her memory. Her home was at Wyke House, and all her children were born there. Legacy By his will Robinson left legacies to Captain John Wordsworth and Richard Wordsworth of Staple Inn, London. His means were comparatively small. After his death his accounts were called for, and it was some time before they were passed, and the embargo placed by the crown on the transfer of his Isleworth property to George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey removed. Robinson was benefactor to Isleworth, Appleby, and Harwich, leaving books to the grammar schools in the last two towns. Robinson's correspondence and official papers, including many communications from George III, went to the Marquis of Abergavenny at Eridge Castle. The substance of part of them was described in the 10th Report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission. Excerpts from the whole collections were edited by Benjamin Franklin Stevens for the Royal Historical Society. Wyke House in the 19th century became a school, run by Alexander Jamieson, and then a private lunatic asylum.The 1832 Madhouse Act and the Metropolitan Commission in Lunacy from 1832. One of the proprietors was William Birmingham Costello; later physicians there were John Stevenson Bushnan and then Robert Gardiner Hill. Hill parted company with his partner Edmund Sparke Willett in 1860; Willett was listed as proprietor in 1874.Lyttleton Forbes Winslow, Manual of Lunacy; a handbook relating to the legal care and treatment of the insane in the public and private asylums of Great Britain, Ireland, United States of America, and the Continent (1874), p. 78; archive.org. It was still in use as a mental hospital in 1958. In 1970 it was being used for mental health rehabilitation, and was Grade II listed.

Established in Mogadishu, Somalia in January 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies (HIPS) has begun writing reports and policy papers to advise the nascent Somali government, international organizations, and other local actors. In its first six months, HIPS has provided commentary and guidance on topics as diverse as educational opportunities in Somalia, displaced nationals, and domestic diplomatic initiatives in Kismayo and the self-declared state of Somaliland. Notable speakers include Asha Haji Elmi, Mohamed Nur \\"Tarzan\\" and Mohamed Ali Ameriko. As part of its mission, the Heritage Institute will also promote a culture of learning and research in Somalia. It aims to do so by launching a series of public libraries across the country, organizing summer book fairs and offering research courses and fellowships to postgraduate students and aspiring researchers. In 2013, the UN Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group alleged in a report that the Heritage Institute and its Director Abdi Aynte were complicit in financial mismanagement by Somali government officials.

A firm \\"believ[er] in public universities as public goods\\", known for \\"cheerful contempt of the private schools and their ways\\", she spent the bulk of her career in public education, working first in the Detroit school system, then the University of Michigan, and finally at Berkeley, where she taught until her retirement. Middleton was known as \\"a titanic figure in Middle English literary studies\\". Her work on Chaucer, especially \\"The Clerk's Tale\\", is praised by scholars for its contribution to the understanding of Chaucer and Chaucer's audience. Some of her essays are collected in a 2013 collection edited by Steven Justice and published by Ashgate, Chaucer, Langland, and Fourteenth-Century Literary History; in the same year, Ohio State University Press published an edited collection, Answerable Style, whose contributions take Middleton's work as a \\"touchstone\\".

It may also include literature authored in Portuguese by German-speaking colonialists and settlers of Brazil. This includes literature written by descendants of Germany, Austria and the German-speaking part of Switzerland. In Portuguese it is known as literatura teuto-brasileira, and in German as deutschbrasilianische Literatur. Luso-Germanic books may be printed either in Latin script or in Fraktur. Luso-Germanic works are generally composed in Standard German; however, it is not unusual for Brazilian Portuguese words to also be used. German Immigration to Brazil The first German immigrants to settle in Brazil were 165 families who settled in Ilh√©us, Bahia, in 1818. One year later, 200 families settled S√£o Jorge, in the same state. Some Germans were brought to work in the Brazilian army after Independence from Portugal in 1822.Ancestry.com \\"Projeto Imigra√ß√£o Alem√£\\" However, the cradle of the German settlement in Brazil was S√£o Leopoldo, in 1824. At that time Southern Brazil had a very low population density. Most of its inhabitants were concentrated on the coast and a few in the Pampas. The interior was covered by forests and populated by Indians. This lack of population was a problem, because Southern Brazil could easily be invaded by neighboring countries.Since Brazil was recently independent from Portugal, it was not possible to bring Portuguese immigrants. Germany was suffering the effects of the wars against Napoleon, overpopulation and poverty in the countryside. Many Germans were willing to immigrate to Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil's Empress, Maria Leopoldina, was Austrian and encouraged the arrival of German immigrants. Luso-Germanic literature displays a strong sense of German nationalism. Poetry, short-stories and letters write of German heritage, German language and the desire and longing to preserve their German culture in the new Brazilian environment. It aims to construct a cultural identity, combining German patriotism with the realities of colonial life in Brazil. The literature alerts individuals to cultural realities of Luso-Germanic life in the 19th century. This literature thrived until 1939 when the Nationalization Campaign of Getulio Vargas' Estado Novo prohibited the publication of texts written in foreign languages,Seyferth, Giralda. \\"A Id√©ia de Cultura Teuto- brasileira: Literatura, Identidade e Os Significados da Etnicidade.\\" Horizontes Antropol√≥gicos. 10:22.

Gothic in style, it has remained largely unaltered since the 14th century. It lies in the Diocese of Visby. History View of the interior The presently visible, Gothic church is probably the successor of two earlier churches, the first a stave church or at least a wooden church, which was later replaced by a Romanesque stone church. Rebuilding of the church into its present form was carried out between the early 13th and mid-14th centuries. The church may originally have been built to serve a large farmstead. Since its completion during the 14th century, the church has remained largely unaltered. Architecture The church has a tall and slender western toward which contains a single bell, built by the Gothic builder workshop known by its notname Egypticus, which was active on Gotland during the time period 1330-1380.Roosval, Johnny (1911) Die Kirchen Gotlands, ein Beitrag zur mittelalterlichen Kunstgeschichte Schwedens (Leipzig : E.A. Seeman) The nave is divided into two by a single column, and the choir ends in an apse. During a restoration in the 1950s, medieval murals were uncovered. They now again completely dominate the interior of the church. They are partly designed as imitations of drapery and tapestries, and partly depict biblical scenes and other figures (including knights and footmen fighting). They date from c. 1300 and were probably executed by an anonymous German artist. The church also incorporates a choir bench from the first half of the 14th century and a church bell from 1374; otherwise, most of the furniture is later, Baroque in style. Close to the church are the relatively well-preserved ruins of a defensive tower dating from the 12th century, built as a place for protection for the congregation during times of war or danger.

An interdisciplinary research lab, Woods encompasses senior fellows and affiliated faculty as well as researchers, postdoctoral scholars and students collaborating on sustainability research. It supports research in seven areas: climate, ecosystem services and conservation biology, food security, freshwater, oceans, public health, and sustainable development. It provides seed funding for environmental research and supports seven research centers, programs and workshops.  History  In the mid-1990s, a committee chaired by former Stanford president Donald Kennedy was appointed by provost Condoleezza Rice to evaluate environmental research. In 2000, its report proposed a coherent program to coordinate major efforts. As a result, president John L. Hennessy in 2003 announced a campus-wide initiative on the environment and sustainability. The following year he created the institute to serve as the initiative‚Äôs centerpiece and focal point. Envisioned as a hub for environmental researchers, the Institute brought together experts from the university‚Äôs seven schools to pursue interdisciplinary, research addressing complex environmental challenges while preparing the next generation of environmental leaders. The community grew to more than 150 fellows, affiliated scholars and researchers. In 2006 the Institute was formally renamed for Stanford trustee Ward W. Woods, (a 1964 graduate), and his wife, Priscilla, who made a $30 million contribution.  Environmental venture projects Every year since 2004, the institute chooses several high-risk projects to fund. Each environmental venture project (EVP) receives up to $100,000 per year for one to two years. Each project must: *Involve interdisciplinary collaboration among Stanford faculty members who have never worked together *Be focused on challenges relating to the environment and/or one of Woods‚Äô seven focal areas (climate, ecosystem services and conservation biology, food security, freshwater, oceans, public health, and sustainable development) *Seek advancement in complex, cross-cutting issues such as environmental ethics, incentive systems, risk perception, and analysis and valuation of natural systems Woods awarded $8.5 million to more than 50 projects in 24 countries through 2013, and recipients have also received $39 million in follow-on grants from outside sources. EVP projects include: * Low-cost mobile toilets: Stanford researchers developed a project called Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods (SOIL), aimed at producing portable, low-cost toilets to help improve sanitation conditions in parts of Haiti with no sewers or running water while also improving the quality of agriculture land. * Biodegradable plastic: Another team used its EVP to develop a wood substitute made from hemp fibers and a biodegradable plastic resin called polyhydroxybutyrate. This wood-and-plastic substitute has the potential to save trees, reduce greenhouse gases and shrink landfills. * Pumping water with sunlight: a team led by professor Rosamond Naylor monitored a solar-powered drip-irrigation system put in place in two rural villages in northern Benin by Solar Electric Light Fund. As a result of these solar irrigation pumps, incomes in the two villages shot up, as did nutrition levels. Research sponsored by Woods led to innovations including solar energy pumps used to water crops in the developing world, new technology that removes pathogens from wastewater and the introduction of government policies for drinking water access in sub-Saharan Africa.  Other programs  The Woods Institute is also involved in educational and leadership programs, such as: * The Leopold Leadership Program which trains academic researchers to take new approaches to learning, as well as to effectively communicate their work to businesses, political leaders and students. It was created in 1998 (named for Aldo Leopold) and moved to the Woods Institute in 2005. * Mel Lane Student Grants: These are grants of between $500 and $3,000 awarded to Stanford students to work on environmental projects in addition to their required coursework. * Rising Environmental Leaders Program, a one-week training camp that takes place in Washington, D.C. Participants learn about policy development, partnership building and public service careers. * Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR), which provides a stipend to Stanford undergraduate students conducting interdisciplinary research who are also enrolled part or full-time in summer school. Students need to work closely with a faculty member who is willing to apply on their behalf. * Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowships (SIGF), competitive awards for a three-year Stanford fellowship. It is given to doctoral students who work on interdisciplinary research involving the humanities, the natural world and social sciences. * Young Environmental Scholars (YES) conference, organized by Stanford postgraduate students and postdoctoral scholars aimed at bringing environmental researchers from all seven schools together to create a dialogue about environmental policy, behavior and norms research. * Stanford students accepted into the Goldman Honors Program must study environmental science, technology and policy, with a concentration in one of these disciplines. During their senior year, the students create and implement a project that addresses an environmental challenge.

These organisations were intended to care for sick people and were a consequence of the rapid population growth, expansion in area and public health issues experienced by the city as it industrialised. The Manchester Infirmary (MR) medical charity ‚Äì then based in Piccadilly, Manchester ‚Äî was struggling to cope with the rapid expansion of the city of Manchester by the early 1800s. The population was increasing significantly and was spreading widely into new industrial and residential suburbs, making it impractical for the hospital to expand its system of home visits for the care and treatment of patients. There was a proposal that branches should be established in outlying areas but, instead, those areas acquired independent facilities. Chorlton Dispensary Chorlton-on-Medlock town hall The first of these new Dispensaries opened in the township of Chorlton Row (now Chorlton-on-Medlock) around 1825, probably as a reaction to an epidemic of fever in that area at the time and with knowledge of a scheme that had been established in Blackburn one year earlier. There had been an appeal to the MR for help but it was unable to do so, for reasons relating to its own financial priorities and also staffing levels. Thus, the Chorlton Select Vestry, comprising all the major ratepayers of the area and responsible for the administration of the Poor Law, provided money to enable care for paupers who needed medical assistance. Funds were also provided by subscribers in return for their having the right to refer non-paupers to the institution. The Chorlton Dispensary was based in the newly constructed town hall from about 1832 and its first president was Hugh Hornby Birley (1778-1845), a significant owner of textile mills in the area. Salford and Pendleton Dispensary The MR was unwilling to expand in 1827, when proposals for branches in Ancoats and Salford were raised. The independent Salford and Pendleton Dispensary was formed soon after under the presidency of a would-be Tory politician, and later High Sheriff of Lancashire, William Garnett (d. 1863). Construction of a building commenced in 1830 with the intent that it would house a small number of beds for inpatients as well as serving as a base for the Dispensary. Financial constraints caused a delay in the provision of the inpatient facilities, which did not appear until 1845. Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary The Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary In 1828, the Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary was established as a separate institution from the MR and at least in part upon the recommendation of that body. While many of the wealthy people of Salford lived within the bounds of that borough, the people of Ancoats created much wealth but saw little of it because the people who owned the businesses generally lived elsewhere. Its first president was another significant owner of local mills, George Murray. Others Few establishments during the 20 or so years subsequent to that of Ancoats survived for long. A small and little-documented Dispensary opened at Hulme, near Chorlton, in the early 1830s. In addition, various specialist bodies were formed, such a maternity charity in Chorlton and another that concerned itself with skin diseases, but few of these survived for long. An exception was the Dispensary for Children, established in 1829. that eventually became a significant children's hospital.

MacCreagh was the son of Scottish parents, possibly born in Perth, Indiana in 1889 while his father, an anthropologist, was visiting the United States to study Native Americans. Michael J. Lannoo, This Land Is Your Land: The Story of Field Biology in America. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2018. (pp. 238-9). However, according to MacCreagh's biography - Indiana MacCreagh () by Roderick Heather, it is much more likely that he was born and educated in Scotland and later studied in Paris and Germany. Mistakenly believing he had killed a fellow student in a German sabre duel, he fled to Southeast Asia, where he lived for several years. MacCreagh worked in Calcutta, Darjeeling, the Malay Islands, Tibet, China and Burma, where he collected animal specimens. He then travelled to Africa where he captured wild animals for British and US zoos. MacCreagh arrived in New York in 1911, where he later began to write fiction. He wrote several short adventure stories for magazines such as Argosy, Adventure and Short Stories.Robinson, Frank M. & Davidson, Lawrence. Pulp Culture - The Art of Fiction Magazines. Collectors Press Inc 2007 (p.39). He travelled in South America on the Mulford Expedition. His book White Waters and Black published 1926 is an account of the expedition. He also travelled to Abyssinia with his wife in 1927, on an expedition to locate the Ark of the Covenant. His account was serialised in Adventure and published as a book The Last of Free Africa. After the book's publication, MacCreagh was made a \\"Knight of the Empire\\" by Emperor Haile Selassie. He revisited Ethiopia several times and came a friend of Haile Selassie. MacCreagh served as a US Navy pilot in World War I and volunteered for special service for the US and British armed forces in World War II. It is possible that MacCreagh was the inspiration for the fictional character of Indiana Jones. MacCreagh died in Florida in 1953 of abdominal cancer.

Next to him are Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, November 1952 :For the Jordanian politician, see Suleiman Hafez Sulayman Hafez was an Egyptian lawyer and politician. Hafez drafted the abdication letter of King Farouk and negotiated his stepping down following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.Kandil, p. 27. In early 1953, following the revolution, Hafez was selected by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) to serve as both Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister in the government of Prime Minister Muhammad Naguib, the senior officer who took part in the overthrow of King Farouk. He handpicked all but two of the ministers in the cabinet and his relatively young appointees consisted of technocrats, members of the youth wing of the Nationalist Party of Fathi Radwan and two associates of the Muslim Brotherhood.Gordon, pp. 67-68. Hafez became one of the chief antagonist against the Wafd Party in Egypt following the revolution. He sought to have Mustafa el-Nahhas ousted as the party's president, penning a letter on behalf of the revolutionary officers that described el-Nahhas as a \\"tumour in the body politic.\\" At the time, there were sharp internal divisions within the party, with the young guard seeking to show more flexibility towards the officers and viewing the old guard, represented by el-Nahhas, as being out of touch. El-Nahhas had refused to negotiate the party's renewal of license with President Naguib as long as party veteran Fouad Serageddin remained imprisoned. However, he eventually relented after significant defections from the party and submitted the application to Hafez's interior ministry.Gordon, p. 73. Hafez, a major legal figure prior the revolution, was among the law-based civilian allies of Naguib, which also included Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri. Naguib's appointment of Hafez to the interior ministry, which was responsible for domestic security among other tasks, was seen by later historians as weakening his hand. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the officer who led the revolution, managed to take advantage of the appointment by easily managing to appoint himself to both of Hafez's positions in June 1953, amid the growing rivalry between Nasser and Naguib. Hafez then became the official legal adviser Naguib.Kandil, p. 39. While Naguib drew on constitutional lawyers and the leaders of pre-revolutionary political parties, Nasser surrounded himself with his fellow officers. Hafez resigned from his advisory position on 27 March 1954 as tensions between Nasser and Naguib escalated.

The Department of Energy and Congress would then have the option of stopping or altering what the EPA proposed to do. According to a report about the bill from the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the bill \\"provides for greater checks and balances over EPA's rulemaking activity by requiring, before the agency finalizes new energy- related rules estimated to cost more than $1 billion, that the agency submit a report to Congress providing information detailing certain cost, benefit, energy price, and job impacts, and also that the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other relevant agencies, conduct a review of the energy price, reliability, and other energy-related impacts, and make a determination about whether the rule will cause significant adverse effects to the economy.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background According to the committee report, \\"since 2009, EPA has proposed or finalized thousands of pages of new regulations imposing billions of dollars cumulatively in new compliance costs across the economy. These regulations include new rules that affect the production, supply, distribution, or use of energy and may impose annual compliance costs that continue over a period of years or even of decades.\\" This bill was written as a reaction to this situation. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 would require the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), before promulgating a final rule that regulates any aspect of the production, supply, distribution, or use of energy (or that provides for such regulation by state or local governments) and that is estimated by the Administrator or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to impose aggregate costs of more than $1 billion, to submit a report that contains: (1) an estimate of the total costs of the rule, (2) an estimate of the increases in energy prices that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule, and (3) a detailed description of the employment effects that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule. The bill would also require the United States Department of Energy (DOE): (1) to prepare an independent analysis to determine whether such rule will cause any increase in energy prices for consumers, any impact on fuel diversity of the nation's electricity generation portfolio or on electric reliability, or any other adverse effect on energy supply, distribution, or use; and (2) upon making such a determination, to determine whether such increase, impact, or effect will cause significant adverse effects to the economy and publish such determination in the Federal Register. Most significantly, the bill would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating any such final rule if the Department of Energy determines that such rule will cause significant adverse effects to the economy. Congressional Budget office report The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 would require that before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalizes any energy-related rule with an estimated regulatory cost of more than $1 billion, including indirect costs, EPA must submit a report to the United States Congress detailing the rule‚Äôs potential costs and other impacts on jobs and gasoline prices. The legislation also would require the Department of Energy (DOE), in consultation with other agencies, to prepare an independent analysis of those rules to determine if they would adversely affect the economy. EPA would be prohibited from finalizing any rule that DOE determines would have significant adverse effects to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1582 would cost $35 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting H.R. 1582 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The CBO‚Äôs estimate is based on information from EPA about the anticipated number of energy-related rules that would be subject to the requirements under this bill over the next five years. The CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1582 would not have a significant impact on spending by EPA because most of the analysis that it would need to complete under H.R. 1582 will already be conducted to meet similar reporting requirements under existing Executive Orders. The CBO estimates, however, that the DOE would need additional appropriations of about $7 million annually to meet new and expanded reporting requirements under H.R. 1582. Those costs would cover staff and support costs for about five studies per year that would be similar in scope to recent DOE analyses of proposed energy legislation. That estimate is based on information from the Energy Information Administration, the organization within DOE that would be responsible for completing the analyses and reports. H.R. 1582 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 was introduced in the House by Rep. Bill Cassidy (R, LA-6) on April 16, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. The Subcommittee held Consideration and Mark-up Sessions on July 10 and July 11, 2013, before forwarding the bill to the full Committee. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held Consideration and Mark-up Sessions on July 16, and July 17, 2013. The bill was ordered reported (amended) by a vote of 25-18. It was accompanied by House Report 113-164. On Friday, July 19, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 1582 would be on the schedule for the week of Monday, July 22, 2013. Debate and discussion Supporters of the bill see it as a way to limit the power the EPA has to enact regulations that would hurt the economy. Opponents of the bill, writing in its committee report, argued that bill gives the Secretary of Energy too much power to veto EPA rules and duplicates an existing regulatory review process that is already being used. Critics also argued that the bill would be used to prevent important environmental regulations.

As a result, the abbreviation \\"k.k.\\" (for kaiserlich √∂sterreichisch, k√∂niglich b√∂hmisch or \\"Imperial Austrian, Royal Bohemian\\") was used and not \\"k.u.k.\\" (\\"Imperial and Royal\\") which would have implied a connexion with the Hungarian half of the Empire. Proposed in a memorandum by Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, in February 1906 the War Ministry in Vienna convened a session on Alpine border security. Field Marshal Tunk, agreed with him and put forward a concept, the fundamentals of which were then carried out. The existing state rifle regiments were to be trained as mountain troops and, together with the Landsturm border patrol companies and gendarmerie departments were to form the backbone of a territorial defence force with local knowledge on the border of Tyrol. The Commander-in-Chief from 1916, Emperor Charles I  Formation and deployment on 1 Aug 1914  On 1 May 1906 the two state rifle regiments with their HQs stationed in Bozen and Trient (now Bolzano and Trento, both in Italy) and the 4th Landwehr Infantry (Klagenfurt) were nominated as \\"high mountain troops\\" (Hochgebirgstruppe) and, in 1909, a third state rifle regiment, with its HQ stationed in Candido, was added. In 1911, the fifth regiment followed: the 27th Imperial-Royal Landwehr Infantry (Laibach).The Landwehr infantry regiments bore the location of their HQ as part of their name The area of the Carnic ridge in Carinthia and the Julian Alps was assigned to the 4th Landwehr Infantry (Klagenfurt) and the 27th Landwehr Infantry (Ljubljana). These two, hitherto standard infantry regiments were given the new uniform of the mountain troops. From 11 April 1917 they bore the names 1st and 2nd Mountain Rifles. 1st Imperial-Royal State Rifles (Trient) (k.k. Landessch√ºtzenregiment \\"Trient\\" Nr.

The winter stations were naturally located in the valleys, but this did prevent there being a comprehensive programme of winter exercises, alpine skiing course and skiing training in the mountains.  Dress and equipment  In 1907, the gamecock spray of white and black feathers that had been worn on the cap until 1887 by the state rifles was re-introduced. Together with the edelweiss on the collar, it formed the badge of the Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops. Otherwise the uniform was the same as that of the J√§ger infantry. What was new was the pike gray mountain dress: mountain boots, mountain socks, britches, heavy jacket, cap, coat, cape. Officers continued to wear their previous Landwehr uniform as individual (i.e. not in squads) on parade. Officers' cap badge after 1916 State rifleman in mountain dress after 1908 Battalions and companies were given pack animals. The rifle was replaced by the (shorter) 8mm Mannlicher M 95 carbine. They were issued with additional equipment adapted to the requirements of mountain warfare; including skis, ropes, crampons and ice axes. Regiments were reinforced by a mountain machine gun section of four machine guns which, to improve mobility, could be carried by pack animals or in manportable packs at the highest altitudes. The same applied to the take- apart mountain guns. Portable field stoves (Schwarm√∂fen) and heated tents assisted troops to operate in inhospitable conditions. When skiing the two- stick approach had replaced the single-stick method. The Bilgeri binding was a touring binding that could be used with the normal hiking boot. *Extract from the pamphlet \\"Mountain Warfare in Winter\\" (Gebirgskrieg im Winter) : Produced by the k.u.k.

Spelman is a philosopher in the United States. She is currently a professor at Smith College. She is a Barbara Richmond 1940 Professor in the Humanities. Due to this position she currently resides in Northampton, Massachusetts. Studies Her studies focus on four aspects: critical race feminism, emotions being shaped, repair activities of humans, and humans as waste makers. Critical race theory is \\"a critical examination of society and culture, to the intersection of race, law, and power\\". However, Spelman's interpretation of this theory also involves women. She expresses her thoughts about the subject in her book titled Inessential Woman: Problems of Exclusion in Feminist Thought. This book focuses on her studies of race and gender together. Her book titled Fruits of Sorrow: Framing our Attention to Suffering, focuses on her studies of human emotions. She believes politics and interactions between humans cannot be separated from our emotions. They influence one another. The emotion that is focused on in this book is that of human suffering. Her studies regard what can come about from suffering. She notes that not all things that come about from suffering are bad. She focuses on three ways people who suffer can be seen: \\"tragic figures, or objects of compassion, or bearers of experiences from which others can learn or otherwise profit\\". In this book she attempts to discover the meaning and significance of human suffering. Her studies involve the suffering of oneself as well as that of others. Her studies of repair activities of humans is published in her book titled Repair: The Impulse to Restore a Fragile World. This book ties into her other piece, Fruits of Sorrow. While that book shows the imperfections of life, e.g. the fact that things break, this piece shows humans' needs to fix them. Her book delves into what makes humans human. We naturally attempt to fix things that are broken or wrong in our lives. Her 2016 book Trash Talks: Revelations in the Rubbish focuses on the complex relationship between human beings and waste. Influences on feminist philosophy Spelman presents many ideas that impact the branch of feminist philosophy. Spelman \\"holds that social conditioning creates femininity\\" and therefore all around the world a definition of femininity is different. Though she does believe that women raised in different cultures are different, she also believes all women have something in common to one another. Another point that Spelman emphasizes is that of social standings. She states, \\"no woman is subject to any form of oppression simply because she is a woman; which forms of oppression she is subject to depend on what \\"kind\\" of woman she is\\". Just like men, women are treated differently based upon race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Each of which play a part in how a woman is seen in society.

A resident of Lake Providence, Williamson represented the delta parishes: Tensas, Madison, East Carroll, and Concordia, a rich farming region along the Mississippi River. Included in his district were Vidalia, Ferriday, St. Joseph, and Tallulah. At the time, two state senators represented the four-parish district. Background Williamson was born in the now ghost town of Salem in Benton County, one of the six northernmost counties of Mississippi. His parents were the former Josephine Leggett and Albert W. Williamson. In 1897, Norris Williamson received his Bachelor of Science degree from Mississippi State University in Starkville, an institution then only seventeen years old. On July 4, 1897, he relocated to East Carroll Parish in far northeastern Louisiana to become a contractor in the construction of levees along the Mississippi River. In 1904, he purchased the Owenton Plantation. In 1920, he closed the construction business to devote full-time to the 4,000-acre Wilton Plantation, where he raised cotton, cattle, and grains. The historically black Union Baptist Church No. 1 was built on Williamson lands in 1928. In 1918, at age of forty-two, Williamson married the former Sally Cooke (1887-1976), daughter of H. Brent Cooke and the former Rachel Wilson of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1922, he joined others in the organization of the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation and was a member of the original board of directors. In 1923, he worked to organize the Louisiana and the American cotton cooperative associations. Williamson co-founded and served on the executive committee of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. In 1928, he and Sally adopted a seven-year-old daughter, Norris Williamson, who later married Joseph Lawrence Brock. Norris Brock died in 1948 at the age of twenty-seven, a year before her father's passing. In 1944, twelve years after Williamson's Senate tenure ended, Progressive Farmer magazine declared him \\"Man of the Year\\" because of his service to agriculture. Williamson was a member of the Masonic lodge.Frederick W. Williamson and George T. Goodman, eds. Eastern Louisiana: A History of the Watershed of the Ouachita River and the Florida Parishes, 3 vols. (Monroe: Historical Record Association, 1939, pp. 770-773 Political career From 1912 to 1916, Williamson was the president of the East Carroll Parish Police Jury, the governing body of the parish, akin to county commissions in most other states. He left the police jury upon his election to the state Senate. As the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, As a freshman senator, Williamson in 1917 introduced a bill calling for state funding for the eradication of the cattle tick pest, and it was signed into law by Governor Ruffin Pleasant. Williamson supported woman's suffrage through ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was an alternate delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention, which nominated the Roosevelt-Wallace ticket. The Louisiana delegation was led by then Governor Sam Houston Jones, the leader of the anti-Long faction. Williamson served alongside Senator Clifford Cleveland Brooks, a planter from St. Joseph in Tensas Parish. Williamson was an unwavering conservative and an unyielding critic of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. In June 1929, he was named vice-president of the anti-Long Constitutional League of Louisiana, which was organized in the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans to \\"save the state from Long\\". The president of the organization was former Governor John M. Parker.Huey P. Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New Orleans: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), p. 183. Williamson retired to private life in 1932, rather than face likely defeat at the hands of the Longites, and his seat passed to Andrew L. Sevier of Tallulah, who remained in the post until his death in 1962. Brooks was unseated in 1932 by the banker Daniel B. Fleming of Ferriday in Concordia Parish. Whereas Williamson had refused to compromise with the Long faction and retired from politics, Brooks ran again, equivocated in his last campaign regarding Longism and disappointed some of his original supporters who felt that he had not stood by his principles. Brooks was unseated, even the loser to Fleming in his own Tensas Parish.Once Proud Princes, pp. 207-209 Norris and Sally Williamson, who outlived her husband by twenty-seven years, are interred at Lake Providence Cemetery.

Schwarz (born October 6, 1939) is an American political scientist. He graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A in 1961, received his Ph.D from Indiana University in 1967, and studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science and L‚ÄôInstitut d‚ÄôEtudes Politiques de Paris. He was an economic adviser to Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana in 1963, completed work for his Ph.D in Belgium and Luxembourg in 1964-66, and then went on to teach at the University of Minnesota from 1966-1970 and the University of Arizona from 1970-2004. In 2006, he became a distinguished senior fellow at Demos, a public policy research organization in New York City.  Early life and career  Schwarz was raised in a Jewish family in Westchester County, New York, the son of Erwin Schwarz, who was in the woolen business, and Louise Lasker Schwarz, who did philanthropic work for the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Community Service Society. Schwarz attended Scarsdale High School and was an avid athlete. Schwarz began his academic career at the University of Minnesota in 1966. In 1970, he moved to the University of Arizona, where he continued his career up until his retirement in 2004. A devoted teacher, he was a winner of the Danforth Teaching Award at the University of Arizona.W. W. Norton Publishing Co. Author biography page He was Chair of the Faculty at the University of Arizona from 1995-1997 and is now a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Political Science in the College of Social and Behavioral Science. Schwarz's research and writing initially emphasized democratic politics, particularly representative legislatures, resulting in The United States Congress in Comparative Perspective, co-authored with L. Earl Shaw and published in 1976. The book examined the legislatures of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany from 1950 to the early 1970s. Schwarz then assessed the actual results of the public policies enacted by Congress, which culminated in a 1983 best-selling book, America‚Äôs Hidden Success: A Reassessment of Twenty Years of Public Policy. It described how the programs legislated under the New Frontier and the Great Society, (which by Reagan‚Äôs presidency had increasingly become viewed as failures), instead saved Americans from far more serious unemployment and inflationary disasters in the 1960s and 1970s, which would have otherwise been inevitable with the entry of the gargantuan baby-boom generation into the labor market and economy. Schwarz then turned to assessing the results of public policies enacted during the Reagan and later administrations, focusing on workers and the larger economy. The research ended in two books, The Forgotten Americans: 30 Million Working Poor in the Land of Opportunity in 1992 (co-authored with Thomas J. Volgy) and Illusions of Opportunity: The American Dream in Question (1997). The former book discovered that dramatically more Americans occupied low-wage jobs, with little mobility upward, than was generally understood by either government officials or the public. Current economic policies (such as the frozen minimum wage and reduced public assistance) and flawed economic measures (such as the increasingly outdated poverty line) greatly exacerbated the problem. The basic family budgets set forth in The Forgotten Americans, coupled with its analysis of the levels of hourly pay needed to meet those basic budgets, helped give rise to living-wage movements in a number of states and cities. It also helped press the federal government to consider altering its standard measure of the poverty line and spurred some states and cities to enact a higher local minimum wage. In Illusions of Opportunity Schwarz shows how to quantify the shortage of adequate jobs for workers and families in the American economy in a period spanning from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s. Schwarz's next book, Freedom Reclaimed: Recovering the American Vision (2005), received positive reviews in prominent publications.Christopher C. Burkett, Political Science Quarterly Winter 2005. http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=15234 The book brought together three earlier interests that guided Schwarz's work: democratic representation, the content of public policies, and their impact on the economy and opportunity for Americans. Schwarz develops a philosophical narrative that reveals the vital moral interconnection of the three areas of interest within a tradition of American thinking that reaches back to the nation's founding philosophy. Schwarz discovered that this philosophy corresponded closely with the policies that the government had been adopting and implementing. Common Credo: The Path Back to American Success (2013) explored the government's present actions and operations relative to the founding moral tradition. It stated the numerous ways in which the essentials of the founding philosophy, whose implementation accounted for the nation's success in the past, have become misunderstood by Republicans as well as Democrats, liberals and conservatives alike, over the past four decades. The book argues that the nation's increasing departure from the principles of the philosophy during those four decades sewed the seeds for the nation's most intractable problems, such as the economy's collapse in 2008 and its slowed growth for years both before and after the collapse.

A group of Russian men were eating at the Azeri-owned restaurant, when allegedly, they noticed that the expensive, premium brand vodka bottle the waiter was pouring their drinks from was actually filled with a cheap, low quality spirit. An argument and brief scuffle ensued. The ethnic Russians then left the bar. The barman then called a 'rescue team' of 15 Chechens. This team of hired 'protectors' actually arrived an hour after the Russians involved in the initial fracas had exited, but on arrival, randomly attacked ethnic Russian diners in the restaurant, who hadn't been involved in the original vodka dispute. Armed with baseball bats and knives, they set on the clientele shouting 'allahu akbar!', and in a brutal melee, 2 Russians were killed, 8 seriously injured and 15 mutilated, the injuries ranging from cuts to gouged out eyes. Despite the fact that 3 police vehicles were in the direct vicinity of the restaurant, the police did not intervene. This has led to allegations that the police were being paid off by the Chechen gang. The Finnish television documentarist Arvo Tuominen explained the violence in the following way:Arvo Tuominen: √Ñ√§nisen vett√§ (Water of Lake Onega) ‚Äî a road movie around Lake Onega. YLE TV 1, 26 Dec. 2011. After the funeral of the Russian victims, tensions spilled over into an all out riot as the mob attempted to obtain vigilante revenge. Many of the Chechens and the families left the town, some stating a desire to live in Finland.http://konstantin2005.blogspot.com/2006/09/kondopoga.html. Sergey Katanandov, the head of Karelia Republic, told \\"Izvestia\\" on September 6 about a gang of Chechens who drove around the town in a Mercedes without number plates 'terrorising locals'. He also related an incident where a Chechen gang beat a local policeman. An ensuing lawsuit by the policeman was dropped, Katanandov hinting that he had been 'paid off' by the gang - others believe fear of reprisals may have been his motivation. It said to be an open secret in Russia that many businesses often operate under the protection of ' (\\"roofs\\") - that provide protection via the FSB and other state bodies. In Kondopoga, many believe such 'immunity from prosecution' was visibly flaunted by the Chechen gang and the businesses under their protection. Some reports link this state of affairs to clashes on the night of September 1‚Äì2, 2006 between groups of ethnic Russian youths and the OMON (a SWAT-type and riot- control unit) troops. The Chayka restaurant was destroyed during this unrest. A number of Chechen-owned businesses were also targeted. On September 2, two days after the beginning of rioting, there was a mass meeting held at the town hall. A number of Russian nationalists came from Moscow, including leaders of Movement Against Illegal Immigration, and organized a rally calling on the government to forcibly resettle all people from the Caucasus, especially ethnic Chechens, from the town. The nationalists pointed to the reign of fear spread by Chechen gangsters and the many violent acts committed against ethnic Russians, exacerbated by corrupt officials 'in the pockets' of the Chechens, as their motivation. On April 1, 2010, the Chechens and Dagestanis who participated in the original restaurant attack were convicted of various crimes. Islam Magomadov was convicted of two counts of murder and sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment, five more people were convicted of assault and aggravated assault and received sentences ranging from 3 years 10 month up to 10 years of imprisonment.

Drysdale Vickery; 1844 ‚Äì 12 January 1929) was an English physician, campaigner for women's rights, and the first British woman to qualify as a chemist and pharmacist. She and her life partner, Charles Robert Drysdale, also a physician, actively supported a number of causes, including free love, birth control, and destigmatisation of illegitimacy.  Education and marriage  Vickery was born in Devon in 1844 to a piano maker and organ builder. By 1861, she had moved to South London. Vickery began her medical career at the Ladies' Medical College in 1869. There she met the lecturer Charles Robert Drysdale and started a relationship with him. They never married, as they both agreed with his brother George (also a neo-Malthusian physician) that marriage was \\"legal prostitution\\". The society, however, generally presumed that the pair were married; had their contemporaries known that they were in a free union, their careers likely would have suffered. Vickery sometimes added Drysdale's name to her own, referring to herself both as \\"Dr. Vickery Drysdale\\" and as \\"Dr. Drysdale Vickery\\". In 1873, Vickery obtained a midwife's degree from the Obstetrical Society. On 18 June the same year, she passed the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's exam and became the first qualified female chemist and druggist. Afterward, Vickers went to study medicine at the University of Paris, as women were not allowed to attend any British medical school. There she gave birth to her first child, Charles Vickery Drysdale. The UK Medical Act 1876 allowed women to obtain medical degrees, and Vickery returned to England in 1877. In 1880, she became one of five women who qualified as physicians in the kingdom, obtaining her degree from the London School of Medicine for Women, and started practising medicine. In August 1881 her second son, George Vickery Drysdale was born.  Activism  Vickery became a member of the Malthusian League and an outspoken supporter of birth control after the trial of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, who were arrested for publishing a book about contraception in 1877. When she was called to testify at the trial, she spoke about the dangers of too frequent childbirths and of using over-lactation as a contraception method. She had to temporarily withdraw from the League, however, because the London Medical School for Women did not approve of her activities. She resumed membership in 1880, when she obtained her degree, and spent the following decade lecturing about birth control as a key element to the emancipation of women. At the same time, she actively opposed the Contagious Diseases Acts. Both Vickery and Drysdale joined the Legitimation League, set up in 1893, and campaigned for equal rights for children born out of wedlock. Vickery felt that the organisation \\"did not go far enough\\" until it started advocating free love. She was successively a member of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, the Women's Social and Political Union, and the Women's Freedom League. After Drysdale's death in 1907, Vickery continued practising as a physician and succeeded him as president of the Malthusian League, while their elder son Charles and daughter-in-law Bessie became the new editors of the journal Malthusian. Soon afterward, she became one of the first members of the Eugenics Education Society.  Later years  The grave of Alice Vickery in Brookwood Cemetery Vickery moved to Brighton in 1923 to be near her elder son. She regularly addressed meetings of the local branch of the Women's Freedom League. She died of pneumonia on 12 January 1929, a few days after delivering an address that became her final public presentation. She was buried with Charles Robert Drysdale in Brookwood Cemetery. Family Her life-partner was Dr Charles Robert Drysdale. Their sons were Charles Vickery Drysdale FRSE (1874-1961) and George Vickery Drysdale (1881).

It was a two bay biplane with pairs of parallel interplane struts, though the inner bay was quite narrow. There were ailerons on both upper and lower planes, externally connected. Its engine was a six cylinder inline, water cooled BMW IV, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed, which drove a two blade propeller. The fuselage was flat sided and accommodated the two crew in a continuous open, tandem cockpit. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the vertical tail was tall and rounded, the rudder extending below the keel. The V 60 had twin float landing gear attached to the wing and lower fuselage on a number of V-struts and laterally cross braced. Operational history One V 60 was entered into the German Seaplane Competition held in July 1926 on the Baltic coast. During one flight the pilot, Haase, put down on the sea to make some adjustment but was swept away. The aircraft and its passenger were rescued.

In addition to the LNG plant, the project includes production at the Yuzhno- Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. History Ceremony of loading of the first LNG tanker within the project of Yamal LNG, 8 December 2017 Yamal LNG project was proposed when the company with the same name and controlled by Gennady Timchenko and Pyotr Kolbin got a license for the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field in 2005. Novatek took control of Yamal LNG in 2009. Another project named Yamal LNG was proposed by Gazprom. In November 2008, Gazprom announced that it prepared a list of potential partners for the LNG plant of the Yamal project. Although the list was not disclosed, Gazprom indicated that ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were included on the list. Also Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol YPF and Petro-Canada were mentioned as potential partners. In October 2010, the Novatek's project was chosen by the Russian government as a pilot project. The groundbreaking ceremony for the port construction was held in July 2012; however, construction of the port itself began in 2013. In December 2014, amid the 2014‚Äì15 Russian financial crisis, the Russian government gave a 150 billion rouble subsidy to the project. The commercial operation of the port and first LNG train were launched on 8 December 2017 by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Technical description The project cost US$27 billion. The Yamal LNG plant will have three trains with total capacity of 16.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year when fully operational. The first train is operational at the end of 2017 and the full 3 train capacity is to be achieved by 2021. A second LNG Plant, named Artic LNG 2, is also proposed at a site to east near the Gyda Peninsula, across the river Ob estuary from Sabetta The plant was designed and commissioned by consortium of Technip and JGC Corporation, and Chiyoda. In addition to the LNG plant, the project includes the construction of a seaport, airport and power plant. The power plant will be built by Technopromexport and its turbines will be supplied by Siemens. The power plant will have capacity of 380 MW(during ISO conditions) across its 8 turbines and it is to be operational by 2018. Construction of the port facilities started in September 2013. The LNG plant is supplied from the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field. The main export market for LNG would be China. LNG would be shipped to Asian markets through the Northeast Passage. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering is contracted to build up to sixteen Arc7 double acting ice-class gas tankers for the project. Tankers will be chartered and operated by Sovcomflot. A 180 km railway line is being built, connecting Bovanenkovo to Sabetta. Ownership The project is developed by JSC Yamal LNG. Novatek owns 50.1% stake in the company while Total S.A. and CNPC own 20% each with China's Silk Road Fund has signed agreement to purchase 9.9% stake. General director of the company was Gleb Luxemburg and from September 2014 Evgeny Kot has been appointed the CEO of Yamal LNG. Icebreaker LNG carriers Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships. The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017. =Ships= In service as of October 2019 https://www.reuters.com/article/lng-yamal-shipping/table-latest-arc7-lng-ship- delivers-1st-cargo-another-waits-outside-yamal-idUSL5N2734OK: *Christophe de Margerie, Sovcomflot *Boris Vilkitsky, Dynagas *Fedor Litke, Dynagas *Eduard Toll, Teekay *Vladimir Rusanov, MOL *Vladimir Vize, COSCO Shipping and MOL *Rudolf Samoylovich, Teekay *Nikolay Yevgenov, Teekay *Georgiy Brusilov, Dynagas *Boris Davydov, Dynagas *Nikolay Zubov, Dynagas *Vladimir Voroni, Teekay *Nikolay Urvantsev, MOL *Georgiy Ushakov, Teekay *Yakov Gakkel, Teekay References External links * * https://www.tv4play.se/program/nyheterna/11985830 * Category:Energy in Siberia Category:Industry in the Arctic Category:Proposed liquefied natural gas plants Category:Energy infrastructure in Russia Category:JGC Corporation Category:Companies based in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug Category:Natural gas companies of Russia ","title":"Yamal LNG"},{"id":"40068972","text":"Nordic House borders the reserve. The Vatnsm√Ωrin Nature Reserve (translation: \\"water marsh\\") is a protected moorland in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. The reserve provides a water source for Tj√∂rnin Lake and is a nesting ground for birds. It borders the Nordic House and the University of Iceland. The area within the Reserve including drains and fences, and measures . Eighty-three species of vascular plants are documented. Biodiversity has been inhibited due to invasive animals and plants as well as industrial waste. History Parts of what is now Vatnsm√Ωri had been used as agricultural fields since the 19th century. In the 20th century, building activity encroached into the area. As the area had been known for its importance for wetland nesting birds, Vatnsm√Ωri was designated a Nature Conservation area in 1981. The lake and parts of the wetland were established as a nature reserve in 1984 by the Reykjav√≠k City Council. A general conservation plan, particularly for activities related to the nesting area of birds, was developed for the period of 1990‚Äì2001 by the City Council. A master plan for the period 2001‚Äì2024 was subsequently developed with detailing for pond areas, fencing, walkways, and bridges. Consequently, to filling the pond area, the water level in the canals rose by with corresponding rise of ground water levels by . In 2012, the Nordic House promoted an exhibit on Vatnsm√Ωrin. Vegetation A floral survey was carried out in 2003 which identified species of vascular plants in the reserve. Swamp vegetation is the common flora. This is characterized as wetland vegetation, vegetation on an old excavation area, as well as vegetation on embankments. A report of 83 species vascular plants, itemized 65 as original Icelandic flora. Varied soil conditions in the reserve are attributed to the large floral diversity. The vascular plant species identified are the following: * Achillea millefolium * Achillea ptarmica * Aconitum x stoerkiana Reichenb * Agrostis capillaris * Agrostis stolonifera * Alchemilla alpina * Alchemilla glomerulans Buser * Alchemilla tela * Alopecurus pratensis * Angelica archangelica * Anthoxanthum odoratum * Anthriscus sylvestris Hoff * Betula pubescens Ehrh * Bromus inermis leysse * Calamagrostis Strict Koele * Caltha palustris * Card Mine pratensis * Carex lyngbyei Horne * Carex nigra Reichardt * Cerastium * Chamomilla suaveolens Rydb * Cirsium arvense scop * Dactylis Glomerata * Deschampsia caespitosa Beauv * Elymus repens Gould * Epilobium palustre * Epilobium Watsonia Barbey * Equisetum arvense * Equisetum palustre * Eriophorum angustifolium * Euphrasia Frigida Pugsley * Festuca rubra * Festuca vivi pair Sm * Filipendula ulmaria Maxim * Galium verum * Hippuris vulgaris * Juncus alpinoarticulatus Chaix * Juncus articus Wild * Juncus articulates * Leontodon autumnalis * Leymus arenarius Hochst * Luzula multi flora Lej * Matricaria maritima * Menyanthes trifoliate * Montia fontana * Myosotis arvensis * Parnassia palustris * Phalaris arundinacea * Phleum pretense * Pinguicula vulgaris * Plantago maritima * Poa annuals * Poa pratensis * Potentilla anserine * Potentilla palustris scop * Ranunculus acris * Ranunculus repens * Rhinanthus minor * Rumex acetosa * Rumex acetosella * Rumex longifolius * Saws procumbens * Salix alaxensis * Salix caprea * Salix lanata * Salix myrsinifolia * Salix phylicifolia * Senecio vulgaris * Sorbus aucuparia * Stellaria graminea * Stellaria media * Taraxacum officinale * Trifolium medium * Trifolium repens * Triglochin palustris * Tussilago farfara * Valeriana sambucifolia * Vicia cracca * Vicia sepium * Viola palustris Conservation As a result of deterioration noted in the wetlands of Vatnsm√Ωrin Reserve in recent years, the number of birds reported in the lake demonstrates a declining trend. This is attributed to the lack of adequate nesting grounds, though as a reserve, the nesting area has lacked adequate protection for nearly a decade as result of invasive plant species and animals. Chervil and thistle, which have grown dense, preclude birds from nesting. Action plans have been initiated jointly by the Nordic House, the University of Iceland, and City Council to improve the conditions in the reserve by removing invasive species, replacing these with wetland vegetation, building embankments, building sedimentation ponds in the main stream to improve the flow through the moors, and de-silting the lake.

Thornton served as member of the House of Burgesses for Northumberland County from 1748‚Äì49 and 1752‚Äì61. Thornton was the great- grandson of William Thornton who arrived in Virginia from England as late as 1646 settling in Gloucester County, Virginia. He was through his paternal line a cousin of fellow burgesses, Francis Thornton of Spotsylvania, George Thornton of Spotsylvania, William Thornton of King George and William Thornton of Richmond County, Virginia and William Thornton of Brunswick County. In addition to his fellow burgesses he was a distant cousin of the future Presidents James Madison and Zachary Taylor.  Life  Thornton was born 1721 in King George County, Virginia to Anthony Thornton and Winifred Presley, the daughter of Peter Presley. He was upon his maternal grandfather's death made sole heir of the entirety of the Presley estate which included some 3000 acres and a notable house known as 'Northumberland House'. In most historical records he appears as Presley Thornton and was recorded as Presley Thornton in the House of Burgesses. He was elected to represent Northumberland in the House of Burgesses in 1748‚Äì1749 returned 1752‚Äì1761 and was appointed to the King's Council in 1760. He was voted out of office in 1761 and retired and devoted his remaining years to his plantation. Thornton died in 1769 leaving his estate to his wife and children, following his death his widow removed to England and Northumberland House was inherited by his eldest son Presley Thornton. Thornton's sons served in the British military and his family were staunch loyalists unlike all other branches of the Thornton family. After the premature death of the junior Peter Presley Thornton, Thornton's second son Presley Thornton returned from England and inherited Northumberland House. The younger Thornton was pardoned and restored to full citizenship in 1783 and retained ownership of Northumberland House until 1800 upon which time he sold the entire estate and removed to Genesee, New York.  Marriages & Children  Thornton married twice, both of unknown dates firstly to Elizabeth whose identity is not precisely known. His second wife was Charlotte Belson, the adopted daughter or ward of Colonel John Tayloe of Mt. Airy in Richmond County, Virginia. Belson was reported to have been English and is likely to have come to the Tayloe through relations of Mrs. Tayloe's first marriage to the Bristol merchant Stephen Lyde. As political tensions increased in the colony, Belson removed her family back to England engaging two of her sons in the Army and one in the Navy.

When hostilities commenced in August 1914, Territorial soldiers were asked to sign a document called the Imperial Service Obligation which waived their immunity from overseas service. By 26 September 1914, 72% of Territorials had signed; the remainder were consigned to second line battalions. New Territorial recruits continued to be able to enlist for home service only, until March 1915. The Military Service Act 1916 forced those under the age of 41 to sign the Imperial Service Obligation or resign.Beckett, Ian Frederick William (1991), The Amateur Military Tradition: 1558-1945, Manchester University Press, (pp. 230-231) As the Territorial regiments' first and second line battalions were prepared for active service, those who had opted for home service or were unfit were formed into Provisional Battalions that in turn formed the 71st, 72nd and 73rd Home Service Divisions. On 1 January 1917, the remaining Provisional battalions were renamed Home Service Territorial Battalions of the Infantry Regiments. In addition, regular army infantry soldiers who were too old or unfit to serve overseas were formed into (Home Service) Garrison Battalions, which became part of the Royal Defence Corps. Second World War During British re-armament in the mid-1930s, the Royal Defence Corps was disbanded and replaced by the National Defence Companies, a part-time force which was part of the Territorial Army (TA) and open to ex-servicemen between the ages of 45 and 60 years.Hansard - House of Commons Debate 21 July 1936 vol 315 cc228-9: TERRITORIAL FORCE (NATIONAL DEFENCE COMPANIES). The Defence Companies were mobilised during the week before war was declared, their role being the protection of \\"vulnerable points\\". In November 1939, two months after Britain's entry into the Second World War, the National Defence Companies were formed into battalions attached to Regular Army regiments and renamed \\"Home Service Battalions\\", to guard vulnerable points and prisoner of war (POW) camps in the United Kingdom.Perry, Frederick W., 1988, The Commonwealth Armies: Manpower and Organisation in Two World Wars Manchester University Press (p. 53) References External links * \\"Let 'em all come\\", MEN 41-55, HOME SERVICE BATTALIONS A World War II recruiting poster.

The largely Gothic church stands next to an older defensive tower. The church's main portal is richly decorated with medieval sculpture, and the interior contains an altarpiece from the 14th century of high craftsmanship. The church is in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History Detail of the decorated main portal The church is built next to a defensive tower, erected in the 12th century and probably built to protect the congregation from raiders from across the Baltic Sea. The present-day church is largely from the 14th century. Only the tower remains of an older church on the same site. The tower was originally part of the nave of this first, Romanesque church. The current tower roof dates from 1755. Architecture The church is a High Gothic building, characterised by a spacious nave, divided into four vaults by a single central column. The choir lacks an apse and instead the eastern end of the church is adorned with three Gothic windows. Possibly the most noteworthy part of the church is the southern portal, which is richly sculpted. Dating from the 14th century, it was made by the Gotlandic workshop or sculptor commonly referred to by the notname Egypticus. The portal displays scenes from the Old Testament. The interior of the church contains fragments of medieval murals. The altarpiece is an piece dating from the 14th century of fine craftsmanship, and the church also has a medieval baptismal font. There is also a medieval gravestone slab in the floor of the choir, which is inscribed with runes. Other furnishings date from the late 17th century (the pulpit) and the 18th century (choir stalls and pews).

She was later transferred to Swedish ownership, renamed Astrid and sailed on the Baltic Sea until 1975. She then sailed under a Lebanese flag and was allegedly used for drug smuggling. After being found burnt out on the coast of England in the early 1980s, she was overhauled and used as a sailing training vessel. She was based in Weymouth, Dorset, United Kingdom and was informally known as \\"Weymouth's vessel\\". Astrid ran aground off the coast of Ireland on 24 July 2013, and subsequently sank, with all on board rescued. She was salvaged on 9 September 2013, but as the cost of restoring her was too high she was scrapped and broken up by April 2014.  Structure  Astrid was a dual-masted, square-rigged, iron/steel-hulled tall ship. She was in length, with a beam, a draught and a mast height of . In addition to her sails, she also had a small Scania Ds 1402 four-stroke diesel motor for propulsion. Astrid was the smallest tall ship in the Dutch fleet. As built, Astrid had a gross register tonnage of 182; she was 143 net register tonnage with a capacity of 123 tons under her deck. Her dimensions were length, beam and depth. Her four-stroke single cycle, single action 2-cylinder auxiliary diesel engine was built by Gasmotorenfabrikant Deutz A.G., K√∂ln, Germany. The cylinders were bore by stroke. Astrid had two deckhouses: one at the stern with navigational equipment and maps, and another forward containing a bar. The lower deck had twelve 2-person cabins (of which three could be used as 3-person cabins) as well as showers, toilets and a galley.  Career  Astrid was built in 1918 in Scheveningen, Netherlands by G van Leeuwen as W.U.T.A., short for Wacht Uw Tijd Af meaning \\"Bide Your Time\\". She was originally rigged as a lugger. By 1930, she had been re-rigged as an auxiliary schooner. Then owned by N. M√ºller, her port of registry was Dordrecht, South Holland and her Code Letters were QOSF. In 1934, her Code Letters were changed to PIRV. In 1937, Astrid (then known as W.U.T.A.) was sold to Swede J. Jeppson and renamed Astrid. Her port of registry was changed to Skillinge and the Code Letters SLEK were allocated. By this time, she had been derigged and was operating on her engine alone. Astrid was used on trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea until 1975. Astrid then sailed under a Lebanese flag. She was allegedly used for drug smuggling, and was being shadowed in the English Channel by HM Customs and Excise when she mysteriously caught fire. Astrid was found abandoned and burnt to a shell off the coast of England in the early 1980s by Graham Neilson. Astrid was transferred to British ownership in 1984 when she was overhauled for the Astrid Trust, a private company limited by guarantee. The restoration was financially supported by Sir Jack Hayward, and also involved Rear Admiral Charles Williams. She was subsequently dedicated on 17 May 1989 by Princess Anne, following which she took part in the 800th anniversary celebrations of the Lord Mayor of London. Astrid then competed in the 1989 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race. She also competed in the 1990 and 1991 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races. Astrid made more than 16 crossings of the Atlantic Ocean as a training ship. Astrid was captained by Paul Compton until 1999. In December 1996, the Astrid Trust was wound up, and Astrid, then lying at Barbados, was put up for sale with an asking price of ¬£750,000. Following her sale in 1997, Astrid was converted into a luxury sailing vessel in 1999‚Äì2000, after which she could carry 45 passengers, or have 24 guest crew members. Since circa 2006, she had been owned by Ineke and Pieter de Kam. Astrid was a regular participant, and winner of several prizes, in Tall Ship Races and Regattas. Astrid was based in Weymouth Harbour, and was informally known as \\"Weymouth's vessel\\".  Sinking and salvage operation  Astrid sinking on 24 July 2013 The wreck of Astrid after she had been raised. Astrid departed from Southampton, UK on 14 July 2013 and was due to arrive in Cherbourg, Seine-Maritime, France on 28 July 2013 as part of a European Union International Exchange program. As of 14:00 on 23 July 2013, the ship was anchored in Oysterhaven Anchorage in County Cork. The 30 crew members of the ship consisted of the master; three permanent crew members; a cook on a temporary contract; a mentor; and 24 trainees aged from 15-24 (eight from Ireland, four from the Netherlands, three from the United Kingdom, six from France, two from Belgium and one from Spain). This meant that there were 23 teenagers and 7 adults on board, consisting of 24 trainees and 6 permanent crew. Pieter de Kam was captaining the ship. The Astrid raised its anchor at around 11:00 on 24 July 2013, and left Oysterhaven on motor power. She was one of 50 vessels participating in Ireland's 2013 Gathering Cruise between Oysterhaven and Kinsale. At around 11:35 her sails were being raised while the engine was still in use, and the ship was sailing towards the south-west at around 3 knots. At around 11:40, the ship's engine failed. Around midday on 24 July 2013, Astrid ran aground on Quay Rock at Ballymacus Point, near the Sovereign Islands in southern Ireland, while attempting to enter the harbour near Kinsale, County Cork. The ship's engine failure prevented her from pulling herself off the rocks. The thirty crew members were rescued from the tall ship, with 18 being rescued by a RNLI lifeboat and the other 12 by another tall ship. Four RNLI lifeboats and two Irish Coast Guard helicopters were involved in the rescue. The incident was filmed by the Irish Coast Guard. None of the crew suffered any injuries. The entire hull of the vessel was covered by water, with a exclusion zone being enforced by the patrol ship . On 26 July, divers and a surveyor started assessing whether salvage and repair of the ship would be possible. Initial reports indicated that Astrid had been looted overnight from 26‚Äì27 July, with the ship's wheel and heavy brass compass and bell stolen from the ship. However, it soon emerged that some of items were missing from the ship within hours of the incident; subsequent news reports stated that the wheel was likely ripped off the ship by the sea within 48 hours of the accident, and the Irish Coastguard and Naval Service issued a warning to stay away from the wreck. Salvage divers recovered all three missing items from the ship on 9 August, and they were handed over to the ship's owner. A video showing their recovery, and the damage to the ship, was later released. Extensive damage was found by the diver's preliminary examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping water out of the ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water. Plans for the salvage operation were approved by the Irish Coast Guard, and the salvage operation began on 1 September, with work to remove loose ropes and secure the fuel containers; the salvage operation was expected to take up to 3 weeks. Astrid was recovered by the sheerleg GPS Atlas on 9 September 2013 by Atlantic Towage and Marine, and was transported on a barge to Kinsale for assessment and an investigation of what caused the accident. The insurers of the ship deemed the cost of restoring Astrid to be too high due to the damage caused while she was partially submerged (an economic write-off); as such she was scrapped and taken to Cork Harbour to be broken up. The scrapping process was completed by April 2014.  Investigation  On 23 July 2014, a day before the anniversary of the Astrids sinking, an interim announcement from the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) said that the loss was due to engine failure, and that a full report would be posted once standard procedure to ensure \\"natural justice\\" had been followed. They rated the type of incident as a \\"Very Serious Marine Casualty\\". On the same day, it was reported that some of the canvas sails from the Astrid, as well as some of the timber from the lifeboats, had been turned into designer handbags. The MCIB released their full report on 11 February 2015. The report found that the main cause of the incident was that the ship had not been operated safely in compliance with international conventions, and that the direct cause of the ship's grounding was due to engine failure as a result of fresh water contamination of the engine's fuel, which occurred by human error when the water was taken on board in Brighton on 12 July 2013. It found a \\"catalogue of failures and breaches of international regulations\\", including unsafe route planning that was influenced by photo opportunities rather than following the safest route, and it recommended that the master of the ship should always have authority to override courses during promotional activities to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew and passengers. It found that the SOLAS Conventions had been breached, and that the ship had not been certified as a passenger ship for either EU or international voyages, that the crew were not appropriately certified, and that the ship should not have been at sea. The liferafts were three months overdue of inspection, the Certificate of Seaworthiness was invalid, and the master's Certificate of Competency had expired a month before the accident. It also noted that mistakes were made with the mayday alert, causing a 10-minute delay in deploying the RNLI and Coast Guard, which could have had a significant impact if the conditions of the incident had been worse. The ship's owners were financially ruined by the incident.

Within three years, the group had created an organization and employed a staff led by founding executive director H. Alexander Robinson. In July 2009. the organization became the first black LGBT group to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) board of governors when its deputy executive director, Jason W.

It was founded in 1911 after the fall of the Portuguese monarchy and was later integrated in the new University of Lisbon along with the former Technical University of Lisbon. The history of a university in Lisbon dates back to the 13th century. History thumbThe first Portuguese university school was founded in 1290 by King Dinis in Lisbon, and was called Studium Generale (Estudo Geral). In the following 247 years, this first university school was moved several times between Lisbon and Coimbra. In 1537, during the reign of Jo√£o III, the university moved definitively to Coimbra. The entire university institution, including the teaching staff and all the books from its library, were moved to Coimbra where the University of Coimbra was definitively installed. Lisbon became a university city again in 1911 when the current University of Lisbon was founded, through the union of newly created and older schools, like the 19th century Polytechnic School (Escola Polit√©cnica), the Royal Medical School of Lisbon (Real Escola M√©dico-Cir√∫rgica de Lisboa) and the Letters Higher Studies (Curso Superior de Letras). Faculties =Faculty of Law= The Faculty of Law (Portuguese: Faculdade de Direito) was officially created by a Decree of March 22, 1911 as Faculdade de Ci√™ncias Econ√≥micas e Pol√≠ticas, but was only installed in 1913, and was given its current designation later in 1918. It was originally located at the Valmor Building (Edif√≠cio Valmor) at the Campo dos M√°rtires da P√°tria. It was transferred to its current campus at the University City (Cidade Universit√°ria) in 1957-1958. A new building, housing the Faculty's library, was built in the late 1990s. The only graduation given is law, and the specialised post-graduate studies available include several branches of the same area. Among the many graduates from the faculty of law are the former Presidents of Portugal Jorge Sampaio and M√°rio Soares, Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano, the President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso, Portuguese statesman, deputy, and professor Adriano Moreira and businessman and former Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsem√£o. Current President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was a full professor there for many years, before his election in 2016. First Republic political leader and several times Prime Minister Afonso Costa was a teacher at the faculty and its founder and first dean.

Jo√£o Vale e Azevedo, a lawyer and former chairman of SL Benfica, was also a student and an assistant lecturer at this faculty. =Faculty of Sciences= The Faculty of Sciences (Portuguese: Faculdade de Ci√™ncias, usually abbreviated FCUL) was created in April 19, 1911, by the transformation of the former Lisbon Polytechnic School (Escola Polit√©cnica de Lisboa). The Polytechnic School itself had been created in 1837, by the transformation and merger of the previous Royal Marine Academy (1779) and Royal College of the Nobles (1761). From 1911 until 1985 (when it moved to its current grounds, at Campo Grande), the Faculty of Sciences was installed in the former Polytechnic School building. Those former installations are now used as a museum, now and then. Its current grounds comprise a built area of 75662 square meters, corresponding to 8 buildings (labeled C1 through C8, where C stands for Ci√™ncias ‚Äî Sciences) which host the classrooms, offices, cafeterias, libraries, book shop and leisure areas. The faculty population, as of the 2009/2010 school year, consisted of (in parentheses, the numbers as of the 2008/2009 school year): * 3055 graduation students (2964); * 418 Joint degree (B.Sc.+M.Sc.) students (327) * 1008 M.Sc. students (1218); * 412 Ph.D. students (552); * 388 teachers, about 95.3% hold a Ph.D. (417, 96.6%); * 22 hired research staff (23) * 186 non-teaching workers (204).Agenda FCUL 2009/2010, 2009.Agenda FCUL 2010/2011, 2010. The computer science department has been granted several honours, namely a finalist position in the Descartes Prize and two IBM Scientific Awards. The faculty's campus also comprises the Instituto de Biof√≠sica e Engenharia Biom√©dica (IBEB), the Instituto de Oceanografia and the Instituto de Ci√™ncia Aplicada e Tecnologia (ICAT). There are 18 graduations available, in the following areas: * Applied Mathematics ** Fundamental Applications branch ** Statistics and Operations Research branch * Applied Statistics * Biology ** Environmental Biology branch (Marine and Terrestrial profiles) ** Cell biology and Biotechnology branch ** Evolutionary and Developmental biology branch ** Functional and Systems Biology branch ** Molecular biology and Genetics branch * Biochemistry * Chemistry * Computer Engineering ‚Äî the Engineer title requires an additional 2-year Master programme, on one of the following: ** Computer Architecture, Systems and Networks (Distributed Systems, Security, Embedded Systems, Fault tolerance) ** Information systems (Database systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile computing) ** Interaction and Knowledge (Artificial Intelligence-driven: multi-agent system, machine learning, Natural language processing and interaction, neural networks) ** Software Engineering (Software design, Algorithms, Programming) * Information and Communications Technology * Energy and Environment (partnership with Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inova√ß√£o) * Geographical Engineering * Geology ** Applied geology and Environment branch ** Geology and Natural resources branch * Health Sciences (partnership with Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Dentary Medicine of the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Lisbon and Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon) * Maths * Physics ** Physics branch ** Astronomy and Astrophysics branch ** Computational Physics branch * Meteorology, Oceanography and Geophysics * Microbiology (partnership with Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Pharmacy) * Physics Engineering (Engineering Physics) * Biomedical Engineering & Biophysics (Biomedical engineering) * Technological Chemistry Ant√≥nio de Sommer Champalimaud, a notable Portuguese business tycoon, studied at this Faculty of Sciences but did not graduate. Jo√£o Magueijo, a Portuguese cosmologist and professor, studied at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL). Jorge Palma, singer-songwriter, studied for a while at the Faculty of Sciences before embracing a successful career in music. Nuno Crato, a Portuguese university professor, researcher, mathematician, economist, and writer who has been appointed president of both the Portuguese Mathematical Society and Taguspark, studied for a while at the Faculdade de Ci√™ncias before changing his mind and graduate at the ISEG - Instituto Superior de Economia e Gest√£o/Technical University of Lisbon, embracing a notable academic career. Pedro Passos Coelho, Prime Minister of Portugal, studied mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences, but did not graduate there. Branca Edm√©e Marques studied chemistry before moving to Paris to study radiology with Marie Curie. She would return to Lisbon to eventually become the first female professor of chemistry. Lidia Salgueiro taught physics and conducted research for over 30 years, becoming the first woman to be elected as a Corresponding Member of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, an organization founded in 1779. =Faculty of Medicine= The Faculty of Medicine is a leading medical school, having its origins in the 19th century when the Real Escola M√©dico-Cir√∫rgica de Lisboa was founded in the city. Santa Maria's Hospital (Hospital de Santa Maria), one of the biggest Portuguese hospitals, is the teaching hospital of the faculty, and share the same installations. Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio and Alexandre Carlos Caldas studied at this faculty, and Egas Moniz (a Nobel prize winner) was a professor there. Other noted personalities who studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon include: *Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes, (born September 1, 1942), Portuguese novelist. *Joaquim Alberto Chissano, (born 22 October 1939), second President of Mozambique. (dropped out) *Jo√£o Lobo Antunes, (born June 4, 1944), a prominent Portuguese Neurosurgeon. *Jonas Savimbi, (1934‚Äì2002), a guerrilla, military leader and politician from Angola. (dropped out) *Jos√© Tom√°s de Sousa Martins, 19th century physician, noted for the esoteric cult-status achieved after his death. *Agostinho Neto, (1922‚Äì1979), served as the first President of Angola. *Maria Elisa, (born in 1950), journalist and television presenter. (dropped out) *Carlos Caldas , (born 1960), Chair of Cancer Medicine at the University of Cambridge. =Faculty of Letters= The Faculty of Letters (Portuguese: Faculdade de Letras), FLUL, was created in 1911 by the transformation of the previous Superior Studies in Letters, from which all students and professors were transferred. The Superior Studies in Letters itself had been created in 1859 by King Pedro V, from which all students and professors were transferred. The Faculty of Letters remained installed on the facilities of the Superior Studies, an annex to the Academy of Science, until 1957, when it changed to the current building, in the University City (Cidade Universit√°ria). In 1975, a new pavilion was built to accommodate the large influx of students who arrived after the democratization of higher education in Portugal, a consequence of the Carnation Revolution. The pavilion, theoretically provisional, still stands today. In 2001, two new buildings were finished: one to accommodate new classrooms and the Computer Room, and the Library Building, which is now the second biggest library in Portugal. Although the faculty's graduation with most studies is modern languages and literatures (L√≠nguas e Literaturas Modernas) (which has a number of variants, including studies in Portuguese, Spanish, English, French, German and Italian), it also offers philosophy, history (and archeology), African studies, Asian studies, European studies, cultural studies and classical studies (the degree itself is named classic languages and literatures). It is also the former home of the degree in psychology. In the mid-1980s a new Faculty of Psychology was created to accommodate it. Notable professors at the faculty include the second President of the Portuguese Republic, Te√≥filo Braga, and writers Vitorino Nem√©sio and Urbano Tavares Rodrigues. The poet Fernando Pessoa was a former student, though only attended for less than a year. Fialho Gouveia, a noted Portuguese television presenter, attended the Romance Philology course at the Faculdade de Letras but dropped out in order to follow a successful career in radio and television. The writer Luiz Pacheco was a student at FLUL before dropping out. The actress Alexandra Lencastre and Moonspell frontman Fernando Ribeiro also attended the philosophy course but did not graduate. Famous musician and composer Fernando Lopes-Gra√ßa also dropped out of FLUL. Football player and manager Artur Jorge graduated by FLUL after has been a student at the University of Coimbra's FLUC. Research The Instituto de Medicina Molecular of the University of Lisbon, a research institute in molecular medicine, is one of the most noted biosciences research institutions in Portugal. The Instituto Geofisico do Infante Dom Luiz exists since 1853 and is a research and operational unit that maintains the longest meteorological series of Portugal. Research is organized and funded through CGUL, the leading Portuguese geophysical research unit, and Associated Laboratory (with LATTEX) of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology. Researchers of LaSIGE, a research laboratory for large-scale information systems (integrated into the Department of Computer Science), have received several honors, namely an IBM Scientific Award, an Order of Engineers distinction and a place among the eight finalists of the Descartes Prize. =Instituto de Ci√™ncias Sociais (Institute of Social Sciences)= The Instituto de Ci√™ncias Sociais (ICS), an associated state laboratory, is a university institution devoted to research and advanced training in the social sciences. The ICS focuses its research on five main subject areas: the formation of the contemporary world; the study of citizenship and democratic institutions; the problems of sustainability, linking the environment, risk and space; social changes and individual action in the context of the family, lifestyles and schooling; and issues concerning identity, migration and religion. The main subjects represented at the institute are social and cultural anthropology, political science, economics, human geography, history, social psychology and sociology. The independent Social Science Research Group (GIS) was founded by Ad√©rito Sedas Nunes in 1962. It became an autonomous institute of the University of Lisbon in 1982 and acquired the status of associated state laboratory in 2002. The central activities of the ICS include: publishing research in book form and in articles in Portuguese and international journals of reference; advanced education to the level of master's degrees and doctorates; maintaining a dialogue with the international scientific community; and spreading knowledge in the wider community‚Äîan increasingly important activity to ensure the necessary interaction between science and citizenship. An√°lise Social (Social Analysis), Portugal's oldest and most prestigious peer-reviewed social science journal, together with the ICS's own publishing house, Imprensa de Ci√™ncias Sociais (Social Science Press) are the most visible manifestations of the institute's activities. The ICS is located at the University of Lisbon campus in a central area of the city next to the national library (Biblioteca Nacional). Its new offices, opened in 2003, were especially designed for the institute's research activities and postgraduate courses. The Library, which has 40,000 books and subscribes to 313 periodicals, is also home to the fast- growing Social History Archive (AHS). Currently (2008), the institute has about 70 researchers and 100 postgraduate students and is engaged in about 200 research projects. Nearly 70 per cent of its activities are financed from its own funds, which are obtained competitively.

Students apply by creating a 1-2 minute video detailing their idea for a new invention intended to solve an everyday problem. Ten finalists are chosen annually to work alongside a 3M scientist during a summer mentorship and receive a trip to the 3M Innovation Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, to compete for $25,000 and the title of America's Top Young Scientist.  Selection process  The entry period is from December until April each year. A panel of judges from Discovery Education and its partner organizations, educators, and science professionals score qualifying entry videos and choose 10 finalists and up to 51 merit winners, one from each state and the District of Columbia, based on the following criteria: *Creativity (ingenuity and innovative thinking) (30%) *Scientific knowledge (30%) *Persuasiveness and effective communication (20%) *Overall presentation (20%) Students are required to address an everyday problem and articulate how the problem directly impacts them, their families, their communities, and/or the global population. The idea must be a new innovation or solution, and cannot be a behavioral change or a new use for an existing product. Judges also look for the level of understanding of scientific concepts and confidence in communicating science in general exhibited in the videos. The ten finalists undergo a summer menotoship and in the fall travel to 3M's headquarters in Minnesota to participate in the Young Scientist Challenge Final Event. They visit 3M labs, meet 3M scientists, and tour the 3M Innovation Center, and also participate in a series of other scored challenges to demonstrate their scientific knowledge and communication abilities. For their final challenge, they then present the innovation that they developed during their mentorship. Here the finalists are judged by a panel of judges selected by Discovery Education and its partner organizations according to the following guidelines: *Creativity (ingenuity and innovative thinking) demonstrated in the presentation (30%) *Scientific knowledge demonstrated in the presentation (20%) *Effective use of a 3M technology in the innovation (10%) *Ranking from the Final Event's scored scientific challenges (40%) After the Final Event, participants attend an award ceremony and dinner, at which the winner of the title \\"America‚Äôs Top Young Scientist\\" is announced. =Prizes= First Place (America's Top Young Scientist) *$25,000 *Trip to Costa Rica (or similar destination) *Contest trophy Three Runner-Up Prize winners *A trip to Costa Rica (or similar destination) Six Second Prize winners *\\"Excitations\\" for a $500 excursion Minor Planets Named After Finalists *NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Small Body Database Up to 51 Merit Winners (one from each state and the District of Columbia) *3M Innovation Prize Packs  History  Formerly known as the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge (DCYSC), the Young Scientist challenge was created in 1999 as an engineering research and exhibit competition for students in grades 5 through 8. It was sponsored primarily by Discovery Communications, Society for Science and the Public, and Elmer's Glue. Competitors were originally qualified for DCYSC by entering an International Science and Engineering-affiliated science fair and being nominated by a teacher or professional. Students completed an application that included several essays, which were then evaluated for communication abilities by DCYSC judges, who selected 400 semi-finalists and 40 finalists who received an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. to compete in the final competition. The finals consisted of two parts. The first was a research presentation, accounting for 20% of the total score, held at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, the National Academy of Sciences, or another academic national association that varied from year to year. The second was a series of six science-related challenges at the National Institutes of Health or the University of Maryland. Each challenge concluded with some type of presentation (e.g., a radio show, a TV show, or a news conference) worth 10% of the students' total score. Students also presented a simple science experiment, known as a Whelmer, in front of cameras for 15% of their score. The remaining 5% came from teamwork, as the finalists were split into eight teams consisting of five members each for the science challenges. In 2008 the contest became the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge. Students no longer have to be nominated and now submit a 1-2 minute video clip as their form of entry. Kara Fan from San Diego won the 2019 top prize, with a nano-particle bandage concept. She made an anti-bacterial bandage with a silver particle solution to win the 2019 3M Young Scientist Challenge.  Challenge themes  Since 2003, themes for the Young Scientist Challenge have followed scientific curiosities and been built on the activities and innovations around them. *In 2003, the activities were based on the 100th anniversary of the first flight of the Wright Brothers on December 17, 1903, and included a reproduction of the Wright Brother's 1901 wind tunnel and lift balance, which allowed contestants to test various wing designs for lift, and rocket-propelled go carts powered by compressed carbon dioxide gas. *In 2004, the activities were based on the 100th anniversary of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, celebrated in the World Year of Physics 2005. *In 2005, inspired by the events of Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, the activities were about understanding natural disasters and included a 20-foot tall vortex (tornado) generator, a 40-foot tsunami wave tank simulator, and procedures to safely dispose of biological waste after a natural disaster. *In 2006, the activities were based on the theme \\"Disease Detectives\\" inspired by the H5N1 avian influenza scare. Contestants participated in virtual colonoscopy screening, mold identification and remediation, and avian flu containment using herd immunity models. *In 2008, the activities centered on NASA-themed challenges. Finalists met NASA scientists and had the opportunity to work in a 1/6th gravity simulation, attempt a repair to the Hubble Telescope, and look for water on Mars. *In 2009, the finalists went through four rounds of challenges based on the theme \\"The Science of Everyday Life\\". *In 2010, activities focused on ways to keep humans safe. Contestants were judged on their knowledge of science and their ability to apply it to areas of safety and security.

History  On August 27, 1898, the school directors of the City of Sweetwater purchased the Bachman Building on College Street for $6,000 for use by Sweetwater City Schools. On September 9, 1912, Sweetwater High School opened at this location under Principal E. Gatewood Hall. Initially, there were three teachers and 35 students. On May 5, 1914, Essie Pennington became the school's first graduate. In September 1916, the school moved to a new site, the former home of Sweetwater Military College, and the future home of Sweetwater Hospital. In July 1926, the Monroe County Court voted to fund the current site of the school. Fourteen acres of the Cannon Farm on Athens Pike were purchased for a price of $7,500. In September, Young and Stoner were awarded the contract to build the school building. Total cost was $136,000. This brick, two-story building was approximately 28,000 square feet and contained 14 classrooms, a gymnasium, an auditorium/study hall, and an apartment for the principal or caretaker. The distinctive \\"bowl\\" in front of the building was created at this time, due to the excavation of needed fill dirt. The building was completed by September 1928. By now, the school have five teachers, 240 students, and Principal R.M. Ivins. The curriculum included business, science, math, history, home economics, English, French, and Latin. In 1927, the school adopted the \\"Wild Cats\\" mascot, previously being known as the \\"Tornadoes\\", this being the current mascot of cross-county rivals Madisonville. On March 7, 1930, the Sweetwater PTA approved a $10 expenditure for the installation of the \\"SWEETWATER HIGH\\" letters on the side of \\"The Bowl\\". In 1935, the Works Progress Administration began work on a football field adjacent to the school. Previously, home games had been played at the fairgrounds, Kiwanis Field, or the neighboring Tennessee Military Institute. The cost of the field was $4,722. In 1963, the current cafeteria was built. The previous cafeteria was converted into a library and offices. In 1964, the school became integrated. In 1965, the aptly-named \\"Round Building\\" was built, including classrooms and locker rooms around the perimeter, and a 1,500-seat gymnasium in the center. The former gymnasium was converted into a band room and agricultural shop. During the 1980s, a new football stadium was built, seating 3,500. In the mid-1990s, the main building was renovated. Eight classrooms were added, and an elevator and chairlift were installed. In 2004, an 11-room addition was built, at a cost of $1.9 million.  Student demographics  In 2014, Sweetwater High School had 591 students: 98.3% Caucasian, 1.3% African- American, and 0.7% other.  Athletics  Sweetwater has a diversified athletics program, including football, basketball, cross country, softball, soccer, golf, baseball, and cheerleading. Sweetwater won state championships in football in 1971 and 1972 (coached by King Berrong), and 1993 (coached by Bill Dupes Sr.) In 1993, Sweetwater won both the TSSAA AA State Championship in football and the TSSAA AA State Championship in basketball. They also went to the state tournament in TSSAA AA baseball. In 2012, the Wildcats football team reached the Tennessee State 6AA finals, coming in second, as did the girls' soccer team. In 2013, the Wildcats competitive cheerleading team came in second in the State finals. Kippy Brown a Sweetwater High School graduate, also helped his prep team lead the state in scoring in 1972 and 1973. Following his high school career, Brown attended Memphis State University (currently known as University of Memphis), where he was quarterback for the Memphis State University Tigers from 1975 to 1977. Brown's Tigers upset sixth- ranked Auburn University 31‚Äì20 in 1975. Brown engineered this victory by completing seven of 11 passes for 103 yards and two touchdowns. Brown was the interim coach for the University of Tennessee Vols, after former head coach, Lane Kiffin, announced that he was leaving the program to take a position at the University of Southern California. Brown had experience at UT under former head coaches Johnny Majors and Philip Fulmer.

Cristman was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Herkimer Co.) in 1914. He was a member of the New York State Senate (32nd D.) in 1915 and 1916; and was Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections. At the New York state election, 1926, he ran as an \\"Independent Republican\\" for U.S. Senator from New York. Cristman was a \\"dry\\" Republican, and was supported, and fervently campaigned for, by the Prohibition Party, although he didn't appear on the ballot under the Prohibition line. He polled about 232,000 votes, and thus spoiled the re-election of the \\"wet\\" Republican incumbent James W. Wadsworth, Jr. who had openly and forcefully opposed Prohibition. Wadsworth was defeated by Democrat Robert F. Wagner with a plurality of about 116,000 votes. Cristman died on August 3, 1942, in Herkimer, New York; and was buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery there.

The main companies associated with the Principal Group were First Investors Corporation, Associated Investors of Canada and Principal Savings and Trust Corporation. The associated corporations within the Principal Group grew to more than $1 billion of assets. The corporations were closed by regulators in 1987 and subsequently liquidated. At the time of the closures, approximately 67,000 investors were at risk of losing an estimated $500 million in funds advanced to Principal Group entities. Various provincial governments, including the Government of Alberta, the main regulator, paid an estimated $140 million in compensation on the losses of investor-savers, based on deficiencies in regulatory oversight.Brian Brennan, Principal Group Collapse: The Man Who Knew\\".

The legal fees associated with the collapse are estimated to have cost him $10 million. Donald Cormie pleaded guilty under the Investors Act to misleading investors and was fined half a million dollars. In addition, the Tax Court of Canada ordered him to pay $4 million in back taxes on a $7.2 million loan he took from Principal just before it collapsed. A further ruling was made by a judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, who ruled that Donald Cormie made improper payouts totalling half a million dollars to creditors who were family members or company employees, and ordered that the creditors give back the money.

Published for the first time in 1964, the text parodies the memories written by veterans of the 1910 Mexican Revolution and the armed revolts that continued to destabilize the country for the next two decades. Since many of those veterans had joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) --a political organization that had ruled Mexico by rigging elections and engaging in massive corruption and cronyism for most of the 20th century-- the topic was still considered off- limits by the governing regime (and the literary critics that sympathized with it) at the time of its publication. Critically, the novel went on to receive the 1964 Casa de las Am√©ricas annual prize. It has also been distributed among Mexican public schools through the National Reading Program and it was selected by the Guadalajara International Book Fair to celebrate the 2010 World Book Day. Plot Fictional Army General Jos√© Guadalupe \\"Lupe\\" Arroyo, a veteran of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, attempts to dispel all sorts of \\"defamatory claims\\" made by his political rivals and tries to explain the plainly incompetent political and military strategies devised by him and his associates. Style In the novel, Ibearg√ºengoitia caricaturizes the solemn language and rhetoric frequently found in some autobiographical memoirs of the period. Except in a few instances where the passage at hand is not controversial, most characters, cities, and even states are entirely fictional, as the author tried to avert a direct confrontation with members of the ruling party. Publication According to the author, he finished writing the novel in 1963 --some twenty years before his untimely death in a plane accident. The first edition consisted of 10,000 copies printed in May 1964 by Casa de las Am√©ricas in Havana, Cuba, celebrating its winning entry for best novel in its annual prize. In Mexico, it was first available until May 1965 through Joaqu√≠n Mortiz; a publishing house acquired by Grupo Planeta in 1983. Most covers used by Planeta through both its Joaqu√≠n Mortiz and Booket imprints include a painting by his widow, British-born artist Joy Laville. As for its English edition, Ibarg√ºengoitia negotiated a translation with Dr. Jack Robert in 1970 but, according to V√≠ctor D√≠az Arciniega, it was never completed. In 1986, Irene del Corral became the first official translator and her version was published by Bard/Avon Books (New York) under the title The Lightning of August. The same translation was adapted to British English and published in the United Kingdom by Chatto & Windus (1986). In total, the novel has been translated into seven languages.

Co-founder Moshe Nazarathy led a research and development center named \\"Harmonic Data\\" in Israel starting in 1993, funded in part by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. Harmonic acquired the DiviCom business of C-Cube Microsystems in 2000 for about $1.7 billion in stock. It acquired the video networking software business of Entone Technologies in 2006 for about $45 million, Rhozet Corporation in 2007, and Scopus Video Networks, Ltd. in 2009. Omneon Video Networks was founded in May 1998, with investors including Advanced Technology Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Accel Partners and Invesco. Omneon co-founder Donald M. Craig designed products that won Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards in 1988 and 1996. On December 29, 2006 Omneon filed for an initial public offering, and tried again several times in 2007 and 2008 after dropping the \\"Video Networks\\" from its name, but remained private.

Products  Harmonic‚Äôs products fall into four principal categories; video production products, video server products for playout, video processing products, and cable edge products. Video production products are used to support video editing, post-production and finishing. Server systems are used to assemble and play out one or more channel systems. Video processing products are used by media companies, broadcasters, telcos, satellite operators, cable operators, and OTT operators to acquire and use different types and sources of video signals. Cable edge products are used by cable operators to deliver customized broadcast or on-demand and data services to their subscribers. The company supplies cable television headend or hub devices that receive digital video or data from the operator network, re-packetizes the video or data into an MPEG transport stream, then digitally modulates the MPEG transport stream onto a downstream RF channel using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Harmonic sells its products to cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media companies. In 2012, United States customers included Cablevision Systems, CenturyLink, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, DirecTV, EchoStar Holding, TRC Integration, Time Warner Cable, and Turner Broadcasting.

Most of the autograph of the work was thought to be lost until 1982, when it was discovered from the legacy of Maurice Dumesnil, a pupil of Debussy's. The first edition was published in 1986.  Movements  The work is in four movements: # Andantino con moto allegro # Scherzo: Moderato con allegro # Andante espressivo # Finale: Appassionato A typical performance lasts 20-25 minutes.  Critical response  In 1984, music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of an early, incomplete recording of the trio: \\"The Debussy piece is juvenilia. You can have a lot of fun putting it on the turntable and asking your learned friends who the composer is. Nothing in the music suggests Debussy. It is sweet, sentimental, and sugared; it verges on the salon.\\" Reviewer Charlotte Gardner for the BBC wrote in 2012, of a later recording: \\"Debussy's teenage Piano Trio doesn't often get to see the light of day, mostly because it reveals him very much still in feet-finding mode. Still, it's an enjoyable listen, and it‚Äôs interesting to compare its pizzicato second movement with that of the Quartet, and the Brodskys and [pianist] Jean-Efflam Bavouzet are evidently having some fun.

The filly passed into the ownership of Raymond Tooth and was sent into training with Richard Hannon Sr. at East Everleigh, Wiltshire. She was ridden in all of her races by Richard Hughes. Racing career =2006: two-year-old season= Indian Ink began her racing career by finishing unplaced in a six furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse in June. Seventeen days later, over the same course and distance, she recorded her first success when she \\"comfortably\\" won a similar event by two and a half lengths from twelve opponent. In July the filly was moved up in class for the Group Three Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. She started the 4/1 favourite but finished fourth behind Scarlet Runner, Vital Statistics and Simply Perfect. A month later she was moved up in class again for the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse. She led from the start but was caught in the closing strides and beaten half a length by the Barry Hills-trained Silk Blossom, with Scarlet Runner unplaced. Indian Ink next appeared in the Watership Down Stud Sales Stakes, a valuable event confined to fillies who had been offered for sale at Tattersall in October 2005. Racing over six and a half furlongs on soft ground, she was made 9/4 favourite in a field of twenty-two runners. She broke clear of the field in the final quarter mile and won by three lengths from Siamese Cat with the future Gamely Handicap winner Diamond Diva three lengths further back in third place. According to the Daily Telegraph's correspondent, the winner \\"strolled home\\", in the race, with her rivals \\"strung out like washing\\". A week after her win at Ascot, Indian Ink was moved up to Group One level for the first time when she was one of eleven fillies to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden as usual by Hughes, she was made 3/1 joint favourite alongside the French-trained Prix Morny runner-up Magic America. Indian Ink was settled behind the leaders before making progress in the final quarter mile, catching the outsider Dhanyata in the closing stages and winning \\"tenaciously\\" by a neck. =2007: three-year-old season= Indian Ink began her three-year-old season at Newbury where she contested the seven furlong Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. She was made 15/8 favourite, but despite finishing strongly she failed by a neck to catch the 25/1 outsider Majestic Roi. In the 1000 Guineas two weeks later she finished fifth of the twenty-one runners on fast ground behind the Irish filly Finsceal Beo. At Royal Ascot on 22 June Indian Ink was the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Group One Coronation Stakes over one mile: she had been offered at 25/1 on the morning of the race, but attracted strong support as heavy showers of rain led to a softening of the ground. Her opponents included Finsceal Beo, Majestic Roi, Silk Blossom, Mi Emma (winner of the German 1,000 Guineas) and Darjina, a French filly who had defeated Finsceal Beo in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. Hughes restrained the filly in the early stages before making ground approaching the straight. Indian Ink took the lead a furlong from the finish and accelerated clear of her opponents to win by six lengths from Mi Emma who beat Darjina by a head for second place. After the race, Hannon explained that \\"The ground made a big difference. All her best runs last year were on easier ground. Just a bit of give in the ground is fine. In the 1,000 Guineas, the ground was very fast and she got into a bit of trouble.\\" Hughes said that Indian Ink \\"has an explosive turn of foot. I have to be careful when to kick on. It was just a matter of not going too soon.\\" Despite plans to run the filly in the Falmouth Stakes or the Matron Stakes, Indian Ink did not race again. At the end of the year Indian Ink was sent to the Tattersalls December Mares Sale and was sold for 2,000,000 guineas to Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. Assessment In the 2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Indian Ink was given a rating of 121 making her the 29th best racehorse in the world and the fourth best three-year-old filly behind Rags to Riches, Darjina and Peeping Fawn. Stud record Indian Ink was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her new owner. The first of her foals to reach the racecourse was Wahaab, a chestnut colt by Tamayuz, who won a maiden race at Goodwood on his debut in May 2013.

He wrote one of the first published accounts of the Okefenokee Swamp. His diary portrays elite planter life on the Georgia frontier.  Early and family life  Charles Rinaldo Floyd was born October 14, 1797 at \\"The Thickets\\" near Darien in McIntosh County, Georgia to General John Floyd and Isabella Maria Hazzard. His grandfather, Captain Charles Floyd, served in the American Revolutionary War. His father, General John Floyd, served during the War of 1812 and the Creek Indian War. When he was three years old the family moved to Camden County where they purchased large tracts of land located south of the Satilla River, north of the Crooked River and west of the marshes and the Cumberland River to what is now I-95. This area, farmed using enslaved labor, became known as \\"Floyd's Neck.\\" General John Floyd built Bellevue Plantation within view of the marshes leading to Todd's Creek for his father, Charles. That manor house has an anchor-shaped footprint, to symbolize their fortunes provided by the sea. One mile distant, he built Fairfield Plantation overlooking Floyd's Basin and Floyd's Creek for himself. Charles Rinaldo Floyd spent his early childhood years in Camden County. He was educated at home by tutors and later went to boarding school in Beaufort, South Carolina. He attended Sunbury Academy in Sunbury, Georgia. As discussed below, at age sixteen, Charles Rinaldo Floyd left Sunbury Academy to serve as a military aide to his father, General John Floyd, whose army at that time was entrenched at Fort Mitchell. Afterward, Floyd attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, but was dismissed in 1817 for insubordination over what he considered \\"a point of honor.\\" He received a marine lieutenant's commission nonetheless, as discussed below, but was court martialed and suspended with pay in 1820 for caning a storekeeper who had insulted a sentinel. Charles used the time to travel to Europe and tour Napoleonic battlefields. On May 22, 1823 Charles Rinaldo Floyd married Catharine Sophia Powell in Boston. They had two daughters, both born in Camden County, after Mrs. Floyd moved to Camden County to live with her in-laws. However, she missed her friends and relatives in Boston, so in 1828, she sailed for Boston with a servant and her fourteen- month-old baby. On disembarking in Boston Harbor, the servant slid off of the dock and fell into the water with the baby. A gentleman passenger jumped into the cold water and rescued both, but the child died. Charles was initially not told of his little daughter's demise. However, his wife went into a severe mental decline and lost her desire to live. Her sister and grandmother both urged Charles to travel to Boston and see about her. He reluctantly agreed and sailed to Boston, only to discover that both his wife and daughter had died. Charles Rinaldo Floyd met Julia Ross Boog, who became his second wife, at a friend's wedding. He was immediately smitten, describing her as tall, lithe, with dark brown eyes and with thick dark, cascading hair. They were married on September 9, 1831 at Bellevue Plantation. They had seven children. Julia Ross Boog was born April 16, 1815 at King's Bay Plantation near St. Marys, Georgia, the daughter of John Boog and Isabella Kelly~King Turner. Charles and Julia and their children lived at Fairfield, a traditional two-story Southern style home, which his father gave them. An armory was added to house the array of weapons collected by Charles: swords, lances, daggers, knives, double barrel guns, dueling and long-shot rifles, carbines, pistols, dueling pistols, bows and arrows. The stately home also had a library and a sketching room where Charles painted miniatures of family members as well as his now famous horse sketches.Chris T. Trowell. Exploring the Okefenokee: Letters and Diaries from the Indian Wars, 1836-1842 (Douglas, Ga.: privately printed, 1992). Early military, plantation and political careers At age sixteen, Charles Rinaldo Floyd left Sunbury Academy to serve as a military aide to his father, General John Floyd, whose army at that time was entrenched at Fort Mitchell. During the Creek Indian War, he saw combat in the Battles of Tallassee, Chalibee and Autossee. Autossee was an Indian town of the Creek Nation on the Tallapoosa River. The Georgia militia cut off escape routes, then completely destroyed and burned the town and slaughtered more than 200 Indians, including women and children. According to his Journal, in the frenzy of his first battle, a rifle ball grazed Charles' forehead and another passed through his coat sleeve. Floyd then attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was dismissed in 1817 for insubordination over what he considered \\"a point of honor.\\" Floyd's family background and early training as a soldier resulted in a penchant for dueling, a practice he engaged in throughout his lifetime. After his dismissal from West Point, Floyd received a commission as lieutenant in the marines. In 1820, Lieutenant Floyd was arrested for caning a naval store keeper who had insulted a sentinel. He was tried before a Marine Military Court and suspended from duty for twelve months with full pay and emoluments. In his Journal he wrote, \\"I wish to see the Old World in my youth, the best time for observation and improvement\\". He decided to travel to England and the Napoleonic battlefields of Europe, and returned to marine duty in 1821. In 1824, Floyd served as Commander of the Marine Honor Guard whose primary goal was to protect the Marquis de Lafayette when he arrived in New York City to tour the United States. In 1825, Floyd resigned his commission in the Marine Corps and returned to Camden County to take up life as a gentleman planter. In 1829, he served as a Georgia Legislator in the House of Representatives at Milledgeville in Baldwin County, Georgia. He was elected brigadier general for the Georgia Militia's 1st Brigade of the 1st Division.Smith, Gordon Burns, History of the Georgia Militia, 1783-1861, Volume One, Campaigns and Generals, Boyd Publishing, 2000, p 289 In 1837, an altercation arose over cattle. A neighbor, Edward Stevens Hopkins, allowed his slaves to capture and kill Floyd's cows that had roamed onto his property and trampled his patches of peas. In his Journal, Charles Rinaldo Floyd labeled Hopkins as \\"the cow-thief\\" and \\"the enemy\\". The true reason for the confrontation was that Edward S. Hopkins announced his name for election as Major of the 8th Battalion, First Regiment, Georgia Militia. Floyd felt, that as Brigadier-General, he alone had the right to order such an election and he challenged Hopkins to a duel. Hopkins accepted under the Code Duello. In October 1837 a \\"battle\\" was fought on Amelia Island Beach. Hopkins fell at the first fire, shot in the upper leg near the hip. He survived but thereafter walked with a severe limp. Long after the duel, Floyd continued to refer to Hopkins in derogatory terms. In May 1838, under orders from Governor Gilmer, Charles Rinaldo Floyd commanded troops effecting removal of Cherokee Indians from northern Georgia. Indian families were rounded up and placed in internment camps before their forced march out West ‚Äì clearly written about in textbooks today and well-documented as The Trail of Tears. At his headquarters at New Echota he wrote to troops under his command, \\"A truly good soldier is known chiefly by his ready compliance with the orders of his superior ‚Äì his valor in battle, and his humanity to the vanquished\\".  Second Seminole War and Okefenokee Campaign  Floyd was appointed brigadier general of the Georgia militia in October 1838 and ordered to meet five companies and chase a party of Seminoles out of the Okefenokee Swamp. The Indian refugees had been forced north during the Second Seminole Wars, and their presence caused anxiety and conflict in the south Georgia. He wrote letters detailing his Okefenokee campaign to regional newspapers. The Savannah Georgian printed his first letter, and multiple newspapers reprinted it. He wrote that it was ‚Äúa satisfaction to me to have performed what all other men have deemed impossible; to cross the Okefenokee with an army.‚ÄùMegan Kate Nelson. Trembling Earth: A Cultural History of the Okefenokee Swamp. University of Georgia Press, 2005. However, Floyd was deeply disappointed the following year when the Georgia legislature appointed Peter Cone rather than himself as Major General of the state militia.  Retirement  In April 1843 he sold 2,000 acres of land to fund his hobbies. He founded of the Camden County Hunting Club, and his racing boats were famous in the area. Canoes especially were a travel and sporting boat of choice in the area and they were manned by crews of strong slaves in races. He was a secretary of the Aquatic Club of Georgia, and in 1837 challenged New York boating clubs to a race.E. Merton Coulter. ‚ÄúBoating as a Sport in the Old South.‚Äù The Georgia Historical Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 3. September, 1943. Floyd was also an avid collector of rare and antique weapons, and sometimes hunted with a medieval-style lance.Gordon Burns Smith. History of the Georgia Militia, 1783-1861. Volume III. Boyd Publishing Company, 2000. The Charles Rinaldo Floyd Monument is located at the site of the former Fairfield Plantation on Floyd's Neck in Camden County, Georgia Death and legacy Charles Rinaldo Floyd died on March 22, 1845 at his beloved Fairfield Plantation. After hours of excruciating pain in his right side, he died at 2:00 o'clock in the morning with his wife sitting beside him. At his request, his body was wrapped in an American Flag and buried under a pine tree at Fairfield Plantation. Soldiers who had served under him erected a marble monument in his honor.James Vocelle.

In 1964 it was taken over by ICI after ICI had tried and failed to take over Courtaulds.  Beginning In 1939, ICI took out a licence to manufacture nylon fibre. Realizing that they needed the experience of a specialised textile firm, ICI formed a partnership with Courtaulds, who were leading suppliers of viscose rayon. In January 1940 they registered British Nylon Spinners as a limited company with a nominal capital of ¬£300,000 and took equal shares in the company. The product was badly needed to make parachutes, especially after Japan's entry into the war in December 1941 blocked supplies of silk.Historybook AkzoNobel, p 235The Times, 3 January 1940, pg. 12 In March 1940 Courtaulds announced that they were building a plant which would go into production in the autumn.The Times, 15 March 1940, pg. 3 This was at Lockhurst Lane, Coventry. Production began on 23 January 1941.Elliott page 5The Times, 12 March 1941, pg. 9 At this stage nylon polymer and spinner units were being supplied from the U.S. by DuPont. The site was bombed on 14 November 1940 and 8 April 1941. The second attack stopped production for several weeks. It was agreed with the Ministry of Supply that they should find a safer site. Banbury was considered but the final choice was Stowmarket, Suffolk, where ICI Paints Division was already established. Two- thirds of production would be here and one third at Coventry. Limited production began at Stowmarket in December 1942 and full production in June 1943. Both Coventry and Stowmarket closed in 1948.Elliott pp 6,7 In March 1945 it was announced that they had purchased a site in South Wales.The Times, 20 March 1945, pg. 7 This was at Mamhilad, Pontypool.Elliott p7 In November 1945, it was announced that F. C. Bagnall had been appointed managing director of the company, which was based in Coventry.The Times, 5 November 1945, pg. 7 In May 1947 ICI announced that they were building a new plant in Billingham to make nylon polymer. This would have a capacity of 10,000 lb. per year. Some of this polymer would go to Plastics Division but most would go to BNS. During the war polymer had been made in Huddersfield and used to make parachutes, rope and other materials.The Times, 9 May 1947, pg. 10 In July 1948 Courtaulds announced that the Pontypool factory was near completion but there were delays owing to shortage of construction materials.The Times, 12 July 1948, pg. 8 The first yarn was spun at Pontypool on 20 April 1948. However, there were quality problems so initially only one machine was in experimental use. The first problem was with discoloured polymer; then there was a wide variety of yarn production issues. These took months of combined effort to solve. By September 1948 they were ready to run three machines.Elliott p 21/2 In July 1949 Courtaulds announced that production had begun at Pontypool in the previous April. They expected full production to be reached by the end of the year. Most production would have to be exported under government direction.The Times, 5 July 1949, pg. 8 However it wasn't until May 1950 that all production was passed from development personnel to production personnel. When completed, the Pontypool site had a production plant, a pilot plant, a building devoted to testing and developing the products to support their successful use by customers (Technical Development Department), an administration block and a research and development block.Elliott p 8 Most of the buildings were still present in 2011. They can be found at the junction, near Little Mill, between the A4042 and the minor road to Mamhilad. In February 1949 the CIC granted permission to increase the capital from ¬£6 million to ¬£8 million.The Times, 1 February 1949, pg. 7 Operation and growth In 1950 BNS reduced their prices by more than 20% owing to increased production volume and improving methods.The Times, 6 June 1950, pg. 8 Also Courtaulds said BNS was close to full production and planning to increase capacity. This would mean retaining profits within BNS but Courtaulds and ICI hoped that they would soon receive some reward for their investment. The outlook was good.The Times, 4 July 1950, pg. 8 One year later they said BNS had made substantial progress and work had begun on expansion.The Times, 10 July 1951, pg. 9; also 13 July pg. 9 In 1952 progress was continuing.The Times, 8 July 1952, pg. 10 In 1952 BNS had to go to court to defend its right to produce its product. Du Pont had granted nylon thread patents to ICI in December 1946. In turn ICI had granted exclusive rights to BNS the following March. However the US Attorney General had begun a long term action in the US under the Sherman Act in 1944. On 30 July 1952 the judge made an order requiring ICI to reassign the patents to Du Pont within 90 days. This would have ruined BNS so they applied to the British court to obtain an injunction to restrain ICI from complying with the US court's order. The judge decided that it would be quite wrong for a foreign court to impose an order on a British company forcing them to break a contract which had been entered upon properly and fairly in the course of commercial operations.The Times, 16 October 1952, pg. 3The Times, 17 October 1952, pg. 11 This decision was appealed and the appeal court confirmed it, noting that the US judge had expressed some doubt as to the likelihood of his decision being accepted in the UK.The Times, 24 June 1954, pg. 4The Times, 10 July 1954, pg. 5 In 1953 the company provided nylon to John Southworth and Sons of Manchester to make special clothing for the Everest expedition.The Times, 9 June 1953, pg. 4 The company announced that they had acquired a factory formerly used by British Bemberg Ltd in Doncaster. The factory was being adapted for the production of nylon yarn. In 1955 they made a start with about 350 people eventually expanding to 1500.The Times, 12 February 1954, pg. 5 In 1954 the managing director Bagnall announced that the prices of all fine denier nylon yarn would be reduced by 15% and staple by 10%. This would make it the cheapest in the world.The Times, 15 April 1954, pg. 8 In 1955 a purpose-built clubhouse was built at Pontypool. It was opened on 5 November by Lord Raglan, the Lord Lieutenant. It had a fine hall used for dancing and concerts. Over the years many famous performers gave concerts there. In 1959/60 a clubhouse was built at Doncaster. It was opened on 10 October 1960 by the Earl of Scarborough. In May 1963 a clubhouse was opened at Gloucester.Elliott pages 64, 76, 77, 86, 88 In 1957 The Times published a Textile Glossary, which included nylon. There were now some 40 different types of nylon stockings on the market including yarn as fine as 9 denier, five times finer than human hair.The Times, 14 January 1957, pg. 11 Also in 1957 the Melbourne correspondent of The Times reported that BNS had decided to manufacture the first nylon yarn in Australia.The Times, 22 May 1957, pg. 15 In September of the same year, plans for big extensions were announced for Doncaster Works. 900 people were working there. This would increase by 400‚Äì500 men and 50‚Äì100 women. The cost was estimated at ¬£3-¬£4 M. Completion was due by the end of 1958. Eventually there would be 1800 people of whom 90% would be men. There would be a three shift system. Besides production, team of experts would be employed to improve the company's expertise with nylon staple.The Times, 25 September 1957, pg. 6 In December BNS announced that they had developed an elasticised yarn. Manufacturers of stockings could now produce ranges with only three size fittings.The Times, 16 December 1957, pg. 11 In 1958 the Navy announced that its new aircraft direction frigate HMS Llandaff was to be equipped with nylon and Terylene ropes instead of the traditional wire ropes. It was said that commercial shipping had been doing so for some time. Compared with wire they gave much more strength relative to weight, retained flexibility in the cold, withstood sudden shocks, and retained strength in the wet.The Times, 9 April 1958, pg. 5 Also in 1958 BNS applied to the Board of Trade to build a nylon factory at Leigh Park, Havant, Portsmouth. It was to cost ¬£10M, employ 2000 people, and cover 100 acres. The local authorities supported the application.The Times, 16 August 1958, pg. 4 The application was rejected on the grounds that other parts of the country were in more need.The Times, 18 September 1958, pg. 3 There were protests but they were unavailing.The Times, 19 September 1958, pg. 16The Times, 14 October 1958, pg. 13 The Secretary of State for Scotland met a deputation from Greenock Town Council to discuss unemployment there. He said he hoped that BNS could be persuaded to make their new investment in Scotland and that a great deal of work had been done on a ¬£6M proposal for a new dry dock in Greenock.The Times, 10 October 1958, pg. 5 There had also been a delay in the delivery of new nylon-twisting machines at Doncaster Works. Skilled operatives were being employed on unskilled work to avoid losing them.The Times, 12 September 1958, pg. 5 In 1962, BNS took over a site near the old Gloster Aircraft Company site near Gloucester, employing people made redundant by the closure of the famous aircraft company. They expected to employ about 2,500 people.The Times, 24 May 1962, pg. 8The Times, 12 May 1972, pg. II BNS had a weekly paper Signpost and a monthly BNS Magazine for internal consumption. Signpost was renamed Fibres Post in 1965.Elliott page 112 BNS had subsidiaries abroad in: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, (Germany), United States (in partnership with ICI and Celanese) and Canada. Some of these manufactured yarn, others were purely sales operations.Elliott, Chapter 9, pp 92‚Äì98 ICI takeover In 1962 ICI made a takeover bid for Courtaulds. Courtaulds resisted it vigorously and won the battle.Chem. Eng. News, 22 January, page 21; 29 January, pp 25‚Äì26; 26 March, pp 25‚Äì29, 1962 However, talks between the two companies continued and in April 1964 they made recommendations to their shareholders. ICI would surrender its 37.5 per cent holding in Courtaulds and pay Courtaulds two million pounds a year for five years, \\"to take account of the future development expenditure of Courtaulds in the nylon field\\". In return Courtaulds were to transfer to ICI their 50 per cent holding in BNS.Keesing's Record of World Events (formerly Keesing's Contemporary Archives), Volume 10 (1964) , Jul 1964 United Kingdom, page 20162 BNS was absorbed into ICI's existing fibres operation, ICI Fibres, which was based on polyester.

Public works B√∂hm's long term involvement with the art and architecture collective Public Works started in 1999 through a collaborative public art commission together with Stefan Saffer and Andreas Lang. She is a founding member of the group. Public Works is a shared space and practice for researching, discussing and implementing art in relation to everyday public space. Public Works was set up as a truly inter-disciplinary practice, in which both professional fields, art and architecture, are allowed to explore the autonomous and the applied through collaboration. The focus of Public Works is the urban public realm and its participatory development in the context of self-initiatives and formal regeneration programs. Important projects developed during B√∂hm's thirteen years of practice include Mobile Porch, a roaming mini-architecture for urban neighborhoods, Park Products for the Serpentine Gallery and Kensington Gardens and most recently Colchester Inn, a multi-authored new public space for firstside's adjacent city square.

Together with the artist group myvillages.org at Grizedale Arts) The International Village Shop is a cultural initiative and project to support and initiate local production and its trans-local dissemination. The first International Village Shop was run by Myvillages.org in collaboration with public works on the occasion of Grizedale Arts‚Äô \\"Agrifashionsita TV\\" programme at the Royal Academy in London. The network of production and trading spaces that are linked to the project have grown since, with temporary and permanent shops in the UK, Russia, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Chile, California, China, Sweden, France, Switzerland and Ghana. New Village Goods are produced in some places, with local interest groups and external guests collaborating on the development and manufacturing of new objects and goods. =Village produce films= (2008. Together with Wapke Feenstra from myvillages.org and Michael Smythe) The films are short documentaries about the background of products, which are on offer at the International Village Shop. The shop is an ongoing collective initiative by myvillages.org, public works, Grizedale Arts and somewhere, to create temporary and permanent trading platforms for the exchange of local produce across a network of rural and urban spaces. The collection of films shows the multiple places and individuals involved in the overall project. The different scales of the individual village, to private production sites are captured in the films. The films are shown during shop settings, and explain the extended network of producers and production sites that make the International Village Shop. =The Show Room= (2013. In collaboration with Pursuing Independent Paths (PIP)) On June 19‚Äì22, 2013, her exhibit titled \\"Kathrin Bohm: I am a shop\\" appeared at The Show Room in London and was developed within the Communal Knowledge programme, which is supported by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation among other charities.

It was first published on 1 November 2010 in Australia and was then released in the United States a year later. It follows the story of two gypsy boys that find an abandoned zoo after fleeing a traditional celebration. The novella has gained critical praise for its \\"lyrical\\" prose and for the illustrations in the United States version, done by artist Andrea Offermann.  Plot  It is midnight in a destroyed village somewhere in Europe. Through the moonlight, two boys, one with a baby in his backpack, come walking. The realism of the opening paragraphs is disrupted by the personification of Night. Clearly we are in for a fabulist story. The two boys have been on the road for weeks, scrounging an existence in a landscape often devoid of humanity and sustenance. The back-story to the boys‚Äô current situation reveals itself slowly: their family has been slaughtered by soldiers two months previously. They find a pitiful zoo which miraculously has survived the war that has ravaged its village. Also miraculous is that each of the animals in the zoo speaks to the boys. 1 Over the course of one night, we are given the stories of the animals, the zoo, and its most recent zookeepers. This is not a chronological telling but the narrative events come to us almost like a play, with limited settings, such as glimpses of the boys‚Äô travels, the zoo, and the Rom camp. The structure of the novel is instrumental in our interpretation of events. While the story can be read as a narrative of survival during war, much of its significance operates beneath the surface of realism. Symbolic meanings are fundamental to understanding the narrative: its time frame, the survival of the zoo, its midnight setting.  Critical reception  The Midnight Zoo received positive reviews from critics, mostly for the \\"lyrical\\" prose and the illustrations from Andrea Offermann in the American version. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"[a]n evocative story\\" with \\"lyrical, spare prose\\". Booklist was similarly favorable, but it said that the ending \\"may confuse some readers\\". A reviewer for the Daily Mail called it a \\"powerful and sensitively handled fable about war, freedom, and loss\\", and praised the author's writing and use of anthropomorphism. Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review and said that Harnett \\"mak[es] a profound case for the futility of war while exploring questions about responsibility and freedom.\\" Library Journal also gave it a starred review, saying that it was also good for adults who were \\"interested in wartime fiction and thought-provoking, fable-like tales\\", while its juvenile companion School Library Journal called it a \\"beautiful and sad book [that] will stay with readers long after the story is done.\\"  Awards and nominations  The Midnight Zoo won the CBCA Children's Book of the Year Award for Older Readers in 2011. It was also shortlisted for the CILIP Carnegie Medal in 2012.

History W4W was founded in April 2013 by Ronit Peskin, Leah Aharoni, and Jenni Menashe. The group's first event was held on Rosh Chodesh (the first day) of the Hebrew month of Sivan (10 May 2013) with some 5,000‚Äì7,000 Jewish women praying traditionally, filling up Kotel plaza, and outnumbering the WoW group. The number of women who pray at Women of the Wall (WoW) services has been estimated to be between 50 and 180. Debate with Women of the Wall Women for the Wall is a traditionalist group, which favors maintenance of \\"the status quo at the Western Wall, where rules mandate separation of the sexes and restrict the ability of women to lead public prayer groups,\\" except at Robinson's Gate, a section of the wall for egalitarian prayer that was set aside by the Israel Supreme Court in 2003.Daniel K.

History Diakonissestiftelsen's former building on Smallegade in 1865 Diakonissestiftelsen in 1873 Diakonissestiftelsen by Hans Peter Hansen Diakonissestiftelsen was founded in 1866 at the initiative of Crown Princess Louise, consort of the later king Christian IX. She instigated Louise Conring to make a study trip to Sweden, where the order had been active for ten years, and to Germany where pastor Theodor Fliedner had opened the first Deaconess motherhouse in 1836 in D√ºsseldorf-Kaiserswerth in 1836. A building in Smallegade near their current site, contained a small hospital and residences for the Deaconess sisters. Their current site was inaugurated in 1876. Their hospital in Smallegade closed in 1880. The site today The main wing viewed from the garden The Deaconesses' premises comprise 33,000 square meters of buildings on a four hectares of land. The original main building is a long three-winged which runs along Peter Bange Vej.It was designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm in a Neo-Gothic style inspired by medieval monasteries and manor houses. The complex has later been expanded by Gotfred Tvede (1922‚Äì23) and Harald Gad (1937-39). One of the former wash houses To the rear of the main complex, facing the garden, is a couple of wash houses. Other buildings in the grounds include S√∏ster Sophies Minde, located on S√∏nder Fasanvej. It was built in the 1950s to provide residences for retired Deaconess sisters. Diakonissestiftelsen also owns the house Marthabo on the other side of Peter Bangsvej (No. 12) which houses a kindergarten. The building is from 1885 and was designed by C. Lendorff. 2020 Redevelopment Plan In 2011, Diakonissestiftelsen announced plans for a DKK 500 million redevelopment of their site with the twofold ambition to integrate it more in the surrounding cityscape and creating a hub for social and healthcare-related activities. A masterplan competition for the area was settled in April 2012 with two interdisciplinary teams led by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten and Cubo Arkitekter as joint winners. A competition for the expansion and adaption of A√∏ster Sofies Minde was won by Arkitema in December 2013.

Founded in 1816 on the outskirts of the ancient village, it was associated with Independent Calvinists and Strict Baptists throughout nearly two centuries of religious use. The \\"startling\\" wooden building‚Äîremarkably un-English with its simple veranda-fronted style‚Äîhad seen several years of service as an officers' mess at a nearby barracks. The chapel was put up for sale in 2012. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. It was also on that body's Heritage at Risk Register because of its poor structural condition, but repairs were carried out and in 2019 it was deemed no longer at risk. History Joseph Flint was an early 19th-century shopkeeper in the village of Charlwood on the Surrey/Sussex border. Unlike most residents at the time, he was a Protestant Nonconformist and from around 1814 worshipped in a cottage with a small group of like-minded people rather than at St Nicholas' Church, the Anglican parish church. Meanwhile, during the Napoleonic Wars, a barracks existed in the Sussex market town of Horsham. A wooden guardroom or officers' mess was erected there in about 1800. After the war the barracks was decommissioned, and the timber mess building was dismantled and transported on wagons to Charlwood. There the \\"strange [and] quaint\\" structure was re-erected in a field on a dirt track north of the village, and on 15 November 1816 it opened as an Independent Calvinistic chapel for Flint and his fellow worshippers. The opening sermons at Charlwood Union Chapel, as it was originally called, were preached by ministers from chapels at Epsom and Dorking. Epsom had an Independent Calvinistic chapel of its own‚Äîthe denomination was \\"closely associated with Surrey\\" in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Bugby Chapel was opened there in 1779. The chapel only had one permanent pastor: C.T. Smith, who served from 1816 until 1834. Since then, it was served mostly by Strict Baptist ministers, and although it was nominally an Independent Calvinistic place of worship it adopted the character of a Strict Baptist chapel. Smith regularly preached in the village of Horley, away, and in 1846 a Strict Baptist chapel was built there with assistance from the Charlwood cause. The congregation moved from the wooden chapel at Lee Street to a new larger building near Horley railway station in 1881. (Both of these chapels have been demolished, but the burial ground at Lee Street survives.) Charlwood Union Chapel was renamed Providence Chapel, and services were latterly held on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday evenings.Information sign on the chapel wall, photographed on 12 May 2012. The building was advertised for sale by a local estate agent in 2012. It was offered on a freehold basis at a guide price of ¬£49,500, and was advertised as \\"in need of repair and improvement\\" and as being on the national Heritage at Risk Register. For planning purposes, places of worship are covered by Use Class D1; any new owner would be allowed to use the building for D1-class activities without seeking planning permission, but any change of use would require approval from Mole Valley District Council. The purchaser would also have to keep the graveyard around the chapel in its existing condition and allow burials on request. In spring 2013, the Charlwood Society‚Äîa local history and preservation group‚Äîbecame the new trustees of the chapel. Under the name Charlwood Union Chapel, the chapel was registered for marriages on 7 December 1844. It was also registered with this name as a place of worship under the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855; as it predates the passing of the Act, its identity number on the Worship Register is 1. Architecture Providence Chapel's architecture is considered unusual, especially in the context of the Surrey countryside. Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner called it \\"a startling building to find in Surrey, or even in England\\", and claimed that \\"it would not be out of place in the remotest part of East Kentucky\\". Strict Baptist historian Ralph Chambers likened it to \\"a pioneer's shack from some faraway backwood of Canada\\", while English Heritage state that it appears \\"more typical of New England than Surrey\\". Its importance is enhanced by its status as a \\"rare survival\\" from Napoleonic-era England, and it is considered the most unusual of the many 19th-century Nonconformist chapels across Surrey. The single-storey building is timber-framed with a weatherboarded exterior resting on a brick plinth. The hipped roof has a brick chimney-stack, is tiled with slate and extends over the front of the building as a seven-bay veranda with wooden pillars. The main entrance door is centrally placed and has six panels; there is a four-panelled subsidiary door on the southwest side, and casement windows with original external shutters flank both doors. There are also two blocked windows on the east side. A path of Charlwood stone leads to the entrance. Inside, two vestries occupy the northeast side of the building, one of which retains an original fireplace. Other early-19th-century fittings include the octagonal pulpit, box pews and a table. The internal floor area is , and the chapel occupies a plot of land which includes a graveyard. Heritage status The chapel was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 7 April 1983. Such buildings are defined as \\"particularly important [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 44 Grade II* listed buildings and 968 listed buildings of all grades in the district of Mole Valley, the local government district in which Charlwood is situated. Only 5.5 per cent of England's 375,000 listed buildings have Grade II* status, the second highest on the three-grade scale. English Heritage added the building to its Heritage at Risk Register in 2012 as a Priority A project. It described the chapel's condition as \\"poor\\" and \\"in need of repair\\", and noted that its long-term future was uncertain. In 2019 the National Lottery Heritage Fund provided a grant of ¬£260,000 for the restoration of the chapel; work included structural repairs to the roof, weatherboarded walls and timber framing. The former chapel was removed from the Register in October of that year, and it is now used by the local community in Charlwood.

Skjoldh√∏jkilen is a recreational and natural site, in the district of Brabrand in the western part of Aarhus in Denmark. It stretches westwards from Hasle Hills, like a wavy green strip of meadows, small lakes and woodlands. It is 3.5 km long and just as Hasle Hills, it is administered by the self-governing institution 'Hasle Bakker'. Reconstruction The landscape and nature of Skjoldh√∏jkilen was recently restored and recreated in a series of five construction projects finished in 2005. The projects comprised afforestations, restoration of the stream of Voldb√¶kken, construction of multipurpose rainwater reservoirs, and various road constructions. As a consequence, Skjoldh√∏jkilen now constitutes a connected woodland area with the newly raised forest of True Skov to the west, thereby constituting a large green wedgeWedge translates as kile in Danish. of nature cutting its way into the city from the countryside. This is all part of the implementation of Aarhus Municipality's agenda \\"Aarhus surrounded by forests\\" and \\"The Green Mainstructure\\", initiated in 1988 and resulting in the New Forests of Aarhus.The new Aarhus Forests The Nature Administration The total woodland-area of Skjoldh√∏jkilen and True Skov, is comparable in size to the Marselisborg Forests, south of Aarhus. The activity landscape Free standing exercise apparatus. Together with Hasle Hills, Skjoldh√∏jkilen forms a so-called 'activity landscape' and is so far the only one of its kind in Denmark. The activity landscape have been designed to facilitate play, learning, exercise and various recreational activities for citizens of all ages in Aarhus and the project have been financed by Realdania and the former Ministry for Integration. The activity landscape was inaugurated the 25th of May 2009. As in Hasle Hills, Skjoldh√∏jkilen has established mountain bike routes, which are marked to avoid conflict with other users of the area. There are several play areas, exercise apparatus and public shelters, scattered across the landscape and the whole area is designed for public recreational use of all kinds. Every summer, the small music festival of Danmarks Grimmeste Festival is held at a private farm situated in Skjoldh√∏jkilen. Nature Some of the ponds in Skjoldh√∏jkilen are rainwater reservoirs, with an added environmental and recreational aspect. The reconstruction and restorations of Skjoldh√∏jkilen has been successful in attracting and supporting a rich and varied flora and fauna in the area. =Wetlands= The stream of Voldb√¶kken has been relieved from a burden of urban pollution and excessive nutrients, threatening the stream with eutrophication. These improvements now invites the brown trout in the Aarhus River to spawn here. Some of the rainwater basins supports fish like common roach and abramis and various protected amphibians like northern crested newt. The wetlands attracts many species of insects and birds, with numerous ducks and Eurasian coots. Solitary grey herons are regularly seen here, hunting for fish. Skjoldh√∏jkilen has a rich population of European tree frogs - which is uncommon in Denmark - and the soft, nutritious wet earth is popular with moles. =Alder swamp= There is an alder carr of black alder in Skjoldh√∏jkilen.

Jessie Dellosa as AFP Chief. He served as the Executive Director of the Cabinet Cluster on Security, Justice, and Peace at the Office of the President, Malaca√±ang. His appointment as Undersecretary at the Office of the President was from 1 September 2014 to 22 June 2020 shortly after retirement from the military service as Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines. Concurrently, he headed the National Task Force on the Whole of Nation Initiative and was also the executive Director of the National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea. He was succeeded by Gregorio Pio Catapang as AFP chief. Early years and education Bautista was born in Quezon City on 20 July 1958. Following the footsteps of his father, the late BGen Teodulfo Bautista, he entered the Philippine Military Academy in 1976. He graduated 7th out of the 161 cadets belonging to the PMA Class of 1981, and was the recipient of the JUSMAG Saber award; the Commanding General, Philippine Army award; and the Distinguished Cadet Award. Upon his graduation from the PMA, General Bautista attended further military schoolings which include the Scout Ranger, Infantry Officer Advance, and Command and General Staff courses. He also went to various military trainings abroad, namely Grade II Staff & Tactics Course in New Zealand, Joint & Combined Warfighting at the Joint Forces Staff College, National Defense University in the United States of America, Security Sector Reform at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, Hawaii USA, Symposium on East Asia Security by the US State Department and United States Pacific Command, and Senior Executive Seminar at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, Germany, and European Common Security and Defense Policy Orientation Seminar at the European Security and Defense College. He also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of the Philippines, Diliman. Military career = Patikul Massacre while he was in Philippine Military Academy = When Bautista was in PMA, the late Brig. Gen. Teodulfo Bautista, his father, and 34 of his men expected a favorable result to their peace talks with the rebels. Instead, they received gunshots and hack wounds leading to their untimely demise. Brig. Gen. Bautista, then the Commanding General of the 1st Infantry \\"Tabak\\" Division (1ID), was set to meet with rebel leader Usman Sali and his men to discuss the peaceful coexistence of the opposing parties in the region. He even invited the then Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, and the then AFP Adjutant General Col. Gabriel Pangilinan to participate in the meeting but they refused due to their prior appointments.https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1977/10/15/eulogy- for-brig-gen-teodulfo-bautista-and-other-victims-of-the-patikul-massacre- october-15-1977/ At the last minute, Sali proposed to the general that they meet at a public market in Patikul instead of the 18th Infantry Battalion‚Äôs Headquarters. The general accepted and set off without any doubt to Sali‚Äôs intentions. Brig. Gen. Bautista and his men aboard two military trucks went to the meeting place unarmed as a sign of goodwill but found no one in sight. They decided to sit in the nearby table and wait for Sali, only to be attacked the moment their guard was down. The troops were mercilessly shot and hacked. Only Sgt. Oliver Calzada survived the attack by playing dead while his comrades were being killed right before his eyes. After the treacherous attack, Sali fled to Malaysia but some reports indicate that Usman Sali died during subsequent government operations. The military was devastated upon hearing the outcome of what was supposed to be a peaceful meeting between the opposing sides. Brig. Gen. Bautista‚Äôs son, Emmanuel T.

Carter served as campaign manager for North Carolina's Senate Vote '90 and Mobilization '96 political action committees. She served again as campaign manager for Florida Vote/Equal Voice based in Miami - a 2000 non-partisan, statewide voter empowerment campaign, which was initiated by the African-American Ministers Leadership Council of the People, People for the American Way Foundation, and the Florida NAACP - which resulted in one of Florida's largest black voter turn out's ever.

Plot A fugitive from the law (Curtis) leaps from a bridge, then gets a ride from a meek librarian (McDonald). After explaining how he became the victim of several double-crosses, he eventually finds refuge with a blind girl (Jean) and her father (Craven) at a secluded farmhouse. Cast * Gloria Jean as Jane Broderick * Alan Curtis as Cliff Banks * Frank Craven as Clem Broderick * Grace McDonald as Betty * Vivian Austin as Phyllis Prager * Frank Fenton as Sam Baker * Minna Gombell as Marie Background Destiny was originally planned as the opening segment of the 1942 anthology episode drama Flesh and Fantasy directed by Julien Duvivier. However, after some previews Universal Pictures decided to remove the opening segment despite the audience's enthusiasm. Not wanting to waste the footage, the studio hired screenwriter Roy Chanslor to come up with additional material and Reginald LeBorg to direct a few new scenes, so that the episode could be released as a separate feature film. Duvivier's original episode was supposed to have ended tragically, but Universal insisted upon a few \\"framing\\" scenes wherein the refugee is shown to be innocent of the crimes for which he has been imprisoned, and which allowed a happy ending.Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas and John Brunas. Universal Horrors: The Studios Classic Films, 1931-1946, 2007. Jefferson, NC: Mcfarland & Co Inc. , pp. 463-468. Because the new footage had not only a different director but also a different cinematographer and art director, sharp-eyed viewers can easily tell the new scenes (which have the \\"flat\\" look of most of that era's Universal crime thrillers) from the Duvivier sequence, which is much more atmospheric and shadow-laden. Reception =Critical response= TV Guide's summary discussed the film's background, \\"It is surprising to realize when seen today that Destiny, with its fairy tale-like blending of beauty, mysticism, and horror, had few champions in its day. Nor did Gloria Jean--then a teenage soprano and deemed to be a threat to Universal's reigning songstress, Deanna Durbin--whose career soon after went into a steep decline. Oddly cast in Destiny was McDonald, the studio's top tap dancer, who not only did not dance in the film but did not even walk, playing her entire role behind the wheel of a car.\\"TV Guide.

Sisu K-50SS is a six- wheel-driven ballast tractor made by the Finnish heavy vehicle producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT). The vehicle can generate a 388 kN drawing force and it was used for pulling flatbed trailers. Only one unit was produced in 1961 and it is the largest roadworthy motor vehicle ever built in the Nordic countries.  Development  K-50SS was developed under assignment of Kemijoki Oy, which ordered at the end of 1959 two 6√ó6-driven heavy haulers for moving over 1 000 tonnes weighing transformers and other heavy components on flatbed trailers. The initial idea was having two units, of which one would have been used for trailer pulling meanwhile the other one would have pushed the trailer from behind. The vehicles were also planned to be used separately serving on power plant construction sites all over Finland. SAT had previously produced six heavy Sisu K-36 earthmovers and the knowhow was utilised in the engineering work. The first unit was ready in spring 1961, just 1.5 year after the assignment. However, Kemijoki cancelled the order of the other K-50SS and the produced vehicle remained unique.  Technical data  = Engine = The vehicle is powered by Rolls-Royce C6TFL turbocharged 6-cylinder in-line, four- stroke diesel engine. Its 223-kW (300 hp) output is 43% and 1 070 Nm torque 56% higher compared to the standard naturally aspirated type. The cylinder bore is 130.2 mm and stroke 152.2 mm. The compression ratio is 14:1. The engine is fitted with an air-start system. = Transmission and chassis = The hydraulic Rolls-Royce BF 11500Ms230 torque multiplier has three steps. The three-step main gearbox is made by Foden. The power is divided between the front axle and two rear axles by a differential inside the ZF VG-800-4V1 transfer case. The mechanism includes disengaging possibility of the front- wheel-drive for transition drive; then also the hydraulic clutch can be passed by a mechanical connection. The maximum ratio passes nearly 65 000 Newton circumferential force on each wheel. The Kirkstall-made driven axles are equipped with interlockable differentials. The torque between the rear axles is divided by a longitudinal differential. The chassis is constructed in a similar manner as in locomotives; the solution was re-used in 1990s when the company produced Sisu Mammut and Bambino earthmovers for the Swedish mining company LKAB. = Cabin = The large cabin is fitted with two beds and a small kitchen.  Usage and characteristics  The K-50SS was used for heavy hauling in North Finnish hydroelectric power plant construction sites. The 19 300 kg weighing vehicle could be further loaded by extra concrete weights up to 52 000 kg total weight in order to improve the tyre grip. The hydraulic torque multiplier enables passing torque to the wheels when the vehicle is standing still, enabling a smooth start. The maximum speed with the highest ratio is 10 km/h; the maximum speed during transition drive is 55 km/h. The hydraulic clutch can be used for decelerating. According to the contemporary drivers and other people who were involved, the vehicle is easy to drive and it has always fulfilled the expectations given to it. The vehicle cost 21 million marks in the early 1960s and it has only run 43 000 km till 2010. The K-50SS is the all-time largest individual roadworthy automobile unit produced in the Nordic countries, without a tipper or other superstructures. Larger vehicles have been built but not homologated to be used on public roads. The initial transportation solution plan: one K-50SS pulling while another one is pushing.  Current status  When coming to 21st century, the K-50SS was not in active use any more but stored in a garage at Pirttikoski power plant. It was restored to its original outfit little by little and presented in various vintage vehicle meetings, until Kemijoki Oy gave the Sisu to Oulu Automobile Museum in 2006.

It received the assent of The President of India on 23 December 2005. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 has 11 chapters and 79 sections. The Act extends to the whole of India. The Act provides for \\"the effective management of disasters and for matters connected there with or incidental thereto.\\" National Authority The Act calls for the establishment of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), with the Prime Minister of India as chairperson. The NDMA may have no more than nine members including a Vice- Chairperson. The tenure of the members of the NDMA shall be five years. The NDMA which was initially established on 30 May 2005 by an executive order, was constituted under Section-3(1) of the Disaster Management Act, on 27 September 2006. The NDMA is responsible for \\"laying down the policies, plans and guidelines for disaster management\\" and to ensure \\"timely and effective response to disaster\\". Under section 6 of the Act it is responsible for laying \\"down guidelines to be followed by the State Authorities in drawing up the State Plans\\".  National Executive Committee  The Act under Section 8 enjoins the Central Government to Constitute a National Executive Committee (NEC) to assist the National Authority. The NEC is composed of Secretary level officers of the Government of India in the Ministries of home, agriculture, atomic energy, defence, drinking water supply, environment and forests, finance (expenditure), health, power, rural development, science and technology, space, telecommunication, urban development, and water resources, with the Home secretary serving as the Chairperson, ex officio. The Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, is an ex officio member of the NEC. The NEC under section of the Act is responsible for the preparation of the National Disaster Management Plan for the whole country and to ensure that it is \\"reviewed and updated annually\\".  State Disaster Management Authority  All State Governments are mandated under Section 14 of the act to establish a State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). The SDMA consists of the Chief Minister of the State, who is the Chairperson, and no more than eight members appointed by the Chief Minister. State Executive Committee is responsible (Section 22) for drawing up the state disaster management plan, and implementing the National Plan. The SDMA is mandated under section 28 to ensure that all the departments of the State prepare disaster management plans as prescribed by the National and State Authorities. District Disaster Management Authority  The Chairperson of District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will be the Collector or District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner of the district. The elected representative of the area is member of the DDMA as an ex officio co-Chairperson, (Section 25).  National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)  The Section 44‚Äì45 of the Act provides for constituting a National Disaster Response Force \\"for the purpose of specialist response to a threatening disaster situation or disaster\\" under a Director General to be appointed by the Central Government. In September 2014 Kashmir-floods NDRF along with the armed forces played a vital role in rescuing the locals and tourists, for which NDRF was awarded by the government of India.  Other Provisions  Section 42 of the Act calls for establishing a National Institute of Disaster Management. Section 46-50, mandates funds for Disaster Mitigation at various levels. The Act provides for civil and criminal liabilities for those who violate the provision of the Act.  Implementation  The implementation of the National Disaster Act, 2005 has been slow, and slack. On 22 July 2013 Indian Supreme Court Justices A K Patnaik and M Y Eqbal in response to a Public Interest Litigation issued notices to the Governments of Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan Maharashtra and the Central government for alleged failure to implement the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The petitioner alleged that the non-implementation of the Disaster Management Act by the Government of Uttarakhand endangered the lives of citizens. He sought \\"reasonable ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of life, damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood to victims of flash floods in Uttarakhand under the Disaster Management Act\\".  Criticism of the Act The act has been criticized for marginalizing Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), elected local representatives, local communities and civic group; and for fostering a hierarchical, bureaucratic, command and control, 'top down', approach that gives the central, state, and district authorities sweeping powers. It is also alleged that the \\"Act became a law almost at the will of the bureaucrats who framed it.\\"  References   External links  * Disaster Management in India Category:Emergency management in India Category:Acts of the Parliament of India 2005 ","title":"Disaster Management Act, 2005"},{"id":"40070121","text":"The Frank Golden Block, at Brougher and Main Sts. in Tonopah, Nevada is a historic building that was built in 1902.

In 2018, LaRusso was inducted into the Fictitious Athlete Hall of Fame. Fictional biography Daniel LaRusso was born on December 18, 1966Due to Daniel being in college in The Karate Kid Part III, which takes place the following school year, they had to change his birthdate from 1968 to 1966. While originally he was intended to be 15 turning 16 in The Karate Kid, his current canon birthdate is December 18, 1966, making him 8 months older than Johnny Lawrence (character) and two years older than Ali Mills. in Newark, New Jersey, into an Italian-American family. When he was eight years old, his father David LaRusso died after a 2-year battle with stomach cancer. His last words to his son were, \\"I love you. Don't you ever forget that!\\". Daniel's mother Lucille never re-married and Daniel was left without a father. In September 1984, Daniel and Lucille moved to Reseda, California, after Lucille accepts a job offer at a computer firm. Shortly after moving to California, Daniel meets and starts a rivalry with Johnny Lawrence, the two-time winner of the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championship. However, Daniel defeats Johnny in the tournament's final match and becomes the new champion. By the events of Cobra Kai, Daniel is the owner of a successful car dealership in Southern California. Daniel is now married to his wife Amanda, and, together with their two children Samantha and Anthony, live in a large home with a swimming pool. Despite his success as an adult, Daniel's rivalry with Johnny Lawrence reignites after LaRusso learns of the return of the Cobra Kai dojo, now run by Lawrence. Appearances =The Karate Kid (1984)= Single mother Lucille LaRusso uproots her only child, Daniel, from their home in New Jersey and moves them both to South Seas Apartments in Reseda, California. Daniel is invited by his new neighbor, Freddy Fernandez, to a beach party, where he meets Ali Mills. He also encounters and is beaten in a fight by Ali's ex- boyfriend Johnny Lawrence. During his first month in school, Daniel is constantly bullied by Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang. At the school's Halloween dance, Daniel attempts to get back at Johnny by placing a hose above the toilet stall where Johnny is rolling a joint, getting him wet. However, his scheme backfires, and he is chased by Johnny and his gang, who corner him outside his apartment building and assault him until Mr. Miyagi, the apartment's maintenance man, intervenes and saves Daniel. The next day, Mr. Miyagi confronts Cobra Kai sensei John Kreese and proposes that Daniel and Johnny settle their feud in the upcoming All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament on December 19. Kreese agrees, but warns that if they do not show up at the tournament, both Daniel and Mr. Miyagi will be declared fair game to Cobra Kai. Daniel is initially upset with Mr. Miyagi over the arrangement, but Mr. Miyagi assures that with proper karate training, he will no longer have to worry about Cobra Kai. However, Mr. Miyagi has Daniel do mundane chores at his rest house such as waxing his classic cars, sanding the wood floors, and painting the fence. Not understanding his teacher's methods, a frustrated Daniel threatens to quit, but Mr. Miyagi shows that the chores double as defensive techniques, which Daniel has learned through muscle memory. While training, Daniel develops a relationship with Ali. Mr. Miyagi also gives Daniel his yellow 1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible as a gift on his 18th birthday and a reward for getting his driver's license. At the tournament, Daniel unexpectedly advances toward the semifinals. Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to put Daniel out of commission. Bobby reluctantly delivers an illegal kick to Daniel's knee, getting himself disqualified while Johnny looks at Kreese in disgust. Just before Johnny is declared the winner by default, Ali informs the tournament announcer that Daniel will fight in the final round. During the fight, Daniel gains the upper hand and gives Johnny a bloody nose. Kreese orders Johnny to sweep Daniel's leg, an unethical move. In fear of his sensei, Johnny hits Daniel's bad leg with an elbow strike and receives a warning from the referee. Upon the restart of the round, Daniel wins the match after landing a crane kick to Johnny's face. Having gained respect for his nemesis, Johnny gives Daniel the trophy. Daniel celebrates the victory as Mr. Miyagi looks on, proud of his student. =The Karate Kid Part II (1986)= At the beginning of the film, as Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are leaving, they see Kreese berating Johnny for placing second and strangling him. Miyagi intervenes and defeats him easily, comically tweaking his nose before walking away. Daniel asks why he didn't kill him, and Mr. Miyagi says \\"A person with no forgiveness in heart, living worst punishment than death.\\" Six months later, Daniel returns early one morning to Mr. Miyagi's house from his senior prom dressed in a tuxedo and driving the now badly beaten up car Miyagi had given him. Surprised, Mr. Miyagi asks what happened, and Daniel angrily explains that not only is Ali apparently responsible for all the damage to the car, but that she has dumped him for \\"a football player from UCLA\\". Later, when Daniel learns that Mr. Miyagi is going to Okinawa to visit his dying father, he uses his college fund to go with him. Upon their arrival, they meet Sato Toguchi, a wealthy businessman and Miyagi's former best friend. Later, Daniel meets Kumiko, a teenager who aspires to move to Tokyo and pursue a career in dancing. He also encounters Sato's nephew Chozen, and the two become enemies after Daniel inadvertently exposes the corruption in Chozen's grocery business. One day in town, Chozen challenges Daniel to chop a row of ice sheets; however, Daniel wins Chozen's wager by using Mr. Miyagi's breathing exercise and successfully breaking all of the ice sheets. Miyagi tells Daniel to keep his winnings for college. The Toguchi family continues to terrorize the village until a typhoon hits Okinawa. During the storm, Sato is pinned by debris from his family's dojo and rescued by Daniel and Miyagi, while Chozen runs away. Because of this, Sato lets go of his decades-old grudge with Mr. Miyagi and he offers to rebuild the village, disowning his nephew. A humiliated Chozen crashes the village's Obon festival, taking Kumiko hostage and challenge Daniel to a fight to the death. Daniel and Chozen fight a brutal and bloody back-and-forth fight, and Miyagi, Sato, and the crowd use their handheld drums to motivate Daniel and defeat his opponent with the Miyagi family drum technique. =The Karate Kid Part III (1989)= Daniel and Mr. Miyagi return to Los Angeles from Okinawa to the discovery that their apartment building has been sold and is undergoing demolition, leaving Daniel homeless and Miyagi unemployed. Lucille is back in New Jersey to care for Daniel's uncle Louie. Mr. Miyagi invites Daniel to stay with him for a while, and Daniel uses the rest of his college fund to help his mentor set up a bonsai tree nursery. Daniel receives an invitation to defend his championship title at the next All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships, but Mr. Miyagi advises him to ignore it, seeing no point in the competition. However, Daniel is confronted by the prodigious and undefeated karateka Mike Barnes, who threatens Daniel into defending his title and steals the shop's bonsai trees. Terry Silver, a friend of Kreese and co-founder of the Cobra Kai dojo, offers to train Daniel for the tournament. Little does Daniel know that this is an elaborate scheme devised by Kreese and Cobra Kai to exact revenge on him by physically weakening him and having him suffer defeat at Barnes' hands. Silver hopes that this will revive Cobra Kai and promises to give Barnes partial ownership of the dojo in exchange for his help. Silver's methods start to corrupt Daniel, who becomes more aggressive and alienated from Miyagi. Realizing this, Daniel confronts Silver and tells him that no longer wishes to train under him, after which Silver admits that he set him up. When Kreese reveals himself and Barnes attacks Daniel, Mr. Miyagi saves his pupil and agrees to train him for the tournament. At the tournament, Barnes swiftly advances to face Daniel in the final round. He uses Silver and Kreese's tactic of scoring a point, then losing it with an illegal move until they reach the sudden death round. After Mr. Miyagi prevents him from conceding the match, Daniel performs a kata in the sudden death round. A confused Barnes charges at Daniel, but Daniel flips him to the ground and strikes him to win the tournament. =Cobra Kai (2018‚Äì)= Season 1 The series takes place 34 years after the first film. Now aged 49 Daniel is happily married to Amanda and has two children, Samantha (born 2002) and Anthony (born 2007). He and his wife own the LaRusso Auto Group, a chain of car dealerships in the San Fernando Valley. As part of the dealership chain's commitment to customer satisfaction, Daniel personally gives each new client their own bonsai tree. He unexpectedly meets up with his old nemesis, Johnny Lawrence, when his car is wrecked and sent to his intake lot. Daniel, unaware that his daughter Samantha was a passenger when her friends accidentally caused the wreck, offers to fix his car for free, considering Johnny an old friend. However, he later discovers that Johnny has reopened the Cobra Kai dojo in Reseda. Fearing that Johnny will create a new generation of bullies like those that he and Mr. Miyagi faced in the past, Daniel starts taking steps to undermine Cobra Kai. In addition, Daniel begins to struggle with issues within his family and business. Johnny's estranged son Robby Keene gets a job at LaRusso Auto Group to get back at his father. Unaware that Robby is Johnny's son, Daniel takes him in as his karate student. As such, Daniel proves to be a positive influence on the boy, and Robby later turns on his former criminal friends who plan to rob the dealership. However, upon learning of his student's parentage, Daniel fires and banishes him. Undaunted, Robby participates in the All Valley Karate Tournament against Cobra Kai as an independent fighter, and the combination of this tenacity impressing Daniel and his wife convincing him to forgive the boy's mistakes leads to Daniel becoming Robby's sensei again. In the semifinals, Robby's shoulder is badly injured when Cobra Kai student Hawk attacks him from behind. Daniel coaches Robby the final match, but loses a close fight to Johnny's top student, Miguel Diaz, who fights dishonorably by exploiting Robby's injury. With teacher and student reconciled, Daniel plans to expand the Miyagi-Do style and philosophy with an official dojo to oppose Cobra Kai with Robby as his senior student. Season 2 Daniel opens the Miyagi-Do dojo and offers his lessons for free, threatening Cobra Kai's business. He takes Robby in as well, and proceeds to train him and Sam together. When he heads to Johnny‚Äôs dojo to tell him Robby is staying with them, he sees that Kreese has returned. Unfortunately, Daniel has trouble acquiring students considering they are not receptive to the chore-based muscle memory training style he used himself. Daniel tries to be the bigger man after Cobra Kai upstages their demonstration at the local Valley Fest, even refusing to make use of footage of him dispatching of three purse-snatchers caught on Robby‚Äôs phone. He also takes on Demetri as a student, which proves challenging at first due to Demetri's constant whining and desire to take shortcuts. However, at the prodding of Kreese and without Johnny‚Äôs knowledge, Hawk leads a small group of Cobra Kai students in vandalizing Daniel‚Äôs dojo and his prized convertible, and stealing Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor. This pushes Daniel too far and he confronts Johnny at the Cobra Kai dojo, leading to numerous students walking out to join Miyagi-Do. Unfortunately, despite this success, Daniel's passion leads to him neglecting his auto business, forcing an irritated Amanda to run it alone, leading to loss of staff and declining sales. Despite an uneasy reconciliation with Johnny, at the prodding of Amanda and Johnny's girlfriend, Carmen Diaz, the rivalry flares again after a misunderstanding caused by Robby and Samantha spending the night at Johnny's apartment after getting drunk at a party. To make matters worse, the animosity between the two begins to affect their respective students, and the growing tension between the dojos finally explodes into a massive karate war on the first day of school. As a result, Samantha is hospitalized and Johnny's favorite student, Miguel, is inadvertently seriously injured by Robby and placed in Intensive Care. This event also allows Kreese to take control of Cobra Kai and force Johnny out. A furious Amanda demands that Daniel close down the dojo and stop all karate activities. Feeling that he has tainted Mr. Miyagi's legacy, Daniel sadly obliges. Reception \\"Daniel LaRusso,\\" as conceived in the original films, is an iconic hero. Since the turn of the 21st Century, however, LaRusso (along with the character \\"Johnny\\") has been more deeply developed. Notably in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made a guest appearance as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (\\"The Bro Mitzvah\\"). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka. This influenced the 2018 web television series, Cobra Kai, which gives a balanced perspective for Daniel, Johnny, and other characters.

The land for construction of the factory complex was purchased from Emil Bruhl, whose family had acquired the land from the descendants of Szmul Zbytkower. The Koneser factory was one of the most technologically advanced production plants and of the first electrified factories in Warsaw. It was equipped with a range of ancillary equipment such as boilers, alcohol and water steam engines, vodka bottling machines, hydraulic and manually controlled elevators as well as internal system of iron carts. The plant even had its own siding, i.e. a short railway line giving access to the main line of the Wile≈Ñski Railway Station.

The song received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that the song is not groundbreaking or innovative, while it achieved minor success on the charts. Background After releasing \\"Finally Found You\\" in September 2012, as the lead single from his upcoming tenth studio album. The song was a moderate success, reaching the top-forty in most countries, however, the singer announced that the song \\"Turn the Night Up\\" would be the lead single of the album, during its premiere on Elvis Duran show on New York City's Z100, on 22 July 2013. During the interview with Duran, Iglesias said, \\"You know how people are going to react to I and you put so much love into it, so much work into it and it all comes down to that second. The ultimate test for me is once I write a song‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go to sleep, wake-up in the morning and I‚Äôll play it. If it feels good, if it puts me in a good mood, that‚Äôs when I know there is something special.\\" The song became available for purchase on iTunes, on 13 August 2013.  Composition and lyrics  The song came from a phrase (gimme somme of that) that Enrique uses with his girlfriend Anna Kournikova. \\"Turn the Night Up\\" was written by Enrique Iglesias, Niles Hollowell-Dhar, Marty James and Rome Ramirez, while production was handled by The Cataracs. Similar to his previous singles, \\"Turn the Night Up\\" is a dance-pop, electropop and EDM song, and according to himself, it's \\"one of those powerful, fun energetic songs and when we wrote it, I was just focusing at making sure if I could pull off the vocals in the studio, I was like, ‚ÄòThis is it, this could be one of those fun songs.\\" In one of the verses, Iglesias describes his affection, singing \\"You know my intentions / I know you can go all night / I just wanna touch you / girl just let me touch you / I know it‚Äôs been on your mind\\". Lyrically, the song came from a phrase he always says to his longtime girlfriend Anna Kournikova. Speaking to Ryan Seacrest, Enrique said, \\"You know how it started? I always walk around my house and I'm always joking around and there‚Äôs a phrase in the song that says ‚ÄòGimme some of that.‚Äô And I‚Äôm always saying that, saying ‚ÄòGimme some of that‚Äô and ‚Ä¶ doing a stupid little dance. [And] my girlfriend always starts laughing, so I went to the studio and said we‚Äôve got to write the song around this!. Iglesias' line \\"One love, one love\\", originally included in his 2010 hit song \\"I Like It\\", was reused on the song. It was later reused again on his 2014 single \\"I'm a Freak\\".  Critical reception  The song received generally negative reviews from music critics. Natasha Shankar of She Knows wrote that she \\"wasn't too thrilled with the track,\\" calling it \\"another club-ready anthem\\" that cannot compare to his previous single, \\"Finally Found You\\". Direct Lyrics wrote the song is \\"not his best. Still, The Cataracs-produced beat is hot and I can see some DJs creating cool remixes so they can make 'Turn The Night Up' a must-play song in clubs this summer of 2013.\\" He also praised \\"the dance beat\\", calling it \\"dope\\", and \\"the pre-chorus\\", calling it \\"kind of good\\", but that 'sexy talk' Enrique 'tries' to do, and the actual chorus are just weak.\\" Zi Wei of Spin or Bin Music wrote the song \\"incorporates all the elements that made his previous songs Tonight (I'm F**in' You) and 'I Like It'; a sexually charged vibe, with a dancefloor-ready europop beat. But the song falls flat, sounding like a track off will.i.am's \\"#willpower\\", and that is not a compliment.\\" He also wrote that \\"Enrique‚Äôs Pitbull-wannabe rap style is laughably bad\\".  Commercial performance  While not reaching success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, \\"Turn the Night Up\\" received positive reception from radio, where it immediately garnered an audience of over 12 million within only 24 hours. Meanwhile, over the course of four days, it climbed into the Top 20 audience rank of the Mediabase Top 40. The song debuted at number 30 on the Pop Songs chart, becoming his second-highest debut on the \\"Pop Songs\\" chart, only behind of his first entry, 1999's \\"Bailamos.\\" The song sold 47,000 units in its first week, debuting at number 6 on Dance/Electronic Digital Songs, while also debuting at number 62 on the Hot 100.

The fans were able to create their own version of the music video through the website \\"Turn the Night Up\\" to have a chance of winning two tickets to any Enrique Iglesias concert and a chance to meet him. The official music video was originally shot by Yasha Malekzad, through his production company Artist Preserve http://www.promonews.tv/videos/2013/08/29/enrique-iglesias-turn-night-yasha- malekzad =Synopsis= In the music video, Enrique hops in his Aston Martin and follows a girl (Kristen Carpenter) to a house party filled with gorgeous women. Then he appears in a daze as he walks through the home filled with ducks and acknowledges every piece of eye candy in the room.

Convicted of 664 burglaries, but suspected of carrying out several thousand, he has been described as a legend in Norwegian criminal history. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Larsen wandered throughout the country, burgling hundreds of cabins and lodges, often spending several nights in the process, all the while avoiding law enforcement. He was named one of Norway's most notorious criminals. Early life Larsen was born on 22 August 1958, in a Gypsy family in Sandviken, a neighborhood in Bergen, and had four siblings. Old acquaintances described the family as being very interested in recreational activities, spending a lot of time outdoors. The children learned early to survive in the mountains. They could hunt, fish, and make \\"anything with their hands.\\" And they learned to hike and trek through the forests. In addition to outdoor activities, Larsen had a great passion for football, and was once expected to become a professional footballer. He played as a winger with IL Sandviken. After school, he went to Copenhagen and joined the Danish club Fremad Amager, but soon dropped out and started living on the streets. Criminal life After returning to Bergen from Copenhagen in the late 1970s, he found himself homeless and jobless. He soon started breaking into multiple cabins, receiving his first criminal conviction in 1979. He continued burgling however, first in the vicinity around Bergen, before moving to Voss and Hardanger. Here he would raid the area and gather large depots of stolen goods. On 20 July 1989, he left Bergen with his cousin and friend Svend Dahle, and moved to eastern Norway. One year later, on 3 August 1990, the two were raiding a cottage in Tolga in √òsterdalen when, both drunk after having raided the cottage's alcohol store, they started fighting. Larsen left the cottage, and when he came back he found the cottage burned down and Dahle dead inside it. Larsen was charged and convicted of involuntary manslaughter, but was later released on parole. After receiving thirteen convictions throughout the 1990s for over 450 burglaries, he was arrested again in October 2000 and charged with 221 new counts of burglary, and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison. One year later, in late April 2001, he escaped from prison while on temporary parole. After slipping away into the forest, he immediately embarked upon a massive burglary-spree. During the next four months, Larsen robbed 60 cabins in Ringsaker, over 50 cabins in Stor-Elvdal, 25 cabins in Alvdal and Folldal, as well as over 30 cabins on around Mount Dovre. By mid-August, the search for Larsen had turned into a large manhunt, involving the police, hunters, cabin owners and local volunteers, all scouring the forests and wilderness and conducting 24-hour patrols of popular hiking areas, searching for any trace of the notorious criminal. On 19 August, after receiving dozens of reports of forced entries, Norwegian police started plotting Larsen's itinerary on the map. Police detectives read the terrain and calculated Larsen's likely next step. They then arranged for police units to stay one step ahead of him. The plan worked, and they managed to track Larsen down when a police patrol found him walking on the mountainous border between Lom and Skj√•k. He was handcuffed and escorted under heavy guard a few kilometers through the steep and difficult terrain to the nearest road, before being transported back to prison in H√∏nefoss. On 23 August 2005, Larsen was again released on probation, but once again he disappeared into the woods. Almost immediately after, police were flooded with reports about break-ins in lodges and cottages throughout Buskerud county. After receiving a tip-off, Larsen was apprehended on 10 October. He confessed to having burgled 70 cabins in Sigdal, Modum, √òvre Eiker and Ringerike. He was sentenced to a further 2 years and 6 months in February the next year. Larsen was subsequently incarcerated in Ringerike Prison. In 2007, he was brutally assaulted by a fellow inmate after an altercation, causing him to suffer a cerebral hemorrhage, requiring life-saving surgery.  Hiatus and return to crime  After being released from prison some time after 2008, he spent some time at a psychiatric hospital, being treated for anxiety and depression. Larsen spent many years out of the public eye, without committing serious offenses. On 23 July 2013 however, when the Kirkvoll family entered their mountain lodge at Geilo they found it broken into and vandalized. They also found Larsen heavily intoxicated sleeping in one of the bedrooms. When they confronted him, he introduced himself before running out and disappearing into the nearby woods. On 31 July, he was arrested outside Geilo, and subsequently confessed to seven additional break-ins. Modus operandi Although convicted 14 times of 664 separate break-ins, he is suspected of carrying out thousands. This is due to his modus operandi remaining unchanged throughout the years. After breaking into an unoccupied cabin or lodge, Larsen would typically live there for several nights, drinking all of the alcohol he could find (Larsen was a long- time alcoholic, and was a recovering drug-addict) as well as eating all of the food. Owners have also described scenes of vomit and urine, while leaving a \\"signature\\" of excrement on the living room floor was considered Larsen's trademark. He also typically stole outdoors-equipment such as sleeping bags and clothing, which he needed for wandering the wilderness.

M√°nes exhibition in Prague. From left to right: Tobeen, Pelotaris (1912), Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Portrait of Mademoiselle Pogany (1912), Jean Metzinger, La Femme √† l'√âventail (Woman with a Fan) and En Canot (Im Boot, The Boat) Woman with a Fan, signed JMetzinger (lower left) is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 92.7 x 65.7 cm (36 1/2 x 25 7/8 in.), representing an elegantly dressed Parisian woman, perhaps Lucie Soubiron, who Metzinger married in 1909, painted in a geometrically Cubist style with a stylish feathered or plumed hat while holding a fan (visible to the lower right). A vase on a table and decorative wall paper can be seen in the background. The vertical composition is divided, fragmented or faceted into series rectangular and square surfaces accentuated by the flowing curvilinear forms of the models garments and hat. Rather than depicting the Woman with a Fan from one point of view, Metzinger has used a 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject from a variety of locations and from different angles, her detailed face, neck and hat are observed from a succession of spatial angles or locations captured over an extended period of time, resulting in a complex series of profile and frontal views seen simultaneously.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press One of the most accomplished works of this period, Woman with a fan \\"anticipates Picasso in exploring the legacy of Neo-Impressionism: :\\"The subject is again a woman with a plumed hat, but now the girl is a cohesive factor used to break down space and bring the figure and houses together. Here too, however, lines and planes take the forms of arabesques and decorative patterns. The constant use and re-use of Cubist structural devises in this manner suggests that Metzinger never ceased to consider them more than \\"mannerist\\" devices, through which reality was filtered but not basically altered.\\" (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, 1967)Painters of the Section D'Or: The Alternatives to Cubism. Exhibition, September 27-October 22, 1967, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, 1967 Here Metzinger is almost exclusively concerned with principles of pictorial construction: the interplay of horizontals, verticals and curves, with color playing an important but secondary role. Rather than depicting the Woman with a Fan from one classical point of view, Metzinger has used a 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject from a variety of locations and from different angles. The images captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive time intervals are all shown together on one canvas.Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Cubist Works, 1910‚Äì1921, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press. p. 43. The observer now played an active role. The reconstruction of the total image was left to the creative intuition of each individual. The sum of the parts from which the 'total image' is composed now resides in the mind of the observer. The dynamism of form set in motion by the artist (who chose the multiple view points rather than just one), implicit or explicit within the properties of the work, could be reassembled and understood in an interactive dynamic process.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001 :\\"But we cannot enjoy in isolation\\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \\"Cubisme\\",Du \\"Cubisme\\", Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, Edition Figui√®re, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913) \\"we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies.\\" This reciprocity between the artist and the public is perhaps one of the reasons Metzinger felt the need to include elements of the real world into his paintings of the period, untouched by the wrath of total abstraction. \\"The reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events\\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes in 1912. Art, to them, could not \\"be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.\\" Related works File:Jean Metzinger, 1912, Landscape (Marine, Composition Cubiste), oil on canvas, 51.4 x 68.6 cm, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University.jpgJean Metzinger, 1912, Landscape (Marine, Composition Cubiste), oil on canvas, 51.4 x 68.6 cm, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University.

Missoni is credited with expanding Missoni into a global brand after his parents handed control to him and his two siblings, Angela and Luca, in 1996. Missoni was born in Gallarate, Lombardy, Italy, in 1954, to Ottavio and Rosita Missoni. His parents had opened a small knitwear store in Gallarate in 1953 shortly before he was born. They released their first articles of clothing using the Missoni label in 1958. The company, which is known for a distinctive zigzag knitwear pattern, became successful in Italy during the 1960s. The three Missoni children ‚Äì Vittorio, Angela and Luca ‚Äì became involved with the day-to-day operations of the family business. In 1996, Ottavio and Rosita handed control of the Missoni fashion house to their children. Angela and Luca took responsibility for the creative direction of the Missoni line, while Vittorio Missoni handled the business aspects of the company. Vittorio Missoni initially led the marketing and manufacturing departments of Missoni. However, he was widely credited with expanding the fashion house into a full global brand after becoming Missoni's chief executive officer in Europe and the United States. Under Vittorio Missoni, the company's trademark pattern and name expanded into household and cosmetic products, including perfume and towels. A Missoni Hotel, the first of several locations, debuted in 2009 in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2011, Missoni partnered with the American retail chain, Target Corporation, to release a line of limited-edition, lower priced Missoni products, which proved so popular with shoppers that Target's web site crashed due to demand. The plane in which Missoni and his wife were flying, a forty-four-year-old Britten-Norman Islander, disappeared on January 4, 2013, after taking off from Los Roques Airport in the Los Roques archipelago, where they had been vacationing, en route to Caracas, Venezuela. Missoni was 58 years old at the time of the plane's disappearance. His wife, Maurizia Castiglioni, and their friends, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi, as well as two crew members were also on board the plane. The search for the missing aircraft took more than six months. His father, Ottavio, died in May 2013, before the plane was located. On June 27, 2013, it was confirmed that Missoni's plane was found in the Caribbean Sea, north of the Los Roques archipelago.

Brahmi was the founder and former leader of the People's Movement, which, under his leadership, won two seats in the constituent election in 2011. Early life and career Brahmi was born on 15 May 1955 in Sidi Bouzid, capital of the Sidi Bouzid Governorate. He graduated from his Alma Mater, the Higher Institute of Management at Tunis University with a Master's Degree in accounting in 1982. After his graduation, he taught as a professor of economics and management for two years at the Technical College of Menzel Bourguiba. Later, he worked in the Office of Irrigation, and then in real estate from 1985 to 1993. He did consultancy work as an auditor for the Technical Cooperation Agency in Saudi Arabia. From 2004, he worked as the manager of a real estate business specializing in residential properties. Politics Brahmi was an active member of the Arab Progressive Unionist Students until 2005, at which point he left and founded the Nasserist Unionist Movement, an illegal party under the Ben Ali government. After the Tunisian revolution, he founded the People's Movement and became the general secretary of the group. The party later joined the Popular Front on 13 April 2013. However, Brahmi and other members of the movement left the front on 7 July due to criticisms of the movements' central and regional leaders over cooperation with the front. Brahmi was known for his socialist and Arab nationalist beliefs, particularly in the tradition of Gamal Abdel Nasser.Daragahi, Borzou. Salafist identified as suspect in Tunisia assassination. Financial Times. 26 July 2013. He was a practicing Muslim. Although a member of the anti-Islamist Popular Front, he did not have a reputation for being especially critical of Islamists, and in fact had many friends in the ruling Islamist Ennahda Movement. Assassination Brahmi's funeral procession On 25 July 2013, Brahmi was fatally shot in Tunis outside his Ariana home in front of his wife and children by two men on a motorcycle. He received 11 bullets and died later that day in a hospital in Ariana district of Tunis. Brahmi's death followed the assassination of opposition leader Chokri Belaid, killed on 6 February 2013. The two were members of the same left-wing coalition. Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou told a news conference: \\"The same 9mm automatic weapon that killed Belaid also killed Brahmi.\\" The suspect in both murders was identified as Abu Muqatil al-Tunisi, a Salafist being sought on suspicion of smuggling weapons from Libya. A state funeral was held for Brahmi and tens of thousands of people attended the procession to the Jellaz Cemetery in Tunis. During Brahmi's funeral, protesters called for the government to be toppled, while police fired tear gas on them. =Protest= Following his death, hundreds of his supporters, including relatives and party members of the People's Movement, demonstrated in front of the Interior Ministry's building on Avenue Habib Bourguiba and blamed the incumbent Ennahda Party and their followers for the assassination. Hundreds of supporters also protested in Brahmi's hometown of Sidi Bouzid. After the protests, Education Minister Salem Labiadh submitted his resignation. The opposition minority in the national assembly called for the government to resign and dissolve the legislature, but Prime Minister Ali Larayedh said that the government would continue its work and set 17 December as the date for the scheduled general election (later postponed for the end of 2014). In January 2014, however, Ennahda replaced Larayedh with a technocrat. =Legacy= On 19 September 2013, Tunisia's interior minister told lawmakers the CIA informed authorities Brahmi was a target and said there had been a \\"failure\\" in the security services' response. He announced an investigation had been opened. In the 2014 election, his wife Mbarka Aouinia Brahmi, heading the Popular Front's list in the Sidi Bouzid constituency, was elected a member of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. On 4 December 2014, she was nominated for the post of the First deputy Speaker of the Assembly by the Popular Front, but was defeated with 33 votes against 157 votes for her contender Abdelfattah Mourou of Ennahda. Apart from the Popular Front (15 seats), only Afek Tounes (8 seats) had declared their support for her. She later criticized the pact of Nidaa Tounes with Ennahda, \\"the two parties of the political right, the one liberal and the other religious,\\" as she put it.

It is reputed to be the first and longest running international sporting fixture of any type. It has been an annual series hosted alternately by Cricket Canada and USA Cricket. The series saw a 17-year hiatus beginning in 1994 due to financial difficulties. Since its revival in 2011 the series has been expanded from a two-day match only to a two-day match, a One Day International, and two Twenty20 matches. History The first Auty Cup Trophy match was a two-day match held from the 25‚Äì27 September 1844 at St George's Cricket Club in Manhattan, New York. Largely as a result of this match, the first Canadian Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, declared cricket Canada‚Äôs first official sport in 1867. The trophy was donated by Karl Andr√© Auty of Chicago, Illinois. The original trophy was retired in 1963 to honour the memory of K. A. Auty and re-dedicated 20 years later in Calgary, on 19 November 1983, by Canadian Cricket Association president Jack Kyle and United States of America Cricket Association president Naseeruddin Khan. The re-dedicated Auty Cup trophy resides at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. The 2016 Auty Cup was won by Canada (retaining the Cup), in a series of three 50 over matches held on October 13, 14, and 16, in Los Angeles just before the 2016 ICC World Cricket League Division Four tournament. In 2017 Auty Cup was won by USA, in a series of three 50 over matches played on Sept. 12-14 in Toronto. There was no competition in 2018, as the two organizations were not able to finalize terms for the Cup Series.

The mine is located in South Kalimantan, Borneo. The mine has estimated reserves of 32.9 million carats of diamonds. The hundreds hoping for fortune at Indonesia's largest diamond mine 1.2k Share Tweet BY VICTORIA HOSingapore Nov 09, 2015 For the 500 or so miners that toil at the Cempaka mine, Indonesia's largest diamond producer, each day provides hope that one of them will find the next massive rare diamond there. Cempaka is in South Kalimantan in Indonesia, and has provided some huge finds for miners in the past. In 2006, a 3.02 carat blue diamond was discovered, and it was rare enough that its UK-based owner, BDI Mining, thought it was important enough to announce to shareholders. But it's still dwarfed by 1965's find of a 166 carat gem that was nearly the size of a pigeon's egg. The Trisakti diamond, as it was later named, was sold off at auction. Ulet Ifansasti, an Indonesian photographer who went down to the mine to shoot for Getty Images, told Mashable that he met miners aged 17 to 70 at the site. One of the oldest miners told him he had been working there for the past 50 years, in hopes of finding the next Trisakti. But the life of a diamond miner can be fraught with danger, Ifansasti pointed out. 400 of them have died at Cempaka since 2000 due to landslides caused by soil erosion from digging. \\"From the top it looks like the moon,\\" he said, of the numerous craters made at the site. There are also disputes over territory, said Ifansasti. The workers are freelance, not hired by BDI (now owned by LSE-listed Gem Diamonds), and head to the mine in groups of ten to stake out spots with potential. Groups of miners which dig in competitors' spots have come to clashes before, and people have been killed in the conflicts, he said. \\"It's open to all, everybody can go (to the mine), and workers, they fight for the land,\\" he said. Cempaka's mine is located near to the Martapura city center, which has become a tourist attraction for its numerous shops carrying diamonds at purported bargains. Kalimantan has had several diamond mines since the 18th century when it was under Dutch rule. Cempaka owner BDI Mining, now owned by LSE-listed Gem Diamonds, started mining operations there in 2005, and in a year had uncovered 50,000 carats of \\"gem quality\\" diamonds, it said in a statement.

She did research at the National Institute for Medical Research in the 1950s and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in the 1960s. In 1967, she moved to Glasgow University and became its first female professor in 1973. She became the Gardiner Professor of Immunology there in 1980 and retired in 1990. She was an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology. Early life She was born in Dulwich in May 1928. She studied physiology at Bedford College, graduating in 1949, and then gained a doctorate at King's College London School of Medicine in 1952. Career Parrott's first job was for the Medical Research Council, working in their Clinical Endocrinology Research Unit in Edinburgh from 1952 to 1954. Alan Parkes then recruited her to assist him researching reproductive biology at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill. He valued her skill in vivisecting small animals and she started by transplanting ovaries into mice that had been sterilised by radiation, as a way of restoring their fertility. Another experiment led to a major paper which was published in Science in 1960: \\"Role of Olfactory Sense in Pregnancy Block by Strange Males\\". In this case, she removed the olfactory bulb of female mice to show that this prevented them from aborting when exposed to a strange male. This confirmed that smell was involved in the Bruce effect. Her co-author, Hilda Bruce had previously shown that mice would have a miscarriage if they smelt a strange male. At the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, she studied the immunological effect of the thymus, experimenting on newly-born mice by observing the effects of removal of the thymus upon their immune system such as the production of lymphocytes. These results were widely debated as the findings were unexpected. In 1967, she moved to the University of Glasgow, to work in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology as a senior lecturer. In 1973, she became a professor, the first woman to hold a chair in Glasgow University's 500-year history. In 1974, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1980, she became the head of the department and the Gardiner professor, when her predecessor, R.G. White, retired. She retired in 1990. Later life Parrott died on 17 January 2016, aged 87.

Most of the Servian reforms extended voting rights to certain groups, in particular to Rome's citizen-commoners who were minor landholders or landless citizens hitherto disqualified from voting by ancestry, status or ethnicity--collectively, the plebs as distinguished from the hereditary patricians. These reforms thus redefined the fiscal and military obligations of all Roman citizens. The so-called Servian constitution probably represents a long-drawn, complex and piecemeal process extending from Servius' predecessors, Ancus Marcius and Tarquinius Priscus, to his successor Tarquinius Superbus, and into the Middle and Late Republic. Rome's military and territorial expansion and the consequent changes in its population made franchise regulation and reform an ongoing necessity. The wholesale attribution of these measures to Servius \\"cannot be taken at face value\\".Tim Cornell, The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000 ‚Äì 264 BC), Routledge, 1995, pp. 144 - 147, 173 -175, 183 for military character of reforms, especially in census. The Servian constitution introduced two elements into the Roman system of government: a census of every male citizen, to establish his wealth, tax liabilities, military obligation, and the weight of his vote; and the comitia centuriata, an assembly with electoral, legislative and judicial powers. Both institutions are foundational for Roman republicanism.Forsythe, \\"The Army and Centuriate Organization,\\" p. 26. By entrusting the military defense of the state to all citizens, the Servian reform created interdependency among the social classes; in its organization of voting tribes, it inextricably allied political and military life and opened up a \\"political space\\" for republican participation.Michael S. Drake, Problematics of Military Power: Government, Discipline and the Subject of Violence (Frank Cass, 2002), pp. 22‚Äì23. To the Augustan historian Livy, the military service rendered by plebeians was thus a form of public service on a par with patrician duty in the Senate.Drake, Problematics of Military Power, p. 39. Even so, census rank depended on property value, and under the Servian constitution no citizen assessed at a worth of less than 11,000 asses (or 12,500, depending on the source) was admitted to the regular army.L√©on Homo, Roman Political Institutions From City to State (Routledge, 2005, originally published 1929), p. 18. Curiate reform and census Until the Servian reforms, the passing of laws and judgment was the prerogative of the comitia curiata (curiate assembly), made up from thirty curiae; Roman sources describe ten curiae for each of the three aristocratic tribes, the Ramnes, the Tities, and the Luceres, each claiming patrician status and privilege to election as magistrates by virtue of their descent from Rome's founding families. These tribes, supposedly based on three of Rome's hills, comprised approximately 200 gentes (clans), each of which contributed one senator (\\"elder\\") to the Senate. The senate advised the king, devised laws in his name, and was held to represent the entire populus Romanus (Roman people); but it could only debate and discuss. Its decisions had no force unless approved by the comitia curiata. By the time of Servius, if not long before, the tribes of the comitia were a minority of the population. Rome's far more populous citizen-commoners (plebeians) could participate in this assembly in limited fashion, and perhaps offer their opinions on decisions but only the comitia curiata could vote. An aristocratic minority thus exercised power and control over the commoner majority.Cornell, pp. 115 - 118. Roman tradition held that Servius formed a comitia centuriata of commoners, elected by the citizens as a whole, to augment or displace the comitia curiata as Rome's central legislative body. This required his development of the first Roman census, making Servius the first Roman censor.Census derives from Latin censere, \\"to judge\\" or \\"to estimate\\". The census was organised on military lines; citizens assembled by tribe in the Campus Martius, to register their social rank, household, property and income. This established an individual's tax obligations; his capacity to muster arms at his own expense, when required to do so by the citizen's obligation to give military service; and his assignment to a particular voting bloc in elections and law-making. The institution of the census and the comitia centuriata are speculated as Servius' attempt to erode the civil and military power of the Roman aristocracy, and seek the direct support of his newly enfranchised citizenry in civil matters; if necessary, under arms.Cornell, pp. 194 - 197. The comitia curiata continued to function through the Regal and Republican eras, but the Servian reform had reduced its powers to those of a largely symbolic \\"upper house\\" whose noble members were expected to do no more than ratify decisions of the comitia centuriata.Cornell, p. 25. =Classes and army= The census classified Rome's male citizen population according to status, wealth and age. The classes were subdivided into groups called centuriae (centuries), nominally of 100 men (Latin centum = 100) but in practice of variable number,The Servian \\"centuries\\" are therefore held to mean \\"groups\\". further divided into seniores (men aged 46 ‚Äì 60, of a suitable age to serve as, reserves, \\"home guards\\" or city police) and iuniores (men aged 17 ‚Äì 45, to serve as front-line troops when required). Adult male citizens were obliged, when called upon, to fulfill military service according to their means, which was supposedly assessed by as, a monetary unit that in the archaic period represented a particular weight of bronze or copper.Cornell, pp. 180 - 181, according to whom it was equivalent to one pound, much heavier than the later as. It cannot therefore be represented as a fraction or equivalent of the as, sesterce or denarius of later coinage. This evaluated wealth of a citizen was based primarily on land ownership (jugera) and head of livestock (pecunia) until the introduction of a monetary system in the 2nd century BC. A citizen's wealth and class would therefore have defined their position in the civil hierarchies, and up to a point, within the military; but despite its apparent military character, and its possible origins as the mustering of the citizenry-at-arms, the system would have primarily served to determine the voting qualifications and wealth of individual citizens for taxation purposes, and the weight of their vote. Wars were occasional but taxation was a constant necessity;Cornell, pp.186 - 190, 194 - 196. and the comitia centuriata met whenever required to do so, in peace or war. In effect, the comitia centuriata was the representative assembly, in a civil and political context, of Rome's citizenry-at-arms. Though each century had voting rights, the wealthiest had the most centuries, and voted first, and those beneath them were convened only in the event of deadlock or indecision. The lowest were unlikely to vote at all and was in large exempted from military service. The centuriate classes were as follows:List derived from Cornell, p. 179, who is citing Livy, 1.43, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus IV, 16 - 18. Descriptions of the armour and arms to be supplied by members of each class are almost certainly learned, speculative introjections by Livy and Dionysius. *1st class, with 100,000 in asses, infantry self-equipped with helmet, breastplate, greaves, round shield, spear and sword, comprising 40 centuries of seniores, and 40 of iuniores. *2nd class, with 75,000 in asses, infantry self-equipped with helmet, greaves, oblong shield, spear and sword, comprising 10 centuries of seniores and 10 of iuniores. *3rd class: 50,000 in asses, infantry self-equipped with helmet, oblong shield, spear and sword, comprising 10 centuries of seniores and 10 of iuniores. *4th class: 25,000 in asses, infantry self-equipped with oblong shield, spear, javelin, and swordThe oblong shield and sword are only in Dionysius' version comprising 10 centuries of seniores and 10 of iuniores. *5th class: 11,000 asses (12,500 in Dionysius), infantry self-equipped with sling and sling-stones (and javelin, in Dionysius), comprising 15 centuries of seniores and 15 of iuniores. *Supernumaries: Proletarii (Capite censi, poor citizens, with no estate), 1 century. Military specialists: Equites (cavalry); 18 centuries (6 seniores, 12 iuniores). Engineers; 2 centuries. Musicians; 2 centuries. Cornell suggests that the voting order of the equites (after infantry of the first class) reflects their subordination to the relatively low-status infantry in the centuriate system, but takes the view that equites in the archaic period \\"consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of patricians\\".Cornell, p. 196. Rosenstein distinguishes the \\"smaller, select group of 1,800 whose horses were furnished at public expense (equites equo publico)\\" from the majority of equites, who were wealthy enough to maintain and equip their own horse (equites equis suis).Nathan Rosenstein, \\"Military Command, Political Power\\", in A Companion to the Roman Army (Blackwell, 2011), p. 136. The Servian reforms established both the Roman army's centuria system and its order of battle; men picked from civilian centuriae were slipped into military ones, and each battle line in the phalanx formation was composed of a single class.Lendon, J.E., Soldiers & Ghosts: A History of Battle in Classical Antiquity, Yale University Press (2005), , , p. 182: The Greek-style phalanx was known to the Romans of the Regal era, and their best fighting men were armed identically to early Greek hoplites. In the early Republican era, as during the Regal era, the highest officers of the army were drawn from the same social stratum as the aristocratic comitia curiata. Even after the institution of the comitia centuriata, the most immediate and effective plebeian defense against aristocratic power was the actual or threatened withdrawal of labour, including military service. The first known plebeian officers (tribunes) were elected by the plebs from among their own number after the secession of 494 BC.John Rich, \\"Warfare and the Army in Early Rome\\", in A Companion to the Roman Army (Blackwell, 2011), p. 19. =New tribal division and expansion of the city= The reformation of the tribal divisions increased the city's sacred boundary (the pomerium) to include Rome's seven hills and their inhabitants. Some form of defence was constructed to protect the enlarged city, later reinforced by a wall, and the enclosed area was divided into four new administrative regiones (regions, or quarters); the Suburana, Collina, Palatina, and the Esquilana, where Servius himself is said to have taken a new residence.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1. 44. The named regions are in Varro, Lingua Latina, 5. 45. Modern analysis of the so-called \\"Servian Wall\\" remains suggest a construction some time after his reign; a contemporary defense of ditch, earthen embankment and moat are thought likely. See Gary Forsythe, \\"The Army and Centuriate Organization in Early Rome,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Army (Blackwell, 2011), p. 30. The situation beyond the walls is unclear: similar tribal areas, perhaps known as pagi, may have extended into the surrounding Roman territories (the ancient ager Romanus), and some of their inhabitants would have qualified for citizenship under the Servian class reforms.Discussion in Cornell, pp. 176 - 179. Either way, membership of a Roman voting-tribe depended thereafter on residence, rather than ancestry and inheritance. This would have brought significant numbers of urban and rural plebs into active political life; and a number of these would have been allocated to centuries of the first class, the most likely to vote.Cornell, p. 173. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, writing in the late first century BC, adds that the tribal divisions were where citizens paid their taxes. The city's division into \\"quarters\\" remained in use until 7 BC, when Augustus divided the city, by now much more densely populated, into 14 new regiones.

It represented compositors, skilled tradesmen responsible for typesetting in the printing trade. History A series of meetings was held in early 1880 which led to the formation of the New South Wales Typographical Association on 15 June 1882. Originally registered under the New South Wales Trade Union Act, in 1918 it was to become the New South Wales branch of the Printing Industry Employees' Union of Australia. The organisation achieved some notoriety for boycotting The Dawn for employing non-union labor ‚Äì women, who they refused to permit to join the association. In 1911 the secretary of the NSWTA assisted female employees in the printing industry to form the Printing Trade Women and Girls' Union and then to obtain their first award in November 1912. On 13 August 1890, the Western Star and Roma Advertiser newspaper of Toowoomba, Queensland reported that one Miss Hill, employed by a Printer named Mr Jarrett of Clarence Street, was refused admittance to the union. On 6 May 1902, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that \\"the monthly board meeting of the New South Wales Typographical Association was held at the Trades Hall on Saturday night The president (Mr T W Spicer) occupied the chair.

The circumstances of accident  Cengaver Katrancƒ± (4th picture from the bottom) on the memorial plaque at the May-Ayim-Ufer. On 30 October 1972, at approximately 13:00, eight-year-old Cengaver Katrancƒ±, together with a friend, were feeding swans on the River Spree (Gr√∂benufer street, currently May-Ayim-Ufer). Katrancƒ± lost his balance and fell into the river, which was, at this section, part of the Friedrichshain district of East Berlin. A fisherman was present, but offered no assistance for fear that doing so would be treated as a violation of the GDR border and, therefore, the East German guards could shoot him. A West Berlin fire department, including two divers, was alerted, but could not intervene after they unsuccessfully attempted to obtain permission for the entry into the river. An East German fire boat and a tanker were also present, but did not take the rescue operation. Despite people on the west side crying out to them for help, they also chose not to violate the forbidden zone without permission to get close to the western waterfront. Approx 13:30 West Berlin police car arrived. Following negotiations with the border guard officer at Oberbaum Bridge, around 14:30, an East German rescue boat began searching for the boy. About half an hour later his body was taken out of water. That evening the boy's mother received an entry permit for East Berlin in order to receive his body.

Orofacial pain is a common symptom, and there are many causes. Defined boundaries of the orofacial pain region. Orofacial Pain (OFP) is the specialty of dentistry that encompasses the diagnosis, management and treatment of pain disorders of the jaw, mouth, face and associated regions. These disorders as they relate to orofacial pain include but are not limited to temporomandibular muscle and joint (TMJ) disorders, jaw movement disorders, neuropathic and neurovascular pain disorders, headache, and sleep disorders. Classification International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is a new classification coming into effect as of January 1, 2022. It includes chronic secondary headaches and orofacial pain. The classification has been established by a close cooperation between International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Headache Society (IHS). There are 4 main classifications prior to ICD-11 which attempt to classify the causes of orofacial pain. * The International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3), a publication by the International Headache Society. https://ichd-3.org/ * The Classification of Chronic Pain Second Edition (Revised), a publication by the International Association for the Study of Pain. * Orofacial Pain: Guidelines for Assessment, Diagnosis, and Management, Fifth Edition by American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP): www.aaop.org. * The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (see TMD). It has also been suggested that the most basic etiologic classification of orofacial pain is into the following 3 groups: # Primarily somatic, arising from musculoskeletal (e.g. TMD pain or periodontal pain) or visceral structures (e.g. pulpal pain or pain from the salivary glands), and transmitted via an intact pain transmission and modulation system. # Primarily neuropathic, which occurs as a result of abnormal or damaged pain pathways, e.g. a surgical or traumatic injury to a peripheral nerve. # Primarily psychological, which is rare (See: psychogenic pain)  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of orofacial pain can be difficult and can require multiple examinations and histories provided by the patient. The pain history is essential and will indicate any further examinations required. The correct diagnosis of orofacial pain requires an in-depth pain history which will include: * Location of the pain * Timing * Duration * Associated symptoms * Exacerbating and alleviating factors * Description of the type of pain experienced e.g. dull, aching, throbbing, burning, tingling or pulsating. Other information and examinations include: * Full medical history * Full dental history * Full social history * Clinical examination * Radiographic examination Differential diagnosis Clinical presentation of orofacial pain. = Dental related = *Pulpal **Dentinal hypersensitivity resulting from ***Caries ***Toothwear **Pulp disease (reversible and irreversible pulpitis) resulting from ***Caries ***Trauma *Periapical pathology and periapical acute abscess *Periodontal **Periodontal abscess **Pericoronitis and pericoronal abscess *Cracked tooth syndrome = Non-dental related = *Musculoskeletal including Temporomandibular diseases (TMD) *Neuralgias and neuropathies **Trigeminal neuralgia **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia **Sphenopalatine Ganglion neuralgia **Sluder's Neuralgia ** Mental nerve neuralgia **Post-injury **Burning mouth syndrome **Postherpetic neuralgia *Persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical facial pain) **Atypical odontalgia * Mucosal ** Traumatic, immunologic, infective, erosive, ulcerative and vesiculobullous lesions e.g. oral ulceration (e.g. aphthous stomatitis, erosive oral lichen planus, etc.) * Psychosomatic * Sinonasal **Rhinosinusitis * Headaches **Cluster **Migraine **Tension-type **Neoplastic **Aneurysm *Salivary gland disease **Sialadenitis **Sialoithiasis *Cardiac toothache *Eagle syndrome  Management  A multi-disciplinary approach is needed for orofacial pain disorders involving both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches which can be applied to the specific type of disorder. Non-pharmacological approaches can include physical therapies and psychological support to effectively manage the facial pain and reduce the negative impact on quality of life and daily functioning. Self-management interventions, such as education, jaw posture relaxation, and cognitive or behavioral self regulation, have been shown to improve long-term outcomes for patients with orofacial pain, specifically in patients with TMD. Self- Administration of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Blocks (SPG or Pterygopalatine Ganglion) is an excellent approach to a wide variety of orofacial pain conditions. Often chronic orofacial pain (lasting over 12 weeks) requires referral to a specialised branch of medicine or dentistry or continuation of treatment in a primary care setting, if symptoms cannot be managed otherwise. * Oral and maxillofacial referral for TMD * Primary care referral for tension- type headaches * Neurology referral for migraines and cluster headaches * Ear Nose and Throat referral for rhinosinusitis and midfacial segment pain Epidemiology Orofacial pain is common problem. For example, in the United States, one report estimated that 22% of the general population had suffered from some form of facial pain at some point in the 6-month period before questioning, of which 12% was toothache. In the United Kingdom, 7% of the general population reported having some degree of chronic orofacial pain. Other reports indicate a prevalence of 10‚Äì15% for TMD in the general population. A systematic review looking at the prevalence of orofacial pain found that highest prevalence was for pain on opening the mouth (21%-49%), muscle tenderness (17%-97%) and self-reported joint pain (5%-31%).

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for the Spikenard flower. Background Flower- class corvettes like Spikenard serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Construction She originally ordered on 22 January 1940 by the Royal Navy as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class program as HMS Spikenard (K198).

On 15 May 1941 she was one of ten corvettes loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy. She could be told apart from other Canadian Flowers by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships. War service = Royal Navy= On 21 January 1941 she sailed with convoy HX 104 to get her final equipment at South Shields, Tyne in the United Kingdom. She was worked up at Tobermory and left on June 10 with convoy OB 332 as a full escort. =Royal Canadian Navy= After commissioning in the RCN she was assigned as part of the Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF). From July 1941 to January 1942 Spikenard made three round-trips to the Mid-Ocean Meeting Point off Iceland escorting the vital trans-Atlantic convoys. On opening night (27 January 1942), Spikenards commander, Lt-Cdr. H.F. Shadforth, hammered a six-inch spike into the floor of the Seagoing Officers Club, \\"The Crows' Nest\\" in St. John's, Newfoundland (better known as \\"Newfyjohn\\" during the War). After Spikenard was torpedoed and sunk two weeks later with the loss of all except eight of her crew, fellow NEF officers preserved the nail as \\"'Spikenard' his Spike\\". It still remains on display and the members of the Club hold a \\"Corvette Wake\\" commemorative dinner every year to remember Spikenard and her crew. =Sinking= On the night of 10 February 1942, Spikenard was torpedoed by while escorting convoy SC 67. The torpedo struck Spikenard at virtually the same instant as another torpedo exploded against a nearby Norwegian tanker, M/S Heina. In the confusion of battle, the other escorts in the group believed that only the now blazing and illuminated tanker had been struck, and rescued her entire crew. Spikenard was not on fire and the other escorts did not realize she was hit and sinking. The other escorts in the group had been caught up chasing contacts and did not realize that Spikenard was gone until she failed to answer repeated radio calls. Some escorts fell back and found only eight survivors. Spikenards Commanding Officer had been the senior officer of the escort group.

This kind of loss leaves a person searching for answers, and thus complicates and delays the process of grieving, and often results in unresolved grief. Some examples are infertility, termination of pregnancy, disappearance of a family member,Beam, C., & Dudly, D. (2014, August 1). Living With A Loved One's Disappearance. AARP The Magazine. death of an ex-spouse, a family member being physically alive but in a state of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease or dementia, etc. An ambiguous loss can be categorized into two types of loss, physical or psychological. Physical loss and psychological loss differ in terms of what is being grieved for, the loss of the physical body, or the psychological mind. Experiencing an ambiguous loss can lead to personal questions, such as, \\"Am I still married to my missing spouse?,\\" or \\"Am I still a child to a parent who no longer remembers me?\\". Since the grief process in an ambiguous loss is halted, it is harder to cope or move on to acceptance from the type of loss experienced. There are various types of grief that can occur due to the type of ambiguity experienced and corresponding therapy techniques to address the certain types of grief. The overall goal of therapy to cope with ambiguous loss is to overcome the trauma associated with it and restoring resilience.  Types  An ambiguous loss can be physical or psychological in nature. =Physical loss= A physical ambiguous loss means that the body of a loved one is no longer around, such as a missing person or unrecovered body from war, but is still remembered psychologically due to the chance of coming back, for example in missing person cases. A physical ambiguous loss can occur across generations, such as the families of victims of the holocaust, and can cause as traumatic distress as Posttraumatic stress disorder. =Psychological loss= The second type of ambiguous loss is where a person is still physically there, but is psychologically absent. This happens in cases where the brain is affected, therefore affecting the behavior or well being of the individual. Psychological ambiguous loss does not just occur to family and friends of the person affected. Psychological loss can happen personally in terms of one losing sense of who they are. This can stem from having a traumatic brain injury and not knowing who they are, causing a lost feeling and uncertain identity issues. Grieving process The grieving process for an ambiguous loss differs from regular mourning in that one is unable to gain closure due to unresolved grief. In cases of a psychological ambiguous loss, the grieving process can be especially difficult because of the inability to accept or admit that there is a problem and cannot confront their situation in the first place in order to deal with the problem. One key factor in getting over an ambiguous loss is resilience. In the normal grieving process, people obtain closure after dealing with a loss. In an ambiguous loss, closure does not exist, and should not be sought after in this case. =Resilience= Resilience and hope are important in the case of an ambiguous loss because paired together, they are able to allow the individual to come to terms with the loss and continue moving forward in life. One way to tell that someone is resilient in a case with ambiguous loss is that they actively seek out help when they know it is needed. Uncontrollable factors such as culture, age, socioeconomic status, and genetics are all factors that contribute to resilience. Trauma and ambiguous loss often co-exist together and if the trauma is not dealt with it can trigger unresolved emotions. Therapy will address a case of ambiguous loss by restoring resilience, and reconnecting with the loss and the relationship with whom the loss is associated. =Three types of grief= The difference between regular grief and grief from an ambiguous loss is the type of loss creates the type of grief experienced. Grief in ambiguous loss can be both beneficial and difficult. Since the grief in an ambiguous loss differs than the linear stages of grief there is no pressure to move on or achieve closure, and this allows for people to remember the lost loved one and move on with relationships and life. There are three specific types of grief that can develop from the type of ambiguous loss. Anticipatory grief Anticipatory grief occurs before bereavement, mourning after death occurs, and upon realizing that death may be imminent for a loved one, anticipatory grief sets in. This type of grief is common among families who have a loved one living with Alzheimer's disease. The grief becomes anticipatory due to the knowledge that the loved one's mental state will only become worse, so the grieving process can start very early. Disenfranchised grief The second type of grief that can develop from an ambiguous loss is disenfranchised grief. It is also known as unrecognized grief because it often occurs in the loss of a beloved pet and the grief is not taken seriously. Frozen grief Frozen grief is the third type of grief, it is a result of the ambiguity of death because of the physical or psychological disappearance and therefore one's grief is frozen since they do not get a chance to let grief run a normal course. Origins The term \\"ambiguous loss\\" was first used in the 1970s by Pauline Boss, a researcher who studied families of soldiers who went missing in action and coined the term in the late 1970s. During her research, Boss had previously used the term boundary ambiguity from 1973 up until 1977, and that term was later replaced with ambiguous loss in 1977.

While not officially a municipality, the area was granted its own ZIP Code (07837) in 1933 by the US Postal Service. Currently the area contains a small US Post Office, several residential apartments and bungalows, and a restaurant & bar overlooking Lake Hopatcong. Nearby residents get their mail delivered to PO boxes at the Glasser Post Office. Visitors to Glasser may find a variety of different ways it's displayed on current GPS devices. In some cases it may appear as Glasser, Hopatcong, Lake Hopatcong or even Andover. A correspondence with Garmin's support explained that because of Glasser's unusual status \\"the street addressing is assigned to a surrounding ZIP (in this case Andover, New Jersey 07821). View of Glasser, NJ History According to the New Jersey Postal History Society, \\"Despite the lack of an official designation, almost everyone refers to the town as Glasser, for Bill Glasser who purchased the property in 1910, said [former postmaster] Elmer Hobbs. According to the postmaster, Glasser built a general store where the post office now stands. At the time, the only post office in the area was in Landing, on the southern end of the lake. A narrow, unfinished road was the only way to get by land from one end of the lake to the other. As a service to his customers and neighbors, Glasser picked up their mail (via boat in summertime) and allowed neighbors to pick up their mail at his general store. In 1933, the post office made Glasser a postmaster because it was determined that he could not otherwise be permitted to carry mail that did not belong to him. When ZIP codes came into existence, they gave him one ‚Äî 07837 ‚Äî and started calling the town Glasser. \\"They didn't want to call it Henderson. It's a cove on the lake. The area's also known as Northwood. But there were too many Northwoods and Hendersons in the postal system,\\" said Hobbs. The name then began showing up on maps, marked as a dot on the Sussex-Morris county border. \\"It's not an official town,\\" said Rusby. \\"But if you have a post office, you get put on the map.\\".The Journal of the New Jersey Postal History Society One resident who held a box at Glasser in the 1980s, Dennis Burnham, reports that when he began using a postage meter, Elmer Hobbs was thrilled because it required him to requisition the official crimping tools from the USPS, making it harder for the government to shut down a post office in which there is a metered customer. Burnham, who moved away in 1992, recalls how Hobbs once asked him to send his attractive assistant to fetch the mail on the day Charles Kuralt visited Glasser to interview Hobbs for his CBS series, \\"On the Road.\\" In 2011, news surfaced that the Post Office in Glasser may face a possible shutdown. Since that time, the United States Postal Service has kept the office open, but reduced the hours to 2 hours a day Monday through Friday and 3 hours on Saturday. They also constructed outdoor PO boxes so that the residents may get their mail outside of the new operating hours (residents of the area don't receive mail delivery and must pick up their mail from the Glasser Post Office) View of Henderson Cove from Glasser, NJ References External links * Hopatcong Borough website * Lake Hopatcong Historical Museum Category:Hopatcong, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in Sussex County, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey ","title":"Glasser, New Jersey"},{"id":"40071332","text":"Taichung City Dragon FC is a football club from Taiwan Taipei, also called Republic of China.

Golden State promoted D‚ÄôAlessandro to assistant general manager in 2006. D‚ÄôAlessandro became known for his strong analytical skills and expertise in the NBA salary cap.

She is generally recognized for her study and research on aesthetics, feminism, and emotion theory.  Career  Carolyn received her Ph.D. from Brown University in 1972. In 1978, she began working as a professor of Philosophy at the University of Buffalo where she continues to work today as the Head of the Philosophy Department. Since beginning her career at the University of Buffalo, Korsmeyer has been recognized multiple times for her outstanding performance and continued achievements for her work both in and away from Philosophy. During her long career, Korsmeyer has published multiple acclaimed articles and books on feminism and aesthetics.  Overview of major work  After receiving her PhD in 1972, Korsmeyer began to focus her research on feminist philosophy and the field of aesthetics. Feminist perspectives in aesthetics has long been major work of Korsmeyer. Fine art, genius, beauty, taste, and aesthetic perception are gendered issues that she has studied and researched. = Philosophy of taste = The philosophy of taste is a relatively new subject in the field of philosophy, however Korsmeyer's study of \\"bad taste\\" is well known. Her consideration of taste in philosophy explores why pungent food like soured milk, fried bugs, extremely hot peppers, and game meat are seen as strong and complex to our palettes. A theoretical understanding of taste of food is compared to the philosophy and interpretation of art in that both deem the similar qualities that entail discriminating perception and also that food and art are both considered 'artistic in creation.' The argument Korsmeyer presents is that these \\"cosmopolitan foods\\" are so complex that they lie on a nearly transparent line straddling between the sublime and disgusting and, when the brain is given the choice, usually the positive reaction wins. Thus, these seemingly disgusting foods give a positive aesthetic response. Her publications on the subject include: *Savoring Disgust: The Foul and the Fair in Aesthetics (Oxford University Press, 2011) *The Taste Culture Reader: Experiencing Food and Drink (ed.) (Oxford: Berg Publishers 2005) *Making Sense of Taste: Food and Philosophy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999) = Feminist perspectives in aesthetics = Feminist aesthetics refers to the idea that in their basic form, classic concepts such as genius, beauty, fine art, aesthetic perception cradle social roles are qualities that are presumed as gender related. In her most notorious book titled Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction to Understanding Feminist Philosophy (London: Routledge, 2004) Korsmeyer uses these \\"classic concepts\\" to identify their qualities and goes on to explain the weight of gender as the abiding attribute. Genius, for example, is said to be 'superior in mind' which has long been associated with masculinity while 'beauty' has long been described as small, soft curvatures that \\"catch a man's eye\\" and thus, is defined as female. Much of her work revolves around the parameters of feminist presence in art, music, and literature. In her book Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective Korsemeyer compares theories of art and the varying interpretations based on gender bias. Her publications on the subject include: *Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction (London: Routledge, 2004) *\\"Feminist Aesthetics\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition) *Feminism and Tradition in Aesthetics, edited with Peggy Zeglin Brand(Indiana University Press, 1993)  Honors and achievements  University at Buffalo Research Recognition Program awarded Korsmeyer their Sustained Achievement Exceptional Scholar Award to awknowledge her outstanding performance over a several year period in her body of work. In 2001, she won the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's Mark Twain Creative Writing Competition by writing a chapter that concluded Twain's unpublished short story, A Murder, a Mystery and a Marriage.

The system consists of a somewhat evolved primary orbited by a massive, 'dark' secondary that is actually itself a close red dwarf binary, making a hierarchal triple system.  Multiplicity  Kappa Fornacis was found to be 0.23 arcseconds north of an X-ray and Radio source in 1995, a distance so close that it is most likely associated with the star. While this would indicate that the star is active and therefore young, private communication indicated that Kappa Fornacis was a spectroscopic binary, leaving the possibility that a companion star was the source of the excess emission. The Hipparcos mission detected a large 19.4 mas/year acceleration in the proper motion of Kappa Fornacis, suggesting that part of an orbit was being observed. Combining this with other proper motion data spanning approximately half a century indicated a periodic variation of 26.5 ¬± 2 years, confirming that the star is an astrometric binary. The amplitude of the variation indicated a mass sum of ; with a primary of approximately , it was evident that the two components must have approximately equal masses. However, as the companion's light or spectrum was not observed, it was clear that it was fainter than a main sequence star. This was interpreted as the companion being a white dwarf. Apparently unaware of the indication of binarity, Kappa Fornacis was included in several radial velocity-based planet searches that began towards the end of the century. A long-period variability was obvious; a linear trend of -1.73 ¬± 0.02 m/s/d was found by the CCPS, while the longer time series of the ESO-CES survey, non-linearity in the trend was apparent and a preliminary orbit was presented, considerably shorter than the astrometric one. Abt et al. 2006 expanded upon this with new and historical data to find a more precise orbit, again shorter than the astrometric one. More recently, a continuation of the ESO-CES survey to the HARPS spectrograph indicates that the companion's orbital period is somewhat longer, more consistent with the astrometric period. Kappa Fornacis B was first resolved independently by Lafreni√®re et al. (2007) and Tokovinin and Cantarutti (2008), both finding a separation of about 0.5 arcseconds that is consistent with the astrometric orbit. The difference in brightness between the two components confirmed that the secondary is overly faint for its mass; The latter paper ascribes this to it being a massive white dwarf or a close M-dwarf binary, but could not discriminate between the two possibilities. The companion has been resolved several times since, allowing for a preliminary visual orbit to be made by 2012. Tokovinin (2013) combined spectroscopic and visual data on the system to find the most accurate determination of the binary orbit thus far. While the photometric colours of the secondary are consistent with an early M-dwarf (), it lies above the main sequence, meaning that its luminosity is too high to be a single star. This means that the secondary must actually be two close stars of similar spectral type, themselves orbiting the more massive primary. Two faint absorption lines were weakly detected in the HŒ± line, varying by about 80 km/s over a period of a few days; these are consistent with two M-dwarfs orbiting each other, confirming that the secondary is a close binary. The subsystem consists of two approximately equal-mass red dwarfs orbiting each other every ~3.7 days. Binaries with such close orbits typically maintain high levels of activity for their lifetimes due to their rotational periods being synchronised to their orbital period, so the components of the secondary are the source of the excess energy in the system.  Properties  The position of Kappa Fornacis A and the combined light of Bab on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. 20px 20px In terms of an object on the celestial sphere, Kappa Fornacis is a fifth magnitude star that lies close to the border between the northerly border of Fornax with Cetus. At magnitude 5.2, it is approximately the seventh-brightest star in the constellation. Kappa Fornacis A's colours and temperature indicate that it has a spectral type of G1 V, meaning that it is about 100 kelvins hotter than the Sun. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (left) the star lies somewhat above the main sequence, indicating that it is in the process of evolving between the dwarf and subgiant stage; this is supported by its surface gravity being lower than a typical G-dwarf and its low level of chromospheric activity (log R'HK ‚âà -5.0). The star has a mass that is about a fifth larger than solar, a value that would be typical of a late F-dwarf (~F7V) when it was on the main sequence. Different methods to estimate the age of the star generally agree that Kappa Fornacis A is 5 to 6 billion years old, making it perhaps 1 billion years older than the Sun. This age corresponds to both the oldest members of the thin disk and the youngest members of the thick disk, though the system falls into the former population based on its kinematics (UVW = -19.5, -16.2, -9.6 km/s) and its close-to-solar metallicity. The two components of Kappa Fornacis B are both early M-dwarfs. Assuming that they are identical, they both have masses approximately half that of the Sun. Because they are in such a short-period orbit, tidal effects will maintain a high level of activity on both stars (in analogue with CM Draconis), meaning that they likely experience flares and rotational variation (BY Draconis variability).

The group is a collective of rappers and record producers that includes east coast rappers Joey Badass, CJ Fly, Kirk Knight, Nyck Caution, Dyemond Lewis, Aaron Rose, Dessy Hinds, Dirty Sanchez, Rokamouth, J.A.B. and Jakk the Rhymer, along with producers Chuck Strangers and Powers Pleasant. The collective was formed in 2011 by Capital STEEZ and Powers Pleasant, with Joey Badass and CJ Fly among its founding members. History =Music career= 2008‚Äì2011: The 3rd Kind and formation of Pro Era Capital STEEZ, then known as Jay STEEZ, had started recording music around 2008. During those times STEEZ was also a part of a rap duo called The 3rd Kind along with childhood friend, Jakk the Rhymer. The 3rd Kind released their only mixtape, The Yellow Tape, in 2009. In the spring of 2011, while still a student at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, New York, Capital STEEZ had a performance at a cafe in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, with friends including Powers Pleasant, Joey Badass and Dirty Sanchez also in attendance to show him support. On their way home from the performance, he and Powers Pleasant came up with the idea of forming a hip hop collective, which they named \\"Progressive Era\\", or \\"Pro Era\\" for short. In addition to the two co-founders, Joey Badass, Dirty Sanchez and CJ Fly were brought into the group as founding members. =2012: Rise in popularity and death of Capital STEEZ= The Pro Era collective signed with the Cinematic Music Group label in 2012, shortly after Jonny Shipes became the manager of Joey Badass. On February 14, 2012, Pro Era released their debut mixtape entitled The Secc$ Tap.e. The release of the AmeriKKKan Korruption (Capital STEEZ) and 1999 (Joey Badass) mixtapes increased the group's popularity in the underground scene. 1999 was listed among \\"Best Mixtapes of 2012\\" by multiple publications. Capital STEEZ was on the list of \\"Rappers to Watch For in 2013\\" curated by website HipHopDX. Pro Era performed with The Smoker's Club's One Hazy Summer Tour, a 30-date tour that began July 13, 2012. In December of that year, Pro Era released the PEEP: The aPROcalypse mixtape. From October 27 to December 1, 2012, Joey Badass went on the first tour for any member of the collective, beginning in New York and ending in Virginia, with the tour also extending abroad to countries such as Switzerland, France, England and the Netherlands. On December 24, 2012, Capital STEEZ committed suicide, jumping from the rooftop of the Cinematic Music Group headquarters in Manhattan, New York City. Earlier that evening, he sent text messages to a few of his closest friends, telling them he loved them. At 11:59 PM on December 23, Dewar posted a tweet saying, \\"The end.\\" He jumped to his death later that night. =2013‚Äì14: Touring and mixtapes= CJ Fly (left) and Joey Badass (right) at the Under the Influence Tour in Toronto, Canada on August 10, 2013. On March 21, 2013, Pro Era participated in the Beast Coastal concert tour with The Underachievers and Flatbush Zombies. The Beast Coastal concert tour performed all over the United States. The first leg of the tour covered the West coast while the second leg covered the East and Midwest, before the tour ended on April 20. Pro Era began a tour of their own on August 29, 2013 at Fort Punta Christo Pula in Croatia and they performed at a variety of venues including New Zealand, Australia and the United States. The tour went on to December 14 and this was technically the first tour in which Pro Era as a group went on tour. Later that year, Pro Era toured with the Under the Influence 2013 tour with Wiz Khalifa, ASAP Rocky, Trinidad James, Chevy Woods and Smoke DZA, among others. On October 5, 2013, CJ Fly released his debut mixtape, Thee Way Eye See It. On December 25, 2013, the group announced that their third mixtape, The Secc$ Tap.e 2, would be released on February 14, 2014. As promised, it would be released on that day, as a part of a free-music giveaway coined \\"Pro Era Week\\". Their next project, The Shift, a free EP was released on May 27, 2014 by Scion AV. = 2014‚Äìpresent: Solo projects and Beast Coast supergroup = Due to the coming release of his debut studio album, Joey Badass began a long world tour alongside Pro Era. The tour started on August 8, 2014 in Norway before they went on to tour the U.S. for weeks until reaching their Europe leg of the tour which began in England on November 18 making stops in countries like France, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Croatia, Switzerland, and Germany. Joey Badass and Pro Era decided to cut the tour short while in Australia due to the death of member, and cousin of Joey Badass, Junior B. After Joey Badass' debut album was released, he stated in an interview that Kirk Knight, Nyck Caution, and CJ Fly will be releasing new music in 2015. He also announced an upcoming Pro Era album as well as a Capital STEEZ posthumous album. Pro Era producer and rapper Kirk Knight began his first tour with fellow Cinematic Music Group artist, Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins, without any other musical artists within Pro Era, on February 13, 2015 and will continue to February 27. They will tour the United States and make stops throughout the country. Joey Badass released his debut album, B4.Da.$$ on January 20, 2015. He went along to promote it on his \\"World Domination Tour\\". In June 2015, Powers Pleasant released his debut project, The Powers Pleasant Experience, while Kirk Knight also released his debut project, Late Knight Special, on October 30, 2015. On February 2, 2016, Swankmaster RAW announced that he had left Pro Era. He wrote, \\"Respectively, want to let to whom it may concern know, I'm no longer a part of the Era. Many blessings to all my brothers.\\" On February 3, 2016, Joey Badass reported on Twitter that another member, Dyemond Lewis, had an amicable split with the group. He wrote, \\"Dyemond Lewis is no longer a part of PROERA... That's my brother to the death but we had to come to this conclusion unfortunately.\\" On February 29, 2016, Nyck Caution released his debut project, Disguise the Limit. On December 9, 2016, CJ Fly released his debut project, FlyTrap. On December 27, Nyck Caution announced the album Nyck @ Knight, a collaborative effort between himself and Kirk Knight, stating that they had already completed 4 songs. On June 2017, both Kirk Knight and Nyck Caution announced that the collaborative project was completed. It is scheduled to be released on July 21st of 2017. On the third annual STEEZ Day Festival, Joey Badass announced after Pro Era's performance that they are working on a group album as well as announcing that a posthumous album from Capital STEEZ, King Capital, was to be released on December 23, 2017, the 5th anniversary of his death. However, on December 11 (eleven days before King Capital was due for release), Joey Badass announced on his Instagram account that the album's release would be delayed until further notice due to \\"business legalities and sample clearances.\\" In 2019, the supergroup Beast Coast, consisting of members from Pro Era, as well as fellow Brooklyn-based hip hop groups Flatbush Zombies and The Underachievers, released three singles ahead of their debut album, Escape from New York, released on May 24, 2019. The group also announced a North American summer tour that began on July 23 and scheduled to end on August 16. 47 logo controversy The \\"47\\" symbol associated with Pro Era The design of one of Pro Era's logos is the number 47 with its digits joined together. It has sparked controversy due to its similarity to the Nazi flag. Like the Nazi flag, the logo has a red field with a solid white circle and a black insignia. Instead of a swastika, the circular white field of the sticker contains the 47 symbol, which bears close resemblance to the swastika and to a wolfsangel, both of which are associated with Nazism and Neo-Nazism. Stickers of the logo and graffiti of the symbol appeared in numerous locations around Edward R. Murrow High School and the Brooklyn neighborhood of Midwood (where the school is located) in March 2014, being planted by members of Pro Era to honor the memory of the late Capital STEEZ. According to local news station News 12 Brooklyn, the group has explained that the logo was designed the way it was to draw attention, and that the symbol resembles peace, love and balance, as with the swastika's significance in various religions. They say that it is supposed to be a spiritual symbol and not an offensive one. Capital STEEZ believed that the logo's resemblance of a swastika is a commentary on the appropriation of what was originally a peaceful & spiritual symbol with roots in Eastern religions.

She holds the W. Alton Jones Chair of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University. Education In 1967, she received an A.B. in political science from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1968, she moved to Canada for political reasons and resided there for a decade. By 1974 she received a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. In 1964, while Friedman was taking a year off from college, she was persuaded by what she refers to as \\"a kind of political ignorance and apathy\\" by political chaos. Career Friedman's full-time teaching career began in 1973 at Denison University, where she spent four years teaching . Since then she has also taught in the U.S. and Canada, ranging from small private liberal arts college to a large state university, such as University of Western Ontario, Bowling Green State University, Purdue University, and Washington University in St. Louis. By the mid-1980s, autonomy had become her main academic focus. \\"Many feminists thought that the moral ideal of autonomy represented male but not female modes of moral reasoning,\\" said Friedman. \\"Most people saw autonomy as a separation of self from loved ones‚Äîa kind of selfishness. I see it in terms of self-determination, and I didn't think it had to carry specifically masculine associations.\\" Friedman considers the impact of familial and community relationships on autonomy and considers critical reflection as a way to diminish oppression. She has also explored such topics as: the nature of close interpersonal relationships, women in poverty, care and justice, partiality and impartiality, autonomy, gender identity, and multicultural education.Switala, Kristin. \\"Marilyn Friedman.\\" Center for Digital Discourse and Cultureat Virginia Tech University.

In 2009 she joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University, working in social and political philosophy, ethics, and feminist theory. Publications Friedman's first book, What Are Friends For? Feminist Perspectives on Personal Relationships on Moral Theory, discusses friendship, care ethics, partiality, and impartiality. Her 2003 book Autonomy, Gender, Politics, defends the ideals of autonomy against various analyses and applies that model to issues like domestic violence and multicultural political relationships.Tennant, Kristin. \\"Philosopher Explores Autonomy as Self Determination .\\" Washington University in St. Louis Magazine.

Awards and recognition Throughout Friedman's career, she has earned several research fellowships and directed a woman‚Äôs studies program. Her fields of special interest are female terrorists, women‚Äôs rights, and cultural diversity. Friedman's interests include a project on female terrorists, and she has covered topics such as whether virtue is required for happiness, how to engage in blaming people in a responsible manner, and how to understand abused women who are convicted of failing to protect their children from the same abusers who are abusing them.

The military investigation has led to the arrest and questioning of several officials, with the case eventually transferred to civilian prosecutors from Ministry of Justice. A court subsequently found 13 military officials guilty of various charges and handed out prison sentences of up to eight months. His death sparked the resignation of Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu, an apology from President Ma Ying-jeou, public protests, major reforms to Taiwan's legal system including the abolition of court martial during peacetime, and doubts over the future of Taiwan's conscription program changes. Background =Biography of deceased= Hung Chung-chiu was raised in Taichung City by his biological uncle. He lived with his adoptive parents and older sister, Hung Tzu-yung. Hung attended the National Cheng Kung University, where he studied in its Transportation and Communication Management Science department. He was accepted to the master's program in said department, but chose to serve his conscription requirement prior to enrolling. =Military detention and death= Hung was serving in the 542nd Brigade in Hsinchu and had been set to be discharged on 6 July. Hung was sent to military detention at a Yangmei base on 28 June after he was found carrying a camera phone a few days prior. One of Hung's fellow conscripts alleged that Hung was wrongfully detained and the victim of a personal vendetta; Hung previously had been at odds with his superiors. Hung was ordered to perform strenuous exercise drills as part of his punishment, and was hospitalized on 3 July, after reportedly suffering a heatstroke and falling into a coma. Hung was initially sent to Ten-Chen Medical Hospital, but was subsequently transferred to Tri-Service General Hospital when his body temperature had risen to 44 ¬∞C (108 ¬∞F). Hung died of organ failure on July 4, 2013, two days before he was due to be discharged from the military. Local media reported that his superiors had allegedly refused to give him water during a drill even though he had repeatedly asked for it. Investigation On July 15, Taiwan's defense ministry released initial findings which showed that Hung should have only been given an administrative punishment and that even if he had committed an offense that merited a military detention punishment, that physical drills should not have been allowed under the heat and humidity he experienced. Questions were raised on the medical and psychological report on Hung that was approved before he was sent for detention at 269th Brigade. Such a medical report would normally take a week to complete, but it was expedited within half a day which military investigators described as \\"unusual\\". Similar questions were raised on delays in emergency transport and treatment of Hung after he fell into coma at the detention barrack; Taiwanese media used civilian CCTV recordings of the journey to 819th Army Hospital to allege that the ambulance was traveling at a slow speed and its sirens turned off. On 26 July, an autopsy report determined that the Hung's death was \\"inflicted by others\\". A few witnesses who spoke to the media after the death of Hung have reportedly received death threats from unknown sources. =Missing CCTV evidence= Critical segments of the closed- circuit television (CCTV) recording that was recovered by investigations from the 269th Brigade that housed Hung in detention were discovered missing. Military investigators attempted to recover the data, but found both segments to contain only black screens. In one instance, all 16 CCTV cameras went blank for 80 minutes between 2pm to 3.20pm on 3 July. This has led to allegations of foul play by Hung's family, the Taiwanese media and opposition members from Legislative Yuan. Investigators from Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office have also joined in the investigation and have removed the entire 16-channel CCTV equipment from the detention barracks for further investigation. The missing CCTV evidence became a significant focus of this investigation. Hung's soldier diary was also initially reported as lost, but was subsequently recovered and the last entry was dated 6 months before his death. Prosecutions 37 military officials received punishment over Hung's death, and 18 cases of criminal prosecutions were initiated under civilian courts. This included Hung's superiors in 542nd Brigade and officials from the military detention base at 269th Brigade. The highest and second highest-ranking officials to be prosecuted were Major General Shen Wei-chih and Colonel Ho Chiang-chun, commander and deputy commander of 542nd Brigade, respectively. On 7 March 2014, the Taoyuan District Court found 13 military officials guilty of abuse of power and handed down sentences of up to eight months imprisonment: * Company Commander Hsu Hsin-cheng received an eight-month imprisonment sentence for abuse of authority. * Major General Shen Wei-chih, Colonel Ho Chiang-chung and four other officials were sentenced to six months imprisonment for their abuse of authority to detain Hung. * Staff Sergeant Chen Yi-hsun, who oversaw Hung while he was in detention at 269th Brigade, received a six months imprisonment sentence for abuse which could be commuted to a fine. Five more officials were acquitted due to insufficient evidence. The family found the sentences too light and \\"unacceptable\\", vowing to file an appeal to Taiwan High Court. The appeal was decided on 28 June 2017. Major General Shen Wei- chih, First Lieutenant Kao Yu-lung, and Sergeant Lo Chi-yuan were found not guilty. Six other defendants were subject to reduced sentences. The High Court decisions regarding Shen Wei-chih and Chen Yi-hsun were appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld Shen's not guilty verdict and sentenced Chen to four months imprisonment and two years of probation. Public reaction Public protest to defend Hung Chung-chiu by carrying dark ROC flag. On 20 July 2013, 30,000 protestors known as Citizen 1985 gathered outside the defense ministry building, where Deputy Minister of National Defense Andrew Yang accepted a petition letter from protestors. The second protest, held on 3 August by the same group, attracted a record number of followers in Taiwan, reaching over 100,000. In response to these protests Legislative Yuan quickly approved major reforms to Taiwan's military justice system, which included the abolition of court martial during peacetime and transfer of military prisoners to civilian prisons. Members of the 542nd Brigade attended Hung's funeral under intense media scrutiny. Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Kao Hua- chu tendered his resignation after the incident, but was initially declined by President Ma Ying-jeou. Kao's tendered his resignation again and this was approved on 30 July. His deputy Andrew Yang took his post. President Ma visited Hung's family and made assurances on a complete investigation, and has also made a public apology. Taiwanese TV media and Hung's family have criticized the slow pace and opaqueness of the military investigation. In particular Chung T'ien Television's News Tornado have decided to conduct their own private investigation by inviting whistleblowers who had just discharged from the Army and media analysts on air; these whistleblowers alleged to have witnessed several military malpractices. The Taiwanese government has offered compensation of NT$100 million (US$3.34 million) for Hung's death. The Hung family insisted that the military officials responsible should bear the compensation amount and rejected the offer, saying that they only consider this matter after the truth is revealed. Hung's death has cast further doubts over Taiwan's military conscription program changes due to manpower shortfalls. Taiwan was supposed to transition to an all-volunteer force by 2015 and shorten military service from one year to four months. 17,447 recruitments were needed for 2013 and only 1,847 was achieved by July, and this incident has shaken public confidence making the target much more difficult to achieve. Following the lower court rulings on the case, Citizen 1985 and netizens voiced disappointment at the sentences, and plan to organize another demonstration.

Exhibits at the park, which is located in a former railyard, tell the story of the creation of the Hoosac Tunnel. The freight yard was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as the Freight Yard Historic District. History The city of North Adams was relatively isolated in the early 19th century, separated from the rest of Massachusetts to the east by Hoosac Mountain, and on the west by the Taconic Mountains. With the advent of the railroad in the late 1820s, proposals were developed for rail connections to other parts of Massachusetts and eastern New York. In 1846, the first rail connection was made, with Pittsfield to the south. The Troy and Greenfield Railroad was chartered in 1848 to develop a rail line that would connect Troy, New York, to Greenfield, Massachusetts, via North Adams and a tunnel through Hoosac Mountain. Work on the Hoosac Tunnel began in the 1850s, but would not be completed until the 1870s; its construction alone provided an employment boom to North Adams.Paul, Bradford. NRHP nomination for Freight Yard Historic District (1972). Available by request from the National Park Service. Rail service between North Adams and Troy was inaugurated in 1859, with this rail yard as its eastern terminus. Between 1859 and the opening of the tunnel in 1875, this rail yard served as a freight and passenger depot. The focus of activity moved around the turn of the century across the Hoosic River to the Union Depot, while this rail yard continued to serve as a freight-handling and storage area. Portions of the railroad properties were subjected to urban renewal in the second half of the 20th century. In the 1980s, preservations restored the surviving properties and adapted some of them for use as a state park and museum. The park saw its grand opening celebrations during the summer of 1986.

Life and work Kevin Lincoln was born in Battery Point, Hobart in 1941 and moved to Melbourne in the 1960s, where he has lived and worked ever since. Receiving little to no formal art training, in order to make a living before he could devote his time to art Lincoln worked various jobs, including as a welder and boilermaker. His early works are predominantly linocuts. The effect of the harsh and contrasting line work that is conducive to the medium, effectively reflects the sparsity of the industrial landscape that surrounded him during this early period. It was not until the 1970s that Lincoln began to work within the more dynamic medium of paint. Lincoln has been described as Australia's most introverted and underrated artists by art critic John McDonald. Despite his introverted nature, Lincoln is widely admired for his still lifes, self- portraits and etchings, all of which embody a sense of restraint and austerity. Recurring themes throughout his work have included age, mortality and the solitary figure. Stylistically, his is work has developed from expressive social realism to abstraction. At over 70 years of age Lincoln continues to develop his practice as a rigorous draughtsman, printmaker and painter. Exhibitions Lincoln has exhibited consistently for over 50 years. He gained visibility within the Melbourne art scene in 1964 when his work was exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society drawing and print exhibition. Lincoln went onto exhibit with The Social Realist Group throughout the 1960s in galleries across Australia. Over the course of his artistic career Lincoln has held more than 50 solo shows such as Kevin Lincoln: The Eye‚Äôs Mind, Art Gallery of Ballarat, 2016, Victoria & Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston, Tasmania; Still lifes and landscapes, 2013, Liverpool Street Gallery, Sydney; The Sea in Winter, 2005, Niagara Galleries, Melbourne; and Survey Exhibition 1977‚Äì88, 1988, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, Victoria. He has also participated in over 100 group exhibitions throughout Australia including Blue Chip XIX: The Collectors‚Äô Exhibition, 2017, Niagara Galleries, Melbourne; A Fine Line: Drawings from the collection, 2016, Gippsland Art Gallery, Sale, Victoria; Artist Artists, 2011, Benalla Art Gallery, Victoria; Snap Freeze: Still Life in the Twenty-first Century, 2007, TarraWarra Museum of Art, Victoria; To Look Within: Self Portraits in Australia, 2004, National Portrait Gallery, Canberra; and with the Dobell Drawing Prize Exhibition, 1994, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney Brisbane. Throughout his career Lincoln has also consistently participated in numerous art fairs, such as the Melbourne Art Fair from 2000 to 2014 and the Second, Third and Fourth Australian Contemporary Art Fair respectively in 1990, 1992, 1994. Collections and awards Lincoln's work appears in the permanent collections of major Australian galleries such as the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales and Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, as well as numerous state, regional, university and private collections throughout Australia.

They occur throughout the world, except for the Subantarctic region. Like many Sciomyzidae, species of this genus have larvae that are predators or parasitoids of snails. The larva of P. albovaria, for example, eats land snails such as Anguispira alternata and A. fergusoni, and then pupates in the empty shell. The P. albocostata larva eats up to five snails and then pupates in the ground litter next to the last empty shell. The larva of P. inflexa attacks the glass snail Zonitoides arboreus. P. punctata is a parasitoid on the amber snail Succinea putris. P. anubis larvae feed on several types of freshwater snails along the edges of ponds and marshes. Several Pherbellia are predators of the pond snail Stagnicola palustris. While most snail-killing flies target land and freshwater pulmonate snails, P. prefixa preys on the mossy valvata (Valvata sincera), which is an operculate snail in the valve snail family. As of 2012 there were about 95 species in the genus.

Christianity started to spread among the Icelanders at the end of the 10th century. The adoption of the new faith by the whole population was the consequence of a compromise between the Christian and heathen chieftains, as well as the lawspeaker, at the national assembly or Al√æingi of 999 or 1000. Initially missionary bishops and priests of foreign origin composed the clergy, but the number of local priests quickly increased. The first Icelandic bishop, √çsleifur Gissurarson was consecrated in 1056. Within fifty years two dioceses were established in the island, with their seats at Sk√°lholt and H√≥lar which were subordinated to foreign archbishops. Landowners had a preeminent role in the administration of Church affairs and earned significant income from the tithe after it was introduced in 1097. Legislation limited the bishops' authority until the end of the Commonwealth in 1264. The principle of the autonomy of the Church only prevailed at the middle of the 14th century. Monasteries, most of them established in the 12th and 13th centuries, became important centers of literature. The Lutheran form of the Reformation which was introduced in Iceland between 1541 and 1551 caused fundamental changes in Church life, spirituality and culture. For instance, the bulk of Church estates was confiscated and the cult of saints was abolished. The first Icelandic translation of the New Testament was published in 1540, and of the whole Bible in 1584. First Christians (c. 795 ‚Äì c. 1000) A 10th-century statue of Thor, the Norse god of thunder, found in Iceland Irish monks voyaging in their small boats known as currachs seem to have been the first settlers to reach Iceland. For instance, Dicuil in his De Mensura Orbis Terrae (\\"Of the Dimensions of the World\\") writes of Irish hermits who spent, in 795, six months on an otherwise uninhabited island where the nights were so bright \\"not only at the time of the summer solstice, but for several days before and after\\" that a man could pick \\"lice from his shirt\\". The √çslendingab√≥k (\\"The Book of the Icelanders\\") makes mention of Christians known as papar or fathers who had already settled in Iceland by the time the first Norse settlers arrived. They departed from the island leaving behind \\"Irish books, bells, croziers, and lots of other things\\"The Book of Settlements: Landn√°mab√≥k (ch. 1.), p. 15. at the arrival of the new colonists. The first Scandinavians reached Iceland in the middle of the 9th century, but its systematic colonization started in the early 870s. Although Christian individuals must have been among those who settled in Iceland, because many colonists arrived from Ireland, England or Scotland, the majority of the settlers were pagans. The latter remained strictly adhered to the cult of Odin, Thor and the other gods of the Nordic pantheon. Paganism even strengthened following the establishment of the national assembly or Al√æingi in 930 which gave rise to a process of unification among the Icelanders. The assembly was composed of chieftains or go√∞ar who had a leading role in the pagann cults. Olaf I Tryggvason of Norway Christian missionaries started to visit Iceland in the last decades of the 10th century. A German missionary bishop, Friedrich who arrived in 981 was the first among them. He was forced to depart from the island in 986 after his Icelandic aide, Thorvald Konradsson, had murdered two men in a battle. Next the Icelandic Stefnir Thorgilsson arrived, who had been dispatched with this mission by Olaf Tryggvason, king of Norway (r. 997‚Äì1000). He was expelled from the country after he had destroyed pagan sanctuaries. Likewise, the next missionary sent to Iceland by the king, the German or Flemish Thangbrand, was forced to leave around 999 because he had murdered some of those who opposed his mission. He reported to the king \\"that it was beyond all expectation that Christianity might yet be accepted\\"√çslendingab√≥k: The Book of the Icelanders (ch. 7.), p. 8. in Iceland, although he had succeeded in converting many chieftains. On hearing this, King Olaf decided to have all pagan Icelanders who were staying in Norway captured and to forbid all Icelanders from Norwegian ports. Since Norway was Iceland's main trading partner, Icelanders needed to maintain the peace. Accordingly, two Christian chieftains who were related to King Olaf, Gissur Teitsson and Hjalti Skeggjason, were sent to Norway. They promised the monarch that they would be making every effort to convert the whole island. In response, King Olaf released his hostages, many of whom were related to pagan Icelandic chieftains. Christianization (c. 1000) Law Rock or L√∂gberg at Thingvellir Gissur Teitsson and Hjalti Skeggjason returned to Iceland. Initially they were planning to set up a separate administration for the Christians. The sharp contrast between the most radical pagan and Christian chieftains' views became manifest at the Al√æingi of 999 or 1000. In order to avoid the breaking out of a civil war, the go√∞ar finally agreed to appoint one of their number, the Lawspeaker Thorgeir Thorkelssonwho was a paganto decide the case. Following his appointment, Thorgeir Thorkelsson withdrew for a whole day. Thereafter he announced his decision to the assembled chieftains, according to which all Icelanders had to be baptised, but heathens were allowed to worship Odin and the other gods in secret. He even permitted the continuation of the old practice of exposition of children at birth and the eating of horsemeat. Many go√∞ar and their retinue were baptized on the spot in the cold water, but \\"all the people from the Northern and Southern Quarters were baptised in Reykjalaug in Laugardalr\\"Kristni Saga: The Story of the Conversion (ch. 12.), p. 50. where geothermal springs could be found. Legend says that even Thorgeir Thorkelsson decided to throw all his domestic idols into a large waterfall which was named Go√∞afoss or \\"Gods' Waterfall\\" after this event. Go√∞afoss or \\"Gods' Waterfall\\" Coin of King Olaf II of Norway The story of the consensual conversion of Iceland was first recorded by Ari Thorgilsson in the early 12th century. Historian Gunnar Karlsson states that Ari Thorgilsson's narration is \\"unbelievable, but it is the only one we have\\". All the same, the story \\"has been used to suggest that voluntary Christianization of an entire population was possible, without any link to a central power\\" (Nora Berend). Thorgeir Thorkelsson's verdict can even be cited as a \\"measure of crisis management to save Iceland from a bitter split\\". On the other hand, the historian Anders Winroth emphasizes that the go√∞ar, through their conversion, \\"monopolized religion for their group, making it more difficult for new men to join their ranks\\". It is without doubt that social attitudes changed radically in short time after the conversion. For instance, duels which had traditionally been fought at Thingvellir were prohibited and slavery declined from the early 11th century. All pagan customs confirmed by Thorgeir Thorkelsson's verdictincluding the worship of Norse deities in privatewere abolished in 1016, mainly due to the efforts by King Olaf II of Norway. The grateful monarch sent a bell and timber after this decision in order to promote the erection of a church at Thingvellir. Middle Ages (c. 1000‚Äì1536) =Icelandic Commonwealth (c. 1000‚Äì1264)= Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg The institutional framework of Christianity was developing in the 11th century. Individual landownerseither go√∞ar or simple farmersplayed a preeminent role in the process: they built the earliest churches and employed the first priests. Accordingly, most churches were for centuries controlled and administered by them and by their descendants, which contributed to the evolution of \\"a system of privately run churches\\" (Gunnar Karlsson). The first clergymen were foreigners, mostly from England or the Holy Roman Empire. However, it was not unusual, at least up until the 1150s, that go√∞ar were ordained as priests. A landowner could also hire a poor young man to be trained for the priesthood in order to serve in his sponsor's church. Such a cleric or kirkjuprestr had limited freedom, because his employer was entitled by law to force him to return if he had departed from the church entrusted to him. Likewise a priest hired by a landownerknown as √∞ingaprestrbecame a member of his employer's household, but he received a regular fee for his services and could serve in more than one church. Bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson of H√≥lar Besides landowners, missionary bishops played a significant role in the early development of the local Church. The √çslendingab√≥k enumerates a number of them, including \\"J√≥han the Irishman\\",√çslendingab√≥k: The Book of the Icelanders (ch. 8.), p. 10. and Bernard from England, who spent a couple of years in Iceland. The last of these \\"wandering bishops\\" (Anders Winroth), Rudolph departed from Iceland in 1050. The first local prelate, Gissur Teitsson's son, √çsleifur was elected at the Al√æingi of 1055. His earlier studies in the school of Herford Abbey made him a suitable candidate, although he had been living in marriage. Following his election, the Al√æingi requested him to make a journey abroad in order to be consecrated. √çsleifur visited Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (r. 1043-1072) who ordained him as bishop on Whitsun in 1056. Bishop √çsleifur settled in his family's farm at Sk√°lholt, but his position remained similar to a missionary bishop because he had not been ordained to a particular episcopal see. The Hungrvaka adds that he had to compete with \\"bishops from other lands\\"Hungrvaka (ch. II.), p. 47. who were supported by many locals because they were less demanding. Byock, and other specialists identify these prelates with five foreigners mentioned in the √çslendingab√≥k who \\"called themselves bishops\\".√çslendingab√≥k: The Book of the Icelanders (ch. 7.), p. 10. √çslendingab√≥k adds that three of them arrived from ermskir, which has been identified with Armenia or Ermland. It is without doubt that they represented a Paulician or other doctrine alien to Western theology. Accordingly, Archbishop Adalbert \\"sent his brief out to Iceland and forbade the men to accept all services from them\\" because they had been excommunicated. Bishop Gu√∞mundur Arason of H√≥lar Bishop √çsleifur set up a school at Sk√°lholt in order to educate the local clergy. He died in 1080. The Al√æingi appointed, in 1082, his son, Gissur to succeed him. At the assembly, all chieftains promised the future bishop that they would accept his decisions without resistance. At Pope Gregory VII's order, Gissur √çsleifsson was consecrated by the archbishop of Magdeburg, because the archbishop of Hamburg was the pope's enemy at that time. Bishop Gissur proclaimed Sk√°lholt his see and donated his inherited farm to the new diocese. He achieved the introduction of the tithe at the Al√æingi of 1097. Revenue from the tithe was divided into four parts among the bishop, the local priest, the church and the poor. Landowners who administered a church were entitled to the part of the tithe which served the upkeep of the church building. Moreover, they also received the part due to the priest if the latter was a member of their household. Upon the request of the inhabitants of the Northern Quarter, Bishop Gissur approved of the establishment of a second bishopric with its see at H√≥lar. Its first prelate, J√≥n √ñgmundsson was consecrated in 1106 by the archbishop of Lund in Denmark. The heads of the two Icelandic dioceses remained suffragans to the archbishops of Lund until the new archbishopric of Nidaros was established in Norway in 1153. Many bishops in the period were related to the Haukdaelir, Oddaverjar or other powerful families. Laymen often required bishops to act as impartial peacemakers or advisors which suggests the Icelandic prelates' highly esteemed social status. On the other hand, bishops had little real authority, even their judicial power was limited. The Al√æingi passed the laws governing Christian life and the relations between the Church and laymen in 1123. These legal provisions were in a decade included in the Gr√°g√°s or Gray Goose Laws. The Christian Law Section of this law book authorized the secular courts to hear cases where clerics were involved, with the exception of a priest's disobedience which was to be judged by the bishop. However, bishops often turned to secular courts to hear such cases, because they had no power to execute their own judgements. Bishop Thorlak Thorhallsson of Sk√°lholt (1178‚Äì1193) was the first prelate in Iceland who attempted to repress secular influence in Church affairs. For instance, he often persuaded landowners who built a church on their estates to donate it to the Church, although he always gave back the same real estate in benefice. In the next century, Bishop Gu√∞mundur Arason of H√≥lar (1203‚Äì1237) make every effort to strengthen his control over clergymen and Church property. However, chieftains opposing his policy expelled him from his see. He often turned to his superior, the archbishop of Nidaros to defend his case, which created an opportunity for the Norwegian prelate for intervening in the Icelandic Church affairs. The archbishop even refused to appoint the candidates the Al√æingi proposed in 1237 to the two Icelandic episcopal sees and consecrated his two fellow countrymen as bishops. The Al√æingi acknowledged the superiority of canon law over secular legislation in 1253. Bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson of Hol√°r initiated the establishment of the first monastery in Iceland, √ûingeyraklaustur, which was only set up after his death, in 1133 at Thingeyrar. Further six monasteries and one nunnery were established till the end of the Commonwealth, but three monasteries were quickly closed. Thingeyrar and two other abbeys accommodated Benedictine monks, the other monasteries were established for Augustinians. Monasteries served as important centers of culture: they owned libraries and their monks wrote new books. For instance, the early saga of Kings Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf II were recorded at the Thingeyrar Abbey. The latter monarch becamealong with the Virgin Mary, Nicholas and Peterone of the most popular saints in Iceland where a couple of churches were dedicated to him. Bishop Thorlak Thorhallsson of Sk√°lholt was the first Icelander whose piety gave rise to the emergence of a popular cult after his death. His veneration was sanctioned by his successor at the Al√æingi of 1198, but the Holy See did not approved this action for almost 800 years. Likewise, Bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson of Hol√°r's cult which emerged in the Northern Quarter was only sanctioned by one of his successors in 1200. =Norwegian rule (1264‚Äì1380)= Norway and its dependencies around 1263 Magnus VI the Lawmender The 13th-century historian, Snorri Sturluson was the first Icelandic chieftain who swore allegiance, around 1220, to a Norwegian monarch. However, it was Gissur Thorvaldsson, Earl of Iceland (r. 1258‚Äì1268) who between 1262 and 1264 persuaded all go√∞ar to accept the suzerainty of King Hakon IV Hakonson of Norway (r. 1217‚Äì1263). Hakon Hakonson's successor, King Magnus VI Hakonson (r. 1263‚Äì1280) decided to reform the law of all his realms and issued a new law code for Iceland. Its provisions governing Church lifethe so-called Kristinr√©ttr n√Ωi (\\"New Christian Laws\\")declared that the Church and its property were to be administered without any interference by laymen. These provisions were first (in 1275) introduced in the diocese of Sk√°lholt, but only in 1354 in the bishopric of H√≥lar. Thereafter bishops had exclusive jurisdiction over clergymen in both dioceses which contributed to the spread of clerical celibacy. Bishop √Årni Thorlaksson of Sk√°lholt (r. 1269‚Äì1298) set about claiming effective control over all churches and their property in his diocese. His agreement of 1297 with King Eric II Magnusson (r. 1280‚Äì1299) authorized him to administer most church farmsteads. Laymen were only allowed to control parcels with a church in which they had at least a half-share. This transformation of the legal system caused that many freeholders became tenants of the Church. Two new monasteries were established under Norwegian rule: one at Reynista√∞r and the other at M√∂√∞rruvellir in 1296. Cathedral chapters were set up in this period. Bishop Jorund of H√≥lar was the first prelate to have been authorized to organize a k√≥rsbr√¶√∞r or body of canons at his see in 1267. However, the exact date when the chapter at Sk√°lholt Cathedral was set up is unknown. =First centuries of the Danish rule (1380‚Äì1536)= Margaret's seal King Haakon VI of Norway (1343‚Äì1380) was succeeded by his minor son, Olaf Haakonsson (1380‚Äì1387) who had some years before inherited Denmark. Upon the young king's death, his mother, Queen Margaret (1387‚Äì1412) followed him as \\"the mighty lady and right master\\" of Denmark, Norway and all their dependencies, including Iceland. Thereafter Iceland remained united with Denmark for more than five centuries. The epidemic known as Black Death reached Iceland in 1402. It devastated the country for 18 or 19 months and caused the death of at least 50% of the population. For instance, 8 of the 14 nuns living at the Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur convent (including the abbess) died in the epidemic. Legend says that there were cases when only 4 or 5 of 15 people going to a funeral returned home because of the fast spread of the plague. The Black Death also contributed to the accumulation of Church property, because dying people often willed their estates to the Church. A second epidemic which ravaged in Iceland in 1495 and 1496 had similar, although less devastating consequences. The so-called \\"English Century\\" of Icelandic history, which was characterized by the growing influence of English seamen and merchants, began around 1410. They were engaged in fishing and trading in stockfish and established several posts in Iceland. An Englishman, John Williamson Craxton even was consecrated as bishop of H√≥lar in 1431. He was accused of organizing a plot against J√∂ns Gerekesson, his fellow bishop at Sk√°lholt. The latter, a Dane by birth, was King Eric VII of Denmark's favorite. He hired foreign mercenaries and set up his private army in order to plunder the countryside and capture many landowners. However, one of his followers murdered a young nobleman whose sister incited her fellow countrymen against the bishop. The rebels took the H√≥lar Cathedral, captured Bishop J√∂ns Gerekesson and drowned him in a river in 1433. In a few years, Bishop John Williamson Craxton was forced to leave his diocese. The last monastery in Iceland was established at Skri√∞uklaustur at the end of the \\"English Century\\" in 1493. The English competed with the German merchants of the Hansa Towns for the control over trade with Iceland. The Danish monarchs supported the Germans in this conflict, but the English were expelled from all their posts in the period between 1490 and 1558. Alabaster altarpieces from England which have been preserved in H√≥lar and many other places in Iceland are traditionally dated to the \\"English Century\\". Connections with the Hansa Towns contributed to the early appearance of Protestant ideas, because most German merchants who settled in Iceland accepted Martin Luther's teaching. On the other hand, Bishop J√≥n Arason of H√≥lar brought the first printing press to Iceland from Hamburg in 1530. The Roman Catholic Church accumulated significant wealthincluding landed property, cattle, trading ships, and precious metalsby the end of the period. For instance, the Diocese of Sk√°lholt had acquired around 9% of all the landholdings in the previous centuries. Reformation (1536‚Äì1627) Modern statue of Bishop J√≥n Arason of H√≥lar (Munka√æver√°, Iceland) King Christian II of Denmark (1513‚Äì1523) was the first Scandinavian monarch to have contemplated the introduction of the Reformation in his realms, but he was dethroned. His attempts to regain his throne caused the outbreak of a civil war in Denmark which lasted from 1533 till 1536. The internal conflict ended with the victory of the deposed monarch's opponent, Christian III (1534‚Äì1559) who had since 1521 been a staunch supporter of Luther's views. Young men studying in Germany were the first Icelanders who accepted Lutheran ideas, but most Icelanders remained faithful to their traditional faith. Furthermore, the two Catholic bishops√ñgmundur P√°lsson of Sk√°lholt and J√≥n Arason of H√≥lartook over the government of the country for the years of the Danish civil war. However, a secret circle of young Lutheran intellectuals was developing in the court of Bishop √ñgmundur P√°lsson in the same period. Title page of Oddur Gottsk√°lksson's translation of the New Testament Title page of Bishop Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson's translation of the Bible The elderly bishop openly opposed the Lutheran Church Ordinance which was introduced in Denmark in 1537. He excommunicated two royal officials who had taken Vi√∞ey Abbey and expelled the monks from there. The bishop's supporters even seized and killed one of the royal representatives in 1539. The nearly blind Bishop √ñgmundur P√°lsson decided to retire and proposed one of his favorites, Gissur Einarsson to succeed him.However, Gissur Einarsson was a secret Lutheran who set about introducing the Protestant principles of Church administration in Iceland. However, the Al√æingi of 1540 insisted on the preservation of the traditional Church structure. The earliest Icelandic translation of the New Testamentwhich was made by Oddur Gottsk√°lksson, one of the secret Lutherans at Bishop √ñgmundur P√°lsson's courtwas published in Denmark in 1540. A naval force sent by Christian III landed at Iceland in 1541. Assisted by Gissur Einarsson, the royal representatives persuaded the Al√æingi of 1541 to accept the introduction of the Church Ordinance in the Diocese of Sk√°lholt. However, Gissur Einarssonwho was consecrated as the first Lutheran bishop in Icelandhad to face the absence of trained Protestant clergymen. He made every effort to extinguish all traditions closely connected to Catholicism. Public opinion even attributed his unexpected death in 1548 to God's justice for his act of destroying a holy cross near Sk√°lholt. Bishop J√≥n Arason of H√≥lar soon attempted to restore Catholicism in Sk√°lholt by force, but the king declared him outlaw. Da√∞i Gu√∞mundsson, a wealthy Lutheran landowner managed to seize the bishop in autumn 1550. J√≥n Arason and his two sons were executed without trial on November 7, 1550. In next summer a new naval force arriving from Denmark forced the people of the Diocese of H√≥lar to accept the Church Ordinance, thus Reformation was introduced in the whole country. The Reformation was a culture shock for the Icelanders. The veneration of saints was banned, the saints' relics and many traditional objects of liturgy were destroyed, and all monasteries were closed. Most Church propertiesin value, around 19% of all landholdingswere confiscated for the Crown in 1554. One half of the tithe was also payable to the royal treasury from 1560. Even so, the two episcopal sees remained important centers of teaching, although for higher education clergymen had to visit Copenhagen. Bishop Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson of H√≥lar (1571‚Äì1627) and his disciples translated the whole Bible into Icelandic and their work was published in 1584. This translation strengthened the position of the vernacular in liturgy, thus Danish never was introduced in Church service in Iceland. Early Modern and Modern Times (1627‚Äì1944) =Dark Ages and absolutism (1627‚Äì1809)= Mount Hekla, the main entrance to Hell, according to 16th-century believers Spiritual literature flourished in the 17th century. For instance, Hallgr√≠mur P√©tursson wrote his Passion Psalms in this period, and Bishop J√≥n Vidalin of Sk√°lholt (1698‚Äì1720) composed a popular book of Family Sermons. Church life in 17th-century Iceland was featured by the dominance of Lutheran orthodoxy. However, the number of churches diminished from about 300 to less than 200 between around 1550 and 1660. A general fear of damnation to Hell (the main door of which was suspected to be on Mount Hekla) emerged among laymen which contributed to their adoption of a lifestyle required by the Lutheran Church. Superstition, including the belief in witchcraft and sorcery became widespread. Between 1625 and 1685, more than around 25 persons were executed on charges of witchcraft. The overwhelming majority of the victims of witch- hunt were men, which distinguishes Iceland from other parts of Europe where the number of women burned at the stake was higher. Superstition began to fade away from the last decades of the century. King Frederick III of Denmark (1648‚Äì1670) decided to get rid of all barriers of royal power and introduce an absolute monarchy in his realms. At an extraordinary assembly, the delegates of the Al√æingi of 1662 were forced to acknowledge the absolute power of the king. Bishop Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson of Sk√°lholt (1639‚Äì1674) was one of the delegates who tried, in vain, to hinder the abolition of the traditional form of government. The Icelandic Jon Thorkelsson and the Danish Ludvig Harboe, two representatives of Pietismthe 18th-century movement for religious revivalarrived in Iceland in 1741 and visited many churches. They preached against sagas and other traditional forms of Icelandic literature, but also emphasized the importance of education of children. Due to their influence, new Church regulations were introduced in 1744. They included the obligatory confirmation of children which required their ability to read by their age of 14. As a series of natural disasters caused the loss of life of thousands of people in the 18th century, Iceland's population dropped from 50,000 to below 40,000 between 1703 and 1784. The major of these catastrophes, the so-called \\"Skaft√° Fires\\"volcanic eruptions in the Laki volcanic rifts which lasted for a year from the spring of 1783and the famine which followed it caused the death of more than 9,000 people in 1783 and 1784. Literature has maintained many episodes of the disaster. For instance, legend says that J√≥n Steingr√≠msson, a clergyman serving in Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur stopped the flowing lava just at the walls of his church by his \\"Fire Sermon\\". Bishop Hannes Finnsson of Sk√°lholt moved to Reykjav√≠k in 1785 because an earthquake that followed the Skaft√° Fires destroyed all buildings at his see. This change of the episcopal see was declared permanent in 1796. The Diocese of H√≥lar and its school was abolished in 1801. Thereafter Reykjav√≠k was the see of the sole diocese of the country. =National awakening (1809‚Äì1885)= =Towards independence (1885‚Äì1918)= =Kingdom of Iceland (1918‚Äì1944)= =Republic of Iceland (1944‚Äì)= The church attendance in Iceland has declined since the 1970s.

It is near the Lake Michigan shoreline in northeastern Grant Park where Daley Bicentennial Plaza previously stood. Maggie Daley Park, like its predecessor, is connected to Millennium Park by the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Designed by landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, the park had its ceremonial ribbon cutting on December 13, 2014, and is named for Maggie Daley, the former first lady of the city who died of cancer in 2011. The park was almost entirely remade with multiple new features including a new field house, an ice skating ribbon, climbing walls, landscaping and children's playground. An older section of the park maintains a garden dedicated earlier to honor cancer survivors. The park is bounded by Randolph Street, Monroe, Columbus and Lake Shore Drives. Construction took 2 years and cost $60 million, including rebuilding an underground parking lot. Approval process Part of the area of the current park in 1993 On August 26, 2012, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced plans for the park where a hotly contested children's museum plan had previously been attempted. In 2008, the Chicago City Council had approved a $100 million plan to build the Chicago Children's Museum on the space, but legal contentions were expected to drag on regarding the use of parkland for such a structure. Construction Preparations for construction began with closures of elements like the Daley Bicentennial field house and areas fenced off in September 2012. By November, the removal of 877 aged crab apple, magnolia, white ash, elm and other varieties of trees began. There were two stated purposes for the tree removal: the removal of the trees and soil would facilitate the repair of the underground East Monroe Street Parking Garage roof; the removal of the trees would make way for a healthier park with a broader variety of plants that were less susceptible to diseases. Features Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden entrance with pergola and the 1905 Federal Building Columns The park features a ice skating ribbon, rock-climbing walls, and tennis courts. It includes three open lawn areas, a lawn panel, a caf√© space, and picnic groves. The northeast section retains the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden, which was laid out in 1996. The park was designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the landscape architects for the George W. Bush Presidential Center. The former Daley Bicentennial Plaza had included 12 tennis courts and Maggie Daley Park accommodates 6 replacement courts. The courts are in the far Northeastern corner known as Peanut Park. An additional feature of Maggie Daley Park is the Play Garden. Occupying 3 acres of Maggie Daley Park, the Play Garden is one of the many attractions within the park area. It is open from 6:00am‚Äì11:00pm, for children ages 12 and under.Rodriguez, Meredith. \\"After 2 Years of Construction, Maggie Daley Park Opens.\\" Chicagotribune.com. Chicago Tribune, 13 Dec 14.

Overhead along the Enchanted Forest pathways are archways defined by upside-down trees, where major branches touch the ground at multiple points and a single trunk rises skyward. Within the Enchanted Forest is a Turning Stone, an upright stone that turns on its vertical axis, as well as a mirror maze (named Kaleidoscope). The Slide Crater within the Play Garden of Maggie Daley Park The 12,000 square foot Slide Crater zone is entered on high from the Wave Lawn by means of the Tower Bridge, which is a suspension bridge elevated by two towers, one of which has two slides, the other a wealth of play features including knobs, flags, a viewing scope, and talk tubes. Allegedly, there are reports that the slides in The Slide Crater are unsafe and have resulted in serious injuries. The Chicago Park District denies that the slides in the playground pose a particularly high risk. \\"Maggie Daley Park is one of the largest and busiest playgrounds in the city; since April, an estimated 400,000 people have visited the park's playground areas. While any injury sustained at a Chicago Park District facility is one too many, the rate of incident compared to the number of people that use the park is very low. The play equipment at Maggie Daley Park was carefully selected and designated for appropriate age groups and meets criteria set by the ASTM, an international standards organization, for Playground Equipment for Public Use. As for the alleged incident occurring on 4/5/15, we have reviewed officially submitted reports and have yet to match any to the incident described by Ms. Hayes.\\" Parker, Lisa, and Robin Green. \\"Growing Safety Concerns, Injuries Reported at Chicago Park.\\" NBC Chicago.

It features several plastic animals, including a large whale and spouts for children to play in the water. It was designed for children ages 2‚Äì5. The Harbor is for children ages two to five. It is 2,000ftsq in size. It features a boardwalk, three full-sized play boats, and is surrounded by the flora of the park. It is located between the swing areas of the park. The Wave Lawn is a 16,530 square foot play area that cuts a swath through the center of the Play Garden. A restaurant is planned for the park, but was not expected to serve the park until its second year of operation. Controversies BP Pedestrian Bridge crosses Columbus Drive to connect Maggie Daley Park and Millennium Park Although the park initially had been planned as a pet-friendly zone, the decision was made to forbid dogs and other pets. During construction, 900 mature trees were removed, and 1000 young trees were planted. Only 38 pre- existing trees were planned to survive the construction, while 160 of the removed trees were marked for recycling.

Exhibition The gallery space was inaugurated by a grand group exhibition, Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), which featured a roster of artists from China and abroad, including Liu Wei, Liang Yuanwei, Cheng Ran, Chen Wei, Gabriel Lester, and Sun Xun.\\"Group Exhibition: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).\\" Asia Art Archive. Asia Art Archive, n.d. Web. 26 July 2013. . Subsequent exhibitions included a series of solo exhibitions by young Chinese artists, such as Cheng Ran (Cheng Ran: What Why Now), Chen Wei (Chen Wei: More), Liu Chuang (Liu Chuang: Works #16-21), Michael Lin (Michael Lin: Shanghai Daily), Cui Jie (Cui Jie), and Guo Hongwei (Guo Hongwei: Editing). Two group exhibitions have also been held at the venue, Cui Jie, Li Shurui, Zhang Jungang & Li Jie and Boy: A Contemporary Portrait. The former, featuring works by the Beijing-based Cui Jie and Li Shurui and Harbin-based duo Zhang Jungang & Li Jie, provided a visual narrative of the relationship between the artists' lives and the contemporary landscape.\\"Cui Jie, Li Shurui, Zhang Jungang & Li Jie.\\" SmartShanghai.

The exhibition was intended as a response to the Bauhaus contention that architecture should serve as a vehicle through which multiple forms of art, including architecture, painting and sculpture, are combined and integrated as a single unity. The show was realized through the collective effort by Michael Lin and several other artists. Cheng Ran produced a ten-channel video installation that incorporates a documentary of the making of Lin's Model Home, as well as footage on the architectural environment and people. Dutch artist Gabriel Lester gave a talk on the relationship between time and space as part of the exhibition program. Leo Xu curated a sound project that extended the exhibition into a subtle soundscape that further facilitates the philosophical rumination over the dynamics between architecture, people, and urban landscape.

Early life Roberts was the son of Captain Charles Roberts, of the 59th Regiment, was born in Ickwell, Bedfordshire, England, and educated Bedford School, between 1845 and 1854, at Carshalton Military School, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U190375/ROBERTS_Col_Charles_Fyshe?index=612&results;=QuicksearchResults&query;=0 He entered the Royal Artillery in 1855, became captain in 1862 and major in 1863. He served in the Crimean War in 1855-56, during which he was twice wounded, and received a medal with clasp, the Turkish medal, and the Sardinian Medal of Military Valor, and was personally commended for his conduct on 18 June 1855 by Lord Raglan. He was in command of the artillery with the field force in Sikkim, in 1861, for which he was thanked in general orders, and by the Governor-General of India in Council, and was made captain and subsequently brevet-major. Career in Australia Roberts was aide-de-camp to Sir John Young, when Young was Governor of New South Wales, from 1866 to 1867. Colonel Roberts retired from the Royal Artillery in 1871, and was secretary to the Agent-General for New South Wales in London from 1872 to 1874, after which he returned to New South Wales. In 1866 Roberts had married Alice, daughter of the late William Bradley, of Goulburn, New South Wales and on the family's return to Sydney, he bought South Hill, a property near Goulburn. In January 1876, a daughter, Beatrice was born there. The property was sold in November 1876. In the same year Roberts was appointed colonel in command of the New South Wales artillery, and second in command of the forces. When Colonel John Soame Richardson led the Sudan Contingent in March 1885, Roberts assumed command of all New South Wales military forces. In June 1885 he was created Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. From 1887 to 1888 Roberts argued with Richardson over his treatment, when command of the artillery was changed to come under the general staff. In 1890 Roberts visited England, and was commissioned by the New South Wales Government to inquire into all military matters likely to be suggestive of improvements in the colonial forces. In 1892, when it was decided to establish a separate department of defence under the Colonial Secretary, Colonel Roberts was appointed the first Under-Secretary. Death Roberts died in Double Bay, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on 9 September 1914. Roberts was an honorary aide-de-camp to the King, his military funeral was held on 11 September 1914 and he was buried in South Head Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, a son and four daughters.

Description Adenanthos ellipticus grows as an open spreading shrub to 3 m (10 ft) high and 4 m (13 ft) wide. The leaves are long by wide, while the orange or reddish- pink coloured flowers are long. Taxonomy Alex George described Adenanthos ellipticus in 1974, the species name derived from the Latin adjective ellipticus and referring to the shape of the leaves. It had been collected much earlier, in 1931 by W.E.Blackall. He published the name A. cuneata var. integra in 1954 but did not write a description so the name is invalid. It is classified in the section Adenanthos within the genus of the same name. Distribution and habitat Adenanthos ellipticus is found only in Fitzgerald River National Park, where it occurs in three populations occupying an area of less than 0.31 square kilometres (77 acres). It grows in quartzite-derived siliceous sand on rocky hillsides. It is found in association with coastal jugflower (Adenanthos cuneatus) and veined adenanthos (A. venosus), but generally grows higher up slopes than those species. Ecology Adenanthos ellipticus is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed afterwards. Fires at short intervals threaten to eradicate it. It is also highly sensitive to dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi). Status The Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments have classified Adenanthos ellipticus as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in 2008 and Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 (Western Australia) in November 2012 respectively. Cultivation Adenanthos ellipticus is unknown in cultivation, and has little horticultural potential, especially compared with the smaller, more compact A. cuneatus. It would likely need frequent pruning to maintain an attractive appearance.

Together with his spiritual teacher Sri Yashoda Mai (1882-1944), he founded an ashram at Mirtola, near Almora, India. He was one of the first Europeans to pursue orthodox Vaishnavite Hinduism. Remaining a strict Gaudiya Vaishnavite the rest of his life, he was highly regarded, and had many Indian disciples. (Correction: By all accounts, and especially by the account of his foremost disciple Sri Madhava Ashish, Krishna Prem transcended the dogmas and practices of his early Vaishnava sectarianism and affirmed a universal spiritual path shorn of \\"orthodoxy\\" and blind traditionalism.) Early life Ronald Henry Nixon, more commonly called Ronald Nixon, was born in Cheltenham, England, in 1898,\\"Krishna Prem, Sri (1898-1965) Western-born Vaishnavite Guru\\" in and educated in Taunton. His mother was a Christian Scientist and his father was reportedly in the glass and china business. At age 18, Nixon became a British fighter pilot in the First World War: he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on probation on 10 May 1917, was confirmed in his rank on 12 June, and was appointed a flying officer in the Royal Flying Corps on 15 June. On one occasion, he experienced an escape from death that he believed was miraculous, in which a \\"power beyond our ken\\" saved him from several enemy planes.Page 17 in (on page 283, the quote from Nixon is cited to page 54 of Roy's biography, 1975 2nd edition) His experiences of death and destruction during the war filled him with a \\"sense of futility and meaninglessness\\". He was transferred to the unemployed list of the Royal Air Force on 11 January 1919 and relinquished his temporary Army commission on 3 December that year. After the war, Nixon enrolled in King's College, Cambridge, where he studied English literature. During this period Nixon also studied philosophy, and became acquainted with Theosophy, Advaita Vedanta Hinduism, Buddhism, and Pali, and developed an interest in going to India to learn more about the practical aspects of Indian religion.\\"The Case of Sri Krishna Prem\\" in Life in India In 1921, while still in England, Nixon accepted the offer of a teaching position at the University of Lucknow, in northern India. As it turned out, the university's vice-chancellor, Gyanendra Nath Chakravarti, was also spiritually inclined and interested in Theosophy, and offered Nixon assistance. Over time, Nixon came to regard Gyanendra's wife, Monica Devi Chakravarti, as his spiritual teacher. In 1928, Monika took vows of renunciation in the Gaudiya Vaishnavite tradition, where these vows are called vairagya. She adopted the monastic name of Sri Yashoda Mai. Soon thereafter, she initiated Nixon into vairagya, and he adopted Krishna Prem as his monastic name. In 1930, Sri Yashoda Mai and Krishna Prem together founded an ashram at Mirtola, near Almora, in mountainous north-central India (state of Uttarakhand). The ashram \\"began and has continued to be\\" aligned with strict orthodox Vaishnavism. In 1944, Yashoda Ma died and Krishna Prem succeeded her as head of the ashram. He travelled little, but in 1948 he visited South India, meeting Sri Ramana Maharshi, as well as Sri Aurobindo and Mirra Alfassa (\\"The Mother\\"). Sardella states that Nixon appears to have been \\"the first European to embrace Vaishnavism in India\\". Haberman states that Nixon \\"was perhaps the first Westerner to tread the path of Krishna-bhakti, and was certainly the first to have any official affiliation with the Gaudiya Vaishnavism of Braj.\\" Krishna Prem, despite his English origins, became widely accepted and admired in the Indian Hindu community. Brooks wrote that \\"Krishna Prem's evident intellectual and inspirational qualities gained him wide fame and many disciples in India, as reflected in numerous books on his life and teachings.\\" Gertrude Emerson Sen wrote that \\"I know of no other person like Krishnaprem, himself 'foreign' to begin with, who has drawn so many Indians to himself\\". His biographer Dilip Kumar Roy wrote that Krishnaprem \\"had given a filip [stimulus] to my spiritual aspiration\\".quoted in Haberman, p. 221. Haberman wrote that Krishna Prem \\"was recognized as a Hindu saint by many Indians of his day.\\" When Nixon died in 1965, he was hailed by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, then president of India, as a \\"great soul\\". Nixon's final words were \\"my ship is sailing\\".

The story is about a young policewoman falling in love with a gangster she pursues. A smash hit, the series is credited with catapulting lead actress Xu Jinglei, a little- known Beijing Film Academy student, to national fame. Plot Some years ago, an Italian violin that Niccol√≤ Paganini had supposedly used was stolen from a Beijing orchestra, smuggled overseas, but miraculously recovered a few years later by the Chinese law enforcement. Strangely, nothing about its recovery was ever printed in the press. Spurned by the police, an intrigued journalist (Pu Cunxin) tracks down Lu Yueyue (Xu Jinglei), a former policewoman who now works as a B-girl in a night club. She also refuses to speak on the case, but he proves more resilient than she expects. Finally she agrees to tell him the whole story, under the condition that he never publishes his story‚Äîunless she dies. After leaving China, the violin first landed in Bangkok before being sold to Poon Dai-wai (Wan Yeung-ming) in Hong Kong, who had just inherited his late father's enterprise. Poon gave the violin to Fung Sai-man (Leung Kai- chi), a senior triad boss, as a present, but when one of Fung's employees secretly brought the violin back to him, Poon hid it and denied knowledge before Fung. That night, the defector was assassinated and several of Poon's employees were shot. Poon Dai-wai decided to send his younger brother Poon Siu-wai (Liu Han-chiang) to mainland China to protect him from Fung's wrath. Lu Yueyue had just begun working for the Ministry of Public Security when they received intelligence from the Hong Kong Police Force about the possible link between Poon Siu-wai and the stolen violin.

Its purpose was organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the Serbian Democratic Parties (SDS), and preparing arms and ammunition in an effort of establishing a country where \\"all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state.\\" A separate group of undercover operatives and military officers was charged with the implementation of the plan. These people then undertook numerous actions during the Yugoslav Wars that were later described as ethnic cleansing and genocide. Planning and leakage The RAM (lit. \\"frame\\") Plan was developed over the course of 1990. It was finalized in Belgrade, Serbia during a military strategy meeting in August 1991 by a group of Serb officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), including General Blagoje Ad≈æiƒá, General Major Milan Gvero, Major ƒåedo Kne≈æeviƒá, Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radinoviƒá, and General Aleksandar Vasiljeviƒá, and experts from the JNA's Psychological Operations Department. In the same month Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá met to discuss when to attack Bosnia and Herzegovina during which Karad≈æiƒá was told his weapons delivery would arrive soon from General Nikola Uzelac, JNA commander of Banja Luka. During the conversation, Milo≈°eviƒá mentioned RAM, asking Karad≈æiƒá ‚ÄúYou know what RAM is?‚Äú to which Karad≈æiƒá responded positively. Milo≈°eviƒá and Karad≈æiƒá were in regular contact by phone. In September 1991, the existence of the RAM Plan was leaked by Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markoviƒá and its details were published in the Belgrade weekly Vreme. He says \\"the line has been clearly established [between the Serbian government, the army and Serb politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina]. I know because I heard Milo≈°eviƒá give the order to Karad≈æiƒá to get in contact with General Uzelac and to order, following the decisions of the meeting of the military hierarchy, that arms should be distributed and that the TO of Krajina and Bosnia be armed and utilized in the realization of the RAM plan.\\". He accused the JNA of having \\"placed itself directly in the service of one side\\" and requested that Yugoslav Defense Minister Veljko Kadijeviƒá and Ad≈æiƒá resign, claiming the two were \\"waging their own war in Croatia\\" and that they had arranged a secret arms deal with conservative Soviet Union military leaders during their March 1991 visit to Moscow. Markoviƒá pressed Kadijeviƒá to comment on the RAM plan. The transcript of the tape leaked said: Vreme had reported that in addition to Bosnian Serb declarations of autonomy, effort was being taken to arm Serb villages and towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina as early as 1990 and continued into 1991. It detailed the origin of the weaponry and the JNA's involvement in the matter. During Milo≈°eviƒá's trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia a tape played from 8 July 1991 stated: Milo≈°eviƒá later claimed that RAM was a codename indicating switching to secure communications and did not stand for a war plan, even though no such switch subsequently happened which Milo≈°eviƒá did not explain as to why. Croatian historian Davor Marijan subsequently described the RAM plan claims as based on circumstantial evidence, saying no specific evidence of the plan has been provided . The September 1991 leak alarmed the Bosnian government, which decided to proclaim independence on 15 October. At the time the Croatian War of Independence was in full swing, and Serbian actions in Bosnia mirrored those of the Serbs in Croatia. In December 1991, Ante Markoviƒá resigned in protest against the excessive use of the Yugoslav budget on military spending which was dedicated 86 percent. Arrangements The plan's purpose was organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the Serbian Democratic Parties (SDS), and preparing arms and ammunition in an effort of establishing a country where \\"all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state.\\" In their plan, the officers described how artillery, ammunition, and other military equipment would be stored in strategic locations in Croatia and then in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Secret Police would be used in arming and training the local Serbs to create \\"shadow\\" police forces and paramilitary units within the Croatian Krajina and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These organized and armed Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces were to form the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). In implementing the plan, a consensus was formed on the chain of command being as limited as possible and resembling a \\"slim company\\". An informal group with selected generals that came to be known as the Military Line was created. Jovica Stani≈°iƒá was installed as its head with Mihalj Kertes taking part as the \\"Minister of Ethnic Cleansing\\". It was determined Colonel ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá (Arkan) would direct it and that General Ratko Mladiƒá and General Andrija Biorƒçeviƒá would coordinate \\"autonomous\\" groups like Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj's White Eagles and Arkan's Serbian Volunteer Guard (SDG). Their research showed that the Bosniaks' (Bosnian Muslims) \\"morale, desire for battle, and will could be crushed more easily by raping women, especially minors and even children, and by killing members of the Muslim nationality inside their religious facilities.\\" According to the minutes, a variant of the RAM Plan written had concluded that: Vladimir Srebrov, a politician who co-founded the SDS with Karad≈æiƒá, had read the RAM Plan in 1992 and says the officers put forth a large campaign of ethnic cleansing \\"to destroy Bosnia economically and completely exterminate the Muslim people.\\" He elaborated that: In his attempts to plead with Serb nationalists to not pursue the plan, he was imprisoned and tortured by Serb militias. Implementation In 1990 and 1991, Serbs in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina had proclaimed a number of \\"Serbian Autonomous Oblasts\\" with the intent of later unifying them to create a Greater Serbia. In 1990, the Bosnian Territorial Defence was disarmed, artillery was positioned to encircle major cities, and a number of arms factories were moved from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia. As early as September or October 1990, the JNA had begun arming Bosnian Serbs and organizing them into militias. By March 1991, the JNA had distributed an estimated 51,900 firearms to Serb paramilitaries and 23,298 firearms to SDS. As a result of the operation, Croatian and Bosnian Serbs were \\"well armed\\" by summer of 1991. According to historian Noel Malcolm the \\"steps taken by Karad≈æiƒá and his party ‚Äî [declaring Serb] \\"Autonomous Regions\\", the arming of the Serb population, minor local incidents, non-stop propaganda, the request for federal army \\"protection\\" ‚Äì matched exactly what had been done in Croatia.

Evidence acquired by humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, corroborated that a policy of rape was organized and carried out. Their findings determined that \\"research, planning, and coordination of rape camps was a systematic policy of the Serbian government and military forces with the explicit intention of creating an ethnically pure state\\". The UNCoE concluded that \\"the practices of ethnic cleansing, sexual assault and rape have been carried out by some of the parties so systematically that they strongly appear to be the product of a policy.\\" It stated in a follow-up report that it was \\"convinced that this heinous practice [rape and abuse of women] constitutes a deliberate weapon of war in fulfilling the policy of ethnic cleansing carried out by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and [...] that the abhorrent policy of ethnic cleansing was a form of genocide.\\" In pursuit of the plan's \\"decisive intervention\\", Milan Dediƒá, the commander of the third battalion of the VRS, reported to Kertes that: \\"Sixteen hundred and eighty Muslim women of ages ranging from twelve to sixty years are now gathered in the centers for displaced persons within our territory.

Early life The eldest son of John Rogers and his wife Adriana van der Weyden of Antwerp, he was born at Wittenberg about 1538. John Rogers the civilian was a brother, and went on some diplomatic missions with him. On his mother's side Rogers was related to Emanuel van Meteren and Abraham Ortelius. Rogers came to England with his family in 1548, and was naturalised with them in 1552. After his father's death in 1555 he returned to Wittenberg, and studied under Philip Melanchthon. He was taught also by Hubert Languet and Johannes Sturm. He returned to England on Elizabeth I's accession, and graduated B.A. at Oxford in August 1561. Nicasius Yetswiert, Elizabeth's secretary of the French tongue, who had known his father, and whose daughter Susan Rogers afterwards married, introduced him to court. Rogers was then in Paris for nine years, with a break in Antwerp in 1565, and came under the influences of Petrus Ramus, and the contemporary eirenicism.Howell, pp. 158‚Äì9. He may have worked in some capacity in Paris for Sir Thomas Hoby;Levy, pp. 446‚Äì7. he was employed as a tutor by Sir Henry Norris, the next English ambassador in Paris, between 1566 and 1570, and sent home intelligence to Secretary William Cecil. After that Francis Walsingham took over as ambassador there. Dutch and German diplomacy In 1572 Rogers was in Ireland, acting as a guide to German aristocratic visitors.Levy, at p. 448. In October 1574 Rogers went with Sir William Winter to Antwerp, and he accompanied a major embassy to the Netherlands, to treat with William the Silent, in June 1575. Thomas Wilson the diplomat was a friend, and Rogers wrote epigrams for him;Albert J. Schmidt, Thomas Wilson and the Tudor Commonwealth: An Essay in Civic Humanism, Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1959), pp. 49-60, at p. 60 note 29. Published by: University of California Press.Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3816476 Wilson took on Rogers as a secretary by the end of 1574. Rogers, Wilson and Walsingham were in effect Elizabeth's staff for the Anglo-Dutch alliance, given final form by the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585. Rogers has been called \\"the key figure in many diplomatic Anglo-Dutch exchanges\\". By 1575 he had fresh status as secretary to the Merchant Adventurers, and was a diplomat receiving personal instructions.Levy, p. 449. As was the case for his friend and colleague Robert Beale, but even more so, the circle of humanist contacts Rogers built up was also a network that facilitated diplomatic contact. Identified as a Philippist (a former student of Melanchthon), Rogers would have been exposed to a Protestant view of international politics that was providentialist, strongly opposed to the Papacy, and intended to combat the Council of Trent. Rogers was engaged in diplomatic business in the Low Countries throughout 1576, and in March 1577 was there again to negotiate the terms on which Queen Elizabeth was to lend ¬£20,000 to the States-General. In the same month he was in Frankfurt with Sir Philip Sidney, a mission on a new front designed to tackle the theological splits that were hampering Protestant diplomacy in Germany. Rogers started to shuttle across the North Sea in support of an ambitious Protestant League.Glyn Parry, John Dee and the Elizabethan British Empire in Its European Context, The Historical Journal Vol. 49, No. 3 (Sep., 2006), pp. 643-675, at p. 659 note 74. Published by: Cambridge University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4091576 Dutch business occupied him till March 1578. At this period Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde deciphered intercepted Spanish correspondence dealing with an invasion of England. Rogers passed it on to Walsingham. Discussions with William in July 1577 gave Rogers some perspective on the German issue. The suggestion was that Frederik II of Denmark might act as honest broker. William considered that Frederik's close relationship with Augustus, Elector of Saxony offered some hope. In early 1579 Rogers was sent by Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester to reconcile John Casimir of the Palatinate-Simmern, a friend, and William, who had fallen out over the Calvinists of Ghent. The publication of the Book of Concord in the middle of 1580 in fact aggravated the difficulties. In September 1580 Rogers was sent to Augustus of Saxony, in an effort to calm the dissensions among Lutherans. Beale was sent to contact a dozen German courts, too, in a drive to counter the troubles over Crypto-Calvinism. In captivity Map showing the Lordship of Anholt in upper centre (as in 1789) During September 1580 Rogers was sent to Nuremberg, the Imperial Diet and a further mission to the Emperor Rudolf II, mainly on trade matters. He was kidnapped in October, removing him from play, as he passed through the Duchy of Cleves on his way.Levy, p. 450. He was captured near Cleves by the irregular forces of Maarten Schenck van Nydeggen, who took him to Kasteel Bleijenbeek. He was then arrested on Imperial territory by Baron von Anholt, at the request of Philip II of Spain. William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg gave an account to Queen Elizabeth in June 1584, stating that Rogers was detained at the tiny Lordship of Anholt, and then Bredevoort. Rogers spent four years in captivity. Hubert Languet wrote to Sir Philip Sidney, but the response from the English court was languid. George Gilpin of the Merchant Adventurers also made some unavailing efforts for his release. The Queen wrote in September 1583 to Duke Casimir, by which time Rogers was held at Bredevoort by Anholt's widow. Etienne Lesieur, an agent of Walsingham, attempted to free Rogers by visiting the Duke of Cleves, and the Duke of Parma at Tournai. He was himself captured in 1585.E. A. Beller, The Negotiations of Sir Stephen Le Sieur, 1584-1613, The English Historical Review Vol. 40, No. 157 (Jan., 1925), pp. 22-33, at p. 22. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/552606 In one version Rogers was ransomed through the baron's counsellor-at-law, Stephen Degner, a fellow-student under Melanchthon at Wittenberg. He was finally freed from Bredevoort in October 1584.Levy, p. 451. The matter was not yet closed, as Lesieur reported, with Rogers detained again and taken to Boucholt, on pretexts, which amounted to further financial demands. Later life On 5 May 1587 Rogers was appointed a clerk of the privy council; he had already filled the office of assistant clerk. He transacted further official business abroad, visiting Denmark in December 1587, and was able to get the king to subsidise Henry of Navarre.Walther Kirchner, England and Denmark, 1558-1588, The Journal of Modern History Vol. 17, No. 1 (Mar., 1945), pp. 1-15, at p. 14. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871532 He was there again in June 1588, when he conveyed expressions of sympathy from Queen Elizabeth to the young king on the death of his father Frederick II. On his own responsibility he made an arrangement under which the subjects of Denmark and Norway undertook not to serve the king of Spain against England. He was Member of Parliament for Newport, Cornwall in 1589. Rogers died on 11 February 1591, and was buried in the church of Sunbury-on-Thames beside his father-in-law's grave. Associations Janus Dousa was a close friend: they had met during the time Rogers spent in Paris. About three months after the foundation of the University of Leiden in 1575 by Dousa, Rogers wrote a commemorative poem.Van Dorsten, p. 9. In Paris Rogers also knew some of the poets of La Pl√©iade (Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf, Jean Daurat and Guillaume des Autels), Florent Chrestien, George Buchanan, Franciscus Thorius and Germanus Valens Pimpontius.Van Dorsten, p. 13. An English friend was the translator of Ronsard, Thomas Jenye.Van Dorsten, p. 18. Another contact of this period was Lucas de Heere. Rogers first met Sir Philip Sidney around the beginning of 1576, and became one of Sidney's intellectual circle, the nature of which is still debated: his letters and poetry are significant sources for its activities. Evidence for the composition and interests of this group, the so- called Areopagus including Edward Dyer and Fulke Greville, in prosody, religious poetry and music, is in his correspondence. Rogers wrote a long flattering poem addressed to Sidney, about his associations and future, from Ghent, dated 14 January 1579 and thought to have been delivered by Languet a few weeks later.Van Dorsten, pp. 61‚Äì7. In that year Rogers formed part of the opposition to Elizabeth's proposed marriage to the Duc d'Alen√ßon, evidence of his attachment to Leicester and the Sidney circle.James E. Phillips, George Buchanan and the Sidney Circle, Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 12, No. 1 (Nov., 1948), pp. 23-55 at p. 24. Published by: University of California Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3815873 Through the group around Sidney, Rogers knew Paulus Melissus. Rogers had kept up with George Buchanan from Paris days, and worked on the London edition of his De jure regni apud Scotos in 1579, communicating through Thomas Vautrollier. Rogers consulted Dousa, Sturm and Fran√ßois Hotman on the edition. Rogers further acted as an apologist for Buchanan's ideas on limited monarchy. They had an extensive correspondence, in particular on the proposed marriage at this period, and it has been inferred that Sidney was informed about it. Rogers also had antiquarian tastes, and was a close friend of William Camden, who quotes some Latin poems by him in his account of Salisbury. Camden is known to have used notes of Rogers. Ortelius and Camden asked Rogers to transcribe in Germany the Peutingerian Table, relevant in their view to the Antonine Itineraries. Rogers in fact never found enough time for his scholarly projects.F. J. Levy, The Making of Camden's Britannia, Biblioth√®que d'Humanisme et Renaissance T. 26, No. 1 (1964), pp. 70-97, at pp. 87‚Äì8. Published by: Librairie Droz. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41429804 Rogers was known to Jan Gruter, and wrote to Hadrianus Junius asking him for early references to the history of Ireland; he was acquainted with Justus Lipsius, perhaps from a meeting in 1577. In the late 1570s Rogers was having discussions with John Dee, concerned with the conquests made by King Arthur, and the titles of Queen Elizabeth. He may have brought Ortelius to Mortlake in 1577. As a consequence of a meeting Dee and Rogers had in 1578, the conquests of King Malgo were added to Dee's imperial schematic. Ortelius tried to have Rogers continue Humphrey Llwyd's work in ancient chorography, but without success, Rogers preferring the humanist literary approach. At the end of his life Rogers was in touch with Bonaventura Vulcanius, through Philips of Marnix, on the subject of runic alphabets. In Denmark for the state funeral in 1588, Rogers visited Tycho Brahe at Hven. Plans for Rogers to help him with publication in England were cut short when Rogers died. Works Roger wrote copiously in neo-Latin verse. Most of it remained unpublished, much surviving in manuscript.Van Dorsten, p. 11. An obituary poem for Walter Haddon appeared in 1576.Lawrence V. Ryan, Walter Haddon: Elizabethan Latinist, Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 17, No. 2 (Feb., 1954), pp. 99-124, at p. 120. Published by: University of California Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3816213 Verses in praise of John Jewel were appended to Lawrence Humphrey's Life of the bishop. Latin verses by Rogers also figure in the preface to Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum and in Ralph Aggas's description of Oxford University, 1578. Family In a Visitation of Middlesex dated 1634 it was said that Rogers had two children‚Äîa son Francis, who married a lady named Cory; and a posthumous daughter, Posthuma, who married a man named Speare.

He successfully combined an industrial career, managing a research division at DSM, and an academic career, as a Professor of Delft Technical College. His contributions span a wide range of research fields, and his name is linked to the van Krevelen‚ÄìHoftyzer diagram for chemical gas absorption, the Mars‚Äìvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation reactions, the van Krevelen‚ÄìChermin method to estimate the free energy of organic compounds, the van Krevelen diagram that is used in coal and coal processes, the van Krevelen method to calculate additive properties of polymers, and the van Krevelen‚ÄìHoftyzer relationship on the viscosity of polymer fluids. He is the author of numerous scientific publications and several classic monographs, amongst which are Coal: Typology, Chemistry, Physics, Constitution and Properties of Polymers: Correlations with Chemical Structure. Early life Dirk van Krevelen was born in Rotterdam to the family of bookkeeper Dirk Willem van Krevelen Sr and Huberta van Krevelen (n√©e Regoort). Education In 1927 - 1933 he studied at Marnix Gymnasium in Rotterdam. In 1933 he was enrolled at Leiden University and studied chemistry under Anton Eduard van Arkel. There he received his \\"kandidaats\\" (bachelor) degree in 1935 and \\"doctoraal\\" (masters) degree in 1938. In parallel, van Krevelen also did his minor in chemical technology under Professor Hein Waterman at Delft Technical College. Career At the time when Dirk van Krevelen worked with Professor Waterman, Mr Waterman was a scientific advisor to Royal Dutch Shell, who funded the employment of three private assistants that performed fundamental research on oil products and processes. As of 1937, van Krevelen was employed as one of these assistants to Professor Waterman, and worked on three topics: the chemical thermodynamics of oil hydrocarbons, the polymerization of ethylene, as part of attempts to improve the anti-knock properties of gasoline, and the induced pyrolysis of methane. The latter project became the topic of his doctorate (1939). When, at the start of World War II Shell stopped employing new scientists, soon Professor Waterman, who was a Jew, was forced to retire from Shell. Yet he managed to help Dirk van Krevelen to obtain a research position in the newly created Central Laboratory of the Dutch State Mines (DSM) starting from 1940. The Central Laboratory was headed by Gerrit Berkhoff. van Krevelen began his research activities in DSM's physical chemistry department. In 1943, van Krevelen became a department manager, as head of the newly created research department on chemical engineering. In 1948, he was promoted to the position of research leader of the Central Laboratory of DSM, a position where he was responsible for directing the research activities. In 1955, van Krevelen became head of the Central Laboratory. In 1959, van Krevelen left DSM and joined the Algemene Kunstzijde Unie (AKU; General Rayon Union), a polymer company. van Krevelen became member of the board of directors of AKU with the special task of supervising the research and development activities of the company. In 1969, AKU merged with the Koninklijke Zout Organon (KZO) in 1969 to become AKZO. van Krevelen became president of AKZO Research and Engineering, until he retired from AKZO in 1976. Contributions In 1951, van Krevelen was one of the founding editors of the journal Chemical Engineering Science. van Krevelen took also part in the organization of the 1st European Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering which was held in Amsterdam in 1957. Private life In July 1939 Dirk van Krevelen married Frieda Kreisel. They had three sons and one daughter. Death Dirk Willem van Krevelen died on 27 October 2001 in Arnhem.

Among his works were sonatas and chamber music and operas. His life began and ended with tragic notes, losing his eyesight and later his home and possessions. Music historian Philip J. Bone called Fridzeri \\" an artist of undoubted genius and a man of most remarkable character, which was fully tried under great adversity.\\" The late Giuseppe Bellenghi, mandolinist and composer, dedicated his variations for mandolin and piano on the Carnival of Venice, to the memory of Fridzeri, the blind mandolin player and composer.Philip James Bone, The guitar and mandolin : biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott, 1914. Blind boy He lost his eyesight in a childhood accident and the loss of this sense only quickened and intensified others. He was taken with music at an early age and was taught singing and the elements of music while a child. However, apart from this first elementary instruction Fridzeri was self-taught in all the branches of the art, both practical and theoretical. He had learned to play the mandolin by age 11 and constructed his own instrument. He mastered the mandolin enough by that point to be engaged as singing boy at the fashionable serenades, which were customary and exceedingly popular among the nobility of Italy, accompanying himself with his mandolin. Fidzeri had a good voice and his stage presence‚Äîa blind boy singing romances, accompanied by his mandolin‚Äîwas a pleasure to these select assemblies. Traveling musician Fridzeri also devoted himself to the study of other musical instruments and excelled in his performances upon the violin, flute, viol d'amour and organ. When he reached twenty years of age, he was appointed organist of the cathedral of the Madonna del Monte Berico, Vicenza, and he moved there from Verona with his parents to take up this position. For the space of about three years he remained as organist of this celebrated cathedral, and then commenced an exceedingly romantic and checkered career. At the age of twenty-four he left home with a companion and toured Europe as a blind mandolin virtuoso. His repertoire consisted of the concertos of Tartini, the principal works of Pugnani and Ferrari, and several of his own compositions. They travelled through the north of Italy and central France, ultimately reaching Paris, towards the close of the same year (c. 1862). Fridzeri met with success and received great applause wherever he performed during his travels. However, in Paris he was not encouraged by his reception; the mandolin was not as popular as in Italy, and he turned to the violin. He appeared as violin soloist at the famous Concerts Spirituels and performed with brilliant success a concerto of Pierre Gavinies and his own two concertos for violin, Op. 5. Then he took up residence in Paris for two years, teaching the mandolin and violin, after which he made a long concert tour through the north of France, Belgium and the Rhineland of Germany. Fridzeri found popularity in Strasburg and he resided there for twelve months, writing his first two operas, which were produced at the Comedie Italienne in Paris when he returned to France. Settling and composing He returned to Paris by 1771, engaged in writing incidental music for the Parisian theaters and also numerous string quartets and mandolin sonatas. Towards the end of that year he left Paris again, this time for Brittany, where he had been appointed private musician to the Count Chateaugiron,and with whom he remained for twelve years. During this time he applied himself in his leisure principally to operatic composition, and undertook periodical visits to Paris to superintend the production of his new stage works. Finding a demand for this class of composition he terminated his service as private musician to Count Chateaugiron and again took up his residence in Paris. Then the French Revolution began in 1789, and he fled to Nantes, where he established an academy of music and was once more employed in teaching. French civil war For five years the blind musician was thus actively engaged in Nantes until the terrors of the civil war in Vendee and there was wholesale massacre Nantes too. He fled back to Paris for refuge. On his return he was elected a member of the \\"Lycee de Arts,\\" 1794, and commenced a music printing business in the Rue Saint Nicaise, near the Palaise Royal. Although his business quickly failed, he did published his opera, Les souliers mordores there. In spite of that, it was the beginning of ill fortune, for in December, 1801, a bomb was hurled at the Palaise Royal and its explosion totally destroyed all Fridzeri's possessions. He wasn't alone; the unsettled state of fifteen thousand persons perished in one month. The French government of this year compelled the blind musician, now sixty years of age and reduced to poverty, to leave France. He began to wander again, with his two daughters ‚Äî both musicians. With them, the elder a violinist and the younger vocalist, they travelled through Belgium and settled in Antwerp where the daughters followed the vocation of their father and established a music and musical instrument business. The business continued until the death of Fridzeri. Works His opera, Les deux miliciens (The two soldiers), established his reputation as a musician and writer of music which was at once melodious and brilliant, and his published works, though not numerous, embrace nearly every variety of musical composition. The following are the principal: *Six quartets for two violins, alto and bass, Op. 1, published 1771, in Paris *a second book of Six quartets published later *Les deux miliciens (The two soldiers), Op. 2, a comic opera in one act which was produced successfully in 1772 *Six sonatas for the mandolin, Op. 3, published 1771, Paris *Les souliers mordores (The brown shoes), Op. 4, a comic opera in two acts produced 1776 at Comedie Italienne *Two concertos for the violin, Op. 5, played by the composer at the Concerts Spirituels, Paris *Six romances for voice with harp accompaniment, Op. 6 *Four duos for two violins, Op. 7, published 1795, Paris *Lucette, an opera produced in 1785 *Les Thermopyles, Op. 8, a grand opera ‚Äî an edition of this work was arranged by the composer for piano solo *Collection of songs with piano accompaniment, Op. 9 *Symphony concertante for two violins, alto and grand orchestra, and many other pieces for the mandolin.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

The Achang live mainly in the village of \\"Husa\\", and smaller villages nearby, in Longchuan County, Dehong Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, near the border between China and Burma. Husa is well known for its knife and sword makers, who have sold their products to Burma and regions along Nu River since ancient times. The Achang craftsmen make a variety of types of blades.The Famous \\"Husa Knife\\"‚Äî‚ÄîChina Minorities‚Äî‚ÄîWest China Tours Online Travel Agency Husa knives are made with a special process which gives the metal a pure texture, and a really sharp and durable blade. The handles and sheaths are also inscribed with various traditional patterns, such as \\"flying dragon and phoenix\\", \\"tiger roaring\\", \\"eastern sunrise\\", making each knife a work of art.The Achang Husa knife Arts of - Master's thesis - Dissertation Each Achang family keeps at least one knife of high quality. When the young Achang men get married, they carry back knives to show their heroic vitality. This ethnic custom has continued to the present time.  History  Forging techniques have been passed down through the generations of the Achang people since the Tang Dynasty. According to historical records, around 600 years ago, during the \\"Hongwu\\" period in Ming Dynasty, soldiers from the army of Mu Ying, a general of the Ming government, were settled in this area. The soldiers brought military techniques of weapon making, gathered during their campaigns against Mongolia, Tibet, the Hui and the Yi, to the local Achang people. Husa village become the \\"arsenal\\" of Ming government armies. Achang people absorbed the Ming government army's weapon manufacturing technology and evolved a unique Husa knife forge craftsmanship, which matured during the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty (around 1600-1680), reached its peak in the early twentieth century.\\"Unveil remote ancients villages in Yunnan\\" - enKunming, 2013-November-12 In the fight against Napoleon's army, those sabers, forged by the Husa were highly prized by the soldiers. During the First World War, British forces set up a \\"Jingpo\\" nationality army in Burma and every soldier was equipped with a special Husa saber, called \\"Geleka\\". In 1990, the master forgers in Husa created a \\"Nine dragons\\" commander's sword. This sword is worn by the honor guard of Chinese People's Liberation Army, guarding the Chinese national flag on Tian'anmen Square. Husa knives have long been in demand by nearby Han, Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Tibetan, Bai and other ethnic people. Recently, Husa knives have been sold widely from Yunnan Province to Beijing, Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and other places, and exported to Burma, Thailand, India and other countries. Under the pressure of the modern culture and the social economy, the Husa knife, forged by traditional techniques and devices, faces heavy competition from less expensive knives made by modern machinery and raw materials. As the traditional masters age, apprentices are rare, and the techniques of Husa knife creation face the danger of extinction.CCTV International  Variations  Many variations of the Husa knife have been developed during its long history. Some of these are: back swords (cane knives), machetes, broadswords, Tibetan knives (specifically made for Tibetans), daggers, and sabers. The best known types are the back sword (long blade) and Tibetan knife, and these are made with particularly elaborate quality and style. The Tibetan knife has wide and thick blade, and is made in various lengths, with delicate inscription \\"tiger roaring\\", \\"swallow flying\\" and other traditional patterns on the handle and sheath. Many Tibetan people wear the knife as their essential tool and ornament.\\"Husa Knife Making of the Achang Minority - China culture Achang Minority\\" . Arts Cultural China. Forging process The production process of Husa knife has 10 steps: #processing of raw materials #billet making #proofing #grinding #decorating with leaf #quenching #polishing #handle-making #belt-making #assembling. Special technique is especially important in the process of quenching. Through heat treatment, the quenching optimizes the hardness and toughness of the blade. In historical records, the blades are described as \\"flexible enough to be bent, one hair blown on the blade, cut two, just can chop iron\\". The tools to make Husa knives include a wooden bellows, a clay-made stove, as well as hammers, clamps, and iron pillows. Raw iron with high carbon content is selected by an experienced old master from specific locations around Baoshan, Tengchong regions, the traditional mine areas in Yunnan. Younger craftsmen, put the selected raw iron into the stove, heating, forging repeatedly, to purify the texture and form different shapes. The resulting metal is ground into blade blanks; and after all these lengthy processes, comes the most important and subtlest process: quenching. Quenching technology requires special know-how. The quality of a knife, largely depends on the quenching skills. There is a kind of thin blade Husa back sword which can bend its blade as a cycle. It can only be built after repeatedly and precisely water quenching and oil tempering. The knife production comes under a model of co- operation between each \\"Zhai\\"(small stockaded village) in Husa. Each \\"Zhai\\" has its \\"fist\\" product. The whole Husa \\"Bazi\\"(small plain), likes a handicraft factory, and each \\"Zhai\\" is one workshop, which is famous for one special product. Laifu \\"Zhai\\" has well-known black cane knife, Mangdong \\"Zhai\\" has broadsword and dagger, Lajie \\"Zhai\\" has sharp sickles, Xin \\"Zhai\\" has back knife and Mangsuo \\"Zhai\\" has delicate sheaths.

Her village consisted of over five hundred citizens and was located between the towns of Sayre, Pennsylvania, Athens, Pennsylvania and Waverly, New York.  Battle of Queen Esther  The story goes that after learning of the death of her son due to a violent argument between him and a drunken townsman, Queen Esther ordered the raid of a nearby farm as revenge for her loss. The exact number of victims killed in the raid has been debated but documents report of a man by the name of Arthur Van Rossum and his wife Janna of Sayre were killed and scalped on September 27, 1778. A military force of two-hundred men under the command of Colonel Thomas Hartley was created and started up the Susquehanna River to Tioga Point, finally reaching the hilly area of Queen Esther. Hartley and his men were confronted by Iroquois warriors resulting in a fierce battle. After several hours of heavy fighting, the Iroquois warriors were overrun by Hartley and his men forcing them to retreat. News of her warriors' defeat quickly reached Queen Esther who attempted to flee with the women and children of her village into the surrounding forests in hopes of escaping to the Chemung River. Historians have argued over the exact details of what occurred next, but the widely accepted claim is that Hartley and his men caught up with the fleeing villagers and forced them to march to a nearby pond. The women and children were lined up on the pond's bank and executed in mass numbers as Queen Esther was forced to watch the ordeal. The bodies of the victims were then dumped into the water to deny them of the proper burial practiced by the Iroquois people. Queen Esther was then lynched by a nearby oak tree and dismembered before being thrown into the pond with the murdered villagers. Early documents have reported that the screams of the victims could be heard from the town of Athens which was over several miles away.  Queen Esther's Curse  The journal of one of the men serving under Hartley gave light to the belief that the area where the massacre of Queen Esther happened is cursed. This is due to his writings of the lynching of the young queen and how her final words placed a curse on any white settlers who would set foot on the land. As early as the early 1800s, residents of the community known as Queen Esther have reported hearing unidentified screams from the surrounding forests. It is believed that these are the spirits of the massacred villagers. Rumors have also reported of hunters seeing a young girl weeping as she hangs from the branches of an oak tree. When hunters run to investigate, she suddenly vanishes leaving no trace of her ever having been there. However hunters claim that after experiencing this ordeal, their weapons fail to fire if not checked before. Some believe this is Queen Esther attempting to prevent anymore villagers from being killed. See also *List of ghosts *Montour family References * Dr. Alexander Campell.

Early life and education Although of Welsh descent, Edward Williams was born in Hindhead, Surrey. His father Iolo Aneurin Williams was a poet, journalist, folk song collector and politician, and his mother Francion Elinor Dixon was the musical daughter of a Colorado cattle rancher. He was the grandson of Liberal politician Aneurin Williams, and the nephew of politician Ursula Williams. Williams was initially educated at Rugby School, and later went on to read Languages at the University of Cambridge. Williams then served in the Royal Navy during World War II, working on minesweeping vessels. Career In 1946 Williams studied under conductor Muir Mathieson, and later with Vaughan Williams. His own prolific career as British documentary composer began in 1948, and his many scores included 24 shorts for British Transport Films alone, plus a number of television films and features, often with Welsh subject matter. During the 1960s, Williams lectured on music at the University of Bristol and developed his interest in electronic music. =Life on Earth= With its avant-garde and pioneering music, using flute, harp, clarinet, strings, percussion and early synthesisers, Williams's Life on Earth score provided an evocative counterpoint to the visuals and Attenborough's commentary. Williams and his orchestra intricately crafted the music scene-by-scene to reflect the imagery on-screen. In one sequence examining the flight of birds, the instrumentation mirrors each new creature's appearance. During the composition for Life on Earth, Williams mentored the film composer Martin Kiszko who then assisted him, and later by William Goodchild. =Soundbeam= In 1984 he commissioned the design of Soundbeam, an ultrasonic movement-to-MIDI converter which enables electronic instruments to be played from a distance by body movements in an ultrasonic beam. This has proven particularly useful in schools for children with special needs. Sound beam has continued to be successful and is in use worldwide. Later life and work In 1992, Williams composed and published 'Landscapes', a 3 movement trio for horn, violin and piano. It was first performed in October 1997 by the Bristol Ensemble with Donald Clist (horn), Roger Huckle (violin) and Susan Bird (piano). In 1995, Williams won the BAFTA Cymru award for best original score for the BBC/S4C series \\"Excalibur: The Search for Arthur\\". In 1996 he collaborated with Pip Eastop for a piece for the Arts Council of Great Britain. Personal life Williams was married to Judith Swingler, daughter of the poet Randall Swingler. Williams died in Bristol on 8 December 2013 age 92, after a short illness. He is survived by his wife Judith, and their 4 children. He was a distant relative of the Welsh poet Iolo Morganwg. He was a keen sailor, owning a Wayfarer, and had built Optimist dinghies.

One example of a naviduct has been built at Enkhuizen on the Houtribdijk in the Netherlands on the instructions of the Rijkswaterstaat. This cost over ‚Ç¨55 million and was completed in 2003. It is big enough to simultaneously transfer two large Rhine river-barges from the Markermeer to the IJsselmeer or vice versa. The structure was chosen because a busy waterway crosses a dam carrying a busy road, but the space available for separate aqueduct and lock facilities was restricted. Name and definition The term is derived from the words for navigation and aqueduct, which are in turn partly derived from the Latin words navis meaning ship and ducere meaning to lead or conduct. It can also be thought of as a lock system with an underpass under the lock for road traffic. The term is introduced and used extensively in the Netherlands for referring to the works near Enkhuizen in Dutch and English language texts. Krabbersgat Naviduct The world's only operational naviduct is near Enkhuizen, and is part of works commissioned in 1995 and administered in the Netherlands by the Rijkswaterstaat. This location is at the western end of the Houtribdijk in the province of Flevoland, which separates the Markermeer from the IJsselmeer. This dam was built as a possible northern dike to build the Markerwaard polder in 1975. Although construction of this polder has been permanentely shelved and was officially abandoned in 2003, the dam is still called a dike. Until the building of the naviduct, marine transport between the two lakes had to cross the dike at the Krabbersgat lock (near Enkhuizen) or the Houtrib lock (near Lelystad) due to the differing lake levels. The two lakes have the same target level, but wind surge and feed flows affect the two water bodies differently. Without a lock on the naviduct, the flow of water through the aqueduct could become too high for navigation. Highway N302 runs along the dike between the two towns, with bascule bridges at the two lock locations. Prior to the official opening of the naviduct at 11am on 26 April 2003 by Roelf de Boer, delays often arose for both road and water traffic, which could not pass the lock location simultaneously, and this was a particularly acute problem at the Enkhuizen end of the dike. =Technical details= The naviduct is constructed in a specially designed polder, having an artificially managed water table depth of -12.00 m NAP. The polder is diamond-shaped with a length of 500m and a width of 160m, while its embankment is elevated to +6m NAP. The road under the naviduct reaches a depth of -10.80m NAP. The polder guide dams were built using the geotextile tube method, where porous sausage-shaped bags are pumped full of sand slurry. The slurry is dewatered as the pumps fill the bags, forming a stable structure that is subsequently covered with quarried stone. Both locks have a length of 125 meters, a width of 12.5 meters and meet the Va requirements of the CEMT Class (i.e. each is suitable for a large Rhine river- barge). Special waterproof concrete was used for the locks, as they are designed to operate without the need for maintenance resulting from surface wear. The completed project cost ‚Ç¨55 million before tax. Other naviducts =Disused= Riley's Lock (Lock 24) which doubled as the aqueduct over Seneca Creek, on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal The Seneca Aqueduct on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal is a disused naviduct, consisting of a lock (Riley's Lock) and an aqueduct. The lock is located next to the aqueduct, but both are part of a single structure made out of sandstone. It was used from 1833 to 1924. One of the arches of the aqueduct collapsed in 1971, so it can't contain water anymore. =Planned= The Dutch government is currently considering whether to replace some of its existing lock and opening bridge combinations with naviducts. Naviducts have a high construction cost compared to standard locks and bridges, but benefit the economy by reducing delays. The former State Secretary for Infrastructure and the Environment, Joop Atsma, issued a statement in 2012 detailing the factors influencing the decision to build a new naviduct on the Afsluitdijk at Kornwerderzand. Strengthening of the existing locks was costed at ‚Ç¨33 million, building new locks at ‚Ç¨91 million and a naviduct and new locks at ‚Ç¨200-450 million, depending on the size of locks and size of highway. A naviduct would give waiting time annualised benefits of ‚Ç¨3 million to maritime traffic and ‚Ç¨13 million to road traffic, based on the bridge opening 7,000 times a year. Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis of all potential solutions were considered, and for the present time, the locks will be strengthened. However, it is quite possible that a naviduct will be built to replace the locks when they reach the end of their useful life in 2050.

They are intended to provide legally non-binding standards on good principles and practices in the treatment of detainees and the management of detention facilities. History and description The European Prison Rules were adopted by the Committee of Ministers in 1973 (Resolution 73.5). The Prison Rules were reformulated in 1987 (R 87.3). In January 2006, the Committee of Ministers on the European Prison Rules recommended that the 1987 version needed ‚Äúto be substantively revised and updated in order to reflect the developments which have occurred in penal policy, sentencing practice and the overall management of prisons in Europe‚Äù. Revisions can also be seen to reflect the expansion of Council of Europe membership: 15 member states in 1973, 21 in 1987, and 46 by 2005. A new version of the European Prison Rules was adopted in 2006, replacing all previous versions entirely. The 2006 European Prison Rules contain a significantly expanded section on health care in the prison setting. For the first time, they refer specifically to the prison authorities' obligation to safeguard the health of all prisoners (rule 39) and the need for prison medical services to be organized in close relationship with the general public health administration (rule 40). The European Prison Rules are based on the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. They are not legally binding for member states of the Council of Europe, but provide recognised standards on good principles and practices in the treatment of detainees and the management of detention facilities. One observer suggests that ‚Äòalmost all European countries aim to apply these standards but it is unlikely that a single one has succeeded in applying them fully.‚Äô In 2006 the Quaker Council for European Affairs produced a gender critique of the European Prison Rules as part of its Women in Prison Project. In recent years the European Prison Rules have been reported to have formed the basis for complaints against penal services and institutions in Norway and Ireland, and have set officially acknowledged standards for prison reform in Armenia. There are 108 rules in nine parts. Part I (rules 1 to 13) sets out basic principles as well as the scope and application. Part II (rules 14 to 38) covers conditions of imprisonment, including: nutrition, hygiene, access to legal advice, education, contact with the outside world, freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Part III deals with health and health care in prisons. Part IV deals with order and security; Part V Management and staff; Part VI Inspection and monitoring; Part VII Untried prisoners; Part VIII Sentenced prisoners; and Part IX the requirements for updating the Rules.

The GBS was originally developed for project management, but applies to product development and the organization as a whole. The concept is based on the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) popular in the project management discipline. Like the WBS, project goals exhibit a hierarchical structure. The highest-level defines the overall goal or mission for the project. The next level down sets the goals the organization intends to achieve from the project. These might include such items as profit, market share, etc. The next layer down defines the features the products must exhibit to achieve the organization's goals. The next layer down defines the specifications each product or component of the product must have to meet the products features. It also follows similar rules as the WBS as noted by the Project Management Institute's standard for project management, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R)PMBOK is a registered trademark of the Project Management Institute Guide).Project Management Institute, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), 5th edition, 2012 Similar to the WBS, the purpose of the GBS is to define all the goals and only the goals in a project needed to achieve the project's higher-level goals. History The GBS is the culmination of three concepts: the hierarchical relationship of product development, the work breakdown structure and requirements traceability. The concept of a hierarchical relationship among objectives in product development was identified by Joseph M. Juran in Juran's Quality Control HandbookJuran, J.M., and Gryna, Frank M.; \\"Juran's Quality Control Handbook\\", 4th Edition, McGraw- Hill, Inc., 1988 where he states in section 2.2, subsection Hierarchy of Product Features, \\"Products exist in a sort of hierarchical or pyramidal organization. At the apex is the overall product or system. Below the apex are multiple layers made up of subsystems, components, etc. At each layer, the products have features which must be defined by specifications and procedures.\\" The project work that creates the product, therefore, contains similar characteristics. Requirements traceability also became popular in the mid 1980s, particularly regarding medium and large-scale government projects. The idea of requirements traceability is to demonstrate the need for a particular project requirement or work element by showing how it is needed to achieve particular goals. The work breakdown structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the work to be done in a project. The term \\"goal breakdown structure\\" was coined by Stephen Gershenson, working with Michael B Bender and Stuart Syme in the late 1990s. The concept was first presented in project management seminars during this period. The first publication introducing the GBS was in Bender's first book: Setting Goals and Expectations.Bender, Michael B, Setting Goals and Expectations, Virtualbookworm Press, 2004 Mr. Bender embellished on the topic in his second book, A Manager's Guide to Project ManagementBender, Michael B, A Manager's Guide to Project Management, Financial Times Press, 2010 In the latter publication, Bender expanded the concept to apply to the organization as a whole, based partly on the works of David P. Norton and Robert S. Kaplin in The Balanced Scorecard.Kaplin, Robert S. and Norton, David P; The Balanced Scorecard, Harvard Business School Press, 1996 Structure and rules =Rules= The GBS follows two rules for decomposition. # Nothing missing. Each layer must contain all the goals needed to ensure the project achieves the next higher level goals. # Nothing extra. No layer should contain any extraneous goals; goals not needed to achieve the layer above. The first rule ensures success of the layer above. The second rule prevents the project from exhibiting extra scope and work that doesn't add value to the organization, saving time and money. =Structure= While the specific implementation of the GBS may vary from project to project, the classic implementation contains four layers or tiers. These are: * Project goal or mission statement * Business objectives * Project requirements * Product specifications Project Goal or Mission Statement In the original work, the highest level of the Goals breakdown structure is the project's goal or mission statement. This layer exhibits slightly different characteristics to the other tiers as its primary objective differs. The goal of the project mission or goal statement is to maintain the focus of the project team and stakeholders. Therefore, it is the one layer of the GBS that is not all-inclusive (it violates the Nothing Missing rule). Business Objectives The next layer down contains the business objectives for the project. This is a list of objectives the organization's senior management expects from the project. Often, these objectives tie directly to the organization's strategic plan and include such items as: Return on Investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV), market share, efficiency improvement, etc. This is the first layer that must satisfy both rules. Project Requirements The third tier contains the project's requirements. This is a list of both project and product characteristics required to achieve the business objectives. These include all the features, functions and characteristics that the project's deliverables must exhibit to achieve the business objectives. This also includes all the project's operational requirements and constraints needed by senior management. For larger programs, this tier may contain more than one layer. For example: :Program Layer ::Project Layer :::Sub-project layer Product Specifications This tier identifies all the specifications for the project's products. This tier may contain more than one layer as show below: :Product Specifications ::Component Specifications :::Sub-component Specifications Notes Category:Project management techniques Category:Product development ","title":"Goals breakdown structure"},{"id":"40073602","text":"The Nahe mine is a large potash mine located in southern Laos in Khammouane Province.

The Salym group includes three oil fields: West Salym, Upper Salym, and Vadelyp, located in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, southwest of Surgut and of Salym. Total recoverable C1 and C2 oil reserves are estimated to be 140 million tons. Total area of licenses equals to . SPD has been involved in the integrated development of the Salym group of oil fields, including appraisal and engineering, since 2003. During this period, a major modern oilfield has been established here. Since the summer of 2006, SPD has been one of Russian petroleum companies with an annual production volume exceeding 1 million tons. In 2014 SPD produced about 6.55 million tons of oil. Salym Petroleum Development is a 50/50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Gazprom Neft, a Russian petroleum company. In order to ensure the 95% level of associated petroleum gas utilization on the Salym group of fields, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plant has been built for associated petroleum gas processing ‚Äì a project that has been implemented by a partner company, Monolit LLC (Rose of the World group). The plant commissioned in May 2012 receives associated petroleum gas from Salym fields and Shapsha group of fields, RussNeft being the holder of the license for development of the latter. Currently SPD is realizing a pilot project of enhanced oil recovery technology called ASP (from Alkali, Surfactant, Polymer). The company has been studying it since 2008. It has completed series of laboratory and field tests with impressive results. The use of the technology in a single well tracer test demonstrated the displacement of 90 percent of oil left in the formation after waterflood. In 2014, the company drilled seven ASP wells, and started the construction of ASP mixing unit. In 2015 the company is planning to start up the experimental production. SPD is prepared to pro-cede to industrial application of the technology starting in 2018. The similarity of characteristics be-tween the fields in the region makes it possible to use this oil recovery method on other oilfields in Western Siberia. As calculated by experts, application of the ASP technology in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug will make it possible to produce additional 2.4 bln tons of oil in the next 15 years.

Life and career Tharwat Okasha was an army officer involved in the Free Officers Movement, along with former president Nasser and his comrades, which toppled King Farouk of Egypt from his crown in what is known as the 23 July Revolution of 1952. As a child of an aristocratic family, Okasha received a good education, read books in foreign languages, and learned music very early on in his home. This background made him the most cultured and enlightened officer among his group of army officers. He was appointed minister of culture in the late 1950s by President Nasser. Okasha held the position twice from 1958 to 1962 and, again, from 1966 to 1970. The two terms made him the most prominent minister of culture in Egypt's modern history. Okasha received his PhD in literature from Sorbonne in the 1960s and worked as visiting scholar at the College De France. He published more than 70 books, including his three-volume memoir titled My Memoirs in Politics and Culture, which is considered a rich resource for historians of the Nasserite era; as well as a 38-volume encyclopedia of arts titled The Eye Listens and the Ear Sees. During his terms in ministerial posts, he founded many cultural institutions that are still functioning and considered major Egyptian landmarks.

She is best known as co-vocalist of the American heavy metal band Butcher Babies. She landed her first job in Hollywood as an Entertainment Reporter for the Playboy Channel, and appeared on many popular network TV shows like Rules of Engagement. Harvey took a break from the entertainment world to earn a degree in Mortuary Science from California's Cypress College, and worked as an embalmer and funeral director before forming the Butcher Babies and pursuing her lifelong dream of being a touring musician. Harvey is passionate about writing. She was named a \\"comic book mastermind\\" by Hustler. Her first published comic book Butcher Babies was released with great success at San Diego Comic-Con 2011. Her first full-length novel, Death and Other Dances, was released in 2014, and a new comic series entitled Soul Sucka was released in 2015. Early life Harvey is of Irish-Ethiopian descent through her father and of Finnish-Italian descent through her mother. She attended Glenn Levey Middle School in Southfield, Michigan. As a teenager she attended Mercy High School (all-girl private Catholic) and Harrison High School, both in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Carla also has a degree in mortuary science from California's Cypress College, and is a licensed funeral director and embalmer. In an interview, she said that \\"She hopes to one day open her own funeral home, but for now, she's enjoying life on the road with the Butcher Babies.\\" She also worked as a nude model and had appeared in several softcore adult features, sometimes using the alias Bridget Banks. Among these are At Your Service (2006), Decadent Dreams (2005), and Bedtime Secrets (2008). Harvey also appeared in Hustler's rap-porn compilation Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle XXX DVD (2001), but did not perform any explicit acts and was only featured as a dancer.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282988/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast  Reaction to criticism  Harvey and her fellow Butcher Babies vocalist, Heidi Shepherd, have been subject to some negative criticism. In an interview with Blabbermouth.net, Harvey said: \\"There's always gonna be haters. We actually don't really play into the negativity, or read into the negativity.

Hammond was born in 1936 in Blackford, an independent indigenous community on the south-east coast of South Australia, and was a member of the Tanganekald group of the Ngarridindjeri people of the Coorong. Ruby obtained school certificate in 1952 but the tough conditions at work in a shop made her touch racism against her.Hammond, Ruby Florence (1936‚Äì1993) At the age of 32 she became a member of the Council of Aboriginal Women and was active throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the pursuit of equal rights for Aboriginal people including professional roles at the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, the Department of Personnel and Industrial Relations and the National Australian Women's Consultative Council. She acted as a consultant to the 1977 Australian Law Reform Commission into Aboriginal Customary Laws which considered whether it was desirable to apply Aboriginal customary law to Aboriginals. The Commission's report outlined Aboriginal customary laws were not generally recognised by general Australian law, yet were a significant influence on Aboriginal people. The report recommended that Aboriginal people should have the final say in the recognition of customary law. Hammond was appointed by the Whitlam Government to the Australian National Advisory Committee on International Women's year (1975). In 1980, Hammond advocated for a treaty which recognised Aboriginal sovereignty. Speaking as representative for the Aboriginal Land Rights Support Group, Hammond argued \\"we are the national minority; it is a treaty between two nations. The government must agree and recognise that we were here first\\". In 1988, she ran in the by-election for the Federal seat of Port Adelaide, becoming the first indigenous South Australian to do so. In 1990, Hammond was appointed Head of the Aboriginal Issues Unit for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Hammond served as Aboriginal Coordinator for the South Australian Department of Arts and Cultural Heritage from 1991 to 1993. In 1991, she joined with singer Archie Roach to publicly demand an inquiry into the Stolen Generations. In January 1993 Hammond was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal, which was presented to her by Her Excellency the Governor of South Australia, Dame Roma Mitchell. She received a posthumous award for equal opportunity achievement in 1993.  Legacy  In 2002 an artwork recognising Hammond's contributions to the advancement of indigenous Australians was included in Reconciliation Place, Canberra. The artwork was designed by 'Munnari' John Hammond, her son. The electoral district of Hammond in South Australia is named in recognition of her contributions. Her name is also inscribed on the Port Adelaide Workers Memorial.

They were theoretically predicted in 1988 by the Russian Soviet physicist Mikhail Dyakonov. Unlike other types of acoustic and electromagnetic surface waves, the DSW's existence is due to the difference in symmetry of materials forming the interface. He considered the interface between an isotropic transmitting medium and an anisotropic uniaxial crystal, and showed that under certain conditions waves localized at the interface should exist. Later, similar waves were predicted to exist at the interface between two identical uniaxial crystals with different orientations. The previously known electromagnetic surface waves, surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons, exist under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive (for example, this is the case for the air/metal interface below the plasma frequency). In contrast, the DSW can propagate when both materials are transparent; hence they are virtually lossless, which is their most fascinating property. In recent years, the significance and potential of the DSW have attracted the attention of many researchers: a change of the constitutive properties of one or both of the two partnering materials ‚Äì due to, say, infiltration by any chemical or biological agent ‚Äì could measurably change the characteristics of the wave. Consequently, numerous potential applications are envisaged, including devices for integrated optics, chemical and biological surface sensing, etc. However, it is not easy to satisfy the necessary conditions for the DSW, and because of this the first proof-of- principle experimental observation of DSW was reported only 20 years after the original prediction. A large number of theoretical work appeared dealing with various aspects of this phenomenon, see the detailed review. In particular, DSW propagation at magnetic interfaces, in left-handed materials, in electro- optical, and chiral materials was studied. Resonant transmission due to DSW in structures using prisms was predicted, and combination and interaction between DSW and surface plasmons (Dyakonov plasmons) was studied and observed.  Physical properties  The simplest configuration considered in Ref. 1 consists of an interface between an isotropic material with permittivity and a uniaxial crystal with permittivities and for the ordinary and the extraordinary waves respectively. The crystal C axis is parallel to the interface. For this configuration, the DSW can propagate along the interface within certain angular intervals with respect to the C axis, provided that the condition of is satisfied. Thus DSW are supported by interfaces with positive birefringent crystals only (). The angular interval is defined by the parameter : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_e}{\\\\epsilon_0} - 1 . The angular intervals for the DSW phase and group velocities ( and ) are different. The phase velocity interval is proportional to and even for the most strongly birefringent natural crystals is very narrow (rutile) and (calomel). However the physically more important group velocity interval is substantially larger (proportional to ). Calculations give for rutile, and for calomel.  Perspectives  A widespread experimental investigation of DSW material systems and evolution of related practical devices has been largely limited by the stringent anisotropy conditions necessary for successful DSW propagation, particularly the high degree of birefringence of at least one of the constituent materials and the limited number of naturally available materials fulfilling this requirement. However, this is about to change in light of novel artificially engineered metamaterials and revolutionary material synthesis techniques. The extreme sensitivity of DSW to anisotropy, and thereby to stress, along with their low-loss (long-range) character render them particularly attractive for enabling high sensitivity tactile and ultrasonic sensing for next-generation high-speed transduction and read-out technologies. Moreover, the unique directionality of DSW can be used for the steering of optical signals.

The series aired from September 9 to September 19, 2013. For a titular million seconds (11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds), contestants attempted to maintain control of a \\"money chair\\" by winning trivia matches against other contestants, earning money for every second they occupied the chair. At any given moment, the four highest-scoring contestants other than the one in the chair were sequestered together. When time ran out, the four top scorers received the money they had accumulated and competed in a stepladder playoff for a top prize of $2,000,000. Executive produced by Stephen Lambert, Eli Holzman, and David Hurwitz, The Million Second Quiz was positioned as a live, multi-platform television event, which Lambert dubbed \\"the Olympics of quiz\\", that would help to promote NBC's lineup for the 2013‚Äì14 television season. The series was cross-promoted through several NBCUniversal properties, and NBC broadcast a live prime time show for each night of the competition (except for September 15, due to Sunday Night Football) and a two-hour finale. Using a mobile app, viewers could play the game against others and potentially earn a chance to appear as a contestant during the prime time episodes. Outside the prime time episodes, the program was also webcast throughout the competition by means of the Million Second Quiz app and NBC.com. Critics argued that the confusing format of The Million Second Quiz, along with its lack of drama and technical issues with the show's app during the first days of the series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air. Despite peaking at 6.52 million viewers for its premiere, ratings steadily dropped during the show's run before rising again near the finale. Gameplay The quiz was set in an \\"hourglass-shaped structure\\" located on a roof in midtown Manhattan. An indoor set in the same building was also constructed for use during the non-prime time portions of the game and for any inclement weather situations, as occurred on Day 4. Contestants played in a quiz competition that ran 24 hours a day for 1,000,000 seconds, literally 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds. Sponsors They are: Orville Redenbacher's, Samsung, Subway, 5-Hour Energy, Hostess, Planet Fitness & Seattle's Best Coffee At any given time, one contestant sat in the \\"Money Chair\\" and accumulated money while defending his/her position against a series of challengers in head-to-head quiz bouts. Each bout lasted a set number of seconds; after a question was read, the contestants had five seconds to secretly lock in their answers on separate keypads. The contestant in the chair earned money at a rate of $10 per second, even when bouts were not being played and during the prime time commercial breaks. When this contestant lost a bout, he/she stopped earning money and the challenger took control of the chair. Only the four contestants with the highest total winnings kept their money once the countdown clock ran out of time. =Bouts= Each prime time broadcast hour consists of three bouts: the \\"Challenger\\" bout, the \\"Line Jumper\\" bout, and the \\"Winner's Defense\\" bout. Questions start at one point each, with the value increasing by one every 100 seconds. At any time, either contestant may choose to \\"double\\" instead of answering; doing so doubles that question's value and forces the opponent to act. A doubled opponent may either answer or \\"double back,\\" quadrupling the point value and forcing the original contestant to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or fails to act within five seconds, the points are awarded to his/her opponent. Contestants may double as often as they wish during a bout. At the end of the bout, the contestant with the higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules. The \\"Challenger\\" bout features a person who has successfully completed an on-site tryout process. The \\"Line Jumper\\" bout of each episode features a contestant who has achieved a sufficiently high score on the official Million Second Quiz app, allowing him/her to skip the tryouts and advance directly onto the show. At any given time, the four contestants who have accumulated the most money in their bouts live in \\"Winners' Row,\\" an area of living quarters set up next to the hourglass. They are at risk of being displaced if someone else outscores them. During a \\"Winner's Defense\\" bout, the current \\"Power Player\\" chooses one of the four Winners' Row occupants (including himself/herself) to face off against the current Money Chair occupant. The winner claims the loser's entire winnings in addition to his/her own and assumes control of the Money Chair, while the loser is eliminated. In episode one, the Power Player was the contestant with the most winnings; starting with episode two, it was the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers from playing along in Winners' Row that day. Contestants who are defeated in the Winner's Defense bouts lose all winnings they have accumulated. All other defeated contestants, including those displaced from Winners' Row by being out-scored, may try out again for a chance to win their way back into the Money Chair. Outside the one-hour television segments, all bouts last 500 seconds (eight minutes and twenty seconds). Each question is worth one point, and no doubling is allowed. Contestants outside of prime time play non-stop save for a ten-minute bathroom break every hour, and their bouts are live-streamed on NBC's website. =Finals= Once the countdown clock reaches zero, the four contestants with the highest totals throughout the game keep all of their credited winnings and compete in a series of three elimination bouts; the fourth and third-place winners face off in a 400-second bout, the victor of the first bout faces the second-place winner (400 seconds), and the victor of the second bout faces the first-place winner (500 seconds). The victor of the final bout receives a further $2,000,000. In the season finale, Andrew Kravis defeated Brandon Saunders to win the grand prize, for an overall total of $2,326,346. Seacrest then announced that Kravis's winnings would be increased to $2,600,000 to make him the all-time highest-earning regular-season contestant on a single American game show, surpassing Ken Jennings's $2,522,700 run on Jeopardy! in 2004. Production alt=Construction of an hourglass to be used as the set for an American quiz show. The concept of The Million Second Quiz was intended to make the show a national event; while pitching the format to NBC, creator Stephen Lambert compared the game to a tennis match and called it \\"the Olympics of quiz.\\" To promote the series, NBC relied on a cross-platform promotional strategy similar to what it had used in the past for The Voice; including appearances by host Ryan Seacrest on other NBC programs, such as the network's NFL pre-game show, Football Night in America. to support the show, and tie-in advertisements for programs airing across other NBCUniversal properties (such as USA Network). The program itself also served as a vehicle for promoting NBC's then-upcoming lineup for the 2013‚Äì14 television season. NBC wanted the game's prime time portions aired live from an outdoor location in Manhattan with the city skyline for background. Production designer Anton Goss, who also designed the set for NBC's The Voice, came up with a three- story bent-steel structure in the shape of a giant hourglass laced with lights and containing the custom-made Money Chair - \\"...on a rooftop with the city behind us...we have to do something significant...It's like we're building our own little skyscraper.\\" Because of the 18,000 lb weight of the hourglass structure in addition to bleachers full of audience members during show times, the building's rooftop required shoring so that the second floor could help carry the large loads. Geiger Engineers provided the structural engineering for the hourglass and other rooftop structures as well as the required rooftop shoring. Two years after the U.S. version of the show was broadcast, an international version of the show aired on China's Hunan TV in September 2015, entitled . alt=Headshot of television host Ryan Seacrest, taken at a media appearance in California in 2013 The Million Second Quiz premiered on September 9, 2013; the non-prime time quiz began a day earlier at 7:17 AM EDT. The first episode started with 867,826 seconds remaining. The show ran for ten episodes before it concluded on September 19, 2013. Reception The Million Second Quiz received negative reviews from television critics, and ratings went down over time: its premiere and finale were seen by 6.52 and 4.95 million viewers respectively, but fell lower in between. The ratings were generally seen as poor; TVWeek described the show as \\"ratings-challenged,\\" and while NBC president of alternative and late-night programming Paul Telegdy was satisfied with the debut episode's ratings, Michael O'Connor of The Hollywood Reporter described it as a \\"ratings disaster.\\" O'Connor attributed the poor ratings to the show's confusing format and also quoted a network executive as saying: \\"I don't know how much worse it can get.\\" The New York Times Mike Hale believed that the general failure of the series was a result of its unclear format, the \\"banal\\" subject matter of many of its questions (citing examples which ranged from American history to the name of Kim Kardashian's cat), the fact that second screen interactions with game shows were not a new concept, and that the show and its interactive components were not \\"convergent\\" enough. Varietys Brian Lowry argued that NBC was \\"a little too desperate to turn The Million Second Quiz into 'an event,'\\" and also stated \\"having watched the opening 2,600 seconds of actual Million Second Quiz content, hey, wake me when it‚Äôs almost over.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Sonia Saraiya felt that The Million Second Quiz, in contrast to other major reality shows such as Big Brother, was a \\"hyped show about hype\\" that was \\"so deeply flawed and so universally unpopular that it is not going to remain in anyone's memory for long. ... In this wildly expensive failure, it‚Äôs possible to see so many of NBC's flaws, all in the same package.\\" However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were \\"friendly\\" and \\"relatable,\\" rather than \\"chosen for their reprehensibility.\\" Digital Spys Catriona Wightman doubted the series would be able to retain viewership: \\"Even while I sort of enjoyed the first episode despite myself, I can't imagine becoming obsessed with it to that extent - is there really enough there to sustain that kind of interest?\\" Writing from a non-prime time contestant's perspective, Seth Stevenson, a journalist for Slate, personally took part in a nighttime slot and was critical of the show's handling of contestants, revealing, \\"Production assistants whispered that a few contestants who'd pounded 5-Hour Energy shots‚Äîin an effort to stay alert‚Äîhad been registering terrifyingly rapid resting pulse rates.\\" Stevenson also added: \\"I stumbled out onto 11th Avenue at 2:15 a.m. this morning, two calendar days after my internment began, and...hadn't won any money. I hadn't met Ryan Seacrest. And my unhinged \\"Story\\" interview will now live in NBC's video vaults for perpetuity, in any and all media formats now existing or ever to be devised throughout the known and unknown galaxy. At least I'm pretty sure that's what the release said. I'm still too amped up on 5-Hour Energy to be sure.\\" =Ratings= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"No. ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"Title ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"Original air date ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"Rating/Share (18‚Äì49) ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"U.S. viewers (millions) ! style=\\"text-align: center;\\"Time slot rank - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 1\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 9, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.7/5 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 6.52 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 2 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 10, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.5/5 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 5.83 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3 style=\\"text- align: center;\\"\\"Day 3\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 11, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.3/4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 5.17 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 4\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 12, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.1/3 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4.16 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 5 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 5\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 13, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 0.8/3 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3.97 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" 6 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 6\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 14, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 0.7/3 style=\\"text- align: center;\\" 3.03 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 7 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 7\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 16, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.0/3 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3.59 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 8 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Day 8\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 17, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.1/4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 5.22 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 9 style=\\"text- align: center;\\"\\"Day 9\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 18, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.1/4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4.87 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 10 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"\\"Finale\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" September 19, 2013 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 1.3/4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 4.95 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 3 } Notes References External links * at the Wayback Machine * Category:2010s American game shows Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2013 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Quiz shows Category:Television series by All3Media Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:September 2013 events in the United States ","title":"The Million Second Quiz"},{"id":"40074082","text":"The Descent from the Cross is a 1650‚Äì1652 painting of the Descent from the Cross by Rembrandt, Constantijn van Renesse and Rembrandt's studio.

It was part of the South Pacific Adventure Series. It was also released in the United States by Feature Films for Families. Plot Anna Peterson (Beth Buchanan) loves horses, and the fact that her father John Peterson (Bruno Lawrence) works at a racetrack in Sydney, Australia only adds to her enthusiasm. One night at dinner, her father announces that after the success of one of the stable's horses in a prominent trophy race, his boss gave the employees a bonus large enough for the Peterson family to go back to her father's ancestral home in New Zealand. Tragically the following day, there is an accident at the stables and John is killed. With nothing left to keep them in Australia, Anna's mother Rose (Michele Fawdon) decides to follow through on her husband's dream and moves Anna and her younger brother Mike (Andrew Shepherd) to Charlton, New Zealand. Upon arrival, however, they find things are not quite what they expected. First, they are run off the road by Mr. Garrett (Peter McAllum), a prominent local horse breeder obsessed with hunting a beautiful brown wild stallion, as he and his men are in pursuit. Next, after walking several miles to their father's family homestead, they discover it has fallen into disrepair and is barely livable. The night they arrive, Anna hears the wild horse out in the woods behind the house and frees it from loose wire in which it had been caught. Before she can persuade the horse to come home with her, a mysterious man appears and frightens the horse away. Meanwhile, a local shop owner Mr. Peabody (John Watson), who met the Petersons on their way into town and who seems aware of a connection between them and Mr. Garrett, informs his friend of their arrival. Garrett's three teenage children Tony (Dean O'Gorman), Ginny (Jodie Rimmer), and Wayne (Brian Rooney) overhear the conversation and discuss the rumour that John Peterson killed one of Mr. Garrett's best mares years before, explaining his cold behavior towards John's wife and children. Ginny warns the caring Wayne that he \\"best not get friendly with them, if you know what's good for you.\\" The next day, Jean Bailey (Beaver) arrives at the homestead to offer her various services, including veterinary services, if the family plans on keeping horses. Rose declines, but invites Jean to stay for coffee, during which Jean tells Rose about the feud between her husband and Garrett. She also offers to tow their stranded car. Anna volunteers to show her where the car was run off the road. On the way, Jean Bailey invites Anna to join the local Pony Club, and they discuss the wild horse. Later, while Anna's mother runs into town for house supplies, she and Mike sneak off to check out the Pony Club in spite Rose's expressed wishes. Rose doesn't want her children around horses out of fear that they'll get hurt. Anna gets into a tiff with Garrett after he attempts to whip his prize horse, Eclipse, which threw his daughter Ginny during competition. Anna and Mike start school the following day, and find themselves the targets of a band of bullies, led by Tony and Ginny. Only Wayne goes out of his way to befriend Anna, telling her about Old Gonzalez (Jose Maria Caffarel), the mysterious man she had seen in the woods, a supposed murderer who lives in the wild. After an incident on the bus, Jean Bailey, who is also the bus driver, threatens to tell the school principal and get Ginny and Tony in detention after school, causing them to miss Pony Club. Ginny plots revenge by inviting Anna and Mike to ride Eclipse after school. During Anna's turn, Tony and his friends throw stones at Eclipse, causing the horse to bolt. When Anna loses control and is thrown, Eclipse runs off into the woods, and Ginny and Tony jeeringly tell Anna to go back home to Australia. Dejected, Anna runs off after Eclipse. In the woods, she finds the wild stallion who leads her to Eclipse, now stuck in a bog. After being saved from falling into a large trap Garrett's men dug throughout the woods by Old Gonzalez, Anna and the old man pull Eclipse out with the help of the stallion, called Wild Fire (Fuego Savaje) by Gonzalez. In contrast to Gonzalez's murderous reputation, he takes Anna to his remote animal sanctuary to rest and to check Eclipse for injuries. In the meantime, Ginny and Tony claim that Anna has stolen the horse, fueling Garrett's determination to buy the Peterson homestead and send Anna's family back to Australia. Wayne is revealed to be friends with Gonzalez when he runs into Anna in the woods on his way to ask Gonzalez's help to find her. Wayne apologizes on behalf of his siblings, who he states only bullied her to get on the right side of their father, and explains his complicity in perpetuating rumours of Gonzalez's reputation as a murderer. He also tells her of his own horse riding accident during which he was injured while trying a difficult jump at his father's urging, resulting in his current limp. Before Wayne and Anna escort Eclipse back to town, Gonzalez tells Anna and Wayne the real story of the fight between Garrett and Anna's father. John had worked for Garrett's father as an assistant trainer on his horse farm. John had a way with horses and unlike Garrett who is very rough with them. One day, Anna's father found Garrett whipping the prize stallion, slated to win the Melbourne Cup race. After an altercation, Garrett tried to persuade his father to fire John, but he refused to fire such a skilled trainer and risk losing the race. One morning some time later, both John and the horse went missing. John later claimed the stable door had been left open and the horse had wandered off. It fell in a gully and broke two legs, ruining any hope of winning the race. Garrett claimed John had tried to steal the horse, and this time his father fired John and told him to \\"get out of town.\\" Gonzalez sends them off to take Eclipse back with instructions that she cannot be ridden for a minimum of two days. As Anna and Wayne stroll back to town with Eclipse, they hear cries for help. Mike, who had gone off on his own to find his missing sister, fell into one of Garrett's horse traps and is seriously injured. Wildfire allows Anna to ride him into town to fetch help. Mike is taken to the hospital, where Rose declares that, in light of the unwelcoming community and the severity of Mike's injuries, they must go home to Australia. While Rose stays with Mike, Jean tries to drum up support for the family in town, encouraging everyone to stand up to Garrett. Anna goes back to Gonzalez's home to say goodbye to Wildfire, but Garrett has followed her and plans to shoot the horse, chasing it through the woods to the edge of a cliff where Wildfire leaps into the rapids, presumably dead. Gonzalez accuses him of leaving the stable door open all those years ago, declares that rather than leading the horse away John Peterson had been tracking it, and chastises Garrett for his arrogance which has caused so much hurt to those around him. After Mike encourages his mom to not go back to Australia the family decides to stay. The community finally rallies around them, forming a working bee to fix up the house, and refusing to be intimidated by Garrett anymore. Wayne shows up riding a horse, having regained his confidence, and invites Anna to come riding with him. When she protests she has no horse, he indicates Wildfire, still alive, at the edge of the woods, and the two ride together through the hills surrounding the homestead.Ed.

Northeast Thailand is believed to contain the world's third-largest‚Äîafter Canada and Russia‚Äîunexploited potash reserves. Operations Mining operations occupy an area of about 26,446 rai or 42.3 km2 which consists of the processing plant area of 1,250 rai (2 km2) and an underground mine. The mine is an underground room and pillar mine projected to reach depths of 350‚Äì380 metres. Udon North and South represent one of the largest potash reserves in Thailand, having estimated reserves of 665 million tonnes of ore grading 16 percent potassium chloride extracted from sylvite ore. With a construction budget of more than 30 billion baht, the project is slated to have a maximum capacity of two million tonnes of potash a year. Local opposition mining had not begun at at least some sites due to local opposition. Concerns include questions about the disposal of mine tailings, a waste rock by-product and projected land subsidance. New mining legislation in the form of a minerals act to be enacted 29 October 2017, has increased fears among activists that its intent is to dampen public participation in mining decisions while expediting mining projects.

The bottom two floors, encircled with a cast concrete brise soleil comprise the original building, completed in 1963. The building's unique architecture and history have inspired efforts to preserve it from demolition. History American Federal Savings and Loan Association acquired a lot In 1961 for US$400,000. The American Federal Building was designed by architect Robert Murphy, who had established his practice in Orlando in 1947 and his firm later became HuntonBrady. The building was originally a two story structure, surrounded by pre-cast a concrete brise soleil, giving the building a distinct modern appearance. The construction firm Jack Jennings & Sons erected the original building, completing it in 1963. In 1973, five additional floors were added to the building with glass-clad outer walls. The building has had a number of banking tenants during its history including Coral Gables Federal Savings, First Union and Loan and CNL Financial Group. The City of Orlando purchased the building in its final years and used it for overflow office space from City Hall which was directly across Orange Avenue. The building (shown here in 2009) was demolished (the process, hampered by delays, beginning in the fall of 2014 and completed by the summer of 2015) to provide space for the construction of the Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts. Plans were made by The Nils M. Schweizer Fellows, a group of mid century modern architecture enthusiasts and architects from the local American Institute of Architects (AIA) chapter and historians to salvage and repurpose the 120-piece concrete brise soleil latticework that surrounds the building. The first preserved and re-purposed Brise Soleil segment was installed in front of the Orange County Regional History Center in Downtown Orlando in November 2018.

He grew up in Austria and Czechoslovakia, arriving in the UK in 1939 on one of the kindertransport missions. He completed his education after the war in Czechoslovakia and Israel (from 1949), obtaining a doctorate in physics. He then lived and worked as a research physicist in the US, retiring in 1995. His honours include the 1979 Stuart Ballantine Medal and his induction into the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame (1991). Early life and education Born in Vienna in 1925, Abeles lived in Czechoslovakia from 1934. In July 1939, aged 14, he was one of hundreds of Jewish children brought from Prague to London through the efforts of British humanitarian Nicholas Winton, an example of the various kindertransport missions that saved many such children from the impending dangers of World War II and the Holocaust. Aged 15 he worked as a waiter and took correspondence courses in English, mathematics, physics and chemistry. At the age of 18, Abeles served as a mechanic in the war as part of No. 311 Squadron RAF. After the war he returned to Czechoslovakia and studied at Charles University in Prague and Czech Technical University in Prague, before moving to Israel in 1949 to study for his doctorate in Jerusalem. His thesis, published in 1955, was titled 'The Galvanomagnetic Effects in Bismuth and Bi- Sn Alloys'. Career Following the award of his PhD, Abeles worked in Israel on germanium electronics before moving to the United States to carry out research in Princeton for the Radio Corporation of America. During his career, Abeles worked at both the David Sarnoff Research Center and at Exxon Research and Engineering in Annandale, New Jersey. He lived with his family in Princeton and commuted to the Exxon research centre. Working with George D. Cody in the 1960s, Abeles developed germanium-silicon alloys that were used in the development of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators used to power spacecraft and probes engaged in long voyages of space exploration. Abeles also worked as a professor at the University of Texas. Recognition and later life For their work, Abeles and Cody received the 1979 Stuart Ballantine Medal (Engineering) from the Franklin Institute, and were inducted into the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame in 1991. Abeles's 65th birthday in 1990 was marked by a symposium in his honour: 'Physical Phenomena in Granular Materials'. Abeles retired in 1995. He has lived in Great Britain as well as travelling in Europe and returning to the US, where his children and grandchildren live. His interests include a range of courses enrolled on as part of the University of the Third Age.

Scott McRae hosted the show in 2000-2001; he was replaced by Nathan Lloyd in 2001-2002, while Emily Jade O'Keefe hosted the final season of the show (which aired in mid-2002). The co-host for the final season was Miss Bytes (shown on TV in the studio). Format Four contestants competed in a tournament format, which consists of a series of word puzzles. =First two rounds (Small Screen Game)= At the beginning of each round, two contestants were introduced. The winner of the coin toss prior to the beginning of the round got to choose a category; the categories used for this round were as follows: Screen Dreams, Planet Earth, Sounds, True Blue, Techno, and Sweating It Out. The first letter in the word puzzle was automatically given. In order for a letter to be downloaded, a contestant had to answer a trivia question related to the category (the answer always contained the letter that was in the puzzle). The first contestant to buzz in with the correct answer earned 1 point and had that letter automatically placed into the correct position in the puzzle. Solving the puzzle earned the contestant an additional 4 points and eliminated the category from further play. Giving an incorrect answer to the trivia question or solving the puzzle incorrectly yielded no points. The first contestant to score 10 or more points (or the contestant in the lead when time was called, whichever came first) advanced to the third round, while the other contestant left the game with consolation prizes. This round was played twice throughout the game. =Third round (Big Screen Game)= The two remaining contestants who won the first two rounds faced off against each other in this round, and their scores were reset to zero. Both contestants were shown a scrambled word or phrase, and were given a maximum of five clues to try and unscramble it; the first contestant to buzz in with the correct word was awarded a number of points depending upon the number of clues given (the maximum score was five points, with one point being deducted for each additional clue). Every time a clue is read out, some of the letters in the word were unscrambled; if no one was able to unscramble the word in five clues, the word was thrown out and no points were awarded to either teams. Once time was called, the contestants played a 60-second lightning round, where the point values for each unscrambled word were doubled (the maximum point value was 10 points). The player with the most points at the end of the round won the game and advanced to the bonus round. If both contestants were tied at the end of the round, one final puzzle was played. The player who buzzed in with the correct answer won the game, but an incorrect answer or no response awarded the win to the other contestant. The highest margin of victory was 90 points (a score of 94‚Äì4), which was recorded in October 2002 by Kavel Gounden (who was 11 years old at the time and represented Kenmore South State School). =Endgame= The contestant who won the game had a chance to win additional prizes. During the first two seasons, the player had to choose one category before the beginning of the round; this was dropped for the show's third and final season. There was a puzzle with four lines: a series of nine letters were blindly chosen by the contestant, and they were placed in the correct positions in the puzzle. Once the positions were filled, the contestant was given 40 seconds to solve all four puzzles (there was one clue for each puzzle). The contestant received a prize for every correct answer; in order for a correct answer to be credited, the line number (or the line letter in the third season) had to be given before the word. Only one puzzle can be solved at a time; if a contestant was unsure, he or she could pass and return to a given clue depending upon the amount of time left in the round. If the contestant solved all four puzzles correctly, he or she won all four prizes If not then he or she will keep the prizes that they did win. Trivia * The show was rerun in 2004-2007 showing on the Disney Channel. * In 2003-2005, a couple of additional episodes (mostly when Lloyd and O'Keefe hosted the show) were broadcast on the Nine Network since the show ended in 2002. * There was a website for the game show in 2000-2002.

Initiation The Varahi project was approved by Government of Karnataka in 1979 with an initial project cost of Rs.9.43 crores. Originally planned as a power generation project, but as the original plan involved submerging of 1,019 acres of forest land, it was changed to lift irrigation project in 2001 as the latter involved submerging of only 129.60 forest land. The irrigation project, on completion, is designed to irrigated 38,800 acres of land of which 15,702 acres are in Kundapura and Udupi taluks of Karnataka. =Delay and cost escalation= Over the years, the project cost increased substantially and in first 25 years a sum of Rs.37 crores were spent, but the work was still under progress as on April 2005. After three decades of launching the scheme, the project cost of the scheme escalated to more than Rs.650 crores of which about Rs.375 crores was spent up to 2011 and work was still under progress. The official reasons given in 2011 by Minister of Water resources, for undue delay in completion of the project were, \\"hurdles from Revenue Department, changes in design, land acquisition, no objection from Forest Department and untimely rain\\". Hope for sugarcane growers In 2004, the lift irrigation project was brought under the preview of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam and once completed, it is expected to revive the defunct Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory located in the same district. In 2011, a sum of Rs.10 crores was provided to revive the Sugar factory. Controversies The undue delay in completion of project has given scope to doubts about the misappropriation of government funds and certain public have filed writ petition in High court of Karnataka demanding for a CBI investigation. In 2011, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president demanded Special Investigation Team probe as more than Rs.200 crores was sanctioned to the project within a span of previous three years by previous Government. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the project on 04/05/2015, but only for two days the water has flown in the channels. The people also suspect that this is one of the biggest scam in the name of water irrigation and probe should be done to punish the people involved in this scam.

The show's revival premiered on 13 February 2019 on Channel 10 and WIN, hosted by Natalie Bassingthwaighte. On 31 January 2019, the show's designers were announced, being interior designers and stylists Chris Carroll and Jane Thomson, interior designer Tim Leveson and design & renovation expert Naomi Findlay. Early series Suzie Wilks and James Lunday The series first aired on the Nine Network in 1998 until 2005, hosted by Suzie Wilks, who was assisted by handyman James Lunday and designers Peter Everett, Deborah De Jong, Glenn T and Tim Janenko-Panaeff. Executive producers were Eric Dwyer, David Barbour and Julian Cress. Each week, two couples would swap houses and with a tight budget of $AU1,500 and just two days, would renovate one room in each other's house with the aid of a carpenter and professional designer. The series was axed when host Suzie Wilks quit in 2005. Revival The series was revived by Network Ten and premiered on Wednesday, 13 February 2019. It is hosted by Natalie Bassingthwaighte, with contestants guided by interior designers Chris Carroll, Jane Thompson, Naomi Findlay and Tim Leveson.

The budget for the renovation of each house was $AU20,000 and couples chose which rooms in their houses they wanted to be renovated. The show, due to a 'disappointing' reception and negative reviews, was cancelled four episodes into the season. It is still unknown if Network Ten will air the remaining episodes in the series.

McCordic School, a congregated school for students with disabilities. The sod of the new school was turned in June 1970 and the building was built in June 1972 at 45 Felstead Avenue on the former industrial property between Danforth and Greenwood. At the same time, East End High School became a co-ed school and renamed Lakeview Secondary School which opened for classes in September 1972. The auditorium and a swimming pool was also constructed. As Lakeview, the school carried a variety of academics and tech skills as a specialized high school as well as four-year courses and had Business Services Programs. The girls were admitted to Lakeview came from Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute. In 1985 Cathy McPherson, the coordinator of the PUSH Central Region, stated that Lakeview and five other schools were listed as having \\"excellent\\" access for disabled persons by the Toronto Board of Education continuing education program.Brett, Mary Ann. \\"Schools don't make grade on access for the disabled.\\" Toronto Star. August 26, 1985. Life p. C3. Retrieved on August 22, 2013. With the decrease of low enrolment and funding of Catholic schools, Ned McKeown, director of the TBE, recommended that on January 7, 1988 that Lakeview and West Park Secondary School be closed and leased to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now known as the Toronto Catholic District School Board) or MSSB from July 1989.Contenta, Sandro. \\"2 Toronto schools set for transfer to Catholics.\\" Toronto Star. January 8, 1988. News p. A1. Retrieved on August 22, 2013. Lakeview held its last classes in June 1989 and the MSSB reopened Lakeview as St. Patrick Catholic Secondary School (opened in 1986, then swapped for the original facility at 70 D'Arcy St. (now Heydon Park Secondary School)) on the Lakeview building in September of that year although the TBE retained the ground floor until 1994.MINUTES of the METROPOLITAN TORONTO SCHOOL BOARD, 1989, p. 148, 254-255, 436. Originally, the TBE planned to retain Lakeview as an adult education centre. The closure of Lakeview reallocated the funding for renovations at Riverdale and Forest Hill Collegiates.

Retrieved July 2013. in Berkeley County, South Carolina.. Retrieved July 2013. Carolinacetus is known from an incomplete cranium with portions of the right inner ear, a detached rostrum, and parts of both mandibles with 11 teeth. Preserved from the postcranium are 13 vertebrae and 15 ribs. The holotype was collected in 1994. Several anatomical features identifies Carolinacetus as a protocetid (and therefore as a member of Pelagiceti) including: external nares are located above the canine, the supraoccipital (in cetaceans, the part of the occipital bone located above the foramen magnum and directed backwards) is narrow and tubular, accessory cusps absent on M3, a broad connection between the ectotympanic bulla and the falciform process of the squamosal, axis vertebra with large vertebral foramen. In Carolinacetus the naral openings are located in front of P1, making it the most basal North American cetacean. Carolinacetus is distinct from other North American cetaceans, it is 8-15% larger than Georgiacetus and differs from it in several cranial characters.

Her work in Dutch linguistics includes amongst others the development of the first academic software teaching platform for Dutch, esp. Dutch syntax, in the late 1980s, the discovery of three additional objects in contemporary Dutch and the rules for the revised Dutch spelling system, Groene Boekje 2005.  Career  Beeken was educated at Heilig-Grafinstituut, Sint- Truiden, Flanders. After leaving Heilig-Grafinstituut in 1979 she entered K.U.Leuven to read Dutch and German linguistics and literature. Reading Dutch linguistics and general linguistics Beeken completed her master's degree in 1983 receiving a magna cum laude for her thesis 'Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar: theorie en praktijk'. Having completed her masters, Beeken was approached to work at K.U.Leuven Department of Linguistics as a research assistant. From 1985 to 1993 Beeken worked as a member of academic staff with Guido Geerts while completing her Doctor of Philosophy under the supervision of Flip G Droste publishing 'Spiegelstructuur en variabiliteit: pre- en postposities in het Nederlands' receiving a summa cum laude and two awards, the Award of the Royal Academy for Dutch Linguistics and Literature, 1993, Ghent, (Koninklijke Academie voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde) and the L.K. Engels Award for theoretical linguistics, 1993, Leuven. From 1993, as a K.U.Leuven Research Fellow in Linguistics, Beeken developed a number of software tools and packages for Dutch: CSE (computer-supported education), syntactic parsing (Comenius, Butler, Cogito) for grammar and writing instruction/computational linguistics (CONST) and for spelling (DT-manie). During this period of research Beeken also worked on the development of electronic dictionaries: Beknopte ABN-gids (Concise guide to Standard Dutch) with Dirk Geeraerts and Dirk Speelman. From 1993‚Äì1996 Beeken continued her research with the NFWO project, 'De lexicale thesaurus als begin- en eindpunt van de interactie tussen lexicologische theorie en lexicografische toepassing' (The lexical thesaurus as starting and finishing point of the interaction between lexicological theory and lexicographic application) From 1997‚Äì1999 Beeken was employed by the Dutch Language Union (Taalunie) to work on the revision of the Groene Boekje 1995 (Green Booklet 1995) towards the creation of the 2005 Groene Boekje. She also was the project manager of the Dutch HLT Agency / TST-Centrale from 2004 to 2007. From 2007 to 2014 Jeannine Beeken was director of the Institute for Dutch Lexicology.  Contribution to Dutch linguistics  Beeken's first major contribution to Dutch linguistics was the design and construction of the first analytical software for Dutch syntax. Her work continued to impact on the Dutch language with her development of Dutch spelling algorithms concerning the problems of DT in the 1990s and her writing of the revised Dutch spelling rules in 2005 Groene Boekje. Beeken's PhD broke new Dutch linguistic grounds when she identified and named 3 additional objects; Directional (DIR), Directional-Locational (DIL) and Temporal (TP), publishing 'Spiegelstructuur en variabiliteit' (Mirror structure and variability: prepositions and postpositions in Dutch) in 1993. Beeken has courted controversy with her opposition to traditional dictionary making, arguing for modern theoretical and computational adaptations and solutions to lexicological and lexicographical problems and challenges.  Publications  Throughout Beeken's career, her publications have covered a breadth of linguistic areas. She was also interested in solutions for academic unemployment. In 1994 she contributed briefly to Roger Blanpain book ‚ÄòThe nine zeros of learning Flanders. From repetitive to creative jobs‚Äô, and in 1995 she addressed the feminisation of job titles for the Flemish social-economic council (Sociaal-Economische Raad van Vlaanderen) and the Ministries in Flanders and the Netherlands. More recently her published work has focused on lexicology, computational lexicography, digitised language resources and spelling, including her contribution to ‚ÄòHebrew and Yiddish words in Dutch‚Äô, and her involvement in the Dutch Medical Journal, publishing ‚ÄòThe successful disclosure of a medical journal through a medical lexicon‚Äô.
