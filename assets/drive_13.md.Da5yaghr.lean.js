She was the wife of Zhao Ang, an official who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty and was aligned with the faction that would later become the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. She is known as the heroic woman for her morally upright character and for fighting alongside her family and the Wei Kingdom in various conflicts with the warlord Ma Chao in the 210s. Background Wang Yi's exact origins are not recorded in history. All that is known of her heritage was that her family name was \\"Wang\\", and that she married Zhao Ang, an official who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty.(謐又載趙昂妻曰：趙昂妻異者，故益州刺史天水趙偉璋妻，王氏女也。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. She bore Zhao Ang three sons and a daughter. As Liang Shuang's captive When Zhao Ang was serving as the Prefect of Qiangdao County (羌道縣; around present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), he left his family in Xi District (西鄉) of the county. Around the time, Liang Shuang (梁雙) started a revolt in the county and occupied Xi District. Wang Yi's two sons were killed during the conflict, leaving behind Wang Yi and her six-year-old daughter, Zhao Ying (趙英). When Wang Yi saw that her two sons had died, she feared that Liang Shuang would violate her, so she attempted to slit her throat with a sword. However, she gave up when she saw her daughter and she said: \\"If I killed myself and abandoned you, who will take care of you? I heard that people will cover their noses if someone wore unclean clothing – even if the person was Xi Shi. Besides, my looks aren't even comparable to Xi Shi's.\\" She then rubbed dirt and excrement on her clothes, and fasted to make herself become thin. This lasted for about a year.(昂為羌道令，留異在西。會同郡梁雙反，攻破西城，害異兩男。異女英，年六歲，獨與異在城中。異見兩男已死，又恐為雙所侵，引刀欲自刎，顧英而歎曰：「身死爾棄，當誰恃哉！吾聞西施蒙不絜之服，則人掩鼻，況我貌非西施乎？」乃以溷糞涅麻而被之，尠食瘠形，自春至冬。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. Wang Yi was spared from disaster when Liang Shuang reconciled with the authorities in Qiangdao County. Zhao Ang sent his men to fetch his wife and daughter. When they were about 30 li away from their destination, Wang Yi suddenly stopped and told Zhao Ying: \\"I'd have never left that place if your father didn't send someone to fetch us. Whenever I read the stories of Lady Jiang and Lady Bo, I feel inspired by their devotions and convictions. However, I am still alive after having gone through similar a experience, so wouldn't I feel ashamed when I face those ladies after I die? I didn't choose death then because of you. Now, since we are close to safety and within the protection of the authorities, I can leave you and die.\\" Having said that, she attempted suicide by consuming poison but luckily for her, an antidote was available, so she received medical treatment quickly and survived.(雙與州郡和，異竟以是免難。昂遣吏迎之，未至三十里，止謂英曰：「婦人無符信保傅，則不出房闈。昭姜沈流，伯姬待燒，每讀其傳，心壯其節。今吾遭亂不能死，將何以復見諸姑？所以偷生不死，惟憐汝耳。今官舍已近，吾去汝死矣。」遂飲毒藥而絕。時適有解毒藥良湯，撅口灌之，良乆迺蘇。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. Siege of Jicheng Sometime during the Jian'an era (196–220) of the reign of Emperor Xian, Zhao Ang was reassigned to be an Army Adviser (參軍事) and relocated to Ji County (兾縣; present-day Gangu County, Gansu).(建安中，昂轉參軍事，徙居兾。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. In 211, the warlord Ma Chao started a rebellion against Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government, but was defeated along with his allies by Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Tong Pass. In the following two or three years after the battle, Ma Chao constantly raided the lands in Liang Province (covering roughly present-day Gansu and Ningxia) and attacked the cities in the area. When Ma Chao attacked Ji County, Wang Yi donned a battledress, armed herself with a bow and arrows, and assisted Zhao Ang in defending the city from Ma Chao's forces. She also handed out her personal accessories as rewards to the soldiers and substantially raised the defenders' morale.(會馬超攻兾，異躬著布韝，佐昂守備，又悉脫所佩環、黼黻以賞戰士。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. However, as Ma Chao pressed on the attack, the city gradually ran short of supplies and its defenders and civilian population began to suffer from hunger. Zhao Ang's superior, Wei Kang, the governor of Liang Province, took pity on the plight of the people and planned to start peace talks with Ma Chao. Zhao Ang tried to dissuade Wei Kang from doing so but was ignored. Zhao Ang returned home and told his wife about it. Wang Yi replied: \\"A ruler has advisers to provide him counsel; officials also have the right to disregard the command hierarchy and take matters into their own hands when the situation calls for it. There's nothing wrong with you being dictatorial under the current circumstances. Who knows whether reinforcements will arrive soon? We should encourage all the troops to perform their duties to the utmost and lay down their lives if necessary. We must never give in to the rebels' demands.\\" However, by the time Zhao Ang went back to see Wei Kang, the latter had already concluded his negotiations with Ma Chao, with both sides agreeing to end the conflict.(及超攻急，城中饑困，刺史韋康素仁，愍吏民傷殘，欲與超和。昂諫不聽，歸以語異，異曰：「君有爭臣，大夫有專利之義；專不為非也。焉知救兵不到關隴哉？當共勉卒高勳，全節致死，不可從也。」比昂還，康與超和。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. Living under Ma Chao's control Ma Chao broke his word later – he killed Wei Kang, captured Zhao Ang, and kept Zhao Ang and Wang Yi's son, Zhao Yue (趙月), as a hostage in Nanzheng County. He hoped that Zhao Ang would comply with his demands and serve him, but was uncertain about Zhao Ang's intentions. Ma Chao's wife, Lady Yang (楊氏), heard of Wang Yi's reputation, so she hosted a feast and invited Wang Yi to attend. Wang Yi planned to make use of that opportunity to help her husband gain Ma Chao's trust and wait for a chance to take revenge. She told Lady Yang: \\"In the past, Guan Zhong became the chancellor of Qi and made great achievements; You Yu entered Qin and played an important role in Duke Mu's rise to power. Now that Ji County has just been pacified, we need men of talent to govern and maintain the city. Only in this way can Liang Province's armies compete with those in the Central Plains. As such, it's imperative that talented people be employed and their abilities put to good use.\\" Lady Yang was very impressed with Wang Yi and thought that Wang Yi was loyal to her husband's faction. She gradually became close to Wang Yi, and Zhao Ang began to gain Ma Chao's trust. Zhao Ang was able to survive under Ma Chao's control because of his wife's efforts.(超遂背約害康，又劫昂，質其嫡子月於南鄭。欲要昂以為己用，然心未甚信。超妻楊聞異節行，請與讌終日。異欲信昂於超以濟其謀，謂楊曰：「昔管仲入齊，立九合之功；由余適秦，穆公成霸。方今社稷初定，治亂在於得人，涼州士馬，迺可與中夏爭鋒，不可不詳也。」楊深感之，以為忠於己，遂與異重相接結。昂所以得信於超，全功免禍者，異之力也。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. Driving Ma Chao out of Liang Province When Zhao Ang secretly plotted with Yang Fu and others to drive Ma Chao out of Liang Province, he conveyed his worries about Zhao Yue – who was still held hostage by Ma Chao – to Wang Yi. However, Wang Yi sternly replied: \\"Loyalty and righteousness are the core virtues a person should possess. Now, we are going to erase our earlier humiliation. We might end up sacrificing our lives and this isn't a cause for concern, so does the loss of our son still mean anything? Xiang Tuo and Yan Hui left their good names in history because they valued righteousness.\\" Zhao Ang agreed with his wife.(及昂與楊阜等結謀討超，告異曰：「吾謀如是，事必萬全，當柰月何？」異厲聲應曰：「忠義立於身，雪君父之大恥，喪元不足為重，況一子哉？夫項託、顏淵，豈復百年，貴義存耳。」昂曰：「善。」) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. The plot turned out successful. They managed to lure Ma Chao out of Ji County to suppress a revolt in Lu County, and then block him from entering Ji County again when he returned to the city after failing to defeat the rebels. Ma Chao fled to Hanzhong Commandery, borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu, and returned to attack Liang Province. Zhao Ang and Wang Yi had moved to Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) by then. Ma Chao's army besieged Zhao Ang's forces at Mount Qi for about 30 days until reinforcements led by Cao Cao's generals Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He arrived and lifted the siege. After his defeat, Ma Chao went to Nanzheng County and killed Zhao Yue. Throughout the whole period of time from the siege at Ji County to the battle at Mount Qi, Zhao Ang had launched nine attacks on Ma Chao and Wang Yi participated in all of them.(遂共閉門逐超，超奔漢中，從張魯得兵還。異復與昂保祁山，為超所圍，三十日救兵到，乃解。超卒殺異子月。凡自兾城之難，至于祁山，昂出九奇，異輒參焉。) Lie Nü Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 25. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Wang Yi briefly appears in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which she is referred to as Lady Wang (王氏). The narrative depicts Zhao Ang and Wang Yi's son, Zhao Yue, as a Major-General (裨將) in Ma Chao's army.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 64. After Ma Chao murders Wei Kang, Zhao Ang wants to avenge his superior, but he hesitates because his son is with Ma Chao, so he consults his wife. Lady Wang's response to her husband is similar to the one documented in the Lie Nü Zhuan, but the last sentence about Xiang Tuo and Yan Hui has been changed to: \\"If you do not carry out your plan because of our son, I will die first.\\" Ma Chao feels so angry at Zhao Ang's betrayal that he kills Zhao Yue and seeks revenge for his losses by massacring several civilians in the area. Lady Wang survives because she is with her husband all that while.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 64.

He was designated Minister of Agriculture by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in 2011, serving in the post until 2013. Life and times Yauhar was born in General Roca, Río Negro, in 1960. His family were cattle ranchers in rural Los Menucos, though he himself would spend much of his life in Trelew, in neighboring Chubut Province. He entered politics as a member of the Justicialist Party, and would later work with Trelew-area Congressman Mario das Neves. Das Neves appointed Yauhar to the powerful Ministry of Coordination upon taking office as Governor of Chubut in 2003, and Yauhar played key roles in advancing the governor's main initiatives. These included the renegotiation of royalties from the province's lucrative oil and gas sector, as well as the establishment of the Chubut Neighborhood Projection party, whose endorsement of das Neves' 2007 reelection campaign gave the governor an absolute majority in the Provincial Legislature. Yauhar's rapport with Das Neves deteriorated early in his second term, however. He was opposed to das Neves' break with Kirchnerism (with whose support the governor had been reelected), and in turn, earned the enmity of the governor's son, Pablo das Neves. Yauhar resigned in September, and was offered a Federal Government post as Coordinator of Public Enterprises for Public Works Minister Julio de Vido. He worked well with de Vido, and with the latter's support was appointed Secretary of Fisheries in November. The largely autonomous Fisheries Secretariat became a part of the newly established Ministry of Agriculture in 2009. The fishing sector in Argentina had been declining for years as a result of overexploitation and high discard rates; the important Argentine hake catch in particular had declined by around 70% since the mid-1990s. Yauhar offered the commercial fishing lobby the lifting of a long-standing regulation requiring the use of special fishing nets designed to free juvenile hake, citing widespread non- compliance. This concession was granted in return for stricter catch share quotas and government monitoring of fishing vessels. The difficulty of monitoring vessel movements along the vast Argentine Sea made implementation of this latter policy unfeasible, however, and by April 2010, Yauhar admitted the failure of this new policy from the point of view of conservation; the lifting of special net requirement proved a boon to the hake fishing industry, however, which saw its catch double to around 800,000 tons in the interim. The Director of the Greenpeace Oceans Campaign, Milko Schvartzman, cited lax enforcement of the catch quotas as another factor. Yauhar ran for mayor of his adopted city, Trelew, in his splinter New Peronist Space ticket in March 2011, but was defeated by the rival Peronist candidate endorsed by Governor das Neves, Máximo Pérez Catán. Following the election in October of Agriculture Minister Julián Domínguez to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, Yauhar was designated to the post by President Cristina Kirchner. He was widely expected to continue his predecessor's policy of rapprochement with the agrarian sector, whose relationship with the federal government had suffered in the wake of a 2008 dispute over a proposed hike in export taxes.

He was also part of CIS member countries Interparliamentary Assembly, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Friendship Group with the Swiss Confederation, the Friendship Group with the Hellenic Republic and the Friendship Group with the Hungarian Republic.http://www.parlament.md/LastructuredeParlament/Deputies/tabid/87/Id/317/Default.aspx Members of the Parliament  Position on foreign relations  Plahotniuc stated in an interview for the Moldovan news website Deschide.md that \\"the Republic of Moldova will not cancel or renegotiate the Association Agreement with the EU, and will not sign an Agreement with the Euro-Asiatic Union\\", qualifying the statements made by Igor Dodon in Moscow as purely electioneering rhetoric. Regarding president Igor Dodon's official visit to Moscow, Plahotniuc has committed the Democratic Party to stand firmly for continuing Moldova's commitment to the European Union and maintains that the Moldova – EU relation must stay pivotal for the foreign policy. On 7 January 2017 Plahotniuc addressed a message to the U.S. president-elect Donald Trump; the statement reflects the party leader's vision: ″Moldova is willing to become a bridge between East and West, not a battleground for the world powers″. As chairman of the Democratic Party of Moldova, Plahotniuc has stood against the long-looming prospect of a Russian-annexed Moldova. The Democratic Party of Moldova has repeatedly reaffirmed its devotion to Western doctrines such as democracy. During his presidency of the Democratic Party, Plahotniuc has attended many meetings with officials from the US and Europe. One of his achievements in that direction was the submission of pro-Moldovan resolutions in the House of Representatives of the US Congress by Congressmen David Price and Pete Olson after having several meetings with them. The resolution reiterated the US support for the territorial integrity of Moldova and for the resolution of the Transnistria conflict, as well as to enhance cooperation between Moldova and the US.  Position on Russian interference in Moldova  Plahotniuc has declared many times that one of his main goals is to stop Russian interference in Moldova, which had spread to all spheres of Moldovan economy such as media, banking system, insurance, NGOs and political organisations. To minimize Russian influence over the region, Plahotniuc together with the government coalition pioneered many reforms and laws such as anti-propaganda law, financial reforms based on EU directives and NGO's reform. Russia, in response to laws that aimed to reduce its influence over the regions, started to frame Moldovan officials, including Plahotniuc with bogus legal cases, ratcheting up a long-running diplomatic row between the two countries. According to Moldovan officials, these actions were due to ongoing investigations into the case known locally as the \\"Russian Laundromat\\". Plahotniuc declared that Russia's behavior \\"toward my colleagues and me is an explicit act of blackmail and political harassment.. abusive and illegal behavior, which will not change our commitment to the democratic and European development of Moldova. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, on 22 February 2019, accused Vladimir Plahotniuc of money laundering. According to Plahotniuc's own political party, the Democratic Party, \\"This was an abusive interference from the Russian Federation side into the elections in the Republic of Moldova. And this so-called case was opened by Russians against the DP's leader, just two days before the parliamentary elections in Moldova, which is clearly an abuse from the Russian Federation side by which they try to influence the election outcomes in Moldova\\". On 26 June 2019, two days after Vlad Plahotniuc's resignation from the position of the PDM chairperson, he was arraignment, in his absence, in the Russian Federation for organizing the criminal drug trafficking network in particularly large proportions in North Africa, through the European Union, to CIS countries, including the Russian Federation. The former PD leader wrote that these are some of the \\"threats\\" addressed to him and his family: \\"Russian Federation has several criminal cases against me, I am not aware of their exact count. I have learned about each of them from press. They would appear either in the times of elections or when the Republic of Moldova, governed by Democratic Party, made decisions that were not to Moscow's liking. All these cases are fantasies and attempts to involve my name in cases that have absolutely nothing to do with me. It is precisely for reasons of political harassment that Interpol rejected tens of Russia's attempt to limit my freedom of movement abusively.\\" According to the International report International Security and Estonia 2020, published by the Estonian secret services, at the end of 2017, the FSB Directorate for Support Program decided to carry out an influence operation against Vlad Plahotniuc, The purpose of the influence operation was to spread information on Plahotniuc's criminal image and his alleged opposition to European integration, which would discourage the West from cooperating with Plahotniuc. The Kremlin was concerned about Plahotniuc's influence as such, and not about the mechanisms and approaches he was implementing. His influence prevented Russia from achieving its own goals in Moldova and, consequently, as a precondition for the expansion of Russian influence.  Businessman  Plahotniuc ran companies in the following domains: oil,Timpul.md, Petrom-Moldova anunță reutilarea benzinăriilor la cele mai înalte standarde ale UE, 13 octombrie 2010 financial and banking, hotel business, media and real estate.Members of the Parliament In August 2010, the Ukrainian business magazine \\"Delo\\" estimated Plahotniuc's wealth to 300 million dollars. Money originated from both \\"Victoriabank\\" and \\"Petrom Moldova\\" activity, where he acted as Deputy chairman of the board of directors and then general director. Plahotniuc acted as the Chairman of Victoriabank, one of the leading banks in Moldova until January 2011. In 2004–2007 Plahotniuc was the unofficial business partner with Viorel and Victor Țopa, together with whom he gained control over bank Victoriabank and Prime TV channel. In September 2010, Victor and Viorel Țopa addressed a memorandum to a number of national and international institutions (17), accusing Plahotniuc of \\"raider attacks\\" of July–August 2011 on a number of 4 banks and ASITO assurance company.(doc) Victor și Viorel Țopa descriu schema RAIDER de la ASITO, VB și BEMNoi dezvăluiri despre Mafia din RM The ex-president of Victoriabank, Victor Țurcan, affirmed later in an interview that the real crooks in Victoriabank case are Victor and Viorel Țopa, and they manipulate the public opinion through false statements.Viorel și Victor Țopa sunt niște bandiți, care acum 4 ani, prin escrocherie ș-au însușit 14% din acțiunile VictoriaBank Later, by one criminal file for each of Țopa was initiated, and they have fled to Germany, accusing Plahotniuc on political persecution.Plahotniuc: Judecătoria din Amsterdam a confirmat că acuzațiile lui Țopa în legătură cu așa-zisul „atac raider\\" de la Victoriabank sunt neîntemeiate On 8 March 2017 Plahotniuc published on his Facebook page the Amsterdam Court's decision where is confirmed that Țopa's accusations about the \\"raider attack\\" from Victoriabank are unfounded.

In January 1827, Edwards sailed on the convict ship Asia, from Deptford to Sydney, commanding a detachment of 1 sergeant, I corporal and 16 soldiers as guards of the convicts. In October of the same year, Edwards was promoted to Lieutenant, before the ship docked in Sydney in March 1828. In October 1828, Edwards was posted to the Moreton Bay penal settlement. Following the death of Captain Patrick Logan (the Moreton Bay Commandant) Edwards took over the responsibility of the Department of Works at Moreton Bay from the in-coming Commandant James Clunie. It was Edwards who made the official report of Logan's death to his Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel Allan in Sydney. The manuscript copy of this letter is contained in Patrick Logan's letterbook, and is held at the State Library of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

He was the head coach for the University of Oregon from 2013 to 2016 before getting fired after a 4–8 record in the 2016 season. He most recently served as the offensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears from 2018 to 2019. Playing career Recruited out of Marshfield High School in Coos Bay, Oregon, Helfrich was offered an opportunity to walk on at the University of Oregon; however, he decided to attend Southern Oregon instead, where he was the starting quarterback from 1992 to 1995 and was a NAIA All-American. Helfrich saw his most successful season in 1993 as he set school records for passing yards, touchdowns, and total offense. In the winter and spring of 1997, he played quarterback professionally, while also serving as assistant offensive coordinator in Europe for the Vienna Austria Vikings. Coaching career Early coaching years Initially starting graduate school with his sights set on becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Helfrich's coaching career ignited at Oregon as a graduate assistant working closely under then offensive coordinator, Dirk Koetter. When Koetter was hired as head coach at Boise State in 1998, the 24-year-old Helfrich went with him as the quarterbacks coach. At Boise State Helfrich coached Broncos quarterback Bart Hendricks. Under Helfrich's development, Hendricks won Big West Conference Player of the Year in 1999 and 2000 and guided the Broncos to the fourth best passing offense in the nation in 2000. Helfrich followed Koetter to Arizona State when Koetter became the head coach of the Sun Devils. Under the coaching of Helfrich, Andrew Walter broke nearly every Arizona State passing record and John Elway's Pac-10 touchdown record. Walter would go on to be drafted in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Dirk Koetter would later praise Helfrich for his coaching abilities, \\"He can do it all in his head. He doesn't have to draw the pictures on the board (…) not many people can do that. He sees the game through the quarterback's eyes. We all have ideas, but if your quarterback can't execute those ideas, they are lines on a paper. Mark is as smart a football guy as I know.\\" In 2006, Helfrich joined the Colorado staff to become the youngest offensive coordinator in college football on the BCS level at the age of 32. His three seasons at Colorado were a challenge as he developed the Buffaloes dismal offense into a modest improvement. After the 2006 season, Mike Bellotti contacted Helfrich about possibly joining Oregon, but Helfrich declined to leave Colorado after only one season; Chip Kelly was hired instead. Two years later, Helfrich was named Oregon's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, replacing Chip Kelly after he was promoted to head coach. Oregon =Offensive coordinator (2009–2012)= During Helfrich's four seasons as Oregon's offensive coordinator the offense ranked highly nationally in several offensive categories and became well known for their extremely fast-paced offense built around speed. Although Chip Kelly called the plays on offense, Helfrich still played an integral role in Oregon's system. He had a large amount of involvement in the game planning, scripting, and coaching on a weekly basis while having a high amount of input in what plays are called and why they are called. Kelly spoke highly of his protégé, \\"He's really, really smart and has great people skills. Sometimes, smart people can't get their point across, but he's a great communicator. When I hire people, I want to hire very, very smart people. I wanted somebody who came from a different system. I didn't want a yes-man. I wanted someone who would bring new ideas to our system.\\" With Helfrich coordinating under Chip Kelly, the Ducks played in four straight BCS bowls from 2009 to 2012, won three straight Pac-12 Conference championships, and continuously energized college football with one of the nation's best offenses in scoring, rushing, and total offense in each of those four seasons. As offensive coordinator during the Kelly era, the offense averaged 44.7 points per game with an average of 283.4 rushing yards and an average of 500.7 yards of total offense. Oregon's offense in 2012 was hailed as its best ever as they averaged 49.6 points per game with an average of 537.4 yards of total offense with 315.2 of those yards per game from rushing. As quarterbacks coach, Helfrich was instrumental in the development of the quarterbacks that played under his tutelage at Oregon. In 2009, Jeremiah Masoli's leadership improved as he led Oregon to the 2010 Rose Bowl. The following season sophomore Darron Thomas guided an undefeated Oregon team to the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. Thomas finished his career 23–3 as a starter with a school-record 66 touchdown passes and led the Ducks to a 45–38 victory over #10 Wisconsin in the 2012 Rose Bowl. The 2012 season showcased Marcus Mariota as the first freshman to start a season opener for the Ducks in 22 seasons. He led the Ducks to a 12–1 record while being named All-Pac-12 Conference First Team, Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year, and winning the 2013 Fiesta Bowl Offensive MVP Award as he guided the Ducks to a 35–17 victory over #5 Kansas State. Helfrich was recognized for his impact on the Ducks' offensive success as he was named by FootballScoop as its National Quarterbacks Coach of the Year in 2010 and 2012, in addition to being one of three finalists as its national offensive coordinator of the year honor. Rumors of Chip Kelly's departure from college football for the NFL were constant during his tenure as Oregon's coach. Kelly refused to accept the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offer as head coach weeks after the 2012 Rose Bowl victory because he couldn't get a promise from Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens assuring him that Helfrich would be his successor. When Kelly began to interview for numerous NFL head coaching positions after Oregon's 2013 Fiesta Bowl victory, it was rumored that a succession plan was put into place for Helfrich to be the next head coach of the Ducks if Kelly were to ever leave. On January 16, 2013, Kelly left Oregon to become the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. =Head coach (2013–2016)= On January 20, 2013, Helfrich accepted the offer from the University of Oregon to become the head coach of the Ducks. As the successor to Chip Kelly, Helfrich's promotion continued an Oregon tradition that would later end when Helfrich was fired after the 2016 season. He was the third consecutive Oregon offensive coordinator promoted to head coach. Before Kelly replaced Mike Bellotti in 2009, Bellotti succeeded Rich Brooks in 1995. Since Brooks' hire in 1977, Helfrich was just the fourth head coach at Oregon. The first Oregon native to become head coach of the Ducks since 1942, Helfrich described coaching at the University of Oregon as being the pinnacle of his career. 2013 season In his first season as head coach, Helfrich had the task of trying to emerge from the shadow of Chip Kelly. He departed from his predecessor's \\"blur\\" offense and implemented a more balanced attack that included a skilled passing game, resulting in an efficient offense that continued to score points and break offensive records. Despite finishing with an 11–2 record and a top- ten final season ranking, Helfrich's first season leading the Ducks was considered a letdown. Losses to #6 Stanford and unranked Arizona (Oregon's first loss to an unranked opponent since 2008) kept the Ducks from reaching a fifth consecutive BCS Bowl berth. Helfrich did however lead his team to a victory over Texas in the 2013 Alamo Bowl, dominating the Longhorns, 30–7, in Mack Brown's final game as head coach for Texas. 2014 season In Helfrich's second season, the Ducks won a school-record 13 games and reached the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship. Quarterback Marcus Mariota became the first Oregon player to win the Heisman Trophy. The season began with Oregon defeating No. 7 Michigan State, 46–27, ending the defending Big Ten and Rose Bowl-champion Spartans 11-game winning streak. After defeating No. 8 Arizona, 51–13, in the 2014 Pac-12 Football Championship Game, the Ducks played in the inaugural College Football Playoff, where they defeated the No. 3 Florida State Seminoles, 59–20, in the Playoff Semifinal Rose Bowl Game and ended the defending national champions 29-game winning streak. Oregon advanced to the College Football Championship Game against the Ohio State Buckeyes and lost, 42–20. The Ducks finished the season with an overall 13–2 record and the No. 2 ranking in the final polls for the third time in program history. It was announced on February 9, 2015, that Helfrich had signed a five-year contract extension worth $17.5 million. 2015 season Helfrich's third season began and ended with historic losses. The Ducks early-season 42-point loss to Utah came with a total of 62 points allowed, the most points ever given up by the Ducks at home in Autzen Stadium. After a 3–3 start, Oregon fell out of the top 25 poll rankings for the first time since 2009 and started the season with two losses in September for the first time in 11 years. Despite the rough start, Helfrich's team bounced back to win six straight games. Following back-to-back victories over #7 Stanford and #22 USC, the Ducks were selected to play No. 11 TCU in the Alamo Bowl. The Ducks dominated TCU in the first half of the Alamo Bowl by scoring at will on consecutive drives and led 31–0 at halftime. However, Oregon's offense and defense collapsed in the second half after losing starting quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. to a head injury. TCU scored on every second-half possession and rallied for the biggest comeback in college football bowl game history to beat Oregon, 47–41, in triple overtime. For the first time since 2007 the Ducks failed to win 10 games and finished with a 9–4 overall record. Following the Alamo Bowl loss, Helfrich demoted defensive coordinator Don Pellum to linebackers coach after Oregon's defense regressed to finish last in the Pac-12 in total defense and ranked 93rd or worse nationally in eight defensive categories. 2016 season Prior to the season, Helfrich made multiple adjustments to his coaching staff. After Scott Frost resigned as offensive coordinator in order to become the head coach at UCF in early December 2015, Helfrich promoted wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator Matt Lubick to offensive coordinator in early January 2016. Following the Alamo Bowl loss, Don Pellum was demoted to linebackers coach, replacing Erik Chinander, who left to become the defensive coordinator for Frost at UCF. In mid-January 2016, David Yost was hired as Oregon's passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach.210623899 Replacing Pellum as defensive coordinator was former Michigan head football coach Brady Hoke, who was hired on January 16. Helfrich and Oregon agreed to part ways on November 29, 2016 following a 4–8 season, Oregon's worst record in 25 years and first losing season since 2004. It also saw the first non-sellout crowds at Autzen Stadium since 2002. Chicago Bears On January 12, 2018, Helfrich was hired by the Chicago Bears to serve as the offensive coordinator. Although Helfrich was not the play-caller, the Bears ended the 2019 season with the 29th-ranked offense and an 8–8 record. He was fired two days after the season. Broadcasting career After departing from Oregon, Helfrich spent the 2017 season as an analyst for Fox Sports. He joined Fox Sports again in 2020 after his termination from the Bears coaching staff.

It lives in the Red Sea, and across the Indian Ocean as far east as the Philippines. It is red or pink, up to long, with enlarged third pereiopods. Originally described in the genus Engystenopus, it is now placed in the monotypic genus Juxtastenopus, in the family Stenopodidae. Description Juxtastenopus grows to a total body length of long (carapace length: ). In life, the animals are red or pinkish, but with white tips to the chelae (claws) on the enlarged third pereiopods (walking legs). Females are reproductive at lengths around , and carry between 27 and 132 eggs, each initially in diameter. Distribution Most specimens of J. spinulatus have been collected from the Red Sea at depths of , where the water is warm. That warm water mass drops to a depth of on passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait into the Gulf of Aden, and J. spinulatus has also been collected at a depth of in the Gulf of Aden. It also occurs in the Indian Ocean, and as far east as Hong Kong and the Philippines, but occurs in much shallower water than in the Red Sea. Taxonomy The earliest discovered specimens of J. spinulatus were assigned by Heinrich Balss to the species Stenopus spinosus. Its first description as a separate species was the type description by Lipke Holthuis in 1946, where it was given the name Engystenopus spinulatus. This was based on a single damaged holotype male, collected in the Lobetoli Strait, east of Flores, Indonesia, and the placement in the genus Engystenopus was considered questionable. The most distinctive characteristics of Engystenopus are characters of the third pereiopod, which was lacking from all the early specimens. When specimens with intact third pereiopods became available, Joseph Goy realised that \\"E. spinulatus\\" did not belong in the same genus as E. palmipes (the only other species of Engystenopus), and erected a new genus, Juxtastenopus, to hold it. The two genera are now placed in different families, although both names carry the meaning \\"close to Stenopus\\"; Engystenopus is one of seven extant genera in the family Spongicolidae, while Juxtastenopus is one of four extant genera in the family Stenopodidae.

Biography Francis Grant was the elder son of Archibald Grant of Ballintomb, Morayshire, a descendant of James Grant, 3rd Laird of Freuchie, by his wife Christian, daughter of Patrick Nairne of Cromdale, was born at Ballintomb in 1658. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and afterwards at Leiden University where he was a favourite pupil of the learned civilian Johannes Voet. Soon after his return to Scotland Grant took a prominent part in the discussions on the constitutional questions arising out of the revolution. Some of the older lawyers insisted on the inability of the convention of estates to make any disposition of the crown. Grant strongly opposed this notion, and published a treatise arguing strongly for the power of the estates to establish a new succession. Grant was admitted an advocate on 29 January 1691, and, owing to the reputation which he had made by this treatise, quickly acquired a large practice. In the exercise of his profession and Grant was created a Baronet of Monymusk, Aberdeen in the baronetage of Nova Scotia with remainder to his heirs male by patent dated 7 December 1705. A few years later he was appointed a Lord Ordinary of the Court of Session in the place of James Murray, Lord Philiphaugh, and took his seat on the bench on 10 June 1709 as Lord Cullen, his title being derived from the name of his paternal estate in Banffshire, which had been ratified to him in 1698, Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, x. 160-1. but which he afterwards sold. In 1713 he purchased the estate of Monymusk in Aberdeenshire, which in 1890 was still the residence of his family, from Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo. On 17 May 1720 he obtained a grant of supporters and an addition to his coat-of-arms, at the same time taking as one of his mottoes the words Jehovah Jireh, the only instance in Scottish heraldry of a Hebrew motto. He died at Edinburgh on 23 March 1726, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard on 26 March.There is a large picture at Monymusk representing Cullen and his family, painted by the Scottish painter John Smibert around 1718. Cullen's portrait has been engraved by S. Taylor .

The idea is that if one's body fat is low, then muscle tissue is more visible. Body builders typically use the ripping process once a year. The process involves a change in diet to reduce fat, and exercise to maintain muscle mass. Body builders often don't look forward to ripping, as it means giving up food and drink they enjoy. It also may mean an increase or decrease in particular training routines. The ripping stage takes as long as a person wishes. However, pushing body fat to low levels can be dangerous, so body builders don't usually do it year round. Body builders typically average around 12–16 weeks of ripping per year.  Dieting and cardiovascular exercise While cutting, a person must consume a diet that is at a deficit from their maintenance calories by 300-500 calories, but still eat 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight to maintain or even gain strength. Cardio burning sessions of 300-500 calories may help some people. Too much cardiovascular exercise can directly affect muscle tissue if it is used excessively and without eating the correct food. The reason for this is because if the human body doesn't have sufficient energy stored in the form of glucose, then it will begin using energy from other sources, e.g. fats or muscles. For example, eating a little extra carbohydrates (which eventually transforms into glucose) will help the body to divert away from muscle tissue and extract energy from the glucose supplies. The time in which one eats is an important factor in ripping where cardiovascular training is concerned. Particular foods take a certain amount of time to extract the glucose in the digestive system. This means that there is limited amount of time to use the glucose before it gets stored as fat. Also there is a certain amount of time after cardiovascular exercise is being performed when the body's energy source runs out. This is when the process of muscle breakdown also comes into play.  Performance enhancers and supplements  Ripping is considered a slow and sometimes painful process due to diet and exercise. A body builder will have to sacrifice many of their pleasures in life, in addition to increasing their workout intensity. But the goals in which they wish to achieve are far from easy, and it is known that some body builders may use performance-enhancing drugs or anabolic steroids to assist them along the way. There are many types of performance enhancers that can help with the loss of fat and the maintenance of muscle tissue. Of course, it is extremely unlikely that any performance enhancers or steroids will have an effect unless the person taking them is taking part in exercise or a specific diet plan. It is very likely that body builders will, at some stage, use supplements to help them rip up. When taking part in such a low carbohydrate, low sugar diet, it can affect energy levels in addition to changing one's mood. A person with such a diet and low energy levels may choose to take supplements that contain caffeine, which increases alertness and motivation. Or they may decide to take a supplement with nitric oxide in it, therefore expanding blood vessels and increasing blood flow, thus increasing oxygen levels around the body.  Main diet principles  Supplements, performance enhancers, or anabolic steroids may assist a body builder or athlete towards goals—but are not necessary for ripping or fat loss. The main concerns in ripping are diet and exercise. Not just what to eat, but also when to eat it is important. Fat and sugar should be completely avoided, and carbohydrates and salt kept at a minimum. Protein is always high during any stage of body building, because of its involvement in muscle repair and maintenance. Someone ripping usually eats carbohydrates in the morning with breakfast, and in small portions with other meals. It is common to have a protein shake after a workout to help with muscle damage from the workout. Protein shakes consumed during ripping usually contain zero or very little carbohydrates. Meals are typically a piece of meat or fish with vegetables. Include carbohydrates are usually low-fat foods like potato, rice, or pasta—and fruits and vegetables, often in smoothie (blended) form.  After ripping  After the ripping stage, the person resumes their normal diet and training routine. They may decrease cardiovascular exercise change their supplements regimen. Some body builders lose 20 or more pounds at the peak of the ripping period. They gain it back again, or even come to exceed their pre- ripping weight—but strive to regain weight as muscle rather than fat.

Two years later, he was a starter at halfback in four games (including the Kalamazoo and Case games) for the 1905 team. During the 1905 season, a controversy developed as to Dunlap's eligibility. He had participated in athletics at Lenox College, and some questioned whether he had a remaining fourth year of eligibility. A letter was received from the person in charge of athletics at Iowa indicating that the Association of Colleges in Iowa did not consider Lenox to be a college.

The series was created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. The series centers around the Enchanted Forest and Storybrooke, and the Evil Queen's (Lana Parrilla) plot to destroy everyone's happiness so she can be the only one with a happy ending. Once Upon a Times first season received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised its cast, visuals, and twists on fairy tales, though some criticized its uneven tone. The pilot episode was watched by 12.93 million viewers and achieved an adult 18-49 rating/share of 4.0/10. Those numbers dipped late in the season to a series low of 8.36 million viewers and a 2.8/8 adult 18-49 rating/share in April 2012, but rebounded slightly for the season finale with 9.66 million viewers and a 3.3/10 adult 18-49 rating/share. Plot The show is based on the theory that there is an alternate universe where every classic fairy tale character (new and old) exists—a world that has a loose connection to our world. On the night of her 28th birthday, bail bonds collector Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is reunited with Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore)—the son she gave up for adoption ten years previous—and takes her back to his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine. Henry has in his possession a large book of fairy tales and correctly suspects that Emma is the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who sent her away so she would be protected from a powerful curse enacted by the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), a curse in which the queen is the only one with a happy ending. It's because of the curse that everyone in Storybrooke is frozen in time with no memories of their former selves—except for the Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother, Regina Mills. Emma refuses to believe a word of Henry's \\"theory\\" and returns Henry home, but then decides to remain in the New England town after getting attached to Henry, which causes the hands of the clock tower to move for the first time in 28 years. Henry tells Emma that she is the only person who can leave Storybrooke, as others who try will suffer accidents. It's soon revealed that Snow and Charming, concerned for the safety of their unborn child, went to seek advice from the imprisoned trickster Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). In return for the child's name, he told them their only hope was the child, who would return on her 28th birthday and begin \\"The Final Battle.\\" The child, an infant girl, is born on the day the Queen enacts her curse and is placed in a wardrobe carved out of an enchanted tree which takes the child to our world. In our world she was named Emma Swan and grew up in the foster system, never finding adoptive parents. She had a difficult childhood and rebelled in her teen years, which ultimately led to her meeting Henry's father, Neal, equally rebellious and feeling abandoned by his own father. In Storybrooke, Emma is soon elected as Sheriff following the sudden death of the previous Sheriff, Graham Humbert (Jamie Dornan), who was really the Huntsman. Regina's antagonistic attitude raises her suspicions and prompts her to move in with Henry's teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard, who is really her mother Snow White. Regina's bitter rivalry with Storybrooke's wealthiest resident, Mr. Gold, becomes heated when she learns he is aware of his true identity as Rumplestiltskin. Mary Margaret falls in love with David Nolan, a coma patient who is actually her husband, and Emma's father, Prince Charming. David wakes up after she reads Henry's fairytale book to him as a favor to Henry. David, however, is married to Kathryn Nolan, the woman who is (in the fairy tale world) his ex-fiancée Princess Abigail, daughter of King Midas. Unable to deny their love, David and Mary Margaret soon begin a secret relationship that becomes public and upsets Kathryn. Kathryn eventually decides to go to Boston and let David be with Mary Margaret only to disappear before leaving Storybrooke. Sometime later an antique jewelry box which belonged to Mary Margaret when she was a child is found buried near the old toll bridge and is revealed to contain a human heart, which is proven to be Kathryn's via DNA testing. Mary Margaret is arrested for Kathryn's supposed murder and hires Mr. Gold as her attorney. As Mary Margaret is about to be prosecuted by corrupt District Attorney Albert Spencer (Alan Dale), who's really Prince Charming's adoptive father King George, Kathryn is found alive in an alley. It is revealed that Regina and Mr. Gold plotted to frame Mary Margaret and force her out of Storybrooke, but Mr. Gold double- crossed Regina and let Kathryn go to exonerate Mary Margaret. When Daily Mirror chief editor Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) (who's actually the Magic Mirror) confesses to having abducted Kathryn in order to jump-start his career, Emma is not convinced and comes to the conclusion that Regina orchestrated the conspiracy and forced Sidney to \\"confess.\\" Emma soon discovers that writer August W. Booth (Eion Bailey), who is the first stranger ever to arrive in town after she did, is from the Enchanted Forest as well: he is Pinocchio, who was sent to our world through the same wardrobe that brought Emma to watch over her. He abandoned her out of fear and is slowly turning back into a wooden puppet as a result. Emma then attempts to take Henry out of Storybrooke forever but is then forced to reconsider when he refuses to go. She finally makes a deal with Regina in which she agrees to leave but will still get to visit Henry on occasion. Since Regina knows Emma's true identity, however, she retrieves her poisoned apple (the same one she used on Snow White) to use on Emma in the form of an apple turnover. Henry, desperate to prove to Emma that the curse is real, takes a bite of the turnover and collapses to the floor unconscious. Emma, who now starts to believe after seeing flashbacks of her true past, is forced to ally with Regina in order to save Henry, and retrieves Rumplestiltskin's true love potion from underneath the Clock Tower. Unfortunately, Mr. Gold intervenes and steals it, leaving Emma halfway up the elevator shaft and Regina tied to a chair and gagged. When Henry is pronounced dead, Emma and Regina return to the hospital to say goodbye to his body. Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to wonder why no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well deep in the heart of the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost. He takes the potion and drops it into the well, causing a purple cloud to emerge and consume Storybrooke as the Clock Tower strikes 8:15.

Episodes Reception Critical response Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an approval rating of 80% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.06/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Charming and fantastical, Once Upon a Time is tonally uneven but derives strength from an outstanding cast and handsome visuals.\\" Metacritic gave it a score of 66 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Washington Posts Hank Stuever called the series \\"a smartly-crafted reward for fans of light fantasy, with the right mix of cleverness, action and romance.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday said the series \\"glows with a near-theatrical shine, challenging viewers to think about TV drama as something other than boilerplate.\\" Several feminist outlets were pleased with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales. Avital Norman Nathman of Bitch stated that she liked the show for \\"infusing a feminist sensibility\\" into the stories. Feministings Genie Leslie commented that Emma was a \\"badass\\", that she liked how Emma was \\"very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children\\", and how Emma was a \\"well- rounded\\" character who was \\"feminine, but not 'girly'\\". Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong, \\"kick-butt\\" female lead, for including multiple strong women who take turns doing the saving with the men, for subverting the fetishization of true love, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion. Wilson went on to state about the lead: \\"Her pursuit of a 'happy ending' is not about finding a man or going to a ball all gussied up, but about detective work, about building a relationship with her son Henry, and about seeking the 'truth' as to why time stands still in the corrupt Storybrooke world. Ratings Soundtrack Extended play Album The album was released featuring five different collectible covers. Novelization Once Upon a Time debuted a fantasy novel from Disney-owned Hyperion books. The novel, titled Reawakened, covers the first season and promises to give \\"fans of the show a whole new look at their favorite characters and stories.\\" The narrative is told from the points-of-view of Emma Swan in Storybrooke and Snow White in the Enchanted Forest. Written by Odette Beane, the novel was published on April 27, 2013 as an exclusive ebook and May 7, 2013 in paperback form.

After 20 years of imprisonment, Olivia La Pena is ready to start a new life again and rebuild the family she never had. The story also follows the lives of her estranged daughters Sheryl and Jennifer who will learn that to understand the other they must learn how to love one another at all costs to save each other.  Plot  20 years ago, Olivia San Juan (Jodi Santamaria/Eula Valdez) fell in love with her longtime suitor Carlos La Pena (Christopher Roxas). They marry. At the same time she is in the middle of a relationship with Dante (James Blanco/Emilio Garcia) who then marries Lailani \\"Lani\\" (Katya Santos/Sylvia Sanchez), Olivia's sister. Olivia grows in burden after killing her husband to save her younger daughter who then is taken by Carlos' mother Alicia La Pena (Tessie Tomas) who then grows hatred for her own daughter-in-law without her knowledge of the real reasons on Carlos's death and Olivia's intentions. Olivia has another baby girl named Bianca (also known as Sheryl, which is a real La Peña) but the girl was given away to Lani, without Olivia's knowledge. Alicia has taken her daughter Jenny to the States after Olivia's mother's death and, finding out her younger daughter Bianca is assumed dead, the latter is set on a not so unkind reunion. After 20 years, Olivia is out of prison and is set to live a new life. Her daughter Jennifer (Nikki Gil) has grown into an intelligent, beautiful, young woman who is taught to become successful in life with the help of her overbearing grandmother Donya Alicia whose shadow she lives under. Jennifer grows hatred for her biological mother Olivia who tries her best to reconnect with her. In her thought that this idea is just a way to ruin the relationship between her grandmother and to ruin her family and start troubles in order to gain her trust, Jennifer crosses paths with Sheryl San Juan (Empress) a poor lass who tries to bind her family back together in search of hopes that she will one day find her father again after leaving her family to work abroad. Sheryl gains faith with her childhood friend Niko (Ejay Falcon) who then courts her and becomes her boyfriend. On the other hand, Jennifer struggles with an upcoming marriage with Mike Sarmiento (Alex Castro) to save the family business from falling apart while in a private relationship with Jenny's cousin Ramona (Dianne Medina). In Olivia's search for a better life, she accepts employment with a lonely bar and restaurant owner Emilio (Allan Paule) who tries to regain her ability to love again. The story further focuses on the difficult relationships that tear the families apart when Dante comes back into Olivia and Lani's lives after he's released from a crime and freak accident that has scarred him for life.

The episode title is a quote from Act III, Scene III of William Shakespeare's play Othello. In the episode, Senator Jordan Crane (James D. Hopkin) arrives in town for an arranged peace talk with the Cheyenne and to discuss the Union Pacific Railroad's future with Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney). Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is put in charge of security while the natives are in town. He prevents Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) from causing a scene, after she spots a female native wearing Lily's dead husband's hat. Plot Thomas Durant prepares the town's makeshift depot for Senator Jordan Crane's arrival via train. Crane arrives and announces to all that he has come to discuss peace with the Cheyenne people. However, he threatens battle if the natives decline. Over a meal served outside under a tent, Crane, Durant, and Lily Bell discuss the issues with payroll and the Union Pacific Railroad's finances. Durant tells the Senator things are fine. Lily comments about her husband Robert's missing survey maps and the path to the Rocky Mountains. Crane lets Durant know that the rival Central Pacific Railroad has already laid its 40 miles of track, pushing east from California. Cullen is put in charge of security for the peace talks while the Cheyenne are in Hell on Wheels. Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) comes to Cullen and asks that he please tell his foremen to keep the peace to prevent bloodshed between the town and the natives. Cullen then asks Elam (Common) to keep his crew civil during their visit. Elam speaks of their recent fisticuffs, and Cullen accuses him of cheating. Elam seems shocked at the mention of his peppered hand wraps and denies cheating. Out of view from Durant's coach, The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) informs Crane that Durant used $147,000 of Union Pacific cash to speculate on railroad stock. Crane wonders about The Swede's interest in the matter. The Swede then requests information about Frank Harper, who is Cullen's current target in avenging his wife's death. Chief Many Horses (Wes Studi) and his tribe arrive at Hell on Wheels. At the negotiations, the chief scoffs at Durant's opinion that Crane is offering the Cheyenne a better way of life. After debating who really owns the land they're discussing, the Cheyenne or the U.S. government, Durant storms off. The chief has rejected the proposal that his people live on a reservation. Crane warns Chief Many Horses that his people will be killed if he doesn't accept the U.S. government's deal. The chief threatens to slaughter Crane's people, in return. After Durant returns to the table, Chief Many Horses describes Pawnee Killer's \\"vision\\" of defeating the train. On a whim, Durant offers the chief's son a chance to make his vision a reality. As the Cheyenne and Hell on Wheels townsfolk watch, Pawnee Killer (Gerald Auger) races on horseback against a locomotive, taking the early lead as the train crew stokes the fire to increase speed. The locomotive eventually bests Pawnee Killer. Durant boasts over his victory later to Crane, who congratulates him but again vows to ruin him over the embezzlement. To prove he's not bluffing, Crane reports that he's sold his landholdings and Crédit Mobilier stock. Durant no longer has a figurative hold on Crane. At the church tent, Ruth (Kasha Kropinski) and Joseph (Eddie Spears) mutually bond over losing their mothers, but Ruth tells Joseph that his mother cannot be in Heaven since she wasn't a Christian. The two later try to explain Christian beliefs to the female Cheyenne. Lily approaches Cullen to inform him that she is taking his advice and leaving town. She notices a Cheyenne woman wearing her dead husband's hat. Lily tries to snatch it from the squaw, but Cullen wrestles her away. She accuses Joseph of lying when he said it wasn't his tribe that attacked her camp. She intends to tell Durant that Robert's killers are in town. Cullen warns her that the price of her revenge will be the death of innocent women and children. The squaw with Robert's hat later offers it to Lily, stating her husband was killed in the massacre as well, with his own arrow. Lily awkwardly realizes that she killed the squaw's husband. After placing the hat on her husband's grave marker, Lily digs up the missing maps from his grave and gives them to Durant, urging him to complete the railroad. Chief Many Horses leaves town, warning Joseph about the people with whom he now resides. Meanwhile, at the saloon, Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) and his gang attempt to incite the townsfolk against the natives. Although outnumbered, Cullen moves to stop him. The Swede also intervenes, reminding everyone that Durant does not want the natives harmed. The Swede suggests the men \\"find some amusement here in town\\". Toole heads with his men to the cathouse, demanding to see Eva but is told that she's not around. Eva (Robin McLeavy) and Elam are dressing in his tent, when Toole and his men storm in to beat Elam and drag him away. Title reference The episode title is a quote from Act III, Scene III of William Shakespeare's play Othello, wherein the title character bids farewell both to being happily married and also to his career as a military general, after receiving news his wife has been unfaithful. He feels he can no longer experience \\"pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war.\\" Reception The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Adam Raymond of New York Magazine conveyed his happiness about seeing trains in the episode: \\"Before last night’s episode, I was ready to rename it Hell on Hooves because, you know, there are more horses than trains. But then 'Pride, Pomp and Circumstance' arrived bellowing enough black smoke to warrant a visit from the EPA.\\" TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna gave the episode almost 4 out of 5 stars: \\"'Pride, Pomp and Circumstance' continued to move the show forward in its efforts to draw the characters closer towards a larger conflict ... Here's to hoping that the second half of the season begins to take all of those interesting story lines and make something of them.\\" Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club would prefer the series to center more on Cullen. \\"The problem with giving the hero of a TV series a vengeance quest for his principal motivation is that, once it’s fulfilled, you have to figure out what he’s going to do next or the series has to end ... If the show becomes swamped by matters in which the man-of-action hero has no stake, then why should we care?\\" The sixth episode was watched by 2.15 million viewers, and had a 0.6 rating with the 18-49 age range — the lowest viewership of the season, so far.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway. The short was released on December 15, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary Buddy is preparing fudge for his girlfriend Cookie. When he walks away from his stove for a moment, Bozo the dog burns his tongue attempting to taste the mixture. Buddy returns with a tube to squirt the fudge onto a pan, disregarding the odd behavior of his pet. As he arranges the fudge on a pan, he tosses some into Bozo's mouth while lecturing the dog on how harmful candy can be to a dog's teeth. Buddy orders the dog to sit and tells him to be quiet as he telephones Cookie to give her tidings of the treat he has prepared for her. The two discuss vanilla (which Buddy always uses for fudge). Meanwhile, Bozo wanders off, back to the kitchen, and spills the fudge all over the floor, then eating it and, true to Buddy's admonition, causing a sharp spike to hurt his teeth. The dog yelps in pain, Buddy yells, \\"Shut up!\\" which Cookie misinterprets as being directed towards her. She hangs up. Buddy walks into the kitchen, finds his fudge ruined and Bozo hiding under a table. Buddy pulls the dog out from under the table and tells him that \\"candy would hurt his teeth.\\" Buddy attempts to remove his dog's loose tooth with pliers. Discovering \\"Dr. Mohler: Painless Dentist's\\" calendar, Buddy has an idea to use nitrous oxide. Buddy attaches a gas pipe with a mouthpiece to Bozo's mouth, and the dog inflates and floats upward. Buddy gets him down with a vacuum cleaner, which then explodes, trapping Buddy in an ironing board compartment. Buddy next decides to tie one end of a string to a dog toy, the other to Bozo's damaged tooth. When that only serves to amuse the animal, Buddy decides to tie up the tooth and tie the other end of the string to a doorknob, the closing action of the door then serving to force the loose tooth from the dog's gums. Bozo is trepidatious, but Buddy is preparing to demonstrate how little the method hurts when a domestic cat comes in. The feline spooks the dog so much that Bozo, still attached by the string to Buddy, chases the creature out of the house. They go through fountains until Buddy becomes trapped in a toy wagon. The cat gets away, but Buddy and his dog become trapped in a hammock occupied by Cookie. All three emerge from the fallen hammock and Buddy discovers that he has the troubled tooth, but Cookie, only mildly disgusted, finds a tooth clearly missing from Buddy's mouth. Millar and Frisby Early in the cartoon, Buddy is seen to be making his fudge with \\"Millar's Cocoa\\", a reference to Melvin Millar. Later on, as Bozo chases the cat (and drags Buddy along), they pass a billboard that advertises \\"Frisby\\", a reference to Friz Freleng. A similar reference to Freleng occurs in High Diving Hare. Dating discrepancy As with many Buddy cartoons, sources differ on the release date of Buddy the Dentist.

The defining features of a literary work do not reside in extraliterary conditions such as history or sociocultural phenomena under which a literary text might have been created but in the form of the language that is used. Thus, literariness is defined as being the feature that makes a given work a literary work. It distinguishes a literary work from ordinary texts by using certain artistic devices such as metre, rhyme, and other patterns of sound and repetition. History The term ‘literariness’ was first introduced by the Russian Formalist Roman Jacobson in 1921. He declared in his work Modern Russian Poetry that ‘the object of literary science is not literature but literariness, i.e. what makes a given work a literary work’ (Das 2005, p. 78). Russian formalism preceded the Russian Revolution as it originated in the second decade of the 20th century and flourished in the 1920s. It had its origin in two centres: the Moscow Linguistics Circle and the St. Petersburg based group OPOJAZ (the Society for the Study of Poetic Language) (Makaryk 2000, p. 53). The focus of their attention was on the analysis of the features that make up literary texts in opposition to the former traditional study of literature which focussed on studying literature in conjunction with other disciplines such as history, biography, sociology and psychology (Makaryk 2000, p. 53). It insisted that literary scholars should solely be concerned with the component parts of a literary text and should exclude all intuition or imagination. It emphasised that the focus resides on the literary creation itself rather than the author/reader or any other extrinsic systems (Erlich 1973, p. 628). To Russian Formalists, and especially to Victor Shklovsky, literariness, or the distinction between literary and non-literary texts, is accomplished through ‘defamiliarization’ (Ekegren 1999, p. 44). A main characteristic of literary texts is that they make the language unfamiliar to the reader and deviate from ordinary language. They have the capacity to defamiliarise our habitual perceptions of the real world and the capacity to estrange it (Ekegren 1999, p. 44). Shklovsky stated that the purpose of art is to disrupt the automatic response to things and give it a new and unforeseen perception (Makaryk 2000, p. 54). Defamiliarised language will draw attention to itself: as our perceptions are automatic, it will force the reader to notice the unfamiliar through a variety of different techniques i.e. wordplay, rhythm, figures of speech and so on (Lemon 1965, p. 5). Another key term in defamiliarisation and literariness introduced by Shklovsky is the concept of ‘plot’. For Shklovsky, the plot is the most important feature of a narrative as he claims that there is a distinctive difference between ‘story’ and ‘plot’. The story of a narrative entails the normal temporal sequence of events whereas the plot is a distortion of the normal storyline and thus associated with defamiliarisation (Williams 2004, p. 5). The idea of defamiliarisation was further explored by the Prague School Theory with one of the main scholars, Jan Mukarovsky, and by later developments in the theory of Roman Jakobson. Jan Mukarovsky postulates the idea that linguistic deviation, such as foregrounding, is the hallmark of poetic texts (Pilkington 2000, p. 16). He claimed that the use of linguistic devices such as tone, metaphor, ambiguity, patterning and parallelism distinguish ordinary language from poetic language. In the 1960s, Jacobson introduced the poetic function of literary texts and further developed the idea that the use of certain linguistic choices draw attention to the language of texts. He placed poetic language at the centre of his inquiry and emphasized that phonetically and syntactically repeated linguistic elements distinguish literary from non-literary texts. He tried to define literariness by distinguishing between six functions of language: the emotive, referential, phatic, metalingual, conative and poetic function (Zwaan 1993, p. 7) . To Jacobson, the poetic function is the most important function as it mainly focuses on the message itself (Zwaan 1993, p. 7). The different linguistic devices in a piece of literary text initiate the reader to have a closer look at the happenings in the text which without linguistic distortion, might have been left unnoticed. Thus, Roman Jakobson emphasised that what makes a literary text is merely associated with the language as self-sufficient entity while reference to social life, history, or anything outside the language is irrelevant. Literary and non-literary texts Literary texts =Literary poems= Some examples of defamiliarisation in poetic literary texts are Shakespeare’s sonnet starting with ‘My mistresses eyes are nothing like the sun’ in which rhyme and metre supply a poetic framework or Dickinson’s I felt a funeral in my brain in which the strategic use of the words in the title already create a notion of new and unfamiliar Rob Pope 'The English Studies Book: An Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture', Routledge, 2005 page 90(Pope 2002). =Literary novels= Two British eighteenth century writers were often cited as a reference for narrative literary texts by Russian Formalists i.e. Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver's Travels and Laurence Sterne’s The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (Selden 1997, p. 33). In Gulliver’s Travels, the overt disproportion between the characters i.e. between Gulliver and the Lilliputians, is an example of defamiliarisation from the real world as it draws attention to the unusual size of the characters (Pope 2002, p. 90). In Tristram Shandy, familiar actions are defamiliarised by being slowed down i.e. the narration is overtly and playfully interrupted, slowed down or accelerated. Furthermore, there is a distortion of the storyline, as the narrative structure and plot patterns are highlighted by positioning chapter 18 and 19 after chapter 25 (Klarer 2004, p. 78). The same can be noticed in Marcel Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past in which he tells the entire novel retrospectively, from the past to the present (Ryan 2011, p. 2). Non-literary texts While in Russian Formalism and Prague structuralism literary texts were seen as the ones that use language in aesthetic and estranged ways, non-literary texts were those that used everyday language precisely and accurately. They consisted of everyday texts, such as newspaper or magazine articles, letters, brochures, advertisements, reports, or editorials. Development of new theories on literariness New Theories In the 1970s, some scholars moved away from the solely linguistic theory adopted by the Russian Formalists and started acknowledging the role of the reader to establish a theoretical discipline. Many of these scholars, which included Jonathan Culler, Stanley Fish, Umberto Eco to name a few, stated that literariness cannot be defined solely on the basis of linguistic properties found within a text but that the reader is also a crucial factor in the construction of meaning (Zwaan 1993, p. 8). They acknowledged the fact that foregrounding is a feature of poetry, however, claimed that language structures such as foregrounding can also be found in ordinary texts e.g. advertisement. Jakobson agrees that such poetic functions can be found in any text but argues that the dominance of those functions over other functions is what makes a text a poetic text (Pilkington 2000, p. 19). Although this justification was accepted by later scholars, Jakobson’s theory was still not perceived as a perfectly acceptable condition for the separation of literary from ordinary texts. As a result, Culler and Fish emphasized that the crucial aspect of literariness is not the poetic construction of a text but the conventional expectations that are involved. Their main emphasis was on a reader-oriented theory which goes beyond a solely textual perception and focuses on the role of the reader in processing and interpreting a text. Fish argued that meaning and literariness are not textual properties but rely on interpretative constructions by the reader (Zwaan 1993). Readers are members of certain social communities in which certain conventions and patterns persist and in which they acquire certain interpretive strategies. (Zwaan 1993). He argued that a certain interpretation of a text will only occur because of the conventional strategies that determine the interpretive community. Strong opposition to the Formalist theory has not only been voiced by reader-oriented theories but also by Marxist critics, speech act theory and new historicism. They all agreed that the view on a distinct definition between ordinary and literary texts should be rejected (Abrams 2009, p. 128). Two views on literariness Thus, the search for a definition of literariness has developed in two directions. The first direction is the Russian Formalist's approach which assumes that there is a difference between literary and ordinary texts with features specific to literary language. The second approach rejects this assumption, as those linguistic features can be found in any other instance of language use. This approach moves the interest from the grammatical structures, syntax and semantics, to that of pragmatics which analyses the author's and the reader's view on the text (Nöth 1990, p. 350). Modern theories on literariness Nowadays, theorists disagree on the issue of what is understood by literariness. In the 1990s, a number of scholars reintroduced the model of formalism to define literariness. Theorists such as Van Dijk (1979) or Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) focus on the cognitive aspects of meaning representation and say that literariness must seek a basis not in linguistic theory but in a cognitive pragmatic one. Zwaan (1993) claims that readers develop cognitive control systems for specific types of discourse which monitors the comprehension of literary texts. Yet other scholars think that a theory of literariness is merely impossible.  References  Abrams, M. H. a. H., Geoffrey Galt. 2009. A Glossary of Literary Terms. 9th ed. Michael Rosenberg.

Features analyzed include waveform properties such as frequency, change in frequency, and amplitude, and the curvature of the wavefront. A number of different species are proficient in surface wave detection, including some aquatic insects and toads, though most research is done on the topminnow/surface killifish Aplocheilus lineatus. The fish and other animals with this ability spend large amounts of time near the water surface, some just to feed and others their entire lives. Description of behavior Certain species of fish spend a substantial portion of their lives near the surface of the water in order to feed, usually on insects that are struggling at the surface. Species that detect surface waves typically use them to localize such prey. When the hunting posture is assumed (which may be neutral posture) as specific mechanosensitive organ is held in contact with the surface of the water in order that mechanoreceptors can receive surface waves. The animal will wait a small amount of time (typically <1s) before initiating a response towards the prey, should the surface waves perceived fall within the preferred stimulus range. Response towards prey typically follows the pattern orientation towards prey, swimming towards prey, and then prey capture. This ability is sometimes referred to as a sense of \\"distant touch.\\"Schwarz, J.S., Reichenbach, T., and Hudspeth, A. J. (2011) \\"A hydrodynamic sensory antenna used by killifish for nocturnal hunting\\". The Journal of Experimental Biology 214:1857-1866 Several species have been shown to use surface wave detection for prey capture. Among these are many species of freshwater fish, notably the groups hatchetfish (Gasteropelecidae), freshwater butterflyfish (Pantodontidae), halfbeaks (Hemiramphidae) and killifish (Aplocheilidae)(list from ). For its consistently stellar performance at the task, the topminnow/killfish (both terms are used in the literature) is one of the primary models for investigation. These species tend to live in small bodies of freshwater, as well as creeks and swamps. Surface waves Capillary wave ripples on Lifjord in Øksnes, Norway The ripples which surface-feeding fish detect are known more technically as capillary waves. Capillary waves are generated by movement of an object at the surface of the water or from the brief contact of an object with the surface from either medium (air or water). Waves radiate outward in concentric circles from the source, and the waveform of each train of waves changes in very specific and predictable waves, as dictated by surface tension and gravity.Bleckmann H, and Kase R. H. (1987) \\"Prey localization by surface wave ray-tracing: fish track bugs like oceanographers track storms\\". Experientia 43: 290-293 The water surface has a dampening effect which causes an abnormal dispersion pattern in which waves decrease in amplitude, speed and frequency with distance from the source.Müller U., and Schwartz E. \\"Influence of single neuromasts on prey localizing behavior of surface-feeding fish, Aplocheilus lineatus\\". Journal of Comparative Physiology A 149 (1982): 399-408 Short-wavelength (higher frequency) waves disperse faster than longer wavelength waves, resulting in higher frequencies at the front of the wave- train and lower frequencies at the tail; a fish detects this as a downward- sweeping frequency modulation. Surface wave detection in Aplocheilus lineatus A vast amount of the research on surface wave detection has been done in the surface-feeding topminnow/killfish Aplocheilus lineatus. Schwartz (1965) demonstrated that this species has exceptionally well-developed surface wave detection ability, and it is easily housed and trained in laboratories.Schwartz, E. (1965) \\"Bau und Funktion der seitenlinie des streifenhechtlings Aplocheilus lineatus\\". \\"Z Vergl Physiology A 50\\": 55-87, cited and translated in Coombs S., Görner P., and Münz H. eds. The Mechanosensory Lateral Line: Neurobiology and Evolution (New York: Springer- Verlag New York Inc., 1989), pp.501-524 Pantadon bucholzi (a surface dwelling butterfly fish) is used less often though is very similar in its anatomy and behavior. The rest of this article will focus on research done with A lineatus. Experimental methodology (See the work of Bleckmann, Schwartz, Müller, etc., 1965-present). The experimental setup for testing A lineatus' abilities is very standardized. Subject fish are often blinded so that visual cues cannot be used. Stimuli are delivered to the surface of the water in a test tank via one of two methods (experimenters often use both): for the first, a loudspeaker is set up facing the water surface, while a plastic disc covers the front of the speaker cone with a small hole in the center, allowing air to be pushed through the hole to stimulate the water surface in a pattern controlled by a square-wave generator. Alternatively, a small rod a few millimeters in diameter is dipped briefly a few centimeters into the water. Either setup can be moved around the tank to deliver stimuli at various locations. The loudspeaker setup offers the advantage that stimuli can be precisely controlled to mimic natural stimuli or to test certain wave properties. Wave characteristics are measured optically. This is done by shining a laser (often helium-neon) at the water surface. Reflections and distortions of the laser's beam are picked up by a photodiode. Fishes' movements are videotaped with a high-speed camera from above the testing tank so that the precise timing and nature of their responses' to stimuli can be reviewed. Behavior of A lineatus Aplocheilus lineatus assumes a hunting posture at the water surface in which it holds the top of its head within 200 μm of the water surface. On perception of appropriate wave stimuli, fish first turn towards the stimulus. This initial turn is made within 150ms of the wavetrain's arrival to the fish. Fish then swim to the wave's source. There are specific parameters for wave stimuli to be perceived which reflect the type of waves produced by prey. Fish are least sensitive to low frequencies, with a minimum threshold of 10 Hz and have peak sensitivity at 75–150 Hz; the highest frequency they can detect is 250 Hz.Müller, U. (1984) \\"Die morphologie und physiologie Anpassung des Seitenlinien-systems von Pantodon bucholzo an den Lebensraum Wasseroberflache\\".

The Mechanosensory Lateral Line: Neurobiology and Evolution (New York: Springer-Verlag New York Inc., 1989), pp.501-524 These waves have small amplitudes (on a micrometer- scale), and fish can detect waves with minimum peak-to-peak displacement of 1 μm at 10 Hz and 0.0007μm in their most sensitive range of 75–100 Hz. Fish are also sensitive to waves generated within 7–30 cm of the fish's location, though they can occur at any point within that radius. Because the water surface acts as a low pass filter, this radius is different for different wave frequencies: 70 Hz waves with 100μm peak-to-peak distance are subthreshold at 37 cm, and 140 Hz waves are subthreshold at 19 cm.Bleckmann, H. (1980) \\"Reaction time and stimulus frequency in prey localization in the surface- feeding fish Aplocheilus lineatus\\". Journal of Comparative Physiology 140:163-172, cited in Hoin-Radkovsky, Bleckmann, Schwartz 1984) Fish are able to tell apart concurrent waves of different frequencies when the frequencies are different by at least 15%, though at certain frequencies this difference can be as low as 8%.Hoin-Radkovsky, I., Bleckmann, H., and Schwartz, E. (1984) \\"Determination of the source distance in the surface-feeding fish Pantodon bucholzi pantodontidae\\". Animal Behavior 32:840-851 The wave-detection system of A lineatus and other surface feeding fish is tuned to match the waves that signal prey in their environment. A lineatus feeds on aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial insects, often insects that have just touched the surface of the water or have fallen in and are struggling at the surface. Abiotic sources give off capillary waves of frequency 8–14 Hz, while biotic sources give off much higher frequencies, anywhere from 12–45 Hz and above.Bleckmann, H., Waldner, I., and Schwartz, E. (1981) \\"Frequency Discrimination of the Surface- Feeding Fish Aplocheilus lineatus - A Prerequisite for Prey Localization?\\" Journal of Comparative Physiology 143:485-490 This correlates well with A lineatus' peak sensitivity at higher frequencies. Wave stimuli are classified into two types: the first is click stimuli (short bursts of amplitude less than 100μm which contain many frequencies between 5 Hz and 190 Hz and are of short duration, as when an insect just touches the water rather than moves continuously at the surface). The other is continuous wave stimuli, which will contain many frequencies and in the wild are generated by fallen prey struggling at the water surface. It has been pointed out that A lineatus and other surface feeding fish are able to locate prey even if the waveform is only in click form (just touching the surface once, as when surfacing for air or when a mosquito larva is hatching), which takes less time to complete than the fish will take to swim over.Lang, H.H. (1980a) Surface wave discrimination between prey and nonprey by the back swimmer Notonecta glauca L. (Hemiptera, Heteroptera). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 6:233-246, cited in Bleckmann, H, and Schwartz, E. (1982) \\"The functional significance of frequency modulation within a wave train for prey localization in the surface- feeding fish Aplocheilus lineatus\\". Journal of Comparative Physiology 145: 331-339 This indicates that the fish are simply performing a form of sensory taxis, that they are getting all the information they need to locate the prey in the initial stimulus reception and are retaining the location while orienting and swimming. Fish also can begin orienting and swimming after receiving only the first few waves in a wavetrain or click stimulus. Directional orientation When stimuli are presented within a detectable range, orientations toward the stimulus by A lineatus are extremely precise: the response is almost perfect with angles up to 150° in either direction from forwards, and precision falls off but not much when waves come from the rear of the fish. There is some disagreement in the field about how A lineatus determines the direction of a stimulus. A common suggestion is that an animal performs a ray tracing calculation, similar to what human oceanographers use to locate ocean storms without a satellite. Theoretically, an animal could compare the arrival times of a wavetrain at two neuromasts, effectively measuring the curvature of the wavefront (the farther away the fish is from the source, the less arc angle will be measured in the distance between the neuromasts). However, there is no evidence of a neural circuit that performs this calculation, and other researchers suggest that the distance between any pair of surface wave neuromasts is too small (A lineatus's head is only 1 cm wide) for the calculation to be made accurately, and then at distances from the stimulus less than 7 cm.Bleckmann, H, and Schwartz, E. (1982) \\"The functional significance of frequency modulation within a wave train for prey localization in the surface-feeding fish Aplocheilus lineatus\\". Journal of Comparative Physiology 145: 331-339 The accuracy predicted by a time- difference mechanism (using triangulation of the wave source based on curvature of wave front) doesn't match actual accuracy. Additionally it has been shown that if all neuromasts are removed except for one, direction detection still occurs to some degree,Müller, U. (1981) \\"Der Einflulb einzelner Neuromasten des Seitenliniensystems auf die Lokalisationsleistung des Streifenhechtlings Aplocheilus Lineatus\\". Diplomarbeit, Universitat Giessen, FRG, cited in Bleckmann and Schwartz, 1982 An alternative theory is that individual neuromasts have a preferred direction, that is they are most sensitive to waves coming from a particular direction. A comparison of activation levels of different neuromasts is a relatively easy neural calculation to perform. When neuromasts are removed unilaterally, fish still turn towards the side the stimulus came from though overestimate the angle by an average of 21° towards the side with intact neuromasts. In this situation, fish often make two turns, first towards the side with intact neuromasts and then back towards the other. Each neuromast has a preferred direction. This was shown in 1970 through ablation of all but one neuromast: fish then usually turned towards one range of directions regardless of where the stimulus came from.Schwartz, E. (1970) Ferntastsinne yon Oberflachenfischen. Z Morphol Tiere 67:40-57, cited in Müller and Schwartz, 1982 The direction sensitivity, as revealed via electrophysiology, shows a cosine function describing receptor firing intensity: accuracy depends on receptor orientation and arrangement and intensity-difference threshold. In 2011 it was shown that there are certain fleshy ridges around each neuromast that direct water flow. When these ridges were removed, the receptive field for each neuromast was much wider than that with intact ridges; this was shown with electrophysiology. The same experiment also showed that adding ridges to neuromasts that did not previously have ridges also altered the receptive fields for those neuromasts. This suggests that local water flow is important in direction detection. Distance detection A lineatus and other surface wave detecting fish have a limited range in which they can detect surface waves. The ratio of source distance/swim distance ranges between 0.84 and 1.20, and the means range from 0.98 to 1.07. This translates to an accuracy of 85% or higher when stimuli are 6–19 cm from the fish, decreasing to 76% at 14 cm. As the wave source gets farther from a fish, the fish's ability to accurately determine distance decreases until it can no longer detect the waves. A lineatus uses the shape of the waveform to determine distance by analyzing how much the waveform has changed since it was generated; this amount of change is extremely predictable and regular. The surface waveform has high frequencies near source, and lower frequencies farther away due to the dampening effect of the water surface; the amount of decrease diminishes with distance. A lineatus' possible use of the wavefront's curvature can be excluded since fish are still able to judge the distance of a wave's source with only a single functioning neuromast when all others have been ablated. When presented with single-frequency or upward frequency-modulated waves, fish underestimate the distance of the wave source; this suggests the normal downward FM of capillary waves, which arises almost immediately in wave dispersion, is necessary for A lineatus to judge distance. This was confirmed in 1982 by presenting fish with waves with an artificially generated waveform so that at 7 cm the wave had the downward FM sweep of a wave 15 cm away, and fish responded to these by swimming 15 cm. The neuro- anatomical basis for this ability has not yet been identified. Anatomy A lineatus and similar surface feeding fish (e.g. Pantadon bucholzi) use a slightly modified lateral line organ called a neuromast to detect surface waves. A lineatus has 18 neuromasts (specialized vibration-sensitive lateral line organs) on the dorsal surface of the head of A lineatus. These are organized into three groups by longitudinal position, and each group is bilaterally symmetric. The groups are, caudal to rostral: nasal/infraorbital (I), supraorbital (II), and supratemporal/post-orbital (III).Bleckmann, H., and Mohr, C. (1998) \\"Electrophysiology of the Cephalic Lateral Line of the Surface-Feeding Fish Aplocheilus lineatus\\". Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 119A(3):807-815 Each neuromast is a cluster of hair-cell bundles arranged in a line and numbering in the 10s to 100s. Each bundle of hair cells is covered in a gelatinous capulla which the capillary waves actually make contact with and in doing so cause afferent neurons to fire.McHenry, M.J. and van·Netten, S.M. (2007) \\"The flexural stiffness of superficial neuromasts in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) lateral line\\". Journal of Experimental Biology 210:4244-4253, cited in Schwarz 2011 Neuromasts are similar in structure to canal organs in the lateral line canal system: they are housed in sacs of connective tissue between the skull and skin, and are connected to the water and water surface via canals and canal pores. Recent work has also revealed small ridges of tissue around each neuromast which direct water flow around it. The neuroanatomy beyond the receptor level for surface wave-detecting neuromasts has been minimally investigated. In this regard what research has been done shows considerable variation between species; in A lineatus, these neuromasts are considered the supraorbital line, and are innervated by ramus opthalmicus superficialis.Müller and Schwartz, 1982, cited in Coombs S., Görner P., and Münz H. eds. The Mechanosensory Lateral Line: Neurobiology and Evolution (New York: Springer-Verlag New York Inc., 1989), pp.501-524 This tract results in collateral fibers that innervate the rostral boundary of the medial octavolateralis nucleus, the area in all teleosts where lateral line organs innervate.McCormick.

Verg Dtsch Zool Ges 80:268-269, cited in Coombs S., Görner P., and Münz H. eds. The Mechanosensory Lateral Line: Neurobiology and Evolution (New York: Springer-Verlag New York Inc., 1989), pp.501-524 In one of the few electrophysiology studies performed on A lineatus, it was found that of all the primary afferents from neuromasts that they recorded, half phase-locked to wave stimuli. These neurons had weaker ongoing activity than non-phase-locked neurons. With waves of decreasing amplitude, phase-locking also decreased. Phase-locking was best in the 40–70 Hz range or in the 80–100 Hz range. Within a neuromast different afferents phase-locked best to waves of different frequencies and amplitudes, and they found no correlation between a unit's dynamic amplitude range and its ability to phase lock. Analysis of data revealed that wave amplitude of waves was encoded in the degree of phase- locking and in the afferent's firing rate. Since this was the extent of the feature representation found, it was concluded that further analysis of waves must happen at higher levels in the nervous system. Amphibians The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) responds to surface waves. It is able to locate wave directions at least to within ± 5°Elepfandt, A., (1982). Accuracy of taxis response to water waves in the clawed toad (Xenopus laevis Daudin) with intact or with lesioned lateral line system. Journal of Comparative Physiology, 148: 535-545 and they can localize and distinguish between two different water waves coming simultaneously from two insects in different directions. Xenopus has approximately 200 lateral-line organs located along the sides of its body, and also around its eyes, head and neck. It is claimed these are used to navigate and detect prey either striking the water or struggling but the role of these organs in surface wave detection is not entirely clear; Xenopus with all of their lateral line organs destroyed are still able to respond to surface waves in an oriented fashion. Compared to animals with an intact system they respond somewhat less accurately to anterior stimuli and much less accurately to stimuli from behind. Areas of the Xenopus brain responding to surface waves have been identified.Branoner, F., Zhivkov, Z., Ziehm, U. and Behrend, O., (2012). Central representation of spatial and temporal surface wave parameters in the African clawed frog. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 198: 797-815 It has been speculated that both Xenopus and the European grassfrog use their seismic sensory capabilities to locate conspecifics in breeding ponds.Narins, P.M., (1990). Seismic communication in Anuran amphibians. Bioscience, 40: 268-274 Arachnids Dolomedes spiders hunt by waiting at the edge of a pool or stream. They hold on to the shore with their back legs while the rest of their body lies on the water, with legs stretched out. When they detect the ripples from prey, they run across the surface to subdue it using their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; like other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to kill and digest the prey. They mainly eat insects, but some larger species are able to catch small fish.Barbour, T. (1921). Spiders feeding on small cyprinodonts. Psyche, 28: 131–132.University of Arkansas Museum Arthropod Museum web page: dark fishing spider (Dolomedes tenebrosus). Females of the water spider Argyroneta aquatica build underwater \\"diving bell\\" webs which they fill with air and use for digesting prey, molting, mating and raising offspring. They live almost entirely within the bells, darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it.Schütz, D. and Taborsky, M., (2003). Adaptations to an aquatic life may be responsible for the reversed sexual size dimorphism in the water spider, Argyroneta aquatica.

It is in black chalk, with pen and ink and white highlighting, on pink prepared (coloured) paper, and measures 26.6 cm x 15.1 cm. It is a figure study made in preparation for his painting The Entombment, and is Michelangelo's only surviving study that was probably drawn from a nude female model.Dunkerton, et al, 186 It also may be the earliest extant European drawing of a nude female model.Dunkerton, et al, 186 The figure in the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left foreground of the painting.

Exceptions from the Italian Renaissance include Raphael, who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and Lorenzo Lotto, who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models.Dunkerton, et al, 186 In Florence, Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making preparatory studies of the nude prior to painting the figure fully clothed, in order to better understand the underlying structure of the body.Dunkerton, et al, 186 The Entombment, Michelangelo, c. 1500–1501.

The creek flows north through San Emigdio Canyon to terminate southwest of Lakeview in the western San Joaquin Valley. In years of heavy rainfall it would be a tributary to the Connecting Slough, the slough between Kern Lake and Buena Vista Lake which has been dry for decades due to agricultural diversion, pumping, and a lowering groundwater table.

Its mouth provided a watering place between Cuddy Valley in the south and Arroyo de Amargosa (Bitterwater Creek) to the northwest near Buena Vista Lake.

It concerns the romantic lives of three sisters. The musical was originally produced in London at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1934 and was not a success. It introduced the song \\"I Won't Dance\\", and also includes \\"Lonely Feet\\", \\"Hand in Hand\\", \\"Now I Have Springtime\\", and \\"My Beautiful Circus Girl\\". Plot At the beginning of World War I, in 1914, three sisters travel the English countryside with their widowed father Will Barbour, a traveling photographer who works at local fairs. The eldest daughter, Tiny, is engaged to Eustace, an earnest if slightly dull constable, although she is attracted to George, an adventurous carnival performer. Dorrie, the middle daughter, is ashamed of her itinerant upbringing and seeks to marry into the aristocracy and enter high society. The youngest daughter, Mary, falls for a gypsy performer. The men are sent to the Western Front in France to fight, while the women remain home. Productions The original production opened in London at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on April 19, 1934. It featured Victoria Hopper, Stanley Holloway, Adele Dixon, Esmond Knight, and Charlotte Greenwood. Reception was mixed, and the musical closed after two months. Kern and Hammerstein did not produce Three Sisters in the US, and it was Kern's last new show to appear in the West End. Greg MacKellan presented a concert reading at the New Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco, California, in 1995. MacKellan used a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts in 2010 to reconstruct the script and score, as parts were missing. The following year, his company, 42nd Street Moon, presented the American debut of Three Sisters in San Francisco at the Eureka Theatre for a three-week run. Legacy Although this show was not considered a success and never made it to Broadway, the song \\"I Won't Dance\\" was later included in the film version of Roberta (1935). and became so popular in that context that it is almost always included in stage revivals and cast recordings of Roberta. The song \\"Lonely Feet\\" was sung by Irene Dunne in the 1934 film adaptation of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein musical Sweet Adeline.

It occurs often in biological imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) because of their limited spatial resolution. Although partial volume effect and spillover refer to essentially the same physical problem, it is important to distinguish the outcome of these two different effects. For partial volume effect, the apparent loss of activity in the object is distributed across adjacent voxels, which are considered outside the object, resulting in increase in activity in these voxels. This increase in activity is referred to as spillover, whereas loss in activity is referred to as partial volume loss.

History The Houston Water Works Company was established by a group of New York investors and entered a franchise agreement with the city of Houston in 1878. The company constructed a dam just upstream from Capitol Avenue, a processing plant on Artesian Street, and connected pipes to the city system. The Houston Waterworks Company pumped about 2 million gallons of water from the Buffalo Bayou daily when it was founded in 1879 to extinguish fires, such as the one that broke out on Main Street a few days after the plant was erected. After natural reserves of drinking water were discovered in Houston, the Waterworks company out-competed local wells. T. H. Scanlan and Associates acquired the Houston Water Works Company and its franchise in 1884. New ownership made capital improvements including a new boiler, pumps, and a reservoir increasing the daily capacity to eight million gallons. Even these improvements were not sufficient to provide enough pressure to every point in the city, and sometimes the system failed at extinguishing fires. In 1887 a new well at Franklin and LaBranch revealed a large natural reservoir, and a total of fourteen wells were added by 1891. The city took over the plant in the early 20th century when it found that the Houston Water Works was mixing bayou water into the drinking supply. In 1903, one water pipe was obstructed by a three-foot eel. Three years later, a broken water main gushed water with a supply of catfish. Both events elicited jokes about how the Houston artesian wells were home to schools of eel and catfish. Mayor Horace Baldwin Rice and Houston City Council studied the inventory of Houston infrastructure and concluded that it was inadequate to provide for the needs of its residents. The city assumed control of the Water Works by purchasing the system from Thomas Howe Scanlan's partnership for about $900,000. In addition to the water plant, the city acquired the system's 65 miles of water mains and its 55 wells. Preserved site In 1975, few remains of this facility were extant. There was a masonry reservoir with a concrete cover and some possible remains of the foundation for the old pump house. These are located on the same grounds as the 1926 Bayou Pumping Station.

Whitson designed the eight-story, Sullivan-inspired building. The ground floor was used as a showroom for automobiles, while the other stories were dedicated to office space. It was constructed of concrete with reinforced steel, thus eliminating the need for a large number of piers. The building is also characterized by a great number of windows, covering much of the outer facing. Ornamentation marks the tops of the seventh and first floors. William Clifford Hogg, the eldest son of former Texas Governor Jim Hogg, used the eighth-floor penthouse to manage Hogg Brothers Company and the family's philanthropic projects. In the 1920s, Hogg's workspace was, \\"surrounded by a roof garden lavishly abloom with shrubs and flowers, in a suite of elegantly furnished rooms that included an oval dining room, a kitchen, a living room, and a guest bedroom as well as offices.\\" He decorated the penthouse with his collection of artwork by Frederic Remington.Kirkland, p.213 The Hogg family used the penthouse as a business office until 1941.

She seems to have a perfect life, until she finds out that her father has a terminal disease. He finally admits to Janine that she is the product of an illicit affair, and his dying wish is for her to meet her mother. In Manila, some twenty years ago, Maurice fell in love with a woman named Consuelo, who worked in the home depot he owned. While applying for that job, Consuelo concealed the truth - that she is married and already had a daughter in Quezon - to have a better chance of being hired. Eventually, Consuelo fell for Maurice and this produced a love child, Janine. Consuelo became overcome by guilt so she left Maurice and Janine to return to her family. After Maurice's death, Janine goes to a rural barrio in Quezon to find her mother. Here she encounters copra farm owner Jake Falcon - a brash, self- confident man oozing with sex appeal. Janine's guarded nature immediately clashes with Jake's macho, devil-may-care attitude. An attraction and unspoken sexual tension develops between them. Janine meets Consuelo in the transient house that she runs with her husband Anselmo and their daughter Karla. Janine pretends to be as a student on a research trip and rents a room from them to be able to stay close to her mother. Janine finds it difficult to find the right timing to tell Consuelo about her true identity. She ends up staying in Quezon for a longer time than she originally intended. Circumstances keep causing her to bump into Jake, and soon, she realizes that she is developing strong feelings towards him. She feels comfortable to be herself with Jake, something that she never felt with Matthew. Things get complicated with the arrival of Matthew. He wants Janine to leave Quezon with him. But Janine is undecided: she still wants a closure with Consuelo, and she is now secretly in love with Jake. Jake tells Janine that he isn't going to give up on her so easily. This leads to a passionate sexual encounter. Janine finally decides that she wants to be with Jake, but her happiness is cut short when she finds out that her half-sister Karla is pregnant - and Jake is the father. Janine knows she can never live with herself if she deprives the unborn child of its father, so she urges Jake to do the right thing. Janine decides to leave Quezon, but before she does, she has a talk with Consuelo who had figured out that she is her long-lost daughter. They agree to keep in touch even though they're far away. Back in Cebu, Janine tells Matthew all that has transpired. She wants to be fair to him, so she breaks the engagement. Eventually, Matthew wins her back. In the meantime, Jake does everything to be a good husband and father to Karla and their baby. A tragedy forces Janine and Matthew to return to Quezon. Eventually, Jake and Janine's feelings are rekindled, and Matthew notices this. Matthew becomes possessive in his jealousy. Janine wants to remain faithful to him, but being with Matthew not only stifles her but starts crushing her spirit. Janine realizes that soon, she will have to make a choice. Should she continue honoring her commitment to the man she is supposed to marry, or will she let herself find happiness in a man who loves her selflessly and lets her feel free?

Built in 1806 to house the Gorham Academy, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for its fine Federal period architecture and its importance in local education. Description and history The Academy Building is set on the east side of the USM campus, between University Way and School Street (Maine State Route 114), a short way northwest of the Gorham town center. The campus is set on a hill, and the building's site gives it a commanding view down toward School Street and the town. It is a two-story wood frame structure, about , and is topped by a gable-on-hip roof with a square wooden cupola at it center. The cupola has arched openings showing an open belfry, and is topped by a wooden spire. The building's walls are finished in wooden clapboards, and it rests on a granite foundation. The corners are finished with wooden quoining, and a modillioned cornice extends around all four sides. The main facade faces northeast, and has a detailed Classical style, with a projecting portico supported by four Doric columns and topped by a balustrade. Gorham Academy was established by an act of the state legislature in 1803, as a college preparatory school, and was the seventh to be established in what is now the state of Maine. This building was built by Samuel Elder and completed in 1806. Initially schooling only boys, it underwent several changes, sometimes serving both boys and girls, and sometimes only girls or boys. In its last incarnation, established in 1856 as the Gorham Seminary, it was coeducational. This school closed in 1877. In 1878, the building was sold to the state to be used for the normal college built around it, which became the university. Though on USM's campus, it is not owned by the university; it is the property of Gorham Academy Association.

Images inspired by the Rodgers-Ramachandran and Ramachandran 1998 study stimuli.Rogers-Ramachandran, D. C., & Ramachandran, V. S. (1998). Psychophysical evidence for boundary and surface systems in human vision. Vision Research, 38, 71-77. A phantom contour is a type of illusory contour. Most illusory contours are seen in still images, such as the Kanizsa triangle and the Ehrenstein illusion. A phantom contour, however, is perceived in the presence of moving or flickering images with contrast reversal.Kiely, P. M., Crewther, S. G., & Crewther, D. P. (2007). Threshold recognition of phantom-contour objects requires contrast velocity. Perception & Psychophysics, 69, 1035-1039. The rapid, continuous alternation between opposing, but correlated, adjacent images creates the perception of a contour that is not physically present in the still images. Quaid et al. have also authored a PhD thesis on the phantom contour illusion and it's spatiotemporal limits (University of Waterloo) which maps out limits and proposes mechanisms for its perception centering around magnocellularly driven visual area MT (see also Quaid et al., 2005 on www.pubmed.com).  Example  One example of this illusion involves stimuli consisting of two similar frames, with uniform grey backgrounds: in one frame, the top half contains white dots and the bottom half contains black dots. A second frame contains the reverse of the first frame, in which the white dots of the first frame are replaced with black dots and the black dots are replaced with white dots. The rapid alternation between these two frames reverses the polarity of the dots, while keeping their positions static.Ramachandran, V. S., & Rogers- Ramachandran, D. C. (1991). Phantom contours: A new class of visual patterns that selectively activates the magnocellular pathway in man. Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 29, 391-394 At high temporal frequencies (20 Hz), the alternating frames are perceived as one non-flickering image, where the individual dots are no longer visible, while simultaneously creating the illusion of a distinct border, dividing the top and bottom halves of the display. This perceived border is a phantom contour illusion.  History  Perceived borders similar to the phantom contour, observed via luminance contrasts, were reported in 1987, when Livingstone and Hubel analyzed various aspects of vision, and linked them to the magno- and parvocellular subsystems.Livingstone, M. S., & Hubel, D. H. (1987). Psychophysical evidence for separate channels for the perception of form, color, movement, and depth. The Journal of Neuroscience, 7, 3416-3468. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and D.S. Rogers-Ramachandran's subsequent research, however, helped pare down and solidify the concept of phantom contours.Quaid, P. T., & Flanagan, J. G. (2005). Defining the limits of flicker defined form: Effect of stimulus size, eccentricity and number of random dots. Vision Research, 45, 1075-1084. Their research was also the first use of “texture borders” to induce this illusion. Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran's research has since led to several more papers on the topic, with varying conclusions regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for these illusions, as well as considerations for this illusion's potential link to dyslexia. See Theories of dyslexia.  Magnocellular pathway  One theory suggests that temporal-frequency processing in the magnocellular pathway, an anatomical pathway that originates in the retina, goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and ends in the primary visual cortex, may be connected to the appearance of this illusion (Skottun and Skoyles debated this link in 2006Skottun, B. C., & Skoyles, J. R. (2006). The use of phantom contours to isolate magnocellular and parvocellular responses. International Journal of Neuroscience, 116, 315-320.). The magnocellular pathway is contrast-sensitive, sensitive to motion, and also sensitive to flashing black-to-white edges. Livingstone and Hubel looked at lateral geniculate cells in both the magno- and parvocellular layers, and found responses to luminance contrasts to be much stronger in magnocellular cells. These cells also had better spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the magnocelluar pathway is activated more by peripheral vision, in contrast to the parvocelluar pathway, which is activated more by central vision. Rogers-Ramachandran and Ramachandran tested whether or not this preference for peripheral stimuli in the magnocellular cells would have an effect on phantom contour perception. As was predicted, sparsely spaced objects, which degrade the perception of the contours in central vision, were more easily perceived when subjects adjusted their fixation from 0 to 5 degrees eccentricity. This supports the idea that magnocellular cells are responsible for phantom contour perception under such conditions.  Clinical use  Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran proposed that the phantom contour illusion could be used to test whether or not a person's magnocellular pathway is functioning properly, as well as provide a means for analyzing the role and function of the magnocellular system in general. Loss of magnocellular function can be found in the early stages of glaucoma. Insight into the connection between this illusion and temporal-frequency processing could help us understand underlying mechanisms responsible for certain types of dyslexia (learning impairments in one's reading ability).Taubert, J., & Chekaluk, E. (2008). The effect of temporal and spatial frequency on phantom-contour detection. Deficits in rapid visual processing have been seen in dyslexics and are believed to be linked to deficits in the magnocellular pathway.Livingstone, M. S., Rosen, G. D., Drislane F. W., Galaburda, A.

Differential sensitivities to temporal-frequency processing may play a role in both the perception of phantom contours, as well as certain reading impairments. Sperling et al.Sperling, A. J., Lu, Z. L., & Manis, F. R., Seidenberg, M. S. (2003). Selective magnocellular deficits in dyslexia: a “phantom contour” study. Neuropsychologia, 41, 1422-1429. found that children with phonological dyslexia (a deficit related to coding meaning of soundsystems of language) showed a decreased ability in perceiving phantom contours, and thus, may be experiencing a magnocellular deficit. Additionally, based on rigorous testing of the dyslexics’ reading abilities, which were compared to their inability to process phantom contours, they found a negative correlation between this magnocellular deficit and reading ability, suggesting a link between magnocellular deficits and orthographic processing (storing patterns of letters in the visual processing system). This is consistent with the theory that some dyslexic people may have motion perception deficits. The pan-sensory deficit hypothesis with regard to dyslexics, states that a deficit in processing rapidly changing stimuli may be a congenital deficit in magnocellular or magnocellular-like processing.  Variations   Achromatic vs. chromatic images  Children with dyslexia possess a lower flicker frequency threshold compared to non-dyslexics when the phantom contour images are achromatic (lacking in color). However, when presented with similar images to the black and white dot images mentioned above, but using equiluminant (aka isoluminant) color, in which the luminance of the colors is the same but the hue is not, the illusion disappears for non-dyslexics as well. Adding a luminance difference as small as 10% between the colors, however, re-activates the illusion. This finding suggests that the parvocelluar pathway, which is sensitive to color, is not responsible for this illusion. The magnocelluar pathway, in contrast, is believed to be insensitive to color. Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran compared using equiluminance contours on these tasks to using a psychophysical “scalpel” to separate the visual pathway subsystems based on their functional roles.  Spatial vs. temporal frequency  When the stimuli used to present phantom contours consist of adjacent dark and light achromatic horizontal stripes (squarewave gratings), variations in spatial and temporal frequency can be examined. An increase or decrease in stripe thickness adjusts spatial frequency, and temporal frequency is manipulated by increases and decreases in flicker rate. Findings show that as spatial frequency is increased, sensitivity to temporal frequency decreases. For example, with a temporal frequency of 7 Hz, the spatial frequency required in order for subjects to perceive the phantom contour was 8.96 cycles degree −1. Subjects lost the ability to detect temporal phase when temporal frequency was above 7 Hz, indicating they relied on some other cue to detect phantom contours. This finding suggests that where phantom contours are processed along the visual system may change, depending on which pattern-detection technique is being utilized. Keily et al. looked at stimulus duration, with relation to presentation of flickering images, and found no detection improvement between 34 and 340 milliseconds, suggesting that the first couple of flicker frames are crucial to phantom contour perception.  Stimulus size and number  When analyzing flicker-generated forms, Quaid and Flanagan noted that, as stimulus size increased, phase- contrast thresholds for these phantom contours decreased. Additionally, thresholds decreased as the number of observed stimuli increased. Large sized stimuli paired with a large number of stimuli produced the lowest thresholds of all.  Phantom objects  The perception of phantom contours extends beyond just a straight border between two halves of a frame. Researchers have employed shapes and alphabetical letters to represent this illusion as well.Sperling, A. J., Lu, Z. L., & Manis, F. R., Seidenberg, M. S. (2006). Deficits in achromatic phantom contour perception in poor readers. Neuropsychologia, 44, 1900-1908. The presentation is similar to an Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test (Ishihara color test), but instead of detecting color blindness, this test is intended to detect magnocellular pathway deficits. The contrast reversal at high temporal frequencies eliminates the dot patterns making up the object and the background, thus leaving only the perception of the object border to define the object. As with phantom border tasks, longer exposure times to the flickering images show no enhancement of the illusion, once again indicating that very few frame flickers are needed in order for the illusion to be present. Longer ramp durations (onset and offset times of the stimulus presentation), however, drastically increase thresholds for contour illusion detection and eventually eliminate the perceived illusion completely. Also consistent with the border tasks, converting the images into equiluminant colors eliminates the illusion of these object borders.  Controversy  There is debate as to whether or not flicker rate is the defining characteristic dividing the phantom contours of the magnocellular pathway and the “surface characteristics” of the parvocellular pathway. Surface characteristics are defined as the perception of the absolute temporal phase of the flickering images, which becomes apparent at lower frequencies (5–7 Hz). In other words, surface characteristics are visible when we are able to see the images flickering from one to the other. This perception occurs at lower flicker rates. At high flicker rates, the images appear as one image. Skottun and Skoyles found several potential holes in the theory that the percept of phantom contours represents magnocellular activity, and the percept of surface characteristics represents parvocellular activity. One argument is that the high temporal frequencies used to activate the phantom contour illusion (>15 Hz) are not optimal frequencies for magnocellular neurons. Optimal frequencies for both magno- and parvocellular neurons are similar to each other and are closer to the range of 5–7 Hz, the frequency range where surface characteristics can be seen. Additionally, they claim that, due to a phase-locking response of parvocellular neurons at high temporal frequencies, there are likely other mechanisms at play when perceiving surface characteristics at these higher temporal frequencies. Skottun and Skoyles also question whether the perception of phantom contours is specifically related to luminance. Our inability to process color at high temporal frequencies may be more related to how the parvocellular system functions, rather than being a defining difference between the parvo- and magnocellular systems. Further, they surmise that detection of surface characteristics at low temporal frequencies may be due to processing further on in the visual system, based on the fact that cortical neurons have longer integration times, compared to the subcortical neurons found in the magno- and parvocellular systems. Quaid and Flanagan recommend looking to the dorsal stream for illusory contour processing, claiming that motion-defined-forms may be detected, even with a magnocellular deficit. They also point out that the dorsal stream mediates low contrast, high temporal frequency stimuli, as well as motion, making it a viable candidate for processing this illusion. When addressing the theory that magnocellular deficits play a potential role in dyslexia, Skottun and Skoyles argue that it may be more of an overall temporal processing deficit, not just a magnocelluar deficit. They claim the inability of dyslexic children to process stimuli that change rapidly or occur briefly may be unrelated to the magnocellular system. Ultimately, they conclude that further research is needed to back the theory that phantom contours and surface characteristics are caused by the magnocelluar and parvocellular systems, respectively, and, therefore, it would be wise not to limit one's research of phantom contours and surface characteristics exclusively to the analysis of how the magno- and parvocellular systems function.

From 1950 to 2003, the Soviet Union and its major successor state, Russia, constructed the largest nuclear-powered navy in the world, more ships than all other navies combined: 248 submarines (91 attack submarines, 62 cruise missile submarines, 91 ballistic missile submarines and four research submarines), four Kirov class battlecruisers, and a missile test ship, as well as nine icebreakers. Many were or are powered by two reactors each, bringing the total to 468 reactors. With the end of the Cold War and with its navy chronically underfunded, Russia has decommissioned many of these vessels, and according to one report dated November 2008, intended to scrap all decommissioned submarines (more than 200) by 2012. However, the safety records of the Soviet and Russian navies and the budgetary constraints on the Russian government are matters of great concern. Ships awaiting decommissioning receive little maintenance, and there are insufficient waste storage facilities, raising worries about possible ecological damage from accidents or improper storage. Overview In the midst of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was more concerned about building up its fleet, rather than making provisions for the disposal of aging nuclear-powered vessels. It was not until 1986 that \\"the Central Committee of the Communist party and the Supreme Soviet ratified Decree No. 095-296 which laid down formal procedures for decommissioning and dismantling inactive nuclear submarines.\\" By this time, the first generation November class submarines had been in service for over 20 years. By comparison, the service life expectancy of the more modern Delta IVs is estimated to be between 20 and 30 years with regular overhauls, or 10 to 15 without. Progress was hindered by the large number of government bodies involved, resulting in much confusion and competition. The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 further complicated matters. Russia assumed responsibility for all of the Soviet Navy's nuclear-powered ships, but agreements between agencies responsible for decommissioning had to be renegotiated. The major issues are financial. In 1995, a Northern Fleet submarine based near Murmansk nearly suffered a nuclear meltdown when power was cut off due to unpaid electricity bills. Decommissioned vessels are often left in floating storage until funds can be allocated for their dismantling. As of November 2001, \\"up to 40% of the decommissioned submarines have been in floating storage without much maintenance for more than 10 years\\". The situation has caused concern in other countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and the Scandinavian countries, which have contributed funding and assistance. The Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation (AMEC) was a joint Norwegian, Russian, and American government consortium (later joined by the British) set up to deal with military environmental issues, mainly the dismantling of Russia's nuclear submarine fleet in Europe. After the \\"somewhat acrimonious dissolution\\" of AMEC, the Norwegian and British governments shared the £3.9 million cost of dismantling a November class submarine. Under AMEC's successor, Cooperative Threat Reduction, the British government financed the dismantling of two Oscar I submarines. The Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has been responsible for the deactivation and destruction of many weapons, including 33 nuclear submarines. With the \\"Star of Hope\\" program, Japan has funded the dismantling of five Victor III and one Charlie I submarines in the Far East. Security is also an issue. Russian sailors have been convicted and jailed for two 1993 thefts of highly enriched uranium from fuel rods. In 1994, Russian officials caught two North Korean agents trying to buy submarine dismantlement schedules. Reactor disposal Removing the fuel from a nuclear reactor requires a specially trained team. The coolant is drained first. A reactor must be cooled down for at least three years after its final shutdown before this can be done. The hull above the reactor is then removed, followed by the top shield. The fuel elements are extracted and transported by ship and then rail to a storage facility. The still heavily radioactive reactor compartment can then be cut away. (Most Russian submarines have two reactors, \\"in separate rooms, but in the same compartment.\\") Due to a lack of land storage facilities, two adjoining emptied compartments, one forward and one aft, are usually cut off as well to provide buoyancy for storage on water. In some cases, however, only the reactor compartment is removed, and pontoons attached to keep it afloat. A third method involves filling the reactor compartment with polystyrene for buoyancy. \\"Reactor compartments from Polyarny and other shipyards at the Kola Peninsula and in Severodvinsk, Arkhangelsk county, are towed to Sayda Bay\\". On 10 August 1985, control rods were incorrectly removed from a Victor class submarine during defueling at Chazma Bay naval yard outside Vladivostok, resulting in an explosion, the \\"release of large amounts of radioactivity\\", and ten deaths. In addition to this Victor, five other submarines have damaged cores preventing their defueling by normal methods. A Russian government report acknowledged in March 1993, that \\"during the period of 1965 to 1988 the Northern Fleet had dumped four reactor compartments with eight reactors (three containing damaged fuel) in the Abrosimov Gulf in 20 to 40 meters of water.\\" Six other compartments, containing nine reactors in all, had also been dumped into the water in the 1960s and 1970s. Submarines November class The surviving November class submarines were decommissioned between 1986 and 1990. Several of them have been scrapped already. All of the survivors remain laid- up hulks in Russian naval bases (K-14, K-42, K-115 and K-133 of the Pacific Fleet; K-11 and K-21 of the Northern Fleet). There are plans to convert the first submarine of the class (K-3) into a museum ship in St. Petersburg, but the hulk remains in Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast, due to economic reasons and the \\"radiophobia\\" of some ecological organizations. K-5 was defueled at the naval yard at Polyarny in November 1966. According to one source, the shipyard \\"likely dismantled\\" the submarine the same year. K-27 was an experimental attack submarine of the November class that went into service in October 1963. A reactor malfunction on 24 May 1968 resulted in the release of radioactive gas into the engine room and fatal exposures to nine crewmen. Replacing the reactor was considered and discarded. K-27 was officially decommissioned on 1 February 1979. \\"The empty spaces of the reactor and equipment associated with the reactor ... were filled with a solidifying radiation-resistant preservative\\" and she was scuttled off the northeastern coast of Novaya Zemlya on 6 September 1982. K-159 sank in the Barents Sea on 30 August 2003, while being towed to be scrapped, killing nine crewmen and depositing of reactor fuel on the seabed. Hotel class All eight Hotel class submarines were decommissioned for scrapping between 1987 and 1991. One undated article placed one at Sevmorput Naval Shipyard No. 35 in Murmansk. As of February 2003, two were reported to be at Russian Shipyard Number 10 at Polyarny. Echo class The 34 Echo class submarines were decommissioned for scrapping between 1985 and 1995. According to the Federation of American Scientists, one or possibly two Echo Is were decommissioned in the mid-1980s and the remaining three or four in 1990. The 29 Echo IIs were all decommissioned by the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2002, a nuclear submarine caught fire during dismantlement at Sevmorput; according to the Bellona Foundation, this was probably the Echo II K-22. Fortunately, the reactor compartment had already been removed, and there was no danger of radioactive contamination. Papa class On 4 June 2010, Voice of Russia reported that K-222, the sole member of the Papa class, had been scrapped at Severodvinsk. Yankee class As a result of the SALT I and START I/II treaties, 33 of the 34 boats of the Yankee class have been decommissioned. K-219 was lost on 6 October 1986 after an explosion and fire near Bermuda. The Bellona Foundation reported on 7 February 2003 that: *K-214 had been dismantled at Sevmash shipyard \\"as an experiment to determine whether the yard can handle such operations.\\" *ten were dismantled at Zvezdochka shipyard: K-216, K-415, K-137, K-140, K-210, K-228, K-444, K-221, K-418, and K-32 Delta class All 18 Delta I boats were taken out of service by 1998 and scrapped by 2005, while the four Delta IIs were taken out of service in 1996. Some of the Delta IIIs have been decommissioned and others put in reserve. Five remain in active service, along with all seven Delta IVs. Delta Is K-279, K-385, K-472 and K-475, Delta II K-193, and Delta IIIs K-441 and K-424 were reported dismantled at Zvezdochka shipyard. Charlie class The 11 Charlie Is and seven Charlie IIs were decommissioned for scrapping between 1990 and 1994. On 4 June 1997, a Charlie \\"sank in a harbor on the Kamchatka Peninsula\\". However, a local official reported that the reactor core had already been removed. On 21 November 2005, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reached an agreement to dismantle five decommissioned nuclear submarines, among them a Charlie I, the latter \\"the first project in Kamchatka under the Japan-Russia cooperation framework.\\" Victor class According to some sources, all 16 Victor Is and seven Victor IIs were decommissioned by 1996. One cited \\"various sources\\" in estimating that \\"somewhere between 8 and 15 [Victor IIIs] had been decommissioned due to lack of funds in the 1999-2000 timeframe\\" while another placed the number at \\"about a dozen\\" (of the 26 built) by 1996. In February 2003, under the Russian-Japanese \\"Star of Hope\\" program, Japan spent $6 million to dismantle a Victor III of Russia's Pacific Fleet; the job was completed in December 2004. Another 20 billion yen ($171 million) was allocated to dismantle four Victor IIIs at the Zvezda shipyard in the town of Bolshoi Kamen and a Charlie I at Vilyuchinsk, Kamchatka (as previously mentioned). Alfa class K-64, the first of seven Alfa class submarines, joined the Soviet Navy in December 1971. The following year, however, \\"the K-64 suffered a major reactor problem when the liquid metal in the primary coolant hardened\\". Her hull was cut in half in 1973-1974 at Sverodvinsk, the forward portion being sent to Leningrad to be used for training, the reactor compartment being kept at Zvezdochka. The remaining boats were decommissioned for scrapping, five in 1990 and one in 1996.Podvodnaya lodka-istrebitel Pr.705(705K), special issue \\"Tayfun\\", Sankt Peterburg, 2002 As of February 2003, K-463, K-316, K-432 and K-493 had been dismantled at Sevmash, with the remaining two at Bolshaya Lopatka, Zapadnaya Litsa, awaiting the same fate. The Alfa reactors use a liquid metal coolant that must be kept at a temperature over 123°C to avoid solidifying; a 2002 paper reports that the coolant in both K-123 and K-373 has solidified. An Alfa reactor compartment was reported in November 1997 as being at \\"an open site on Yagry island in Severodvinsk\\". Oscar class The two Oscar Is were decommissioned in 1996. By 2006, it was reported that their dismantling, funded by the United Kingdom under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, had been completed at Sevmash shipyard. Two or possibly three Oscar IIs \\"were inactivated in the late 1990s, and as of mid-2000 were laid up awaiting disposal.\\" Typhoon class Three of the six Typhoons have been scrapped. TK-202 was deactivated in 1997, and was laid up from July 1999 at the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk. With funding from the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the defueling of her reactors started in June 2002 at the Zvezdochka shipyard. Scrapping was completed in 2003-2005. TK-12 was withdrawn from active service in 1996, and scrapped in 2006-2008. TK-13 was withdrawn from active service in 1997, and scrapped in 2007-2009, \\"funded by Russia, USA and Canada as part of the program 'Global partnership'\\". In September 2011, the Russian defense ministry announced it will decommission and dismantle the three remaining boats to comply with the START III treaty and because the newer Borei class submarines require smaller crews and are less costly to maintain. Akula class K-284 Akula, the lead ship of the , \\"was decommissioned in 1995 to avoid the expense of a reactor refueling\\". Surface ships NS Lenin, the world's first nuclear-powered surface and civilian ship, was decommissioned in 1989. It was subsequently converted to a museum ship. Of the six Arktika class icebreakers, two are no longer in service. NS Arktika was taken out of service and had its reactor removed in 2008. NS Sibir was taken out of service in 1992 due to a problem in the vessel’s steam generation system. The Barents Observer reported on 3 November 2008 that the Russian authorities were preparing to decommission and scrap Sibir. In 2010, the deputy chief engineer of Atomflot, the Russian nuclear fleet operator, reported that \\"all radioactive [materials] have been unloaded\\" from Siber, but the \\"decommissioning decision has not been made yet, however.\\" References External links * Category:Russian Navy Category:Environmental impact of nuclear power Category:Ship disposal Category:Murmansk Oblast ","title":"Decommissioning of Russian nuclear-powered vessels"},{"id":"34000843","text":"Death in children's literature has changed over the course of history as both the average lifespan has increased and society's morals and beliefs and conceptions of children have changed. Early history Until about the 17th century, there was very little literature written specifically for children.Butler, Francelia. (1972) Death in Children’s Literature. Children’s Literature v.1(1), 104-124. Oral storytelling and music accepted death as a matter-of-fact for both children and adults alike. Since mortality rates for children were much higher then, the subject was not taboo. The restoration of life, life as a preparation for death, death as a form of sleep, immortality, animals sacrificing themselves for humans, love as a conqueror of death, and inanimate objects that come to life were all common themes. Examples of the changing approach to death include: The Juniper Tree by the Brothers Grimm, in which a boy is murdered by his stepmother, but comes back as a bird and kills the stepmother. The bird then turns back into a boy and is reunited with his father and sister. The stepmother, though, does not come back to life. Morality lesson Andrew Lang's Fairy Books series contains numerous stories with references to death. In one instance, the reader is encouraged to live a good or “perfect” life in order to go to Heaven after death. In others, both animals and humans gain immortality. Already the concept that bad people stay dead and good, loving people return to life is evident. A better-known example is Sleeping Beauty, in which a character's death is just a sleep that is conquered by love. These themes are also seen in the Slavic story Firebird and the retold versions of Le Morte d’Arthur by William Caxton and Robin Hood by Howard Pyle. Faith is also a factor in life and death. A well-known example is John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, originally written for children. Life is a journey of faith that will end at the gates of heaven. Those having lived a good (in this case Christian) life, enter. In Hans Christian Andersen’s original Little Mermaid, the character must endure a journey, suffering and ultimately death for others, after which she is rewarded with an immortal soul. Aesop’s Fables also contain such references both in the versions written exclusively for adults and those for both children and adults. Early humor Often death has even been the subject of jokes, such as in the various versions of The Yellow Ribbon, in which a young girl wears a yellow ribbon around her neck and a young boy asks her about it, but she puts him off. The two grow up together and eventually marry with the boy/man often asking her about the ribbon, but she continues to disregard the subject as “not important” or “not the right time”. Finally when they are very old, she consents to have him untie the ribbon, and her head falls off. In Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, she jokes that if she falls and dies, she will be \\"quite a story back home\\". There is also the Mother Goose rhyme in which Humpty Dumpty falls and dies, because he is an egg that breaks and can not be re-built. Scientific approach Later this somewhat philosophical or spiritual approach would be replaced by a more scientific approach wherein the illusion of death as a form of sleep is denied and the decomposition of bodies is discussed. This viewpoint may have been popularized by Puritan beliefs that death is a punishment for sin. In favor of this argument would be such texts as James Janeway’s nonfiction A Token for Children: An Exact Account of the Conversion, Holy and Exemplary Lives and Joyful Deaths of Several Young Children.Gibson, Lois Rauch and Zaidman, Laura M. (1991) Death in Children’s Literature: Taboo or Not Taboo? Children’s Literature Association Quarterly v.16(4): 232-234. While life is still shown as fragile, emphasis is placed on the importance of salvation rather than on fantastical alternatives of rebirth as animals, immortality and such. Louisa May Alcott’s well-known Little Women alludes to the story of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress at the same time that she shows the characters, including one who dies, on a journey through the house. Even in this story one can see that opinions are changing as death becomes less of an expectation in society. 20th century to present Death as plot device Death becomes more of a plot device at this time, such as in Frances Hodgson Burnett’s A Little Princess and The Secret Garden. Sarah Crewe’s parents die and she is sent to an orphanage. Mary Lennox’s parents are killed and she is sent to live with her uncle, who is still grieving for his wife and unwilling to even meet his son for fear that he will die as well. In Bambi, the focal point of the story is the title character's survival through his mother's sacrifice. In these examples, death is treated much more subtly, alluded to as something that happened previously, not something to discuss frankly with children. In 1958, Margaret Wise Brown published The Dead Bird, a simple picture book in which children find a dead bird. Just a few years later, children would hear about the deaths in the Vietnam War and the various political assassinations. These historical events may have had an effect on why some parents and educators now agree that death is a “fact of life” that is acceptable for children to be introduced to. At the same time, the cold, impersonal treatment of death begins to disappear in favor of the previous themes of leading a good life, love overcoming death, immortality, inanimate objects having or obtaining life, sacrificing one's life for others, and other such moral or \\"uplifting\\" themes. Still, even in the death-related books published in the 1970s and 1980s, feelings about death are discussed with children only 35% of the time and comfort was slightly more likely to be physical (54%) than verbal (48%).Seibert, D. and Drolet, J.C. (1993) Death Themes in Literature for Children Ages 3–8. Journal of School Health v.63(2), 86-90. Continuance In The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein, a tree sacrifices itself for a boy it loves. Then later, the boy returns as an old man to the tree stump and the two comfort each other. In Charlotte’s Web by E.B. White, the pig Wilbur is afraid of death and the spider, Charlotte, spends her life creating messages in her web in order to save him. When she dies, “she lives on through her 500 offspring” and through the love of Wilbur. In C.S. Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, an allegory to the Christian belief in Jesus, the lion Aslan sacrifices himself for the Pevensie children and later resurrects in time to vanquish the White Witch. In Natalie Babbitt’s Tuck Everlasting, the Tucks have the fountain of eternal youth, but Winnie Foster chooses not to partake in this “life without death”. Katherine Paterson’s character Jess in Bridge to Terabithia is confused over the accidental death of his friend, Leslie. In A Taste of Blackberries by Doris Buchanan Smith, a child dies from an allergic reaction. In Admission to the Feast by Gunnel Beckman, and in Kira-Kira by Cynthia Kadohata, a young character dies of cancer. In The Tenth Good Thing about Barney by Judith Viorst, the last good thing about the deceased cat, Barney, is that his decaying body helps the flowers to grow – a sort of “natural immortality”.Corr, Charles A. (2003) Pet Loss in Death-Related Literature for Children. Omega-Journal of Death and Dying v.48(4): 399-414. Introduction of death concept The death of animals with or without human personalities is a popular way to introduce the topic to younger children. The death of an animal or inanimate object such as a plant made up 2% of the deaths in literature for children ages three to eight written in the 1970s and 1980s. In Hemery's Not Just a Fish, a young girl's fish dies and the girl deals with both her grief and the sympathy or disregard of others. This book actually shows a new trend that exists in society: adults disregard for, or ignorance of, the grief of children. In Tough Boris by Fox, a character shown previously as a gruff, fearless pirate is grief-stricken when his parrot dies. In Viorst's The Tenth Good Thing About Barney, a child is challenged to think of good things about a lost pet named Barney, while he and his family prepare for memorial activities. The use of animals allows the authors to broach the subject of replacing a loved one, such as in Charlotte’s Web when Charlotte's memory lives on through her children. More examples are available in The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, The Black Stallion by Walter Farley, Old Yeller by Fred Gipson and Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. One hypothesis for shielding children from death is that with the advent of modern medicine and changing attitudes about family, death is more removed from our lives than ever before. For example, in Zolotow's My Grandson Lew, a mother must admit to her six-year-old son that his grandfather and namesake has died and she did not tell him.Corr, Charles A. (2003) Spirituality in Death-Related Literature for Children. Omega-Journal of Death and Dying v.48(4): 365-381. Despite all the above examples having more the feel of the earlier themes of death, there are still scientific or formulaic approaches to death available for children, such as in the workbooks, They’re Part of the Family: Barklay and Eve Talk to Children About Pet Loss and Saying Goodbye to Your Pet: Children Can Learn to Cope with Grief. Religious perspectives still play a role in the treatment of death. An estimated 40% of literature for children ages 3 to 8 written in the 1970s and 1980s gave indications of religious beliefs. While only 16% included affirmation of those beliefs, none include disapproval. In one instance, a text even came under fire for being too vague in its description of the religious aspect of death: some readers took offense to Maria Shriver’s What’s Heaven?, because it did not specifically mention Jesus and because it did not dwell on whether or not everyone went to heaven. Boritzer’s What is Death?, published only a year later, seems to be a response of sorts to this issue since it shows a variety of opinions on death. The lack of specifics does not appear to affect the popularity of Lifetimes: A Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children by Mellonie and Ingpen. The universality of death is a subject in The Big Wave by Pearl Buck and The Fall of Freddie the Leaf by Buscaglia. A study of 110 books written in the 1970s and 1980s for children ages 3 to 8 concluded that 85% were fiction, but in 80% of the books, the information about death was considered correct and death was presented as final. In only 28% of the books was the death considered an inevitability. In the 72% that included physical details of death, burial was most frequently mentioned. After that, the category of items most likely to be mentioned (in order) were the dead body, a complete lack of physical details, the casket, and the funeral home. Other identifiers such as the headstone, organ donation, morgue, coroner, death records and/or laws, the grave or cemetery, embalming and autopsy, and related themes were rarely, if ever, mentioned. While \\"life after death\\" is only the subject of 31% of the books written for 3 to 8 year-olds that included death between 1970 and 1989, the focus of ongoing memory as a method of immortality is seen in many texts, such as The Tenth Good Thing About Barney, mentioned above. In Dusty Was My Friend by Clardy, a boy dies in an auto accident and the family shares their experiences and memories in order to continue with life. In Mick Harte Was Here by Barbara Park, a girl loses her brother to a bicycle accident because he did not have a helmet, and so she makes it her mission to remind people to wear helmets. In Badger’s Parting Gifts, by Varley, an old badger knows he will die and is concerned with giving his friends special memories to remember him. Realistic approach Since the 1960s, literature for children is increasingly more realistic and “problem oriented”, so death is just one of many topics approached.Moore, Timothy E. and Mae, Reet (1987) Who Dies and Who Cries: Death and Bereavement in Children’s Literature. Journal of Communication v.37(4): 52-64. For example, John Gunther’s Death Be Not Proud is more realistic than many of the death-related texts written prior.Walker, M.E. and Jones, J. (1986) When children die: death in current children’s literature and its use in a library. Bulletin of the Medical Library Association v.74(1): 16-18. However, some studies have shown that there are gender factors affecting how the characters react to death and the experiences they have. According to the article Who Dies and Who Cries, by Moore and Mae, males are more likely to show no visible signs of grief while females are more likely to express grief, particularly by crying. However males are slightly more likely to show anger and both are equally likely to socially withdraw at first. Also, the reactions to long-term grief are less likely to be shown in all cases. This can be seen in the more graphic details of deaths often depicted in texts aimed at males such as in My Brother Sam is Dead by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier. Not only are the responses to death not even, neither are the subjects of death. In the literature for children ages 3 to 8 written in the 1970s and 1980s, where someone died, 51% of the deaths were adults, 28% were animals or plants and only 9% were children (six books). Of the adults who died, 91% were “grandparent age” and 9% were \\"parent age\\". However, when children died they were more likely to be elementary school age (67%) than high school age (33%). Of the deaths described, 74% were relatives, versus 21% who were non-relatives. The gender of the person dying was about even. Often, the place or cause of death is not mentioned (42% and 49% respectively). Though it is estimated that at least half of actual deaths occur at a hospital or nursing home, hospitals were the location for only 12% of deaths in the studied books. Diseases such as heart disease or pneumonia, accidents and old age were the most likely causes, while seasonal changes, suicide and war accounted for three deaths.

The station was built in 1911 to serve passenger and freight traffic along the Oregon Trunk Railway, which provided a railway connection for towns in central Oregon. The station building has a Stick Style design and was built to a standard station plan used by the line. As the railroad entered a canyon on the Deschutes River near Metolius, it became an important station on the line, as its railway yard housed the pusher locomotives needed to help trains out of the canyon. The railway opened up previously inaccessible land to homesteaders; some of these homesteaders settled in the Metolius area, while others traveled further down the line to Redmond and Bend. The station closed in 1983; by then it served the Burlington Northern Railroad, which sold the building to the city of Metolius the next year. Accompanied by photos.

It provides for the active involvement of stakeholder in the program: providers, partners, beneficiaries, and any other interested parties. All involved decide how to frame the questions used to evaluate the program, and all decide how to measure outcomes and impact. It is often used in international development.Community-based public health policy & practice, Issue #5, April 2002http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS539.pdf  Participatory evaluation in international development  Participatory evaluation in development, is part of the new wave of grassroots development in which local stakeholders have a more valuable role in the development process. Participatory evaluation methods, in comparison to more mainstream evaluation practices, make space for input from locals who have a specialized and more personal set of knowledge on the community's needs. In this context, the term \\"locals\\" can include local governments, local non-governmental organizations, local civil society organizations, and local citizens, among various other actors. In the past, evaluation methods in development have been more quantitative in nature, placing more importance on donor-needs and measurable indicators, but participatory evaluation creates more room for multiple stakeholders to provide much needed input. This strategy can increase the overall accuracy and complexity of monitoring and evaluation in development projects, generating more sustainable outcomes. The key idea is that stakeholders, meaning all groups with both an interest and that are affected by the project, are given an opportunity to provide feedback. The hope is then that the feedback will be implemented in good faith. Participatory evaluation is an extension of participatory development theory. Participatory evaluation methods have been used at all scales of development projects, including in small-scale businesses as well as large-scale projects. Within these contexts, stakeholders are involved at all levels of the development process, including planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Other benefits to applying participatory evaluation to international development include an increase in local ownership, higher empowerment rates for all involved parties, more diverse analysis methods, increase in accuracy to local realities, improvements in impacts of development efforts. Participatory evaluation has also been applied beyond international development aid, and having been involved in humanitarian intervention and aid efforts thus increasing the transparency, accountability, and opportunities to learn. Depending on contexts, participatory evaluation methodologies can vary. Projects can involve active stakeholder participation at every step of the evaluation process; they can control the evaluation process while keeping stakeholders informed and discussing when needed; or projects can train and prep stakeholders to take on development initiatives by learning throughout the evaluation process. Within the international development context, participatory evaluation is not without challenges. Since stakeholders are such a crucial element to participatory evaluation, a major challenge to this method is ensuring that the right groups have been included in evaluation methods. Further still, the challenge is identifying what practices and data collection methods work best when collaborating with stakeholders, especially when working with multiple stakeholder groups that have clashing values and objectives. Another challenge to implementing participatory evaluation methods is maintaining the balance in power dynamics between different stakeholders of the development project, including the evaluation team itself. As part of project teams, evaluation teams hold an authoritative position and these evaluators have the potential to hold more power than local stakeholders. Ultimately, this power balance can be reflected by skewed results. Advantages * Identify locally relevant questions. * Improve program performance * Empower participants * Build capacity * Develop leaders and build teams * Sustain organizational learning and growth Disadvantages  * Time and commitment of all involved * Resource-intensive during evaluation * Conflict resolution may be needed Characteristics * Participant focus and ownership * Negotiation * Learning * Flexibility Applications It is a form of community-based participatory research and participatory action research. The evaluation is designed for the people involved in a program as well as its funders, with the hope that results of the evaluation get used rather than sitting on a program funder's shelf. Tools for monitoring and evaluation in program development, including international development, such as creating a logic model or outcome mapping, can be forms of participatory evaluation if stakeholders are involved. This method is endorsed by the United Nationshttp://www.unesco.org/education/aladin/paldin/pdf/course01/unit_09.pdf and is used in the development programs of many countries including Canada,http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/3/35135226.pdf the US and New Zealand.http://nzaidtools.nzaid.govt.nz/participatory-evaluation Practitioners of participatory evaluation in academia include Clemencia Rodriguez and Barry Checkoway.

He played college football at Texas A&M;, and was recognized as the nation's best college football kicker and a consensus All-American. He was selected by the Houston Texans in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, after winning college football's Lou Groza Award. Bullock is currently the 27th most accurate placekicker in NFL history. Early years Bullock was born in Lafayette, Louisiana. He grew up in Klein, Texas, which is in the Houston area. He attended Klein High School, where he played football. Bullock was the fourth- ranked kicker in the nation coming out of high school with at least six formal collegiate scholarship offers. Bullock attended Texas A&M; University, where he played for the Texas A&M; Aggies football team from 2008 to 2011. After completing 29 of his 33 field goal attempts during his 2011 senior season, he received the Lou Groza Award, given annually to the best college football placekicker. He was also recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 2011. Bullock is the all-time scoring leader at Texas A&M; University with 365 points in 46 collegiate games. His 63 field goals is also a Texas A&M; record during his tenure in College Station. He still holds the records for consecutive extra points and most extra points in Texas A&M; history. Bullock returned to Texas A&M; to finish his petroleum engineering degree at the conclusion of his rookie season on injured reserve. Professional career Houston Texans The Houston Texans selected Bullock in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, with the 161st overall pick, becoming the first kicker ever drafted by the team. His draft profiles agreed that he has tremendous leg strength for field goals and kickoffs, along with his accuracy on long and short kicks. NFL draft analysts noted that Bullock takes a consistent, controlled approach to each kick, getting enough rise to avoid blocks. Bullock was competing with veteran Shayne Graham for the placekicker position. He had made 3 of 4 field goal attempts in the preseason, with the majority of his attempts coming from longer than 50 yards. Bullock's rookie season abruptly ended on August 26, 2012, when he was placed on injured reserve with a groin tear. Bullock fully recovered from his injury, without losing leg strength, and won the kicking job the following season. During the 2013 preseason, Bullock hit 6 of 7 field goal attempts, including one from 55 yards.Randy Bullock settling in after missing entire rookie season. Houston Chronicle. August 25, 2013. In the game against the San Diego Chargers during Week 1 of the 2013 regular season, Bullock hit the game-winning field goal from 41 yards to cap the biggest comeback in Texans history.Schaub keyed Texans' biggest comeback in franchise history, Kubiak says. Houston Chronicle. September 10, 2013. However, in week 2 against the Tennessee Titans, he missed three long field goals (from 50, 50, and 46 yards). In Week 9 against the Indianapolis Colts, he missed three field goals, including a 55-yard attempt in the final seconds of the game; the Texans lost by a score of 27–24. After early struggles in only two of his 2013 games, Bullock showed his mental toughness by finishing the 2013 season strong and making 12 consecutive field goals. He continued his success streak into the 2014 season, breaking the record for the most consecutive field goals in Texans' franchise history (16). The streak came to an end due to a blocked field goal on a missed blocking assignment against the Oakland Raiders. This streak did not include Bullock's perfect preseason with the Texans in 2014 finishing 100% (4/4) with field goals, including a long kick of 52 yards, and 100% (4/4) with extra points. Bullock was reliable with his misses typically coming on field goal attempts beyond 50 yards in 2013. During the 2014 season, he finished the season as the 6th- ranked NFL kicker based on his performance of making 30 of 35 field goal attempts in the regular season, with a long of 55 yards. He made 4 of 5 attempts (80%) beyond 50 yards that season. He also converted 100% of his 40 extra point attempts. Bullock added 40 touchbacks in the 2014 regular season, the 12th most in the NFL that year. On December 20, 2014, against the Baltimore Ravens, Bullock set a Texans' franchise record for most field goals in a game, making all six field goal attempts as well as setting another franchise record for most points in a single game (19), en route to leading the Texans to a 25–13 win. Bullock also was awarded the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In 2015, when a rule change lengthened the distance from which an extra point is attempted, Bullock was tied for first among all NFL placekickers in preseason field goal success percentage with a perfect 5 field goals in 5 attempts, and a 100% success rate of 7/7 on the extra point attempts. Bullock was the first kicker to miss an extra point, but remained a combined (preseason and regular season) 10/11 (91%) on field goals and 10/12 (83.3%) on PATs in 2015. On September 29, 2015, the Texans released Bullock and signed Nick Novak to replace him, despite being ranked among the Top (10) NFL kickers in terms of field goal percentage making 4 of 5 attempts. The lone 2015 field goal miss was a 43-yard attempt that hit the right upright in the Texans' Week 3 win over Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Bullock had 10 touchbacks on 13 kickoff attempts (77%) with the Houston Texans in 2015, keeping him in the Top 7 of NFL kickers by touchback percentage after Week 3. Nearly 20% of his field goal attempts as a member of the Texans were 50+ yards, well above the NFL average, as the Texans struggled on offense from 2013 to 2015, often failing to reach the red zone. New York Jets On November 10, 2015, Bullock was signed as a free agent by the New York Jets after veteran Nick Folk suffered a quadriceps injury the previous game and was placed on injured reserve. On December 6, 2015, Bullock scored 11 points against the New York Giants, including the game-winning attempt in overtime. On December 19, 2015, Bullock kicked two field goals, including the game-winner against the Dallas Cowboys. Bullock missed an extra point and a field goal against Dallas. On December 27, 2015 Bullock scored 8 points against the New England Patriots, including a 49-yard attempt to tie the game in the final minutes of the 4th quarter. New York Giants On August 22, 2016, Bullock was signed by the New York Giants. On September 13, 2016, Bullock was released by the Giants after the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. Bullock was only needed for one game due to the suspension of Josh Brown. Pittsburgh Steelers On December 3, 2016, Bullock was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers after Chris Boswell was questionable with an injury. Bullock actually won the Houston Texans' kicking job over Boswell in 2014. On December 4, 2016, Bullock made his Steelers debut during a 24-14 victory over the New York Giants and completed field goals from 34 yards, 38 yards, and 44 yards while also making an extra point and three touchbacks. On December 12, the Steelers released Bullock due to the return of Boswell after being on the active roster for just two games and earning the game ball from Mike Tomlin in one of those. Cincinnati Bengals On December 13, 2016, Bullock was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals after the team cut Mike Nugent following his struggles. On December 18, 2016, Bullock was 2-for-2 on field goals, 2-for-2 on extra points, and made a touchdown-saving tackle on return-man Sammie Coates after a few missed Bengal tackles in a loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers. On December 24, 2016, Bullock missed a 43-yard field goal attempt as time expired, which gave his former team the Houston Texans the 12–10 win and a playoff spot. On January 26, 2017, Bullock signed a two-year contract extension with the Bengals. On September 14, 2017, in Week 2, Bullock converted three field goals and was responsible for all of the offensive scoring against the Houston Texans in a 13–9 loss. On September 18, 2018, Bullock signed a two-year contract extension with the Bengals through the 2020 season. On December 22, 2019, Bullock made a career-long field goal of 57 yards against the Miami Dolphins. The conversion was the longest field goal in Bengals franchise history.

His eldest daughter was the author and composer, Alma Mahler.  Life  He was born to a family of cotton spinning-mill operators that had been established in Fischamend, a village south of Vienna, since the 17th century. His father, Julius Jakob Schindler (1814–1846), died of lung cancer when Emil was only four years old. His mother, Maria Anna (née Penz, 1816-1886) soon afterwards took him to Pressburg (Bratislava). Three years later, on 10 February 1849, she married Second Lieutenant (later Captain), Mathias Eduard Nepalleck (1815–1873), who served in the local 2nd Hungarian Infantry Regiment. This may have been a forced marriage because, one month after the wedding, she gave birth to a daughter, Alexandrine Nepalleck (3 March 1849–4 September 1932). Eine Waldschmiede Little is known about Schindler's early life. He probably began school in 1848, took piano lessons, and prepared for a military career. He did, in fact, join the army in 1857, and may have taken part in the Battle of Solferino. Not long after, however, he left the army and, in 1860, entered the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where he studied with Albert Zimmermann.* He found his inspiration, however, in the Dutch Masters such as Meindert Hobbema and Jacob Izaaksoon van Ruisdael. In 1873, he travelled to Venice and Dalmatia; a trip sponsored by the industrialist Friedrich Franz von Leitenberger (1837–1899). Later, he visited France and Holland. In the spring of 1864, barely twenty-two years old, he exhibited publicly in Vienna for the first time, and sold his first painting, \\"Eine Waldschmiede\\" (A Forest Blacksmith) for 350 Gulden. After moving about, in 1867 he was able to find a permanent home in Landstraße, where he was registered as an \\"Historienmaler\\" (History painter). Two years later, he relocated to Wieden, where many artists lived, including one of Schindler's favorites, Hans Makart. When his step-father died, he took a larger apartment where his mother and half-sister soon joined him. Musical pastimes and marriage Schindler often took part in the evening feasts held at the Vienna Künstlerhaus. This prompted him to take singing lessons with Gustav Geiringer (1856–1945), a pianist and voice teacher. Later, he studied with Adele Passy- Cornet, a former opera soprano who had opened her own singing school in Mariahilf. This gave him the confidence to perform publicly and was briefly a member of a popular quartet led by . During this time, he took on Tina Blau as a student and, from 1875 to 1876, they shared a studio. A burgeoning personal relationship apparently led to a quarrel and she left. The following year, however, he was preparing an amateur performance of Lenardo and Blandine, an opera by Franz Mögele (1834-1907) when his half-sister Alexandrine, who had the leading role, was suddenly taken ill and Schindler asked Passy-Cornet to find a stand-in. She presented him to one of her new pupils, a twenty-year old German girl, Anna Sofie Bergen (1857-1938). Anna was accepted and, while working with Schindler, they fell in love. In 1878, their engagement was announced in the Viennese daily '. Her professional career proved to be very short-lived. After six performances in the title role of Die Wallfahrt der Königin (The Queen's Pilgrimage) a comic opera by Josef Forster, she suddenly retired, either because Schindler strongly opposed her public appearances out of jealousy or because she was pregnant. They were married in 1879 and, a month later, appeared together for the first and last time in another work by Mögele, the operetta Ritter Toggenburg. In August of that year, Anna gave birth to Alma Magaretha Maria, who would later become famous as Alma Mahler. A second daughter, Margaretha Julie (Grete), was born a year later. She led a less fortunate life and, in 1942, died at a mental hospital in Großschweidnitz. Anna Schindler with Alma (left) and Grete (c. 1890)  Infidelity allegations  Shortly after Alma's birth, Anna was suspected of having an affair with the painter, Julius Victor Berger. Two years after Grete's birth, she was accused of carrying on another affair with Carl Moll, one of her husband's students. Schindler kept a diary in those years which is preserved in part by the Austrian National Library. Extracts were also published in a book by Moll (Emil Jakob Schindler, Vienna 1930). In an entry of 15 October 1879, 1½ months after Alma’s birth, Schindler complained that his joy at the birth was tempered by \\"separation\\" from his wife. This was apparently resolved but, in an unpublished manuscript by Alma, Der schimmernde Weg (The Shimmering Road) she claims that Berger was Grete's real father. However, the facts in the case are confusing, and no conclusion has been reached. Many explanations have been proposed as to why she never had any more children with Schindler because, after his death, she married Moll and gave birth to another daughter (Maria) at the age of 42.Brief biography of Bergen @ Alma Mahler website.  Later life and successes  In 1881, he was awarded the which came with a cash award of 1,500 Gulden, enabling the family to rent a large new apartment that was previously occupied by Passy-Cornet, who had moved to Budapest. Winning the prize also served to attract more clients and their financial condition continued to improve. From 1885 onwards, he rented the Castle Plankenberg, near Neulengbach, where he spent his summers and established an artists' colony. He had several students there, including Marie Egner, his former studio mate Tina Blau, Olga Wisinger-Florian and Luise Begas-Parmentier. Two years later (1887), he received a commission from Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria to sketch the coastal scenery in Dalmatia and on the island of Corfu, as part of a grand project called The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in Word and Picture. That same year, he became an honorary member of the Vienna Academy. In 1888, the Munich Academy followed suit. Schindler monument by Hellmer Schindler adored his two daughters, and at an early age, arranged for piano lessons with , who taught them for several years. They had their debut in 1890, aged ten and nine. He also made certain they received a full education, which was not common practice at the time, and sent them to a private women's academy after becoming displeased with the public schools. He also tried his hand at writing, producing a five act verse drama entitled Anna (1890, not about his wife), which was never published, and art criticism under the pen name \\"Justus\\". His feelings about the Viennese schools prompted him to write an essay: \\"On School Education\\".  Death and cultural impact  His death is generally attributed to appendicitis,Brief biography @ Niederösterreich Museum which he had left untreated for too long while on vacation. However, his death certificate, as published in the Wiener Zeitung, gives the cause as paralytic ileus. His family and Moll were present at his death bed. He is buried in the churchyard of Ober Sankt Veit in Hietzing. An auction of his works, arranged by Moll and the art dealer, H. O. Miethke (1834-1911), produced a net profit of 80,000 Gulden. In 1895, the city of Vienna gave him an \\"Ehrengrab\\" (Honour Grave) at the Zentralfriedhof, with a tombstone designed by his friend, Edmund Hellmer, who also created a statue for the Stadtpark. In 1894, a street in the Währing District had been named after him. In 1912, Moll, who was now director of the in Vienna, held their first solo exhibition of Schindler's paintings, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his death.

After 11 July 1934, it was a public corporation of the Reich. It was financed largely by business donations. The academy's members were prominent representatives of politics, business and academia, including Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Carl Bosch, Friedrich Flick, Carl Schmitt, and Hans Carl Nipperdey; its presidents were Hans Frank (1933—1943) and Otto Georg Thierack (1942—1945). Frank's original goal for the academy — influence on National Socialist legislation — did not prevail because the ministerial bureaucracies successfully defended their prerogatives. The academy developed extensive representative and publishing activities. By holding attractive international congresses, it contributed to the reputation of the Third Reich. Its committees attempted to develop the foundations for a new NS law (Volk Law Code).

It has the largest collection of heritage apple varieties on mainland Australia, including more than two hundred varieties of old and rare apples.Heritage Fruits Society In 1853 Thomas Petty arrived in Australia from England and selected land in the Doncaster and Templestowe area. It was Thomas Pettys' grandson, Thomas Henry, who, in 1911, first bought the property that is located at Homestead Road, nestled along the Yarra River. Thomas Henry was the first of three generations of Pettys to work the Homestead Road orchard. The Petty Family managed the orchard until Parks Victoria purchased the property in 1981. The orchards that once covered the Doncaster and Templestowe area are fast disappearing. The Heritage Fruits Society manages and maintains the heritage fruit collection in Petty's Orchard. The society is part of a worldwide network which is conserving antique apple varieties and protecting them from extinction. Petty's Orchard occupies 44 hectares of land. It uniquely encompasses two hectares of an antique apple orchard, known as the 'Demonstration Orchard', which is maintained by volunteers; 25 hectares of commercial orchard; wetlands and bird hide. The remaining area includes the wetlands, fruit and nut arboretum, Yarra River and surroundings.HFS: Petty's Orchard Musician Tom Petty visited the orchard during a visit in 1986 while on the True Confessions Tour with Bob Dylan. Inspired by what he saw, Petty obtained some cuttings from the orchard and purchased some land upon returning to the US with a clear intention of it being a central point for scientific medical research into apples and other pome fruits phytochemical benefits. Petty’s fascination with apples, which is tied into his interests with rock and roll, dates back to his childhood years when he met Elvis Presley at age 10 while on the set of the 1960 film Follow That Dream. In-between scenes Elvis would perform songs he was writing at the time; it was Stuck on You (which opened ‘You can shake an apple off an apple tree’), released the following year, that Petty witnessed and sparked his love. Since establishing itself after the success of fruit based trial work into the nutritional impacts on Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Petty's US based Orchard is on the precipice of next generation of pome based medical treatments and is looking at expanding into citrus based trials due to a large grant of money from Southern California.

It was originally broadcast on December 8, 2011 on NBC and is the final episode before the show went on hiatus during the 2011–12 midseason. The Christmas-themed episode is a musical featuring original songs performed by cast members. After Greendale's glee club members become incapacitated, the study group is asked to join. Despite their dislike of the club, each of them is lured into joining after their vulnerabilities are exploited. The episode was directed by Tristram Shapeero and written by Steve Basilone and Annie Mebane. The musical format, along with other more subtle elements in the episode is a parody of the Fox television series Glee. Creator Dan Harmon is known to dislike Glee and the series has satirized aspects of the musical TV series in previous episodes. The premise of \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" also draws on an event in season 2's \\"Paradigms of Human Memory\\" (Communitys \\"clip show\\") and provides closure to it. Taran Killam guest- starred as the glee club instructor. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with many critics disagreeing with NBC's decision to bench the series. Critics praised the episode's high-concept satire and character-driven moments. Opinion was divided on the quality of the original songs. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" was seen by an estimated 3.6 million viewers, a drop from the previous week. Plot While meeting in the cafeteria, the study group reveal their plans for Christmas. Some are spending time away, disappointing Abed (Danny Pudi), who had wished to spend the holidays with the group, even renting the critically reviled Inspector Spacetime holiday special to watch with them. Their conversation is interrupted by a performance by the obnoxious Greendale glee club. Midway through, Chang (Ken Jeong) stops them with a cease and desist order from ASCAP—tipped off by Jeff (Joel McHale)—for performing copyrighted music without permission. The glee club members suffer a nervous breakdown and are taken to the hospital. The glee club instructor, Mr. Rad (Taran Killam), invites the study group to join and perform the Christmas pageant but is rebuffed promptly due to their collective dislike for the club. However, through a series of events performed as songs, the members of the group are lured into joining the club one by one. #\\"Glee\\": Mr. Rad manages to convince Abed to join the club by tapping into Abed's desire to spend Christmas with the group. #\\"Christmas Infiltration\\": Troy (Donald Glover) is next to join when Abed reaches out to his desire to celebrate Christmas with the group despite being a Jehovah's Witness. Troy then raps about going undercover to make it seem like he accepts Christmas. #\\"Baby Boomer Santa\\": Troy and Abed exploit Pierce's (Chevy Chase) baby boomer narcissism using mixed musical styles associated with each of the decades Pierce has lived through. #\\"Teach Me How to Understand Christmas\\": Before this song, Annie (Alison Brie) catches the glee club virus after being cornered by Troy, Abed, and Mr. Rad. She then dresses up in a sexy Santa outfit to seduce Jeff. #\\"Happy Birthday Jesus\\": Pierce invites a children's choir to sing to Shirley about how the public school system has thrown out the meaning of Christmas (the birth of Jesus) during its celebrations. Unable to resist her religious fervor, Shirley springs into song, proclaiming \\"Happy Birthday Jesus!\\" With Britta (Gillian Jacobs) the only non-glee club member left, she seeks out Jeff, only to find that he too has been turned. As the group is backstage preparing for the Christmas pageant, Mr. Rad informs Abed of his long-term intentions for the group. As Abed had only made the group join to brighten up Christmas, he sets forth upsetting Mr. Rad's plans. While the group performs \\"Planet Christmas\\" on stage, he asks Britta (who was originally cast as the mute tree) to replace him as the Mouse King. She does and ruins the pageant with her poor singing and bad, improvised lyrics and choreography. Despite Mr. Rad's objections, Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) and the audience supportively agree to 'let Britta sing her awkward song' in the spirit of inclusion. However Mr. Rad then becomes enraged at the idea and inadvertently reveals that he caused the bus crash that killed the glee club members mentioned in \\"Paradigms of Human Memory\\" before distracting everyone and running off. Abed regretfully concedes that \\"forcing things to be bright just makes the darkness underneath it even darker.\\" Back at the apartment, Abed is watching Inspector Spacetime alone. The group suddenly arrives and they announce that after a dark year, they have cancelled their plans in order to spend the holidays with him. The episode ends with them joining him in viewing the Inspector Spacetime holiday special. Production \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" was written by Steve Basilone and Annie Mebane, both their debut writing credits for the series. It was directed by Tristram Shapeero, his seventh directing credit. The music for the episode was composed by series composer Ludwig Göransson, with lyrics by the writing staff. The episode took six days to shoot, which Danny Pudi said is one of the longest for a single episode. Taran Killam, a cast member of Saturday Night Live, guest starred as glee club instructor Cory Radison. Killam previously worked with Community executive producers Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan in the pilot of Nobody's Watching. The show was not picked up. Series creator Dan Harmon has long been known to dislike Glee. Community has parodied the musical television series in previous episodes. In \\"Modern Warfare\\", the show referenced Glees lack of original music. In \\"Paradigms of Human Memory\\", the study group fills in for the glee club members who died in a bus crash, though they sing a song with no real lyrics. These events are brought up during \\"Regional Holiday Music\\", which also reveals the true reason behind the crash. Mr. Rad's \\"Oh look...Kings of Leon!\\" line as a way to distract the audience when he flees after admitting he murdered the previous singing club was also Glee-based: Ryan Murphy asked Kings of Leon if he could use one of their songs on his show because it had an anti-bullying message, but the band told him no. Murphy then publicly criticized them and this led to a short but nasty spat before everyone moved on. Following the footsteps of season 2's \\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\", Abed spends the episode trying to get the group to embrace the holiday spirit during Christmas. Cultural references \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" is a satire-at-large of the television series Glee. The audio transitions for this episode mimic the a cappella audio transitions featured in Glee, whilst the glee club instructor Cory Radison (\\"Mr. Rad\\") shares many similarities to Will Schuester (\\"Mr. Schue\\"). The episode also makes reference to the concept of \\"Regionals\\", which would be confusing to people who haven't watched the show. Unlike most songs on Glee, the music on \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" is entirely original. Jeff remarks in a scene that not liking the glee club does not make the group bullies, in reference to Glee creator Ryan Murphy's criticism of musicians who don't want their music on the show. When Mr. Rad reveals that he killed previous glee club members, he shouts \\"Look, Kings of Leon!\\" to distract the audience before escaping. Kings of Leon had previously clashed with Murphy over permission to use their songs on Glee. The song \\"Glee\\" speaks about the namesake series' tendency to sing their feelings instead of \\"making a face.\\" While performing \\"Baby Boomer Santa\\", Troy and Abed recreate musical styles from the 1940s to 1980s, including performing \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and Troy impersonating Bob Dylan. The episode continues the show's recurring spoof of the British television series Doctor Who through Inspector Spacetime, while also making a nod to the infamous 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special. While the group discusses their Christmas plans, Annie reveals she will spend time with her bubbe (the Yiddish word for grandmother), which Troy confuses for \\"boobie\\" (breast). The scene where Britta discovers that Jeff has been turned is a spoof of the ending of the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In the end tag, the heads of the Dean (Jim Rash), Chang (Ken Jeong), Magnitude (Luke Youngblood), Starburns (Dino Stamatopoulos) and Leonard (Richard Erdman) are superimposed on ornaments as they perform a version of \\"Carol of the Bells\\" using their names and a few recurring lines. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" was viewed by an estimated 3.6 million households, with a Nielsen rating/share of 1.5/4 in the 18–49 demographic. It finished fourth in its 8 pm time slot among broadcast networks and was outperformed by CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, which was seen by 14.4 million households; Fox reality show The X Factor, which was seen by 9.9 million households; and a special holiday episode of ABC reality show Wipeout, which was seen by 6.6 million households. The episode outperformed a repeat airing of The Vampire Diaries on The CW, which was seen by 1.2 million households. Community was NBC's lowest performing show of the night in the demographic despite The Office, Parks and Recreation and Whitney all slipping to season lows. Reviews \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom pleaded for the show to return. BuddyTV placed it #17 in its list of 50 best TV episodes of 2011, calling the songs the \\"best original songs TV has heard in a long time\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A', saying \\"Community is going away for a while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very personal thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, to the point where I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee- spoofing, saying \\"'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it.\\" Sean Gandert of Paste said, \\"As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy.\\" TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show \\"definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side.\\" She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff \\"creepy\\". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a \\"great\\" episode, but \\"faltered just a bit\\" at the end: \\"Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point.\\" Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com gave the episode a bad review, calling the original songs \\"terrible\\". She remarked, \\"fans merit a better episode, better commentary, and better parody of the subject at hand.\\" Nonetheless, she praised the episode's ending and asked, \\"Who cares that the story was a bit weak this time around? It's the last episode we have before the dreaded undetermined hiatus gets underway, and it's Christmas. Let's just cherish the episode for what it is...\\" Sean Campbell said although he enjoyed the episode's concept, \\"the execution left much to be desired\\" and that the quality of the songs \\"varied from okay to bad\\". The Atlantics Kevin Fallon compared \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" to Glees own 2011 Christmas episode \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\" which aired on December 13. Fallon said \\"Regional Holiday Music\\" \\"relentlessly exposed Glees most repetitive cliches\\" and \\"couldn't have invented better illustrations of Glees cringe-inducing, everyone-is-loved-as-long-as-they- sing-a-song motif.\\" However, on a final note, he highlighted the two shows' similarities, explaining how both shows stick to their bold delivery and heartwarming moments.

The album was released posthumously, consisting of the last recordings made by Celestin, who died on December 15, 1954. Background The recording sessions on this album were arranged by Southland Records' owner, Joe Mares. Mr. Mares had wanted to record Celestin, and knew that the jazz and New Orleans legend was in failing health. Needing enough material to fill an album, at least a 10-inch one, he arranged to have the songs recorded at extra length each, instead of the three-minute limit that was standard at the time. The liner notes put a spin on this, citing Mares' desire to record the songs in their \\"full and complete versions.\\" However, Mares did not know if he would be able to book Celestin for another session, a fear that proved to be well founded. Needing an album that would sell well, the songs selected were highly associated with Celestin. Two of these are standards played by almost every Dixieland outfit in existence (Down by the Riverside, When the Saints Go Marching In), but the other two are less well-known (Marie La Veau, Oh Didn't He Ramble.) Note that this last song is often wrongly attributed to W. C. Handy, but the correct attribution is Will Handy.Waltz, Bob. Remembering the Old Songs: Didn't He Ramble Retrieved December 8, 2011. Reception Allmusic notes that this album is a celebration of Celestin the personality, so the vocals are prominent.

Komodo is a commercial chess engine but older versions (11 and older) are free for non- commercial use. It is consistently ranked near the top of most major chess engine rating lists, along with Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero.  History  Komodo was derived from Don Dailey's former engine Doch in January 2010. The first multiprocessor version of Komodo was released in June 2013 as Komodo 5.1 MP. This version was a major rewrite and a port of Komodo to C++11. A single- processor version of Komodo (which won the CCT15 tournament in February earlier that year) was released as a stand-alone product shortly before the 5.1 MP release. This version, named Komodo CCT, was still based on the older C code, and was approximately 30 Elo stronger than the 5.1 MP version, as the latter was still undergoing massive code-cleanup work. With the release of Komodo 6 on 4 October 2013, Don Dailey announced that he was suffering from an acute form of leukaemia, and would no longer contribute to the future development of Komodo. On October 8, Don made an announcement on the Talkchess forum that Mark Lefler would be joining the Komodo team and would continue its development. The latest version, Komodo 14, was released on May 12, 2020.https://komodochess.com/Komodo14.htm Komodo MCTS On December 17, 2018, Larry Kaufman announced the release of Komodo 12.3 MCTS, a version of the Komodo 12.3 engine that uses Monte Carlo tree search instead of alpha–beta pruning/minimax.https://komodochess.com/Komodo12.htm  Playing strength and style  Komodo heavily relies on evaluation rather than depth, and thus has a distinctive positional style. Its forte is to play when there is nothing to play. Komodo author Don Dailey described it as such: \\"In positions that most engines would likely struggle or find it impossible to make progress, Komodo quietly prepares a break and ends up with the victory.\\"  Competition results  Komodo has played in the ICT 2010 in Leiden, and further in the CCT12 and CCT14. Komodo had its first tournament success in 2013, when it won the CCT15 with a score of 6½/7. Komodo also fared very well in the TCEC competition, where in Season 4, it lost only eight out of its 53 games and managed to reach Stage 4 (Quarterfinals), against very strong competition which were running on eight cores (Komodo was running on a single processor). In TCEC Season 5, it won the superfinal against Stockfish. It managed to reach the Superfinal in TCEC Season 6 again, but this time, it lost to Stockfish. Komodo regained the title in TCEC Season 7, defeating Stockfish in the superfinal. In TCEC Season 8, Komodo defeated Stockfish again in the superfinal. Komodo won both the World Computer Chess Championship and World Computer Software Championship in 2016. Komodo once again won the World Computer Chess Championship and World Blitz in 2017. Komodo came third in TCEC Season 11 losing to Stockfish and Houdini, and came second in Season 12 losing to Stockfish.http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-11-final- standings/http://www.chessdom.com/stockfish-convincingly-wins-tcec- season-11/https://chess24.com/en/watch/live- tournaments/tcec-2018-season-12-superfinal  Notable games  * Komodo vs Hannibal, nTCEC - Stage 2b - Season 1, Round 4.1, ECO: A10, 1–0 Komodo sacrifices an exchange for positional gain. * Gull vs Komodo, nTCEC - Stage 3 - Season 2, Round 2.2, ECO: E10, 0–1  References   External links  * Category:2010 software Category:Chess engines ","title":"Komodo (chess)"},{"id":"34001565","text":"The Academy for Youth Leadership in Braunschweig, as seen in 1938. From the German Federal Archives. The former “Akademie für Jugendführung”, built 1937 to 1939, in Braunschweig, as seen from the south. The building viewed from the southeast. To the left is the \\"Ehrenhalle\\", or Hall of Honor, with its 12 meter high columns. The Academy for Youth Leadership () was a Hitler Youth (HJ) leadership school in Braunschweig. It was the highest Nazi training facility for the training of full-time junior executives for Hitler Youth during the Nazi era. It was built between 1937 and 1939. Today, the Braunschweig College for Adult Education and the Abendgymnasium Braunschwieig are housed in this building. Any \\"Hitler Youth who is above reproach in terms of descent, health, performance, and behavior\\" was eligible for the one-year academy course if he had completed his labor and military service and had already taken some leadership courses. Successful completion of the academy course obligated the graduate to twelve years of HJ service. The academy had little effect because the war began soon after its founding.  Conception and history  The decision to build the Academy for Youth Leadership was based on the desire of the Nazi leaders to fill the senior leadership of Hitler Youth with a trained leadership corps of professional youth leaders between the ages of 23 and 35, to institutionalize the recruitment of young talent and to develop a career in the Hitler Youth into one's full career. Therefore, the academy was at the head of the HJ training system, which consisted in part of Reichsführer schools, Reichsführer camps, and leadership preparation 'factories' (Führerschulungswerke - discussion and study groups designed to improve HJ leaders' abilities) in the years after the so-called seizure of power. The training order for the Führer Corps was issued on 18 February 1938. The one-year training at the academy was intended to cover all youth leadership responsibilities. In addition to sports and fitness, it encompassed knowledge regarding political, economic, and cultural life in addition to the natural sciences, though exclusively in propagandistic and educational use in service of the Nazi ideology such as biology as genetics and racial hygiene and history from Nazi leadership's point of view. To give graduates an appropriately international appearance, foreign languages and dance classes were also included in the curriculum. Applicants had to document their Aryan descent with an Ariernachweis (certification of Aryan descent) and have either passed the Abitur (exam to graduate high school) or have completed vocational training. After the year at the academy, three weeks had to be spent working in the industry and six months spent abroad before registering for the final exam. If it was successfully passed. the pupil would be given the Youth Leader's License (Jügendführer-Patent) with a leader's dagger (Führerdolch) and become a Bannführer (battalion leader) in the HJ. However, this concept was never fully realized. The first course began on 20 April 1939 in Potsdam before being moved to Braunschweig. Less than four weeks after the academy was opened on 2 August 1939, with the first class of 87 pupils, the Second World War began with the German invasion of Poland. Almost all students and teachers were given draft orders, and the academy quickly came to a halt. Between 1940 and 1942, the vacant rooms were used by the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM - League of German Girls), first for courses offered by the BDM Faith and Beauty Society, and later for those of the BDM junior leaders. In 1942, the Wehrmacht (Nazi military) seized the buildings to be used as a military hospital. After youth leader Baldur von Schirach expressed an urgent desire for the Academy's release, provisional five-month courses occurred in November 1942. The students were now former HJ leaders that were disabled in the war. The teaching operation lasted until 12 April 1945 when troops of the 30th Infantry Division Marched into the city.

Bräker's house auf der Hochsteig (), contemporary drawing (c. 1794; the house was destroyed in 1836)Stadler and Göldi (1998). Ulrich Bräker (1735–1798) was a Swiss autodidact, writer and diarist, known for his autobiography, published in 1789, widely received at the time as the voice of an unspoiled \\"natural man\\" of the lower classes, based on the title of which Bräker became known as \\"The Poor Man of Toggenburg\\" (Der arme Mann im Toggenburg). Bräker was born as the oldest of eight siblings in Scheftenau, Wattwil, Toggenburg (at the time a territory owned by the Abbey of St. Gall). After the estate name of his birth house he was also known as Näppis-Ueli (Näbisuli). He was the son of Johannes Bräker (Näbishans, 1708–1762).Voellmy (1955). His paternal grandparents were Michel Bräker (1669–1730) and Anna Klauser (1674–1711), but Johannes Bräker had been adopted by his father's cousin. The given name of his mother (d. 1783) is not known, but she was the daughter of Ulrich Zuber (1677–1746) and Elsbeth Wäspi (1685–1755). During 1741-54, the family worked the remote estate of Dreyschlatt., elevation 930 m. ch. 13: \\"Dreyschlatt ist ein wildes einödes Ort, zuhinderst an den Alpen Schwämle, Creutzegg und Aueralp; vorzeiten war's eine Sennwaid. Hier giebt's immer kurzen Sommer und langen Winter [...] In den kürzsten Tagen hatten wir die Sonn nur 5. Viertelstunden. Dort entsteht unser Rotenbach, der dem Fäsi in seiner Erdbeschreibung, und dem Walser in seiner Kart entwischte\\" (\\"Dreischlatt is a wild, deserted place, hindermost [in the Rotenbach valley], towards the alps of Schwämmli, Kreuzegg and Aueralp; it was formerly used as a summer pasture. Here, summers are always short and winters are long [...] on the shortest days, we would have only five quarters of an hour of sunlight. There raises the Rotenbach, which escaped the attention of [Johann Konrad] Fäsi in his Geography [Erdbeschreibung, 1768], and that of [Gabriel] Walser [1695 -1776] in his map.\\" Ulrich was educated in literacy and basic arithmetics during ten weeks each winter, working as a goatherd for the rest of the year. In 1754, the family moved to Wattwil, where Ulrich worked various jobs. In 1755 he entered the service of a Prussian recruiting officer. Against his will, he was pressed into military service in the 13th infantry regiment of the Prussian Army in 1756, but managed to escape later in the same year, at the Battle of Lobositz.Willy Pfister, \\"Aargauer in fremden Kriegsdiensten,\\" in: Beiträge zur Aargauergeschichte 1980; siehe auch: Martin Küster: Ein Toggenburger in Berlin Returning to his native Toggenburg, he married Salome Ambühl of Wattwil (1735–1822) in 1761 and had several children. He built a house auf der Hochsteig outside of Wattwil and traded in cotton for the local home industry. He began writing a diary, and his writing talent was discovered by local writer and intellectual Johann Ludwig Ambühl. Bräker published some texts in Ambühl's journal Brieftasche aus den Alpen. His writing is based on a pietistic outlook and reflects intimate familiarity with the Bible (based on a close reading of the eight volumes of the Berleburg Bible) as well as a keen observation of nature, besides an enthusiastic interest in the works of William Shakespeare (which became available in German translation at the timeGerman translations of individual plays had been available since the 17th century. The first German translation of Shakespeare's complete plays were begun by Christoph Martin Wieland (22 plays by 1766) and completed by Johann Joachim Eschenburg in 1777.). Bräker wrote a commentary on each of the 36 plays by Shakespeare, published in 1780. In the judgement of Voellmy (1955), Bräker's diary is a \\"touching human document\\" containing Lebensweisheit, or \\"pearls of true pragmatic wisdom\\", besides representing an important historical document of Bräker's time from the point of view of a man of the lower classes. His account of his half-year's service contributed significantly to the public image of the Prussian Army and its recruitment practices during the Seven Years' War.Jürgen Kloosterhuis: \\"Donner, Blitz und Bräker – der Soldatendienst des ‚armen Mannes im Tockenburg‘ aus der Sicht des preußischen Militärsystems.\\" In: Alfred Messerli, Adolf Muschg (eds.): Schreibsucht – autobiografische Schriften des Pietisten Ulrich Bräker (1725–1798). Göttingen 2004, 129–187. In 1776, Bräker became a member of the Toggenburgische Moralische Gesellschaft, which was otherwise reserved to the educated classes. Publication of his diary began in 1788, and an edition of his collected writings was compiled printed in 1792. Bräker was not successful as a businessman. He was in debt, and in 1797, a year before his death, he was forced to sell his house in Wattwil. Three out of seven children born to his wife died before reaching maturity. Bräker lived to see, and was perturbed by, the French invasion of Switzerland in the spring of 1798, but he died in September of the same year.

Banderas was able to convince the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexicans. In 1827 Banderas' forces suffered defeat due to using primarily bows and arrows against the Mexicans guns. Banderas then negotiated a peace in which he was pardoned and made the captain-general of the Yaqui towns. In 1829 Occidente instituted a new plan to tax the Yaqui and also to allot their lands.

He was married to Gwen Thomas in 1941 and they had two children, Sarah Cain and Stuart Allen. His parents were Robert Allen Neitzel and Hannah Sayre Meker Cain. Early life Neitzel's father ran a five-and-dime store which Stuart would often work in throughout his childhood. In 1929, Stuart went off to the University of Nebraska where he studied medicine in hopes of becoming a doctor. When his sophomore year came, Stuart realized he did not want to be a doctor, but was merely fulfilling his parents’ wishes, so he decided to become a physical anthropology major. His flunking of chemistry also influenced this decision to change his major. Early career Neitzel conducted his first fieldwork in 1933 as a physical anthropologist charged with identifying bones on a high bluff overlooking the Missouri Valley. He met some University of Chicago graduate students and was invited to attend the university. From 1934-1935 he attended the university, but he had to return to the University of Nebraska for financial and academic shortcomings. He immediately got back to work and went to middle Tennessee to work on the Mound Bottom and Pack Sites from 1936-1937 for the University of Tennessee. In 1938 he met lifelong friend James A. Ford and traveled to Louisiana with him where they both worked on the Greenhouse Site, Baptiste Site and Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site. These three sites were instrumental in defining the chronology for the Lower Mississippi Valley. While working here he met his future wife Gwen Thomas. World War II From 1941-1951 World War II caused archaeological work to cease for Stuart, but he did attempt to join the military multiple times. He was denied every time for various reasons, but he was able to learn how to read topographical maps through his sparse experience with the military. During this time he ran a dairy farm with the help of his wife and kids. Late career In 1954 he became the curator of the museum at the Marksville site, but was replaced in 1957. He then went on a series of archaeological projects starting with the survey of the Ouachita River for Phil Philips. He then worked at the Menard- Hodges Site on the Arkansas River, the Holly Bluff Site in the Yazoo Basin and the Chauga Mound site for Arthur Kelley. He also moved to Cartersville, Georgia to install a few Etowah Exhibits designed by Lew Larson. In 1960, he accepted the job of Curator of the State Historical Museum in Jackson, Mississippi. For four months in 1962, and again later in 1972, he worked on perhaps his most important site, the Fatherland or Grand Village of the Natchez site. This site contains mounds and was the political and social focal point of the Natchez people. He worked as the curator of the State Historical Museum until 1966, after which he continued to do archaeological work throughout the southeast even though he had officially retired in 1966.

The achenes develop in a cylindrical head.Scott, P. J., et al. 2000 onwards. Ranunculus pedatifidus var. affinis. Ranunculaceae of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Descriptions, Illustrations, Identification, and Information Retrieval. Version: 6 November 2000. The variety affinis is usually a more robust plant, and the leaf segments are usually not subdivided into smaller lobes. R. pedatifidus in Alaska, USA In North America, this species occurs in the Arctic, and farther to the south in alpine climates. It can be found throughout Canada north and south of the Arctic Circle, and down through the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains in the United States. Its habitat includes Arctic and alpine tundra.

County of Humboldt was a United States District Court for the Northern District of California decision issued on April 29, 2005 which arose out of a protest dispute in 1997 between environmental activists for the Headwaters Forest and the Sheriff's Deputies of Humboldt County, California. During three protests in the Fall of 1997, police officers swabbed pepper spray in the eyes of eight activists practicing nonviolent resistance. The action taken by the police was later judged to be excessive force and a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. History In three incidents, the first in September 25, 1997, in the office lobby of Pacific Lumber Company in Scotia, California, the second at a Pacific Lumber logging site in Bear Creek on October 3, 1997, and a third incident at the Eureka district office of Congressman Frank Riggs on October 16, 1997, County sheriff's deputies stuck pepper spray drenched Q-tips into the protesters' eyes to try to coerce them to end the protest. Meeting resistance, a second dose of pepper spray, and then sprayed, some of them directly in the eyes with canisters held a few inches from the protestors faces. The plaintiffs charged that the Sheriff used excessive force. The first trial occurred in August 1998 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, presided by Judge Vaughn Walker and ended in a deadlock. Judge Walker then threw the case out. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco. Headwaters Forest Defense v. Humboldt County, 240 F.3d 1185, 1197 (9th Cir. 2001) (\\"Headwaters I\\").

No. CV-97-03989-VRW The defendants appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court and the case was sent back to the 9th Circuit for reconsideration, which again ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants again appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which was then denied. The second trial (Headwaters II, 276 F.3d at 1131.) began Sept. 8, 2004, presided by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, but resulted in a hung jury. The third trial began April 11, 2005 resulting in a victory for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs won a jury trial, but were awarded only $1 per person in damages.

These external electric fields can be produced by any bioelectrical process in an organism, especially by actions of the nerves or muscles of fish, or indeed by the specially developed electric organs of fish. Other fields are induced by movement of a conducting organism through the earth's magnetic field, or from atmospheric electricity.Hopkins, C. D. (2005). Passive electrolocation and the sensory guidance of oriented behavior. In T. H. Bullock, C. D. Hopkins, A. R. Popper, & R. R. Fay (Eds.), Electroreception (pp. 264-289).

Fay (Eds.), Electroreception (pp. 229-263). New York: Springer. Electrolocating fish use this ability to detect prey, locate other fish, avoid predators, and perhaps to navigate by the Earth's magnetic field. Electroreceptors probably evolved once or twice early in vertebrate evolution, but the sense was apparently lost in amniotes, and in a large number of the Actinopterygii (ray finned fishes) only to reappear independently in two teleost clades. In fish, the ampullary receptor is a specialized receptor that it uses to sense these electric fields and allows the fish to follow electric field lines to their source. Sharks primarily use specialized receptors, called Ampullae of Lorenzini, to detect their prey's low frequency DC fields and may also use their receptors in navigation by the Earth's magnetic field. Weakly electric fish use their ampullary receptors and tuberous receptors to detect the weakly electric fields produced by other fish, as well as for possible predator avoidance.Kalmijn, A. J. (1974). The detection of electric fields from inanimate and animate sources other than electric organs. In A. Fessard (Ed.), Electroreceptors and Other Specialized Receptors in Lower Vertebrates (pp. 148-194). Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag Berlin. Passive electrolocation contrasts with active electrolocation, in which the animal emits its own weak self generated electric field and detects nearby objects by detecting the distortion of its produced electric field. In active electrolocation the animal senses its own electromotor discharge or reafference instead of some externally generated electric field or discharge.Albert, J. & Crampton, W. (2006). Electroreception and electrogenesis. In Evans, D.H. & Claiborne, J.B. (Eds) The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. (pp 431-470). CPC Press. Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton, Florida. . Evolution of electroreception and electrolocation Electroreception occurred early in evolutionary history with the evolution of an ampullary sensory system that included receptors able to detect weak electric signals in the environment (less than 1 µV/cm or 50 Hz). Sense organs specialized for electroreception have only been found among vertebrates, and around 8.600 species are known to be electroreceptive. The majority of teleosts and amniotes do not have an electroreceptive system, but the distribution of electroreception in terms of evolution involves different classes of fish. First, there is an origin of a common ancestor of current existent vertebrates (close to lampreys and gnathostomes). This ancestor evolved a lateral line that is important in processing sensory information and present in today's hagfishes. Ampullary receptors are ancestral to jawed fish, for lampreys and agnathans were found to have ampullary receptors 400 million years earlier. Second, there is a loss of electroreception in amniotes. This could be due to the fact that air is a poor medium to effectively conduct the electric fields, unlike water. Third, there is also a loss of electroreception in gars, bowfin, and teleosts (neopterygian fishes). Ampullary receptors are present in all surviving cartilaginous fishes and bony fishes except a few species present in Neopterygii (which include gars, bowfins, and teleosts) Fourth, monotremes and a least three groups of fresh-water teleosts re-evolved electroreception. Fifth, a group of teleosts, Xenomystinae, acquired passive electrolocation with low frequency sensitive ampullary receptors. Sixth, another group of teleosts, Mormyroids, evolved passive electrolocation and active location, as well as a pulse type EOD in active electrolocation. Seventh, Silurifiormes and Gymnoformes evolved passive electrolocation, and Gymnoformes also evolved active electrolocation with a pulse type or wave type EODs. Detecting electric fields Electric fields found in aquatic environments range from local fields to large-scale uniform fields produced by ocean currents. For example, uniform electric fields might provide information on the orientation of field intensity and can give information about the voltage of the electric field through the velocity and direction of the ocean current. Electric fields produced locally by an animate source represent more of an electric field produced by a dipole, which can be represented by two point charges, a positive and a negative. The electric field in water generates an electric current which flows from positive to negative, along lines resembling a dipole field. A field produced by a fish changes according to distance. In a field far away, a dipole produced by a fish looks more like a dipole source. Higher magnitude order multipole fields may dominate closer to the fish, where the current does not converge on one point for the anterior pole but makes a perpendicular gradient over the length of the fish. A dipole contribution is more accurate in fields farther from the source because in three dimensions the dipole contribution to the electric field decreases due to the inverse third power of distance. In contrast, the contributions from quadrupole sources decrease due to the source decreasing by an inverse fourth power of distance. When fish use their electroreceptive sense to detect the electric fields, it is different from other senses such as vision, auditory, and vibration senses. This is due to the fact that stimuli such as light and sound travel in vectors that are associated from the propagation of the wave, and the velocity vector points to the source of the signal. The signal produced by fish used in electroreception exist rather as an electrostatic field rather than propagating as waves due to the fact the frequencies of the fields are very low and only reach up to several kilohertz. Propagating electromagnetic waves would have a wavelength measured in kilometers at this low frequency. The electric fields produced by biological organisms like fish attenuate rapidly in aquatic environments and have a field magnitude around zero at ranges of a few meters at which fish detect these fields. Unlike sounds waves in hearing, there is no velocity vector to describe propagation, shadow cast by the receiver's body, or temporal delay associated with propagation. The non-propagating electric field only gives curved paths about signal direction, but no information about delay times or a direct path to the source.Bodznick, D., & Montgomery, J. C. (2005). The physiology of low- frequency electrosensory systems. In T. H. Bullock, C. D. Hopkins, A. N. Popper, & R. R. Fay (Eds.), Electroreception (pp. 132-153). New York: Springer. Instead of using precise coding such as in hearing, it is important that the receptors are able to detect the low frequency electric fields by relying on spatial information of intensity, orientation, and polarity of the fields. Another type of electric field detected in electroreception is DC field potentials. All aquatic animals show DC fields, and it is the strongest in the head and gill region in species of fish. Teleosts had a range of about 500 µV potential around the gills, while elasmobrachs and crustaceans were 10 times weaker; but if a crustacean was wounded, its DC potential increased to 1 µV. A study by Peters and Bretschneider measured the bioelectric potential across catfish and found the strongest negative potential around the head and gills of the fish, measured 1 mm from the skin. Yet the sources of DC potentials are still not well understood, for potentials still persist even if the animal is anesthetized, so muscle contractions do not modulate DC potentials. Respiratory movements can module DC potentials, but are not caused by the contraction of muscles, since passive moments of the gill covers cause similar modulation in anesthetized or awake animals and muscle contractions produce high frequency signals. When a fish is hurt or distressed, it also emits a stronger DC field potential, which makes it more susceptible to predation. In order to detect low frequency fields and DC fields, fish have specialized receptors to read and process the incoming information. The ampullary electrosensory systems of fish and amphibians are modified hair cell sensors with similarities to the lateral line system and audition. Ampullary receptors pores on the skins of the animal, and each pore opens to a water or jelly filled tube which leads to the terminal swelling. Outer faces contact the ampullary lumen via the aquatic environment while the inner faces synapse with nerve fibers. Flattened cells line the ampullary duct and create a layer of high electrical resistance. The length of the tube varies in length depending on the environment. A marine environment has longer tubes in the receptor when compared to freshwater environments because of cable theory. This theory states when a potential difference is applied between the outside pore and to loose connective tissues to the location of the ampulla proper, no appreciable voltage drops occurs along the canal and the voltage difference occurs across the ampullary wall near the pore of the skin. The tube is well insulated and signals voltage down the sensory epithelium to the electroreceptors. In freshwater, the resistance of the medium is higher than in saltwater, so the tube must channel voltage down a shorter path in order to have the same voltage reach the electroreceptor. An example of the distribution of Ampullae of Lorenzini along the nose of a shark for prey detection and an example of the distribution of Burst Duration Coders in weakly electric fish to detect electric fields In sharks, the Ampullae of Lorenzini is the ampullary organ used to detect electrical stimuli. These cells are distributed along the dorsal and ventral head region of the sharks, but are also found in the pectoral region in skates and rays. The receptor is located in clusters, with a higher density of receptors on the ventral side of the head than the dorsal side of the head, but density and canal length varies by individual and species.Collin, S. P., & Whitehead, D. (2004). The functional roles of passive electroreception in non-electric fishes. Animal Biology, 54(1), 1-25. Jorgensen, J. M. (2005). Morphology of electroreceptive sensory organs. In T. H. Bullock, C. D. Hopkins, A. R. Popper, & R. R. Fay (Eds.), Electroreception (pp. 47-67). New York: Springer. The species of teleosts with electroreception (Gymnotiformes, Mormyridae, and Silurids) are freshwater fish and therefore have smaller ampullary canals than marine species. Mormyrids have ampullary ducts distributed on the head as well as along the top and bottom of their body. Silurids have most ampullary organs in the head skin, but ampullary receptors are also found along the body side. Gymnotids have ampullary organs distributed on the head as well as scattered along the side of the body. Besides having ampullary receptors, teleost fish possess tuberous receptors, which come in two types: pulse marker receptors that code for the amplitude of the signal, and burst duration coders that code for the timing of the signal.Hopkins, C.D., McKibben, J.R.,& Yager, D.D. (1993). Directional sensitivity of tuberous electroreceptors: polarity preferences and frequency tuning. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 173:415-424 Both of these receptors are directional in their responses to the electrical fields. The receptors are scattered across the head and body of the fish, directionally selective, and the best response is when the current is perpendicular to the skin.Hopkins, C. D. (1997). A quantitative analysis of passive electrolocation behavior in electric fish. Brain, 1997(suppl l), 32-59. Localization of external sources (electric fields) An illustrated example of an experiment conducted by C.D. Hopkins. When a weakly electric fish detects an electric field, it will turn its body parallel to the electric field lines and follow the field lines to the source: the fish will not swim directly toward the source Weakly electric fish will orient themselves in a direction parallel to an electric field by bending their bodies (shown by the B angles) to reduce the angle of their direction (F) with the electric field (E) Fish use electroreception to detect the electrical fields produced by other fish, but they also need a way to navigate to the source of the electric field. The use of electroreception to locate the source of the electric field is known as electroreception. Local bioelectric fields produced do not remain strong, and get proportionally weaker to the cube of the distance. These low frequency bioelectric fields are produced from a dipole like orientation in the body of the fish when detected from a farther distance. The current will flow from negative to positive. Using electrodes, Hopkins made different orientations of electric fields to test how fish navigate. He aligned the field radially, tangentially, and at a 45-degree geometry orientation. In other cases, the dipoles could rotate and thus rotate the electric field. The field flows from a positive electrode to the negative electrode. The tuberous cells in teleosts play a role in detecting the electric fields and helping the fish to proper orient. A paper by Hopkins proposes a method for which the fish may navigate. The fish is trying to reduce its alignment \\"error\\", meaning it is trying to stay as parallel as it can with the electric field and reduce the angular difference between the electric field and the angle of its body. The equation to describe this orientation is ξh= ϕE-ϕF. ϕE represents the angle of the electric field. ϕF represents the angle of the fish, taken from three body segments as the fish bends. ξh represents the error angle, which is how far off the fish is from being parallel with the field(. When the fish is parallel with the field, ξh =0. Since the electric field does not stay parallel (the fish follows a curve path from positive to negative changes), the fish with stray off the path and have an alignment error ξh. The fish will then adjust β, its bend angle, to turn toward the electric field and reorient itself parallel with the field. A negative β means the fish turns to the right, and a positive β means a fish turns toward the left. How does the fish know which way to turn? The directionality of the tuberous receptors seems to be controlled by the current flow through the fish's skin. The burst duration coders encode the amplitude by the number of spikes while the Pulse marker receptors encode timing. When the electric field is lined up at the best axis to the receptor, it will produce the strongest signal. This is the case if the electric field is lined up perpendicularly with the receptor. If the fish is lined up with the field, both sides of the fish are stimulated equally in amplitude and the direction of the signals. When the electric field turns to the fish's left, receptors on the left side will be more strongly stimulated with perpendicular signals on the fish's left side while the receptors on the right side would receive a weaker stimulus. The fish will turn to the side of the stronger stimulus. Using the receptors, the fish can detect field and orient itself to the electric field to follow the electric field and locate its source. Behavior Sharks Sharks can detect weak electric fields in their environment using ampullary receptors in to find their prey. A study by Kalmijn et al. 1971 observed this action. Kalmijn used a type of flatfish, called a plaice as a living source of food along with the electrodes and the whiting pieces. He saw that sharks could detect plaice buried under the sand, and would smoothly change direction to where the plaice lay hidden and attack it. To determine if sharks were using electric fields or smell to detect their prey, he devised an experiment. He used the shark species Scyliorhinus canicula and the ray species Raja clavata. He created an agar chamber, which would hold a plaice (small fish), and an opening tube downstream to separate any smells. The agar chamber would enclose the plaice on all sides. The agar does not allow odors to pass, but it does allow electric field to pass through it. Kalmijn would place the plaice in the agar and bury it underneath the sand to eliminate any visual cues. When sharks were in feeding mode, they would locate the agar with the plaice underneath it and attack it near the head region (where bioelectric fields are thought to originate). If chopped up bits of whiting were put in the agar chamber, the shark would try to locate the prey via smell coming out of the outlet tube. Also, if the plaice was put in an agar chamber and covered with polyethylene film, the sharks could no longer detect the plaice. The polyethylene layer inhibits the bioelectric fields and prevents the shark from using passive electrolocation to hunt its prey. One additional behavior observed in sharks is their orientation to the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field acts as a uniform field, B. When the shark swim through the Earth's magnetic field with its own velocity v, the shark induces its own electric current. Sharks swimming though the Earth's magnetic field create a voltage gradient that could act as a physical basis for compass orientation. Weakly electric fish Mormyrids and Gymnotiforms are weakly electric fish that also use electric fields to detect and locate other fish. A Gymnotiform fish, Gymnotus carapo, is a very territorial fish, and responds to an intruder by approaching the intruder and making threatening displays that include short discharges and lunging at the intruder. To find the intruder, G. carapo detects the EOD of the intruder, but the electric field emitted by the intruder fish does not point to the source. The fish instead follows the electric field lines to the source or the fish. Hopkins et al. 1997 replicated this behavior by creating a large pool with a number of electrodes on each end. Based on the orientation of the electrodes (radial, tangential, or in 45 degree angles) the fish would swim until it sensed an electric field, and then would reorient itself parallel to an electric field line and swim to the source. Most often their head was facing opposite the flow of the current. Hopkins then took this lab further and rotated the electrodes so the electric field would orient with the rotating electrodes. When the electrode was rotated clockwise, the fish would try to reorient itself and often swim in counterclockwise loops. This behavior is cause by the fish trying to reduce error angle ξ by turning its bend angle β to come in contact with the electric field lines produced by the dipole in another fish. Similar results were also found using a Mormyrid fish, Brienmyrus brachyistius. Catfish in the order Siluriformes have also shown behavioral responses to electric fields or DC poles. They can detect electric fields as low as .75 uV/cm. An early study by Parker and Hersen involving catfish used electrodes helped to determine the fish's response to current. When the electrodes released a current of 1 uA or more, the catfish would avoid the electrodes, and approach the electrode if the current was less than 1 uA and nibble at the area between the electrodes.

The attraction features Audio-Animatronic bears as well as a backwards section. Big Grizzly Mountain is the second mountain and third roller coaster attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland. History Planning In early 2009, Hong Kong Disneyland proposed a financial arrangement to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong with the aim of expanding the park by adding three new themed areas. This plan was approved in July 2009. On 13 December 2009, the official groundbreaking ceremony took place. Construction The mountain, the centrepiece of the themed area, is tallSouth China Morning Post - Come on down to Grizzly Gulch and was constructed with 30 sculptors and 20 painters working on it for eight hours a day over a period of 14 months. The team visited California's Sierra Nevada Mountains and Yellowstone National Park before starting work. A town from the gold rush days of the 1840s and 1850s has been built around the mountain. Rocks on the mountain seem rough and eroded, but none of them are real. Instead, 3,850 tonnes of cement were used to create them. Even the bricks and \\"wooden\\" logs at the site are made from cement. The team used a special, relatively soft cement to shape the mountain's features. It is also structurally safer: the cement used to make the mountain is as strong as any cement used to build houses. To make the mountain look realistic, designers went through several exhaustive stages, including sketching, model-making, three-dimensional computer scans and adding authentic finishing touches. Two hundred people were hired in May 2012 to run Grizzly Gulch.Theme park out to cement its attraction Amy Nip. South China Morning Post. 18 May 2012. Opening In June 2012, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars began soft openings. On 14 July 2012, the ride was officially opened to the public. Ride Overview Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is the centrepiece attraction in the Grizzly Gulch section of Hong Kong Disneyland. It is a Vekoma Mine train roller coaster with of track. The ride is the second Disney roller coaster to have a backwards section on it -- the first being Expedition Everest in Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The roller coaster also bears several similarities to the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attractions at many Disney theme parks, with the mountain itself resembling Grizzly Peak at Disney California Adventure. Experience The ride begins in the Big Grizzly Mountain Mining Company building. This is home to the mining company's sawmill and one of the mining shafts, where the sounds of a snoring bear can be heard. Signage reports on recent sightings of the mountain's resident family of bears, which lead one of the original prospectors to discover the mountain's gold and the bears to be seen as a lucky charm.Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Upon boarding the 24 seat trains, guests are sent out of the station into tunnel 8. An animatronic grizzly bear, named Rocky, accidentally sends passengers down tunnel 4 while scratching himself on a track switch. In Chinese tradition, the number 8 signifies good luck and the number 4 signifies death, as the numbers are homonyms for characters representing luck and death, respectively. Entering tunnel 4, the train begins to climb a lift hill in the style of a traditional roller coaster. Once the train nears the top of the mountain the lift cable appears to break (next to Shaft 44, in reality the lift cable ends) causing the riders to go back down the hill in reverse and along a different track before entering another mine. Two animatronic bears, a mother and cub named Mother Lode and Nugget, are located inside the mine and the cub sets off some TNT while reaching for a hanging catch of fish left behind by one of the miners, causing the train to launch out of the mine on yet another track. The train then goes through a variety of twists and turns before arriving at the terminal brake run and returning to the station, passing by a damaged minecar containing Mother Lode, Nugget and the fish.

Unlike Disneyland's Haunted Mansion attraction and its counterparts in other Disney parks, Mystic Manor has a lighthearted, fantasy- based theme with no references to departed spirits or the afterlife, due to differences in traditional Chinese culture. The attraction does feature several references to the Haunted Mansion, such as a Medusa changing portrait, a conservatory, and the busts that turn to follow visitors as they move. References to other Disney attractions include several figures similar to those from The Enchanted Tiki Room in the Tribal Arts room. The Manor's exterior design is inspired by the now-demolished Bradbury Mansion that stood at 147 North Hill Street in Los Angeles' Bunker Hill, designed by Samuel Newsom and Joseph Cather Newsom, who also designed the still-standing Carson Mansion in Eureka, California. The attraction utilises a trackless ride system similar to that used in Pooh's Hunny Hunt. It features a musical score by Danny Elfman. Continuing the Society of Explorers and Adventurers theme of Tokyo DisneySea, Mystic Manor tells the story of Lord Henry Mystic and his monkey Albert. Having recently acquired an enchanted music box, Albert opens the box and brings everything inside the house to life. Mystic Manor began previews in April 2013, and was officially opened to the public on May 17, 2013. Experience Queue and pre-show The queue starts at the gate of the manor—a large Victorian mansion in an elaborate Queen Anne architectural style combined with traditional Russian architecture. Guests enter from the side of private residence and continue into the building. Inside, guests see a portrait of Lord Henry Mystic and Albert, Henry's adorable pet monkey. Other pictures in the queue show how Henry met Albert, rescuing him from a large spider; the ribbon-cutting of Mystic Point in 1896; and an 1899 group portrait of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers (including Harrison Hightower and Shiriki Utundu of Tokyo DisneySea's Tower of Terror and a separate portrait of Danny Elfman who composed a Musical Score for the ride). Guests enter a pre- show area where they watch a slide show narrated by Henry Mystic. He gives a short speech about the exhibition rooms and his latest collections, emphasizing an enchanted music box which may possess magical properties. When Henry Mystic mentions the music box, Albert appears and expresses interest in it. After the presentation, guests enter the loading area and board the Mystic Magneto—Electric carriage Henry Mystic invented to take guests on a tour of the museum. Ride experience The first room, the Acquisitions and Cataloguing Room, is where Lord Mystic's collections are temporarily stored and await placement on shelves. The music box Lord Mystic mentioned is now in front of guests. Lord Mystic appears from a door in the middle of the room, looking for Albert. He greets the guests and acknowledges the music box before leaving to continue his search. Albert suddenly pops out and unlocks the box. The escaping magic dust floats in the air and brings life to all the artifacts like a British bust, Samurai Armor, a Kalahari shield and a jade statue of a Qing dragon. In the Music Room, many exotic musical instruments are displayed. A harpsichord is placed in the center of the room. The magic dust gives life to instruments and music begins to play. The music follows the carriage and plays in the background for the remainder of the journey. Albert watches in fascination from atop a large pipe organ from Oaxaca. A lyre from a Sumerian grave plays music and its bull head shakes to the tune. In the room for Mediterranean Antiquities, paintings, ceramics, and Audio-Animatronic statues start to move under the influence of the magic. The carriages first pass a painting from Mt. Vesuvius, portraying four people outside with a volcano visible in the background. As the magic affects the painting, the volcano erupts, submerging the people in lava, who then clink their glasses. The lava falls off of the scene to restart the animation for the next viewer. An amphora with Hercules actually fighting the Nemean lion spins and rocks when the carriage passes, and Hercules jumps above the lion and fights; the painting on the amphora is animated. The carriages then pass a large mosaic of a beautiful Medusa from Troy who morphs into a frightening Gorgon, and her eyes flash before turning back to the beautiful woman. A brief snake rattle is heard to foreshadow her transformation into a monster a second before she does. This mosaic is a reference to the other Haunted Mansion and Phantom Manor attractions, which contain portraits of a beautiful Medusa changing to and from a hideous Gorgon. In the Haunted Mansions and Phantom Manor, however, the Gorgon Medusa is made of stone. In Mystic Manor, she is not. In the Solarium Room, Albert curiously points his finger near the mouth of a Venus flytrap. A larger one faces the riders and roars loudly, lightning crashes, and the room becomes pitch black. Soon afterward, the carriage enters the Slavic-Nordic Chamber, where there is a Russian painting with a young girl picking the flowers of a tree. The clouds comes to life as the god Stribog and blows freezing wind towards guests. The freezing wind leaves the painting and spreads ice throughout the entire room, finally gathering on a large Nordic mirror that shatters the guests' reflection. The Arms & Armour room is full of weapons and armor that have come alive. First seen is a samurai armor wielding a katana that tries to hack Albert's head off, but he dodges each slash with success, then the tsar cannon opens fire on the guests which knocks the carriage back and sends it spinning away. The carriage passes through a hallway containing three suits of armor, their helmets floating next to their bodies and singing along with the music. The carriage then moves in front of a large medieval Ballista, which loads and takes aim at the guests, knocking them into the next room. On the other side of the room, a Mongolian suit of armor can be seen holding a few helmets aloft and laughing evilly. In a swift move, guests enter the Egyptian Antiquities room, where guests see a sarcophagus and some tablets of Egyptian gods. The gods Horus and Isis move, the sarcophagus glows an unearthly green as a swarm of scarabs begin to emerge from the mummy and the sarcophagus' face turns scared before being broken. The guests reached the end of the darkness and reach the Tribal Arts rooms, where, in the first, a large tiki figure dominates the room, spewing lava from its mouth. Two tiki poles stand on either side, as well as multiple other tiki statues. The room is full of chanting and tribal drums, all in tune with the music. Some statues from Polynesia rotate and shoot blow darts, pinning Albert. Then the carriages go into the Chinese Salon where a giant jade Sun Wukong statue is brought to life and uses its staff to create a tornado, making the room spin and causing all the tapestries in the salon to shake. A panda goes out of one of them and enters in another one with two common cranes. The vehicles continuously circle the room during this scene. Albert appears on a wall and the statue tries to hit him with a lightning bolt. This only succeeds in blowing away a portion of the wall and a vase crumbles, showing the sky at dusk. Albert is then blown away from the manor and manages to hold onto a large harp as the enchanted music box suddenly appears. Albert jumps onto the box as the carriages move back to the Acquisitions and Cataloguing Room. The music climaxes as the magic flies back into the music box. Albert slams the lid shut and breathes a sigh of relief as the lights come back on, revealing a perfectly normal room. Lord Mystic then appears behind Albert, happy to have finally found him. He asks if Albert touched the music box, which Albert immediately denies. Wondering as to whether the legends regarding it are true, Lord Mystic thanks the guests for touring his home and bids them farewell as the vehicles move back into the station. Ride system The attraction's 37 Mystic Magneto electric carriages are automated guided vehicles that can travel freely throughout the mansion, receiving directional instruction via radio-frequency identification technology in the floor and Wi-Fi. Thirty five of them are normal vehicles holding up to 6 guests. The 36th and 37th are specially modified to carry a wheelchair and an accompanying person. The carriages travel in groups of four, each group following a unique path influenced by its most recent loading position. Because the carriages are not restricted to a single path, the handicapped carriages can be easily rotated in and out of a group. Riders experience 40 ultra-high-definition images created by 36 projectors. The attraction is one of Hong Kong Disneyland's most complex. Each Mystic Magneto electric carriage operates at a speed of 4 km per hour. For safety reasons, if a guest stands while a carriage is in motion, it stops immediately.

The management and administration of prisons falls exclusively in the domain of the State Governments, and is governed by the Prisons Act, 1894 and the Prison Manuals of the respective State Governments. Thus, states have the primary role, responsibility and authority to change the current prison laws, rules and regulations.

In March 2011, there were 3,405 persons incarcerated in Estonia, and the number of prisoners per 100,000 residents were 254, which is the third highest rate in the EU. These figures include pre-trial detainees and remand prisoners.International Centre for Prison Studies: Estonia Retrieved 2011-07-29International Centre for Prison Studies: Europe - Prison Population Rates per 100,000 Retrieved 2011-07-29 It is, however, a much lower rate than in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the Estonian prison population reached almost 5,000 persons. Finland Finland has 26 prisons (of which about half are open institutions). Official statistics showed on average 3500 places (2003). The Suomenlinna Island facility in Finland is an example of an \\"open\\" correctional facility that are also established in Scandinavian nations. The prison has been open since 1971 and, as of September 2013, the facility's 95 male prisoners leave the prison grounds on a daily basis to work in the corresponding township or commute to the mainland for either work or study. Prisoners can rent flat-screen televisions, sound systems, and mini- refrigerators with the prison-labor wages that they can earn—wages range between 4.10 and 7.3 Euros per hour (US$5.30 to $9.50). With electronic monitoring, prisoners are also allowed to visit their families in Helsinki and eat together with the prison staff. Prisoners are permitted to wear their own clothes. Finnish prison reform had led to the decrease and extremely low incarceration rates that the country now experiences. This model focuses more on the humane treatment of prisoners and due process in regard to courtroom proceeding. They have expanded their alternative programs to keep more citizens out of a formalized jail setting in hopes to avoid offenders re- offending and keep recidivism rates low. In countries like the United States they have used incarceration as a means of politics, and their incarceration rates show it. The basis of the new Finnish model is \\"humane neoclassical crime policy” (Lappi-Seppala, 2002). By shifting their focus onto situational crime prevention tactics and enforcing local crime rehabilitation measures Finland has been able to successfully go from one of the highest incarceration rates in the world to one of the lowest. In recent years Finland has made moves to increase the length of its prison sentences, which are some of the shortest in the world. The longest sentences are awarded to acts of manslaughter and drug trafficking of about 8–9 years. However, murder does receive a life sentence with the option of probation after as little as 10 years with the possibility of presidential amnesty(Putkonen).Lappi-Seppala, T. (2002).

Jamaica United States Downtown Houston, Texas, serves as a jail and the headquarters of the Harris County Sheriff's Office. In the United States penal system, a jail is a facility used to detain persons who are in the lawful custody of the state, including accused persons awaiting trial and those who have been convicted of a crime and are serving a sentence of less than one year. Jails are generally small prisons run by individual counties and cities, though some jails in larger communities may be as large and hold as many inmates as regular prisons. As with prisons, some jails have different wings for certain types of offenders, and have work programs for inmates who demonstrate good behavior. Approximately half of the U.S. jail population consists of pretrial detainees who have not been convicted or sentenced. Prisoners serving terms longer than one year are typically housed in prison facilities operated by state governments.Doris J. James, Profile of Jail Inmates, 2002, 2 (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2002) available online. Unlike most state prisons, a jail usually houses both men and women in separate portions of the same facility.

His early oeuvre had a close affinity to Expressionism. Life and work Eduard Bargheer was born in Finkenwerder, Hamburg as son of Karl Bargheer, a primary school headmaster, and grew up together with his elder brother Ernst Bargheer (pedagogue and, later, ethnologist) and his five sisters. His father died in 1914, his mother in 1919. Ernst Bargheer, 24 years old at the time, assumed the guardianship of his younger brother and sisters and at his insistence Eduard trained to become a primary school teacher. During these early years, Eduard Bargheer not only benefited from his artistic training at the college of arts and crafts in Hamburg-Lerchenfeld but also embarked upon his own private studies, which he continued throughout his entire life. In 1924, the two brothers, Ernst and Eduard, fell out with one another, and Eduard set his own course toward becoming a painter. In 1925, Eduard Bargheer visited Italy for the first time, where he spent a long time in Florence. His deep affection for Italy and its culture was to be a principal theme of his life. Extended travels to Paris followed in 1926 and 1927. In 1928, Bargheer built himself a studio close to the Westerdeich in Finkenwerder. In 1929, he became a member of the Hamburg Secession. It was about this time that he became closely involved in the circles around the art historians Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky. In 1932/33, Bargheer used a grant from the City of Hamburg to live in Paris for several months, and there he made friends with Heinrich Heydenreich, a student of Panofsky's. In 1933, the Hamburg Secession disbanded of its own accord, for it did not wish to exclude its Jewish members, as the Nazi party required. Bargheer visited Switzerland in 1935 and met Paul Klee there. In the same year he bought a small fisherman's cottage – now the Bargheer Haus – on the slopes of the Süllberg in Blankenese, Hamburg. Four years later, in 1939, Bargheer left Germany for Ischia. After the war, he took part in documenta I in Kassel in 1955 and in documenta II in 1959. He was made an honorary citizen of Forio/Ischia in 1948; while still retaining his German nationality, he received Italian citizenship in 1951. He died in Blankenese, Hamburg in 1979. Reception Eduard Bargheer is known above all for his landscape watercolours, which are distinguished by a light-coloured, crystalline style. His combinations of the abstract and the figural evoke associations with the works of Paul Klee and Werner Gilles.

It was the oldest urban development agency of Kolkata and made significant impact on the city's urban geography and pattern of urban growth. It was merged with the larger Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority in 2017 to increase efficiency and cut costs. History The Calcutta Improvement Trust was set up in 1911 through the Kolkata Improvement Act, 1911. Following a recommendation from a government appointed commission and public opinion, the trust was created with the purpose of expansion and improvement of Kolkata and its urban surroundings. A brainchild of George Lord Curzon when he served as the Governor-General of India, it was created as a reaction to the growing representation of native Indians in the existing Calcutta Municipal Corporation(CMC). Development of urban infrastructure through the maintenance and building of lakes, housing, area development, road alignments, rehabilitation projects and commercial complexes was part of the initial program. This also included the preparation of land bank.  Urban Renewal  The areas earmarked for growth included localities on the fringes of the city back then such Tollygunge, Kankurgachi, Phoolbagan, Ultadanga, and the Paddapukur locality in Bhawanipore, as well as those well entrenched within the city boundaries such as Maniktala, Entally, Burrabazar, Cossipore, and Paikpara near Chitpur. The Trust engaged the services of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, the town planner who had successfully restructured the city of Paris. Haussmann believed in Euclidean layouts, comprising straight avenues intersecting each other at right angles. This necessitated ploughing through already built-up areas. His other favoured concepts included 'circulation' (i.e. constructing roads for the movement of people and goods) and 'respiration' (leaving open spaces for the city to breathe). The resulting confection of parks, wide boulevards and so on entailed the destruction of considerable amounts of built up areas. This continued from its early days, through the decades of the colonial period and even after the partition in 1947. In May 2011, The Municipal and Urban Development Minister of Bengal announced that the KIT would be merged with the KMC.  Merger with KMDA  In 2017, the state government merged the century-old KIT and the Kolkata Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (KMWSA) with the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority(KMDA). This was done by passing the West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development) Bill, 2017 by Firhad Hakim, state Urban Development and Municipal Affairs minister. As a result, the Kolkata Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and Kolkata Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Act, 1966 were repealed. Hakim had alleged the two organisations had been merged for efficient management and execution and bring them under one umbrella. \\"CPI(M) used to sell land of KMDA at throwaway prices and the KIT had virtually become defunct.\\" Hakim had said in the assembly. There are 419 staffs and 200 engineers in KIT but they do not practically have any work. They used to come to office, gossip for the whole day and got the salary at the end of the month. The Bill will reduce overhead expenditure,\\" he maintained. Major Projects Some of its recent projects in recent years include : A commercial Complex at Bosepukur, in Kasba as well as the construction of the Kolkata Metropolitan Library Building at Ballygunge Park Road. At the time of merger with KMDA, among the proposed activities on a Public-Private Partnership Model were the completion of a link road adjoining Subhash Sarobar, extension of the development of Rabindra Sarobar, Subhas Sarobar, residential-cum-commercial complex at Bow Street, taking up renovation of BRS-II at Dum Dum Road and encroached KIT land along Ultadanga Railway Line. Projects such as the construction of road and overbridge connecting Beliaghata Main Road and Kolkata Railway Passengers Terminal under the central Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme was also on the cards.

Through stabilization of the fluid in the semicircular canals, a pilot may perceive straight and level flight when in actuality the plane will be in a banked turn. This is caused by a quick return to level flight after a gradual, prolonged turn that the pilot failed to notice. The phenomenon consists of a false perception of angular displacement about the roll axis and therefore becomes an illusion of bank. This illusion is often associated with a vestibulospinal reflex that results in the pilot actually leaning in the direction of the falsely perceived vertical. Other common explanations of the leans are due to deficiencies of both otolith-organ and semicircular-duct sensory mechanisms. Physiology The leans is a type of vestibular illusion in flight which causes spatial disorientation. The process involves the semicircular canals of the vestibular system. The semicircular canals detect angular acceleration. In total, there are three semicircular canals: the anterior, posterior, and lateral canals. Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and each canal arises from a small bag-like structure called a utricle. At the ends of each duct, there is a saclike portion called the ampulla. Inside are hair cells and supporting cells known as the crista ampullaris. Changing a person's orientation will cause specific ducts to be stimulated due to these hair cells. When the head turns, the canals move but because of its inertia, the endolymph fluid tends to lag and thereby stimulates the hair cells. This stimulation results in awareness of angular acceleration in that plane. After about 10 seconds the endolymph velocity matches that of the canal, which stops stimulation of the hair cells and reduces the person's awareness of rotation. In addition, the canals cannot detect rotational acceleration of approximately 2 degrees per second or lower; this is the detection threshold of the semicircular canals. Therefore, a pilot may not notice a slow turn or a bank maintained long enough. After the pilot levels the wings, there is an illusion that the plane is banking too much in the opposite direction. As a response, the pilot often leans in the direction of the original turn to attempt to correct and regain his/her perception of the correct vertical position. The leans may also be caused by peripheral visual orientation cues that become misled. Danger and risk If a pilot does not notice the disorientation and continues to lean, the plane may over bank in the wrong direction and cause rolling. This is the most common spatial disorientation for pilots. In all cases of spatial orientation, pilots must be able to rely on their flight instruments when making control inputs to override false sensations.

The information centre, Giulești Park, is devoted to the upkeep and protection of the building, which is a national heritage site. History Interior of the Chiajna Monastery Construction began during the reign of Alexander Ypsilanti (1774–1782) and was completed by the tyrant Nicholas Mavrogenes (1786–1790) during the Phanariote age also called the Greek origin government of Wallachia. It was built in neoclassical style, and was considered very large for that time: 43 meters long and 18 high, with walls 1 and 2 meters thick. The structure was completed under the rule of Mavrogenes between April 1786 and September 1790. The church was meant to be one of the most important places of worship for Romania, but that never happened. The monastery was abandoned during the plague in the reign of Alexander Ypsilanti. Other sources say that work on the monastery began in 1792, but was abandoned during the time of plague, when the prince was Mihai Suțu. The tower collapsed in the earthquake of 1977. The monastery is featured in the video for Ava Inferi's \\"Majesty\\". Legends *Legend says that the church was bombarded by the Turks even before consecration. Reportedly, the Turks believed that the church was a military objective and tried to destroy it. Thus, all the documents within the church were burned, though the building itself remained standing. *Its great bell was cast into the Dâmbovița River waters and, according to locals, is heard pounding on full moon nights. *On the wall on the right from the entrance, in about the middle, a few feet high, detaching plaster formed in the appearance of a lady or angel, and some claim it resembles the Sphinx of Giza or Romanian Sphinx. *Over the years, many disappearances have been reported in the monastery, especially of neighboring Roma people. * There were two murders, one before and one after 1990. Building today The ruin is located in the immediate vicinity of the railway Bucharest - Craiova and near the final approach path to Bucharest airport, the traffic on these routes hastening its degradation. Some architects believe that the monastery can be restored, because a church built from scratch would cost much more. In April 2011 the monastery was claimed by the church and it now has restoration plans for the site. The place is now bordered by a fence but access is free.

It is native to North America, where it is widespread across much of Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. It grows from British Columbia east to Manitoba, south as far as Sonora, Coahuila, Texas, and Mississippi.SEINet, Southwest Biodiversity, Arizona Chapter, Solidago missouriensis Nutt. includes photos, description, partial distribution map Description Solidago missouriensis is variable in appearance, and there are a number of varieties. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from an underground caudex or rhizome, or both. It reaches one meter (40 inches) in maximum height. The roots may reach deep in the soil. The rigid leaves are up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) long, becoming smaller farther up the stem.Solidago missouriensis. Washington Burke Museum. Retrieved 12-11-2011. The inflorescence is a branching panicle of many yellow flower heads at the top of the stem, sometimes with over 200 small heads. Each head contains about 5-14 yellow ray florets a few millimeters long surrounding 6-20 disc florets. The fruit is an achene tipped with a pappus of bristles. Distribution and habitat Solidago missouriensis can be found in many types of habitat. It is common on the Great Plains. It grows preferably in dry, open habitat and can occur at high elevations. It colonizes disturbed soils. During the Dust Bowl-era drought, when many of the native grasses and plants died, the goldenrod flourished in the dry, cleared soil. As the drought ended and the grasses returned, the goldenrod became less common, disappearing in many areas. It grows in soils turned over by burrowing animals and on roadsides and mining sites. The goldenrod is common in a number of regions, including tallgrass prairie in west-central Missouri, sandhills prairie in southeastern North Dakota, the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta, riparian habitat in northwestern Montana, and the penang distribey of northern Wisconsin.

Chinese coinage during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods includes some of the earliest coins produced in the world. However, they were mostly not the typical round shape of modern coins. They included cowrie shells, ant nose money, spade-shaped money and knife-shaped money.  Cowrie shell  Before the Spring and Autumn period, during the Shang dynasty, cowrie shells had been used as an early type of money. In the Zhou period, their use became more stylised with replica shells made of porcelain, jade or metal coming into use. Some sources suggest that early round coins were a highly stylised representation of the cowrie shells. A snap shot view of THE HISTORY OF CHINA by YK KwanShell Money before Qin Dynasty  Gold money  Gold coins marked with \\"Ying yuan\\". \\"Ying\\" being the name of the Chu capital. The State of Chu produced rough squares of gold, stamped with one or two characters which were used as money. In Chinese they are known as Ying Yuan ().  Spade money  Spade money The shape of spade money () is similar to spade, an agricultural tool. The pronunciation of \\"spade\\" in Chinese is \\"bo\\" (), which is very close to \\"bu\\" (), and it is where spade money derived its name. During the Spring and Autumn period, spade money was used mainly in Shanxi and Zhou royal family. There are two primary types of spade money, Kong Shou Bu (空首布), the early one, and Ping Shou Bu (), the late one. During the currency process, each kingdom had developed their techniques for producing money with the great growth of the national economy. As a result, big changes had taken place in spade money, from big and thick one to small and thin one. Spade money began to be used in the Spring and Autumn period and ended in the late Warring States. Today, there are few remaining and it has become the emphasis of collectors. Three-hole spade money Zhongshan kingdom () (nearly in the 4th century BC), a small vassal state in the mid-Warring States period, first invented and used the early three-hole spade money (), whose contour looked like a mountain. At that time, the handicraft industry, business, iron- smelting industry and bronze casting industry in that kingdom were developed. Usually, people threaded the money together through these holes, which made it easier for people to carry, more convenient for the money to circulate. As a result, the three-hole spade money was well received among people at that time. Due to continuous wars, Zhongshan kingdom fell down and most of the three-hole spade money got lost. Today, there are few left and we can hardly find even in some nationalized large-scale museums.Calgary Coins & Antique Gallery Ancient Chinese Coinage 700 BC to 255 BC. Retrieved: 13 June 2017.  Knife money  Yan State knife money (燕国刀币) During the early Warring States, the state of Qi was one of the strongest in all of China. To show the strength of their kingdom and inherit the tradition of the fondness of knives as the northern grassland nationality, Qi carried out knife-money-system policy.Stanford University The monetary systems of the Han and Roman Empires. February 2008. Retrieved: 13 June 2017. In 279 BC, in the charge of Tian Dan (), the senior general, Qi successfully wiped out the enemy unit, the alliance of Han, Zhuo, Wei, Qin, Chu and retook the lost land. Moreover, Qi Xiangwang (), the leader of Qi, returned to his own land after the five-year exile from his kingdom. In order to celebrate the great victory and the return of Qi Xiangwang, Qi produced the six-word knife money (六字大刀). Besides the six-word one, there is three-word, four-word and five-word knife money as well.  Early round coins  From 350 BC onwards, round coins started to be used. The round coins from the areas that previously used spade money, had round holes in their center. The round coins from the knife money areas typically had square holes. There are only two coins known to be exceptions to this general rule.  Other coinages  An example of Zhou dynasty era \\"bridge money\\". There were other coinages where no contemporary historical sources mentions them. For this reason the validity of these objects as a form of currency is called into question. Because it is unknown if they were or weren't forms of ancient Chinese money, they are usually referred to as \\"pseudo money\\" or \\"odd shaped money\\" (). These currency are often named based on their shape, for example there is \\"fish money\\" (魚幣), \\"halberd money\\" (戟幣), and \\"bridge money\\" (橋幣).

At one time her recordings were more in demand than those of any other female singer in the world. She also recorded Gilbert and Sullivan with Sir Malcolm Sargent, but never sang in standard operas. Biography Essie Adele Ackland was born in Sydney. She studied at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music under Roland Foster, and had further training under Joseph Bradley and Emily Marks. She performed locally and in Queensland, and was chosen to accompany the Belgian cellist Jean Gerardy on his 1923 tour of Australasia, with encouragement from Dame Clara Butt and Henri Verbrugghen. In 1925 she left for London, where in 1926 she married her former fellow student from Sydney, the baritone Reginald Morphew. They chose to keep their careers separate, seldom performing together, and remained married until his death. She became a prominent oratorio and concert performer. Her friend Browning Mummery arranged for her to make some 40 recordings with the Gramophone Company, mainly of ballads, which, along with frequent radio broadcasts, spread her fame even more. She was last singer to perform at The Crystal Palace before it was destroyed by fire in 1936. Essie Ackland toured Australia in 1937, by which time she was considered the most recorded contralto in the world.Canberra Times, 23 March 1937 For her first Sydney concert on 13 March 1937, the demand for seats outstripped the Conservatorium's capacity, so the concert was moved to the Sydney Town Hall.

Thus, an area of common land or a village green will not be a highway, although it may contain one.Ex parte Lewis [1888] 21 QBD 191. There are three kinds:- # A footpath is a highway over which there is a public right of passage for pedestrians. # A bridleway is a highway that does not permit motor vehicles. Some bridleways also debar the driving of cattle. # A carriageway allows vehicles, animals and pedestrians. Highways are vital for tenants and landowners because most property needs a means of access from the public highway. A property with no such means of access is called \\"landlocked\\", which has serious consequences for its value and use. The main statute governing highways is the Highways Act 1980. This gives responsibility for most highways to local councils, although trunk roads lie directly with the Secretary of State. Creation A highway may be created in law by:- # 20 years' uninterrupted use by the public. Landowners sometimes prevent this by erecting notices that state no public right of way may arise, or by preventing use for a day (such as by padlocking a gate). # Dedication, in which the local authority is given notice to take over an area of land as a highway.

Description  Inflorescence of Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides) The species of genus Dysphania are annual plants or short-lived perennials. They are covered with stalked oder sessile glandular hairs and therefore with aromatic scent (or malodorous to some people). Some species have uniseriate multicellular trichomes, rarely becoming glabrous. The stems are erect, ascending, decumbent, or prostrate and mostly branched. The alternate leaves are mostly petiolate, (the upper ones sometimes sessile). The leaf blade is linear, lanceolate, oblanceolate, ovate, or elliptic, often pinnately lobed, with cuneate or truncate base, anentire, dentate, or serrate margins. The inflorescences are terminal, loose, simple or compound cymes or dense axillary glomerules. Bracts are absent or reduced. Flowers are bisexual (rarely unisexual), with up to five tepals connate only basally or fused to form sac, one to five stamens, and a superior ovary with one to three filiform stigmata. Fruits and seeds of Dysphania botrys The fruit is often enclosed in perianth. The membranous pericarp is adherent or nonadherent to the horizontal or vertical, subglobose, or lenticular seed. The seed coat is smooth or rugose. The annular or incompletely annular embryo is surrounding the copious farinose perisperm.  Chromosome numbers  Chromosome numbers reported are 2n=16, 18, 32, 36, and 48.  Photosynthesis pathway  All species of genus Dysphania are C3 plants with normal leaf anatomy.  Distribution  The genus Dysphania is distributed worldwide from the tropics and subtropics to warm- temperate regions. In Europe, the species are native, archaeophytes, or naturalized, in the northern regions absent or rarely adventive.  Systematics  The genus Dysphania belongs to the tribe Dysphanieae in the subfamily Chenopodioideae within the plant family Amaranthaceae. According to phylogenetic research, it is related to genera Suckleya and Cycloloma. Dysphania was first published in 1810 by Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, p. 411-412. Type species is Dysphania littoralis R.Br.. The genus Dysphania primarily comprised 7-10 Australian species. Sometimes they were grouped as an own family, Dysphaniaceae Pax & Hoffmann, or even regarded as members of families Illecebraceae and Caryophyllaceae. In 2002, Sergei L. Mosyakin & Steven E. Clemants extended the genus for the glandular species of Chenopodium subgenus Ambrosia A.J.Scott. Synonyms for Dysphania R.Br. are Neobotrydium Moldenke, Roubieva Moq. and Teloxys Moq..

The first football club to sign Jimmy Douglas was Scottish club, Paisley Institution. There appear to be no records about this club. In 1879 Jimmy Douglas was signed by Renfrew Football Club. This Renfrew existed from 1875 until 1891. Douglas left Renfrew in 1880 and headed south to England. There he joined Barrow Rangers (not today's Barrow Rangers) but after a short stay joined Blackburn Rovers. Before leaving Renfrew, he got a call–up from Scotland. Douglas played in an international friendly against Wales which Scotland won 5–1. However, as Douglas played in England he was never called–up again. (registration & fee required) Jimmy Douglas was one of a triumvirate of Scottish professionals who provided the backbone of Blackburn Rovers' FA Cup success of the 1880s. To circumvent the rules on professionalism Douglas was found employment at Yate's Iron Foundry in the town and he quickly became a popular member of the club. His enthusiastic approach to the game was noted by the correspondent of the Blackburn Times, in April 1882, when he wrote that Douglas 'is a bold player, and when fortune seems against the team becomes reckless of danger, dashing forward against any odds. He is an excellent wing player, and he and his partner understand each other perfectly. He divides with McIntyre the kicks from the right corner flag, and is frequently exceedingly successful in making them. In shooting at goal he is rather too apt to send the leather over the bar, but is, nevertheless, dangerous in front of goal, and is very valuable in a scrimmage'. His success was all the more remarkable because of his small build, but, in an era when brute force often triumphed over finesse, his Scot had sufficient skill to be able to make his mark on the game. When Douglas first joined Blackburn he operated on the right wing of a six–man attack, but when the club adopted the five–man front line he dropped back to right–half. Indeed, his versatility was such that he was drafted into the pivotal centre–half position on more than one occasion and was able to operate with supreme ease in this more demanding role. Jimmy Douglas played in the first of four FA Cup Finals at Kennington Oval on 25 March 1882, 1882 FA Cup Final, Blackburn Rovers became the first team to play in the FA Cup Final who were not based in the Home Counties or London. Blackburn Rovers lost 1–0 to Old Etonians and Douglas played as a forward. Jimmy Douglas played in the 1884 FA Cup Final when the opponents were Queen's Park Glasgow. Rovers won 2–1 and Douglas played on the wing. Douglas' third Final was on 4 April 1885 when again Blackburn Rovers faced Queen's Park Glasgow. Rovers won 2–0 and Douglas played as a forward. The 1886 FA Cup Final was an all–English affair when on 3 April 1886 Blackburn Rovers drew 0–0 with West Bromwich Albion. Douglas played as a forward. The replay was the following week and Rovers won 2–0 with Douglas as a forward again. Douglas made his League debut on 15 September 1888, playing as a wing-half against Accrington at Leamington Road, then home of Blackburn Rovers. The match ended in a 5-5 draw. Douglas only missed one of the 21 League games played in season 1888–89, as Blackburn finished fourth. As a wing-half he played in a midfield that achieved big (three-League-goals-or-more) wins on seven separate occasions. Douglas appeared in the two 1888–89 FA Cup semi-final matches Blackburn played against Wolverhampton Wanderers, which Blackburn lost after a replay. (registration & fee required) At the end of his career, in 1892, Douglas had played 76 first–class matches for Blackburn Rovers scoring eight goals. He played in 34 League matches and 42 FA Cup ties. All his goals were scored in FA Cup ties.

Feed Me I'm Yours began as a local fund-raising cookbook for the Minneapolis chapter of the Childbirth Education Association (CEA) in 1974. Lansky, then a new mother and recent transplant to suburban Minneapolis from New York City, was not familiar with local group 'favorite-recipe' fund-raising cookbooks. But Lansky, then a stay-at-home mom and CEA volunteer, suggested the idea at a meeting. CEA agreed to try the idea, whereupon Lansky rounded up five friends, some from CEA and some not, to help her with the project. She then presented an outline of a cookbook that would be of interest to new mothers, beginning with making baby food. With only two groups working in meetings and only one name suggested for the cookbook, the project was presented to CEA, who quickly agreed to fund the book's first printing. In the Sunday food section of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune (December 1, 1974 issue), food editor Mary Hart featured Lansky and the cookbook. This inspired Lansky and her husband Bruce, who had worked in sales and marketing, to start a publishing company. Meadowbrook Press (named after Meadowbrook Lane where the couple lived) was created to sell Feed Me I'm Yours nationally. When the couple's marriage ended in the early 1980s, however, so did the business partnership; in the divorce settlement, her husband got the business, while she got their lake-front home.Washington Post. February 7, 1985. Books Lansky's first book is still one of the highest-selling baby/toddler food cookbooks in the United States, which has sold over 3 million copies. Lansky followed the book with Taming of the C.A.N.D.Y. (Continuously Advertised Nutritionally-Deficient Yummies) Monster, which landed as #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list on April 30, 1978Indie Book Publishers: Bestselling Books Hall of Fame, bookmarket.com; accessed January 22, 2017. after an appearance on The Phil Donahue Show. Her parenting newsletter was recommended by Ann Landers on December 17, 1981, and was described by the New York Times as 'the most original' of its kind. The newsletter's parenting tips were incorporated into a later book, Practical Parenting Tips for the First Five Years, which has sold over 700,000 copies. In the 1980s Bantam Books published Lansky's first single-topic parenting titles after she left Meadowbrook Press. The list includes: Toilet Training: A Practical Guide to Daytime and Nighttime Training (1993, 2003); Birthday Parties, Best Party Tips & Ideas For Ages 1-8 (1986, 1995); Dear Babysitter Handbook (1992, 2001); Welcoming Your Second Baby (1984, 2005); Getting Your Child to Sleep...and Back to Sleep (1985, 2004); Trouble-Free Travel with Children (1991, 2004); and Baby-Proofing Basics (1991, 2002). Her children/parent read-together books include KoKo Bear's New Potty, A New Baby at KoKo Bear's House, KoKo Bear and the New Babysitter, and KoKo Bear's Big Earache, which last helps children prepare for ear tube surgery. Lansky later self-published these titles through Book Peddlers, which she established to distribute her own titles as well as those by others. On the sixth anniversary of her divorce NAL/Signet published Vicki Lansky's Divorce Book for Parents: Helping Children Cope with Divorce and Its Aftermath. In an interview, Lansky stated: \\"I read what was available on divorce but no one book had all I needed in one place so I wrote the one I wished I could have found for myself... I wrote a book to help other parents get through that tough time.\\"National Examiner. June 13, 2004. The book was reprinted in 1996 by her own press, Book Peddlers. The book received a Parent's Choice Book award. According to the New York Times review of the book, \\"It's the one to read through your fears and tears\\". Her companion children's book, It's Not Your Fault, KoKo Bear, is intended for children 3–7 years coping with divorce. And in the midst of the Beanie Baby frenzy of that time, Lansky created KoKo Bear: the Divorce Doll for Kids. Lansky was interviewed by Meredith Vieira on The View, where she introduced the KoKo Bear doll to a national audience. KoKo Bear comes with a small backpack which encourages children to write down their worries and stuff them into the backpack so that KoKo Bear—not the children—can carry them. In 1988, Lansky received a call from the new editor at Family Circle magazine. The publication was looking for a new household hints columnist, which opportunity allowed Lansky to go from writing tips for young children to tips for adults. Lansky had since written and published several household hints books, including the bestsellers Baking Soda: Over 500 Fabulous, Fun and Frugal Uses, with over 500,000 copies sold, and Vinegar: Over 400 Various, Versatile and Very Good Uses (2004) with over 350,000 copies sold. Media Lansky was a Sunday columnist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune from 1985 to 1987, a contributing editor to Family Circle magazine for more than eight years, and wrote a monthly column for Sesame Street Parents magazine from 1987 to 1997. Lansky's media appearances over the years have included The Rosie O'Donnell Show, The View, CBS This Morning, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Phil Donahue Show, CNN, PM Magazine, Attitudes (on Lifetime Cable), Hour Magazine, Smart Solutions (HGTV), The 700 Club, and The Today Show. She has been featured in several major national magazines and held a parenting spot for a year on AP Radio in 1983. She taped TV segments for Help! Around the House and Home Matters, and has appeared on QVC. Two of her divorce articles can be found on the Huffington Post. Lansky worked as a spokesperson for Arm & Hammer Baking Soda (January 2001/BSMG), the Dole Family Advisory Board (March 2000/Londre Company), Mead Johnson's Enfamil (December 1999/BSMG), and P&G;'s Bounce fabric softener sheets (July 1997/Marina Mahr). In 2005 she worked with 3M as part of the 75th anniversary celebration of the invention of Scotch Tape. In 2002, Lansky was named Minnesota publisher of the year by the Midwest Independent Publishers Association. Personal life Lansky was born in Louisville, Kentucky. At age 13, her family moved to Mount Vernon, New York. She graduated from A. B. Davis High School. After receiving a B.A. from Connecticut College, she worked in New York City in the retail clothing industry. She married S. Bruce Lansky in 1967. In 1971 the couple moved with their first child to Minneapolis where he had taken a new job. When they divorced in 1983, Vicki and Bruce co-parented their children, with the kids living one week with each parent. Today most of Lansky's books are published by Book Peddlers and are distributed by Publishers Group West (PGW) to book outlets and in eBook format, as well as by mail or online through Practical Parenting. Lansky married Stephen M. Schaefer in 2008 just as she was updating 101 Ways to Tell Your Sweetheart \\"I Love You\\". Lansky died on January 15, 2017, aged 75, in hospice care at her home in Trillium Woods in Plymouth, Minnesota from cirrhosis. She was survived by her two children and three grandchildren. Controversy In his November 11, 2010 article on Cracked.com, popular internet writer Seanbaby pointed out that Lanksy had reused whole passages from an earlier work for the book 101 Ways to say I Love You, claiming that she had \\"tricked [him] into buying this terrible book twice!\\".

While specific genres and games have their own accepted rules of conduct, some of these rules are universal across almost all games.  Universal gaming etiquette  Regardless of the game, certain behaviours are universally encouraged or discouraged in multi-player video games. Cheating is almost never acceptable unless all players agree it should be allowed, as it causes the game to become unfair and detracts from the enjoyment of legitimate players. In games that utilize voice communication, players are encouraged to refrain from transmitting loud background noise such as music that may diminish other players' ability to communicate. In games where most communication between players is through text, it's usually considered rude to type in all caps, because it is how one \\"shouts\\" online. Camping in games such as first-person shooters is a strategy that some find bad manners, and others find part of the game. In games with split screen (played on the same screen) it is considered unsporting to look at an opponent's actions by looking at their portion of the screen. This method is also known as screen watching, screening, screen cheating, screen peeking, screen hacking, or screen looking. This also applies to LAN games, where players might be sitting next to each other. In most games, players are generally encouraged to be polite and courteous to one another, and avoid excessive profanity and trash talk. Players are also expected to be friendly and welcoming to newcomers, (generally referred to as newbies, or the somewhat more derogative terms Noob or N00b) and remember that their lack of skill or understanding of the game is only due to their lack of experience with the game. Taking a new player \\"under their wing\\" so to speak is also considered a form of courtesy. It's also a generally accepted rule that a game's events and outcomes shouldn't be taken personally by the players.  Variations between games  In most games, it's considered bad manners to quit before the game has ended, especially in games where a player's disconnect will trigger a spike in latency which causes the other players to have to wait. However, in other games such as Starcraft II, the opposite is true: it's considered bad manners to stay in a game after a clear victor has been decided because the victory requirement to destroy all of an opponent's forces is seen as a waste of the player's time. However, in games where leaving early is encouraged, the player is often still expected to say 'gg' or 'good game' before leaving; failure to do so can be considered bad manners. However, the winning player saying 'gg' on behalf of a losing opponent is impolite, as it suggests the game has already been won and the other player should quit (this is known as an \\"offensive gg\\"). \\"Rage- quitting\\", in which a player logs out if they find themselves in a losing situation is also frowned upon, particularly if doing so denies the other player(s) credit for the potential win. In games involving circumstances where many players need to meet at an agreed-upon time, such as in a raid in World of Warcraft, it's considered bad etiquette to show up late or leave the computer during a game (AFK) without the consent of teammates. In team games where the teams are automatically balanced, it's impolite for players to stop playing rather than simply leaving the game and allowing someone else to take their spot, because this can put their team at a disadvantage.

A midfielder, tall and weighing , Tyson is capable of contributing as both an inside and outside midfielder. He was recognised as a talented footballer from a young age when he represented Victoria in the under 12 championships. Queries were raised over his versatility as a midfielder after he missed out on selection in the under 16 championships. Despite this, he was recruited by the Oakleigh Chargers in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player, and was named their captain the following year. In addition, he represented Vic Metro in the 2011 AFL Under 18 Championships, which earned him All-Australian honours. His improvement towards the end of his junior career saw him recruited by the Greater Western Sydney Giants with the third selection in the 2011 AFL draft. He made his AFL debut in the 2012 season and earned an AFL Rising Star nomination. After two years with Greater Western Sydney and playing in thirteen matches, he was traded to the Melbourne Football Club during the 2013 trade period.

He was recognised as a talented player at a young age by representing Victoria in the under-12 championships in 2005. He attended and played school football for Trinity Grammar School. After missing out on state selection for the under-16 Victoria Metro side in 2009, queries were raised over his pace and ability to be more than an inside-midfielder. He was recruited by the Oakleigh Chargers as a bottom-aged player in 2010 to play in the TAC Cup, playing 14 games for the season. Tyson was elected the captain for Oakleigh in 2011 and led the team to a grand final for the first time since 2006, but ultimately lost to the Sandringham Dragons by eight points.

His season was rewarded with All-Australian selection as the ruck-rover. He raised his draft chances in his final year after expanding his game beyond being just an inside-midfielder and was labelled a \\"complete midfielder\\" by Oakleigh Chargers coach, Greg Doyle. After drawing comparisons to Simon Black and Jimmy Bartel, he was predicted to be drafted inside the top-five in the weeks leading to the 2011 AFL draft. AFL career 2012-2013: Early career at Greater Western Sydney Tyson was recruited by with their third selection and third overall in the 2011 national draft.

The start to Tyson's 2013 season was delayed after he tore his posterior cruciate ligament during the off-season; he played his first match for the season in May with Greater Western Sydney's reserves side in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL). He managed three senior games for 2013, and after thirteen matches in total for Greater Western Sydney, he was traded to the Melbourne Football Club in October, despite being contracted until the end of 2015.

He acknowledged the reason for his improved season was due to moving home to Victoria and having a more settled environment. His season was rewarded with a second-place finish in the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Medal with 293 votes, finishing behind Nathan Jones. He received eleven votes in the Brownlow Medal count, the most for any player recruited in the 2011 draft, and was awarded the Harold Ball Memorial Trophy as Melbourne's best young player.

India is a riverine country. It has 14 major rivers, 44 medium rivers and 55 minor rivers besides numerous lakes, ponds and wells which are used as primary source of drinking water even without treatment. Most of the rivers being fed by monsoon rains, which is limited to only three months of the year, run dry throughout the rest of the year often carrying wastewater discharges from industries or cities or towns endangering the quality of our scarce water resources. CPCB in collaboration with concerned SPCBs/PCCs established a nationwide network of water quality monitoring, which has running 1019 stations in 27 States and 6 Union Territories. The monitoring process is done on quarterly basis in surface waters and on half yearly basis in case of ground water. It covers 200 Rivers, 60 Lakes, 5 Tanks, 3 Ponds, 3 Creeks, 13 Canals, 17 Drains and 321 Wells.

Early life and education Michael David Evans was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 30, 1947, to a non-practicing Jewish mother whose parents were immigrants from the Soviet Union. His father was regularly drunk and violent. This father beat his wife, claiming that Mike was not his son. At age 11, he objected to his father beating his mother, and was assaulted; when he recovered, he had what he describes as a dramatic encounter with Jesus Christ, who promised him a future. Career  Journalist  Evans is a member of the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. He was featured in the Jerusalem Post for his work in Israel.  Speaker  Michael Evans speaking in Caesarea, Israel at Glenn Beck Restoring Courage Event, August 2011 In addition to his work as a commentator, author, and documentarian, Mike Evans is a speaker. In August 2011, he addressed the Restoring Courage event hosted by Glenn Beck in Caesarea.  Ten Boom Fellowship  Mike Evans purchased and restored the Corrie ten Boom house in 1983. It is a museum dedicated to telling the story of ten Boom's family, which harbored, fed, and found safe houses for as many as 800 Jews during the Nazi takeover of the Netherlands during World War II. Upon purchasing and restoring the house, Mike Evans created the Corrie ten Boom Fellowship, a Christian Zionist organization.  Friends of Zion Heritage Center  In 2015, Evans founded the Friends of Zion Heritage Center in Jerusalem, with the main purpose of highlighting religious tolerance and investing dialogue between Christian Zionism and the State of Israel and the Jewish people. Israel's ninth president, Shimon Peres, was the international chairman of Friends of Zion and the founder of the Friends of Zion Award to honor a person for their outstanding support for Israel.  Jerusalem Prayer Team  Mike Evans with Benjamin Netanyahu in an undated photo Mike Evans began the Jerusalem Prayer Team in 2002, which raised money for Ehud Olmert's New Jerusalem Foundation. Recently, the Jerusalem Prayer Team funded the construction of the Mike Evans Museum in Jerusalem, now officially known as The Friends of Zion Heritage Center. Evans has been accused of being a Christian missionary due to his past history. In 1977, he headed B'nai Yeshua, a \\"Hebrew Christian\\" group, which was active on college campuses. A campaign accusing him of subterfuge in Long Island resulted in media coverage. Recent articles continue to simultaneously praise him for his pro-Israel activism, but warn of a possible hidden agenda to convert Jews in Israel to Christianity or \\"Hebrew Christian\\" beliefs.  Author  Evans has written on the Middle East, Christian Living, Prophecy, and Iraq. His works include 42 fiction and non-fiction books, many self-published.

Nevanlinna used this criterion to prove the Bieberbach conjecture for starlike univalent functions Statement of criterion A univalent function h on the unit disk satisfying h(0) = 0 and h'(0) = 1 is starlike, i.e. has image invariant under multiplication by real numbers in [0,1], if and only if z h^\\\\prime(z)/h(z) has positive real part for z < 1 and takes the value 1 at 0\\\\. Note that, by applying the result to a•h(rz), the criterion applies on any disc z < r with only the requirement that f(0) = 0 and f'(0) ≠ 0. Proof of criterion Let h(z) be a starlike univalent function on z < 1 with h(0) = 0 and h'(0) = 1. For t < 0, define :f_t(z)=h^{-1}(e^{-t}h(z)), \\\\, a semigroup of holomorphic mappinga of D into itself fixing 0. Moreover h is the Koenigs function for the semigroup ft. By the Schwarz lemma, ft(z) decreases as t increases. Hence :\\\\partial_t f_t(z)^2 \\\\le 0. But, setting w = ft(z), : \\\\partial_t f_t(z)^2 =2\\\\Re\\\\, \\\\overline{f_t(z)} \\\\partial_t f_t(z) = 2 \\\\Re\\\\, \\\\overline{w} v(w), where :v(w)= -{h(w)\\\\over h^\\\\prime(w)}. Hence : \\\\Re\\\\, \\\\overline{w} {h(w)\\\\over h^\\\\prime (w)} \\\\ge 0. and so, dividing by w2, : \\\\Re\\\\, {h(w)\\\\over w h^\\\\prime (w)} \\\\ge 0. Taking reciprocals and letting t go to 0 gives : \\\\Re\\\\, z {h^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over h(z)} \\\\ge 0 for all z < 1\\\\. Since the left hand side is a harmonic function, the maximum principle implies the inequality is strict. Conversely if : g(z) =z {h^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over h(z)} has positive real part and g(0) = 1, then h can vanish only at 0, where it must have a simple zero. Now :\\\\partial_\\\\theta \\\\arg h(re^{i\\\\theta})=\\\\partial_\\\\theta \\\\Im\\\\, \\\\log h(z) = \\\\Im\\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\theta \\\\log h(z)=\\\\Im\\\\, {\\\\partial z\\\\over \\\\partial\\\\theta} \\\\cdot \\\\partial_z \\\\log h(z) =\\\\Re\\\\, z {h^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over h(z)}. Thus as z traces the circle z=re^{i\\\\theta}, the argument of the image h(re^{i\\\\theta}) increases strictly. By the argument principle, since h has a simple zero at 0, it circles the origin just once. The interior of the region bounded by the curve it traces is therefore starlike. If a is a point in the interior then the number of solutions N(a) of h(z) = a with z < r is given by : N(a) ={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{z=r} {h^\\\\prime(z) \\\\over h(z)-a}\\\\, dz. Since this is an integer, depends continuously on a and N(0) = 1, it is identically 1. So h is univalent and starlike in each disk z < r and hence everywhere. Application to Bieberbach conjecture Carathéodory's lemma Constantin Carathéodory proved in 1907 that if : g(z)= 1 +b_1 z + b_2 z^2 + \\\\cdots. is a holomorphic function on the unit disk D with positive real part, then : b_n\\\\le 2. In fact it suffices to show the result with g replaced by gr(z) = g(rz) for any r < 1 and then pass to the limit r = 1. In that case g extends to a continuous function on the closed disc with positive real part and by Schwarz formula : g(z) = {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} { e^{i\\\\theta}+ z\\\\over e^{i\\\\theta} -z} \\\\Re g(e^{i\\\\theta})\\\\, d\\\\theta. Using the identity : { e^{i\\\\theta}+ z\\\\over e^{i\\\\theta} -z} = 1 +2 \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} e^{-in\\\\theta} z^n, it follows that :\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\Re g(e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\,d\\\\theta =1, so defines a probability measure, and :b_n =2\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-int} \\\\Re g(e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\,d\\\\theta. Hence : b_n \\\\le 2 \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\Re g(e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\,d\\\\theta =2. Proof for starlike functions Let : f(z) = z + a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + \\\\cdots be a univalent starlike function in z < 1\\\\. proved that :a_n\\\\le n.

(Note the name is given both with and without the hyphen in different sources.) Origins The Mid Kent Railway was formed on 23 July 1855 to construct a 4.75-mile line between the South Eastern Railway (SER) at Lewisham and the Farnborough Extension of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway (WEL&CPR;) at Beckenham. The intention then was to extend this line to Croydon at a later date. The line opened 1 January 1857 and was operated by the SER under a ten-year agreement. Mid Kent (Bromley & St Mary Cray) Railway  This project was drawn up in 1856 to construct a four-mile line between Shortlands and St Mary Cray. This line was of strategic importance in providing a link between the East Kent Railway and the WEL&CPR;, thereby providing a potential alternative route between London and Dover to the roundabout route used by the South Eastern Railway and so enabling the creation of the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR;) in 1859. This line was leased to the LC&DR; in 1862. Addiscombe Line Although the company later abandoned its intention of building a line to Croydon, an extension to Addiscombe Road through Elmers End was completed in 1862 which was also leased to the SER on completion. Dissolution The remaining interests of the company were taken over by the SER in August 1866. Legacy The Lewisham – Elmers End and the Shortlands – St Mary Cray sections now form parts of the Hayes line and the Chatham main line, respectively.

Life  Koppel was born to Jewish parents in Berlin, where he grew up, but after the Nazi takeover of Germany, they emigrated to Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1933, where he began his education as an artist. In 1938, he and his father Joachim fled to the United Kingdom. His mother, Paula, was plagued by severe arthritis attacks and remained in Czechoslovakia. During the Holocaust, she was deported to Theresienstadt and was eventually murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp. Joachim worked in a factory in Pontypridd, whilst Heinz studied art in London, with the German emigre artist, Martin Bloch, who was to be a great influence on Koppel's later work. Bloch also taught Koppel's cousin, the artist Harry Weinberger, who had fled to England from Czechoslovakia a year after Koppel. In addition, Koppel became interested in Freudian psychoanalysis, which is reflected in his work. Other influences included German Expressionism and Surrealism. From 1944 onwards, Koppel lived in Dowlais, near Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, where he taught art to both children and adults, and the surrounding countryside was an important subject in his paintings, showing mystical influences and often bordering on the fantastic. The decaying industrial areas of Wales were also present in his work, whilst his murdered mother is a motif in a series of papers. In early 1949 he married fellow artist Renate Fischl a German exile born in Dresden, herself a painter of some repute and student of the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing. The couple had four children. In 1956, Koppel left Wales with his wife and children and for a time, he lived in London and Liverpool, where he continued to work as an art teacher and it was during this time that his work began to be regularly exhibited in London galleries. Finally, in 1974, he settled down in Cwmerfyn, near Aberystwyth, remaining active as an artist, and in his later work he experimented with various materials such as fibreglass and resin. He was one of the original members of the 56 Group Wales, which set out to raise the profile of modern Welsh art. Koppel's son Gideon Koppel is an award- winning film maker and a Professor of Media at Manchester School of Art. Koppel died suddenly on 1st December 1980, at the age of 61.  Works  Many of Koppel's works are in museums and galleries in South Wales. In his homeland, however, he is largely unknown. The first exhibition of his works in Germany was held in Berlin between August 2009 and January 2010 at the Centrum Judaicum.

Cakes are formed through several layers of yeast-fermented dough separated by lard that are flattened, stuffed, and baked with a coating of sesame seeds. Commonly eaten as a breakfast food with congee or as a street snack, they are now often bought prepackaged and given as gifts. Preparation After a dough has been formed by mixing water, oil, and wheat flour, yeast is added, and the dough undergoes fermentation. Special attention is paid to the consistency and viscosity of the dough. Afterwards, dough is cut, stuffed with a lard shortening, flattened, and rolled into a tight spiral so that many layers of lard and dough are incorporated, thus obtaining the characteristic layered flakiness of the cakes. The spirals are then filled, rounded into buns, and rolled flat into the characteristic large oval shape. Changzhou sesame cakes exist in both sweet and savory varieties; sweet fillings are made with sugar, and savory fillings are made with lard and scallion. Cakes are then covered in white and sometimes black sesame seeds and baked. Finished cakes are roughly the size of a hand. They are crisp and flaky, with a thin golden crust, and served hot.http://news.sina.com.cn/o/20080722/102914200409s.shtml See also * Huangqiao Sesame Cake * Jin deui * List of sesame seed dishes References Category:Changzhou Category:Chinese cuisine ","title":"Changzhou Sesame Cake"},{"id":"34003244","text":"thumbnail The theory of ologs is an attempt to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for knowledge representation, construction of scientific models and data storage using category theory, linguistic and graphical tools. Ologs were introduced in 2010 by David Spivak, a research scientist in the Department of Mathematics, MIT. Etymology The term \\"olog\\" is short for \\"ontology log\\". \\"Ontology\\" derives from onto-, from the Greek ὤν, ὄντος \\"being; that which is\\", present participle of the verb εἰμί \\"be\\", and -λογία, -logia: science, study, theory. Mathematical formalism At the basic level an olog \\\\mathcal{C} is a category whose objects are represented as boxes containing sentences and whose morphisms are represented as directed labeled arrows between boxes. The structures of the sentences for both the objects and the morphisms of \\\\mathcal{C} need to be compatible with the mathematical definition of \\\\mathcal{C}. This compatibility cannot be checked mathematically, because it lies in the correspondence between mathematical ideas and natural language. Every olog has a target category, which is taken to be \\\\textbf{Set} (Category of sets), the category of sets and functions, unless otherwise mentioned. In that case, we are looking at a set of amino acids, a set of amine groups, and a function that assigns to every amino acid its amine group. In this article we usually stick to \\\\textbf{Set}, though sometimes using the Kleisli category \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathbb{P}} of the power set monad. Another possibility, though one we do not use here, would be to use the Kleisli category of probability distributions—the Giry monad—e.g., to obtain a generalization of Markov decision processes. The boxes in the above example refer to objects of \\\\textbf{Set}. For example, the box containing the sentence \\"an amino acid\\" refers to the set of all amino acids and the box containing the sentence \\"a side chain\\" refers to the set of all side chains. The arrow labeled with \\"has\\" whose source is \\"an amino acid\\" and whose target is \\"a side chain\\" refers to a morphism between two objects of \\\\textbf{Set} and thus needs to be a function between two sets. Indeed, every amino acid has a unique side chain so the arrow is a valid morphism of \\\\textbf{Set}. The functional nature of the morphisms in \\\\textbf{Set} is expressed in an olog by labeling arrows with appropriate sentences (e.g. \\"has\\"). For another example let (\\\\mathbb{P},\\\\eta,\\\\mu) be the power set monad on \\\\textbf{Set} so given A\\\\in Ob(\\\\textbf{Set}), \\\\mathbb{P}(A) is the power set of A, the natural transformation \\\\eta sends a\\\\in A to the singleton \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} and the natural transformation \\\\mu unionizes sets. A morphism f:A\\\\to B in the Kleisli category \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathbb{P}} can be seen as establishing a binary relation R. Given a\\\\in A and b\\\\in B we say that (a,b)\\\\in R if b\\\\in f(a). We can use \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathbb{P}} as the target category for an olog. In this case the arrows in the olog need to reflect the relational nature of morphisms in \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathbb{P}}. This can be done by labeling every arrow in the olog with either \\"is related to\\", or \\"is greater than\\" and so on. Ologs and databases An olog \\\\mathcal{C} can also be viewed as a database schema. Every box (object of \\\\mathcal{C}) in the olog is a table T and the arrows (morphisms) emanating from the box are columns in \\\\mathcal{C}. The assignment of a particular instance to an object of \\\\mathcal{C} is done through a functor I:\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to \\\\textbf{Set}. In the example above, the box \\"an amino acid\\" will be represented as a table whose number of rows is equal to the number of types of amino acids and whose number of columns is three, one column for each arrow emanating from that box. Relations between ologs Communication between different ologs which in practice can be communication between different models or world-views is done using functors. Spivak coins the notions of a 'meaningful' and 'strongly meaningful' functors. Let \\\\mathcal{C} and \\\\mathcal{D} be two ologs, I:\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to \\\\textbf{Set}, J:\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\to \\\\textbf{Set} functors (see the section on ologs and databases) and F:\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D} a functor. We say that a F is meaningful if there exists a natural transformation m:I\\\\to F^{*}J (the pullback of J by F). Taking as an example \\\\mathcal{C} and \\\\mathcal{D} as two different scientific models, the functor F is meaningful if predictions, which are objects in \\\\textbf{Set}, made by the first model \\\\mathcal{C} can be translated to the second model \\\\mathcal{D}. We say that F is strongly meaningful if given an object X\\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} we have I(X)=J(F(X)). This equality is equivalent to requiring m to be a natural isomorphism. Sometimes it will be hard to find a meaningful functor F from \\\\mathcal{C} to \\\\mathcal{D}. In such a case we may try to define a new olog \\\\mathcal{B} which represents the common ground of \\\\mathcal{C} and \\\\mathcal{D} and find meaningful functors F_{\\\\mathcal{C}}:\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to \\\\mathcal{C} and F_{\\\\mathcal{D}}:\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}. If communication between ologs is limited to a two-way communication as described above then we may think of a collection of ologs as nodes of a graph and of the edges as functors connecting the ologs. If a simultaneous communication between more than two ologs is allowed then the graph becomes a symmetric simplicial complex. Rules of good practice Spivak provides some rules of good practice for writing an olog whose morphisms have a functional nature (see the first example in the section Mathematical formalism). The text in a box should adhere to the following rules: # begin with the word \\"a\\" or \\"an\\". (Example: \\"an amino acid\\"). # refer to a distinction made and recognizable by the olog's author. # refer to a distinction for which there is well defined functor whose range is \\\\textbf{Set}, i.e. an instance can be documented. (Example: there is a set of all amino acids). # declare all variables in a compound structure. (Example: instead of writing in a box \\"a man and a woman\\" write \\"a man m and a woman w \\" or \\"a pair (m,w) where m is a man and w is a woman\\"). The first three rules ensure that the objects (the boxes) defined by the olog's author are well-defined sets. The fourth rule improves the labeling of arrows in an olog. Applications The concept was experimentally documented by David Spivak and coauthors Associate Professor Markus J. Buehler of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and CEE graduate student Tristan Giesa in a paper that was published in the December 2011 issue of BioNanoScience in which the researchers establish a scientific analogy between spider silk and musical composition.

Younan is the former President of the Lutheran World Federation (2010–2017),Lutheran World Federation: Who We Are - The President and remains a member of the ELCJHL Council. History Early history The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land has its origins in the arrival of German and English Protestant missionaries to Jerusalem in the mid 19th century. Protestant missions had begun in the early 19th century, but Protestant Christians had no legal protection in the Ottoman Empire, unlike the Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox, who were legally protected by treaty. In 1840, the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV sent his diplomat, Christian von Bunsen to present a proposal to Queen Victoria of Great Britain for the establishment of a joint Protestant bishopric under the protection of both Prussia and Great Britain. An agreement was reached to establish a joint bishopric of the Anglican Church of England and the Evangelical Church in Prussia, comprising Lutheran, Calvinist and united Protestant congregations, known as the Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem and this was facilitated by the passing of the Bishops in Foreign Countries Act 1841. The first Bishop was a Jewish convert, Michael Solomon Alexander, who arrived in 1842. Early Lutheran mission In 1851, Theodor Fliedner was invited to bring four deaconesses to begin a hospital and the first formal school for girls in the Levant, Talitha Kumi, was set up in Jerusalem. In 1860, Johann Ludwig Schneller set up the Syrian Orphanage in Jerusalem for children who were made homeless or orphaned by civil war in the region. A provisional chapel for the use of the Prussian Protestants was erected in 1871 on land granted by Sultan Abdülaziz in the Muristan area of Jerusalem. Due to political and theological differences, the joint bishopric was finally abolished in 1886 and the Evangelical mission continued work independently of the Anglicans. Lutherans focused primarily on social work and education while the Anglicans focused on evangelism. In 1898, the newly constructed Church of the Redeemer was officiated by Kaiser Wilhelm II and served as the headquarters of the Evangelical mission. Autonomy and independence After the Second World War the World Lutheran Federation (WLF) took care of the remnants of the German-initiated Evangelical missions, combining Lutheran, Calvinist and united Protestant efforts. Due to the influence of the WLF the Lutheran aspect prevailed.Mitri Raheb, \\"Die evangelische lutherische Kirche in Palästina und Jordanien: Vergangenheit und Gegenwart\\", in: Dem Erlöser der Welt zur Ehre: Festschrift zum hundertjährigen Jubiläum der Einweihung der evangelischen Erlöserkirche in Jerusalem, Karl- Heinz Ronecker (ed.) on behalf of «Jerusalem-Stiftung» and «Jerusalemsverein», Leipzig: Evangelische Verlags-Anstalt, 1998, pp. 183–200, here p. 193. . In 1947, the Lutheran mission was granted autonomy from the Evangelical Church in Germany and in 1959 was recognised as an autonomous religious community by King Hussein of Jordan. The church was then officially named the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan (ELCJ). The ELCJ had by then grew beyond Jerusalem and had set up congregations in Ramallah and Amman to serve Lutheran Palestinians who were refugees of the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 1974, the ELCJ joined the WLF and in 1979 the first Palestinian bishop, Daoud Haddad, was elected to lead the church. In 2005, the Synod of the ELCJ decided to rename the church to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land to more accurately reflect the work and ministry of the church that spans Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Despite being in a minor key it is predominantly positive in tone, though with some hints in the slow movement of the emotional turmoil of Fauré's life at the time of the composition. Background In 1877, after wooing her for five years, Fauré had finally become engaged to Marianne Viardot, daughter of the well-known singer Pauline Viardot. The engagement lasted for less than four months, and Marianne broke it off, to Fauré's considerable distress. It was in the later stages of their relationship that he began work on the quartet, in the summer of 1876.Nectoux. p. 84 He completed it in 1879, and revised it in 1883, completely rewriting the finale. The first performance of the original version was given on 14 February 1880. In a study dated 2008, Kathryn Koscho notes that the original finale has not survived, and is believed to have been destroyed by Fauré in his last days.Koscho, p. 56 Structure The work follows the conventional layout of the genre, with four movements of roughly similar proportions. The opening movement is the longest, the second, scherzo, movement the shortest. ;Allegro molto moderato The first movement is in sonata form.Koscho, p. 57 The commentator Carl Dahlhaus refers to the \\"almost opulent cantabile and extreme refinement of texture\\" of the opening movements of both of Fauré's piano quartets.Dahlhaus, p. 291 The opening theme, a vigorous melody showing the influence of Brahms,\\"Gabriel Faure Piano Quartet No. 1 in C minor Opus 15\\", New Zealand Piano Quartet, accessed 9 December 2011 contrasts with a delicate second theme in E major (later in the movement it is in C major), in which the off-beats are lightly stressed, unlike the flowing first theme.Koscho, p. 61 The movement ends with a final statement of the opening theme. ; Scherzo, Allegro vivo The second movement, a playful scherzo, is one of Fauré's rare virtuoso pieces. He generally shied away from brilliant instrumental display, but the Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that here, as in the First Violin Sonata, composed just before the quartet, the composer felt a brilliant scherzo necessary to preserve the balance of the whole work.Nectoux, p. 89 The movement follows the traditional scherzo-trio-scherzo structure and consists of two contrasting principal themes in E major and G minor in the scherzo sections with a third in B major in the central trio section only.Koscho, p. 74 ;Adagio After the high-spirited scherzo, the slow movement has a strong air of sadness. Koscho writes, \\"It is striking for its unsettled, lachrymose air, which Fauré prolongs through a combination of frustrated harmonic progressions and ascending melodic fragments.\\"Koscho, p. 83 It is in conventional ternary form with the main C minor melody giving way to a central theme in A major, before returning to end the movement. The critic Stephen Johnson writes that the movement gives the listener \\"more than a hint\\" of Fauré's sadness at the events of 1877, though \\"the emotion is always nobly restrained, with not even the slightest hint of self-indulgence.\\"Johnson, p. 2 ;Allegro molto The lively finale is based on two themes, the first in C minor, referring back to themes earlier in the quartet, and the second tonally ambiguous but primarily in E major.Koscho, p. 90 The two themes are brought together in C major to conclude the piece.Koscho, pp. 96–97 Notes References  External links * *Performance of Piano Quartet No. 1 by Musicians from Ravinia's Steans Institute from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in MP3 format Category:Compositions by Gabriel Fauré Faure Category:1879 compositions Category:Compositions in C minor ","title":"Piano Quartet No. 1 (Fauré)"},{"id":"34003452","text":"Map of the tectonic setting of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake showing the fault lines across the Tenasserim Hills The Three Pagodas Fault is a right- lateral displacement strike-slip fault between Burma and Thailand named after the Three Pagodas Pass.

Consisting of 15,683 lines of poetry, it holds the distinction of being the longest poem in Tulu. The epic is essentially a biography of a legendary Bunt princess Siri Alvedi and expands to describe the fate of her progeny - son Kumara, daughter Sonne and grand daughters Abbage and Darage. The epic declares Siri's divinity and also that of her progeny and she is worshipped as a Daiva (demi goddess) across Tulu Nadu region of South West India in temples known as Adi Alade. Siri is the patron deity of the Tulu people. Her worship and mass possession cult surrounding her transgresses caste and ethnic lines. The Epic of Siri, though in Tulu, is well known in Kannada speaking populations in and around Tulu Nadu. It is recited in parts in a highly ritual style during the annual festival of Siri Jatre and mass possession festival called Dayyol. Complete recitation of the epic takes close to about 25 hours. The Epic of Siri has been translated into English by Lauri Honko, a Finnish linguo-folklorist. Plot summary According to the legend, there existed a principality of Sathyanapura whose ruler was an aging Bunt man of Arya Bannaya Bali lineage named Bermanna Alva (Alupas ?). He had retired himself to his manor of Majaluttu Beedu in depression after the death of his wife and only daughter. Annu Shetty, son of one Shankar Alva, a relative, was managing the affairs of the principality on his behalf. Bermanna’s constant worry was a lack of suitable heir to his throne. He wished for an heir and prayed to Brahma. Brahma, disguising himself as a Brahmin, visited Bermanna and said that his current state of sorrow was because he had neglected the worship of his ancestral deity whose temple lay in ruins in the village of Nidgal. On the advice of Brahma in disguise, Bermanna went to Nidgal, renovated the temple of his ancestral deity and conducted puja ceremonies. He returned home with the Prasadam - Areca nut flowers and sandalwood paste. Overnight the Prasadam turned magically into a little baby girl. Bermanna, realising that the baby was a gift from Brahma himself, brought her up as his own daughter naming her ‘’Siri’. Siri grew up to be a beautiful maiden. Kantha Poonja, a minor Bunt Feudal Lord of Basrur Beedu fiefdom longed to marry her. His mother Sankari Poonjedi arranged for her son’s marriage to Siri by promising Bermanna Alva that Kantha Poonja would look after the administration of both the principalities (Majaluttu Beedu and Basrur Beedu) without any difference of rank. After her marriage, Siri soon became pregnant. In the seventh month, the baby shower ceremony (Bayake) is held. Kantha Poonja goes to a neighbouring town to purchase a costly saree for her. On his way home, Kantha Poonja visits his mistress, a prostitute named Siddu. Siddu, on seeing the lovely saree, forcefully tries it on despite Kantha Poonja’s disapproval. Kantha Poonja orders her to remove the saree immediately and fold it again since it was a gift for his wife. On the day of the baby shower (Bayake), Siri refuses to accept the saree brought by Kantha Poonja, saying that it had adorned a prostitute first. Kantha Poonja is enraged and develops a grudge against Siri for insulting him in front of his guests. Bermanna Alva tries to pacify the couple and then takes her back to Sathyanpura for the delivery as per prevailing custom. Siri soon delivers a baby boy named Kumara. Bermanna sends the message of the birth to Basrur but no one – neither Kantha Poonja nor his mother - replies. Soon Bermanna Alva dies. A succession battle ensues between Siri and Annu Shetty over the throne of Sathynapura. Kantha Poonja conspires against Siri by joining hands with Annu Shetty. The dispute of succession is taken to a council of elders who are bribed by Kantha Poonja to rule against Siri. Siri realising the conspiracy through her divine powers curses her husband Kantha Poonja that his lands should remain barren and his clan remain childless. Through her divine powers she also burns down the manor of Majaluttu Beedu which was now under the possession of Annu Shetty. Soon she leaves Satynapura accompanied by her infant son Kumara and a maid servant Daru and proceeds towards the forest of Bola. She performs various miracles on her journey to Bola Forest. In the meantime Siri loses her child and Daru, the maidservant who accompanied her from Satyanapur. Soon she meets the twin kings of Bola, Kariya Kaasinghe and Boliya Deesinghe who on hearing her tragedy sympathise and accept her as their foster sister. They also arrange her marriage with Kodsar Alva of Kotradi fiefdom (Kotrapady Guthu). This marriage turns out to be a happy one and she gives birth to daughter name Sonne after which she breathes her last before which she declares that anyone who worships her will have abundance in their life and will be cured of various diseases. The second part of the story deals with Siri’s daughter Sonne, who is married to one Guru Marla. The couple remains childless after many years of marriage. They make a vow to Brahma that if they have children they will devote them to the worship of Brahma. In due course, Sonne becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins girls, Abbage and Darage. Sonne and Guru Marla forget the vow made to Brahma. One day Brahma comes to them disguising himself as an astrologer. He predicts that,‘’If you forget your vow, you will be troubled or get into trouble. God may take back his boon.’’ Guru Marla gets angry at this prediction and tells the astrologer to leave his house immediately. Later one day, Sonne and Guru Marla have to leave their house for some work. Before leaving, they keep the game of ‘’Cenne’’ in a box and lock it. They do this because they know the girls often quarrel while playing the game. After they leave, Brahma comes to their house disguising himself as a Brahmin and opens the lock to remove the Cenne game (a Tamil variation of mancala). He tells the girls Abbage and Darrage to play it. Soon the girls start quarreling over the game and in a fit of rage one of the girls strikes the other violently on the head with the wooden board that is used to play the game. The girl succumbs to her injuries and dies. Realising this, the other twin also commits suicide by jumping into the well. Sonne and Guru Marla return home and get worried on not finding their daughters. Brahma disguised as a Brahmin appears before them and says ‘’As you did not fulfil your vow, god has taken back his boon.’’ He then disappears. Worship Siri is worshipped in Tulu Nadu across caste and ethnic lines. There are numerous temples dedicated to her and her progeny called Adi Alade. Five among them are the most important. These Temples are the venue for the annual festival held in her honour called Siri Jatre and also the Daliyopaliyo - a mass possession cult of women associated with her. The Five Temples are *Adi Alade Temple of Hiriadka in Udupi district, Karnataka, India *Adi Alade Temple of Pangala in Udupi district, Karnataka, India *Adi Alade Temple of Nandalike in Udupi district, Karnataka, India *Adi Alade Temple of Kavathar in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, India *Adi Alade Temple of Nidgal in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, India References Siri, Epic of Category: Tulu people Category:Tulu language Category:Bunt (community) ","title":"Epic of Siri"},{"id":"34003459","text":"St. Jerome in his study, 1451, now in the Walters Art Museum Antonio da Fabriano (active in mid 15th century) was an Italian painter, active in the Region of Marche.

History The station was a typical Great Western Railway building, with a wide canopy stretching across the platform. The original station building was constructed from wood. By 1913 it was in need of rebuilding and was completed in brick over the next 3 years. In 1908, confusion between Tetbury railway station and Tetbury Road railway station ( north-east on the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway) led to the latter being renamed Coates railway station. Prior to the name change, both stations had taken erroneous delivery of the other's goods. In 1926, the use of the station's signal box was discontinued when the points began to be operated from a ground frame by the engineman. In 1930, the platform was extended to allow horses to be transported to and from the Beaufort Polo Club in nearby Westonbirt. In 1963, an entire Tetbury farm - complete with machinery, foodstuffs, staff and pedigree herd of Hereford cattle - was transported from the station to Stranraer in 31 vehicles. On 4 April 1964, the Tetbury branch line was closed as part of the Beeching Axe. The railway line and main station building were later demolished, with sleepers being used in pathways. The area was subsequently converted into a car park. In 2016 the Staffordshire blue brick goods shed was converted into an arts centre in a joint programme by Tetbury Town Council and Tetbury Rail Lands Regeneration Trust (TRLRT).  Use  The line's primary economy was livestock. A cattle market was built adjacent to the station, and the line's freight generally consisted of food for livestock, milk, and coal. The Gloucestershire-Wiltshire border was such that livestock would pass from one county to another on entering the station - with different swine fever regulations in place between the counties, the station would experience lengthy delays before livestock could be trucked into and out of the station.

Forrest was also the fastest-intensifying tropical cyclone on record, with its minimum barometric pressure dropping from 976 millibars to 876 millibars—a drop of 100 millibars—from September 22 to September 23, in less than a day. Forrest affected Japan in September 1983 and formed from a tropical disturbance far from land in the western Pacific Ocean. On September 20, the system was classified as a tropical storm, and thereafter began to intensify. The next day, Forrest reached typhoon status, and the intensification process accelerated. The storm prudently strengthened on September 22, and the following morning, attained peak intensity following a pressure drop of in slightly less than 24 hours. Thereafter, Forrest began to weaken slowly as it moved northwest. Approaching Japan, Super Typhoon Forrest first hit Okinawa on September 27\\\\. Nearby, a tornado hit Inza Island, destroying 26 homes and injuring 26 people. Forrest then moved north, impaling the Japanese archipelago before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 28, before eventually dissipating on October 4\\\\. The torrential rainfall caused by the typhoon triggered deadly landslides and flooding across Japan. In all, the typhoon killed at least 21 people, left 17 listed as missing, and injured 86. Forrest flooded 46,000 homes in muddy water, over 100 dwellings were destroyed, and 2,560 people were rendered as homeless. Seven flights were called off and 27,000 people were stranded. In addition, 67 bridges and 818 roads were damaged.  Meteorological history  Typhoon Forrest originated from an area of disturbed weather that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) around west of Pohnpei in mid- September. Initially, the system was not well-organized; however, it had a sufficient amount of convection. Hurricane Hunters investigated the system four times from September 17–20, though none of them were able to identify a closed atmospheric circulation. Despite this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued on September 18\\\\. This alert was issued again on September 19; meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor the system. By early on September 20, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm as it moved west-northwest. During the evening hours of September 20, the JTWC started issuing warnings on the system after the low developed a central dense overcast. At this time, the storm was located about south of Guam. Initially, only gradually strengthening was expected by the JTWC, but this did not occur and by the morning hours of September 21, Hurricane Hunters measured winds of . Based on this, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and named it Forrest. Around this time, JMA upgraded Forrest into a severe tropical storm. By 1800 UTC that day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Forrest to typhoon status as the storm developed an eye. After moving away from Guam, Forrest continued deepening; by the evening hours of September 21, Hurricane Hunter data indicated a minimum barometric pressure of . Eleven hours later, however, the aircraft reported a pressure of ; according to the JTWC, this marked a pressure drop of in a little under a day. At midday on September 22, the JTWC assessed the intensity of the storm at , equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, and placed the storm's barometric pressure at , which marked the fastest pressure drop ever recorded by a tropical cyclone— in just under 24 hours. By this time, the temperature within the eye had reached . Despite this, the JMA estimated that Forrest had 10-minute sustained winds of only . Several hours later, the agency still estimated winds of . After a brief turn towards the west-northwest, the JMA reported that Forrest attained its peak intensity at 0000 UTC on September 23, with winds of and a minimum central pressure of . After attaining peak intensity, the storm weakened slightly on September 24 according to the JMA, though the storm briefly restrengthened to its peak wind speed at noon on September 25. By this time, Forrest was moving northwest, and the JTWC expected the storm to re-curve due to a weak spot in the subtropical ridge. However, the re-curvature took longer than expected. The JMA suggested that the storm maintained its intensity of for several days. On September 27, however, the JMA estimated that Forrest finally began to weaken. The storm quickly weakened thereafter, and by midday, the JMA downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. During September 28, the system completed its extratropical transition, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system early on the next day. After becoming an extratropical cyclone the system recurved and started to accelerate towards the east-northeast, before the JMA stopped monitoring the system during September 30, as it moved into the East Pacific basin. Thereafter, several ships reported storm and gale force winds while the system moved towards the east-northeast and along southwest Alaska. The system subsequently stalled and gradually dissipated over the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska, with the system being last identifiable on October 4, about northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Preparations and impact During its formative stages, the storm passed near Guam, where winds of were measured. Rainfall was light, totaling , but was enough to result in slight flooding. While weakening and passing southwest of Okinawa, gusty winds and heavy rains were recorded. At the Kadena Air Base, winds of and gusts of were measured. Rainfall of was recorded, resulting in minor flooding. A few people were hurt due to high winds, but according to the JTWC, the residents of Okinwana weathered the storm \\"well\\". Numerous funnel clouds were spotted, but no tornadoes were recorded. Northwest of Okinwana, on Inaka Island, a tornado was reported, which cleared a wide swath. Throughout the island of Okinawa, 30 sustained minor injuries and 20 homes would either damaged or destroyed, including seven homes that were destroyed. About 160,000 customers lost power. When the storm posed a threat to Kyushu, five ships were evacuated to an air force base that was considered \\"safe typhoon haven\\" by the JTWC. In Motoyama, of rain fell, including in 24 hours and in one hour. In Nagoya, five children were washed away by rising floodwaters while they were walking home from school. Four of the children were confirmed dead, and one 5-year-old child was reported missing. In Nishinomiya, near the western city of Kyoto, twelve construction workers were swept away by a downpour-triggered mudslide. Four of the construction workers were rescued, but the remaining eight of the construction workers were missing. Elsewhere in the city, a landslide destroyed two homes, resulting in the deaths of a 71-year-old and a 77-year-old farmer. Around south of Tokyo, in Shizuoka, three construction workers were swept along the Nishi River. In Hyogo, on Honshu, 12 people were buried alive when a hut collapsed due to a mudslide. In all, Forrest killed at least 21 people, left 17 missing, and injured 86. Due to overflowing rivers and dikes, 46,000 houses were flooded, including 141 \\"seriously\\". Around 7,700 homes were under water, and over 100 were destroyed. In addition, 67 bridges and 818 roads were damaged. A total of 2,560 people were homeless. Seven flights were called off and 27,000 air travelers were stranded. Train service was halted for hours and track lines were damaged in eight places.

It serves as the administrative center of Belokrestsky Selsoviet, one of the seven selsoviets into which Chagodoshchensky District is administratively divided. Municipally, it is incorporated as Sazonovo Urban Settlement, one of the two urban settlements in the district. Population: History Sazonovo was founded in 1923 as a selo around the Pokrovsky (since 1924 Sazonovsky) glass-making factory. It had the name of Belye Kresty and belonged to Ustyuzhensky Uyezd of Cherepovets Governorate. On August 1, 1927 Cherepovets Governorate was abolished, and its area became Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Simultaneously, uyezds were abolished, and Verkhne-Chagodoshchensky District was established, with the center in Belye Kresty. In 1932 the district was renamed into Chagodoshchensky District, and between 1932 and 1935, the district center was located in the urban-type settlement of Bely Bychok (currently Chagoda), but in 1935 it was transferred back to Belye Kresty. On September 23, 1937 Chagodoshchensky District was transferred to newly established Vologda Oblast. In 1947, Belye Kresty was renamed into Sazonovo and obtained the status of urban-type settlement. During the aborted administrative reform of the 1960s, Chagodoshchensky District was briefly disestablished and then reestablished in 1965. After the reestablishment, Chagoda became the district center. Economy Industry The Pokrovsky glass-making factory was founded in 1860 and renamed into Sazonovsky glass-making factory in 1924 in memory of the worker Denis Sazonov who died in an accident on the factory. It is still in operation. Transportation A114 highway, connecting Vologda to Cherepovets and Saint Petersburg, passes the northern outskirts of Sazonovo. There is a connecting road to Chagoda and local roads, but no other through roads to other districts or to Leningrad or Novgorod Oblasts. A railway line connecting the stations of Kabozha (in Novgorod Oblast) and Podborovye (Leningrad Oblast) runs through Chagodoshchensky District from the south to the north. The station of Ogaryovo is located in Sazonovo. A narrow-gauge railroad which connected Sazonovo with the selo of Borisovo and was used for peat transportation and for passenger service has been discontinued.

Built 1828-1830, it is a rare example in Maine of a Cape style house built out of stone in the English masonry style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Stone House stands in a rural part of southern Bridgton, on the north side of Burnham Road, a short way west of its junction with Willis Park Road. The house is built on a sloping lot, and presents a single story to the south and two stories to the north. It is built out of slabs of granite hand-quarried from a local quarry, with a timber-frame half story. It has a gabled roof and a central brick chimney, and modern ells extend the building to the west. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by sidelight windows. The house was built in 1828-30 by John Mead, Sr., an Englishman who settled here in the early 1800s. In 1828, his house was destroyed by a freak windstorm, and he decided to build a house that was capable of withstanding such events. It is the only house known in western Maine that uses English masonry methods. Mead was also engaged in the only known instance in the state of planting mulberry trees for the purpose of cultivating silk worms.

Built in 1799, it was probably one of Brunswick's grandest houses of the time, built for John Dunlap, a prominent local businessman. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Dunlap House is located in a residential area west of Brunswick's downtown, on the north side of Oak Street west of Union Street. It is set on a slight rise that would have had a fine view of the Androscoggin River to the north, from which it is now separated by United States Route 1. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, two interior chimneys, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade, which faces east, has a Greek Revival portico sheltering the centered entrance, with fluted Ionic columns supporting an entablature and cornice. The entry is flanked by sidelights and topped by a transom window. Two single-story additions extend the building to the west, parallel to the street. It had 50 rooms, views of the river, and gardens that were unmatched in the town. It had a 50-foot drawing room and a three-story mahogany staircase. The house was built in 1799 and designed by the Melcher Brothers, Samuel III and Aaron. It was considered the finest home in Brunswick upon completion, built for Brunswick's wealthiest resident, John Dunlap. Dunlap was the son of the first minister in the town. He gained massive wealth through the fur trade as well as in Brunswick's burgeoning lumber industry. Congressman Charles J. Gilman married a descendant of John Dunlap, Alice McKeen Dunlap, and lived in the mansion. The property stayed in the family until 1929, and was later subdivided into apartments.

There was a coal wharf in Stafford, and a single lock to connect it to the canal. It opened in 1816, and closed in the 1920s. There are proposals to restore the navigation as the Stafford Riverway Link. History The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal provided a navigable link between the River Severn and Birmingham, and had been opened in May 1772. It served Stafford by the provision of a wharf at Radford Bank, but goods had to be transferred to carts for the final journey into the town. The first proposals for a navigable link to Stafford were made in 1798. The scheme involved aqueducts to cross the River Sow and the River Penk, but the canal was not built. In order to supply Stafford, a horse tramway was constructed from the town to Radford Wharf, which opened on 1 November 1805. The Stafford Railway Coal and Lime Company owned the tramway, on which horses hauled wagons capable of holding around 1.5 tons of coal or lime. The terminus was by Green Bridge in Stafford, but it appears that it was not a profitable concern, as John Hall, one of the four owners, sold his £810 share in the business for £254 in 1811, and the company was bankrupt by 1813. A navigation was again proposed in 1810 by Owen Hall, who wanted to make the Penk and the Sow navigable, and obtained permission from the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal to construct a lock at Radford. By 1812, the plans included an inclined plane to connect the Penk and the Sow to the main canal. By the time it was built, it had been simplified by connecting the Sow directly to the canal at Baswich. The lock was opened on 19 February 1816, and so the canal cannot have been used before that, although the railway had been sold in 1814. Although it used the river, much of the channel was a new cut, designed to eliminate a series of sharp bends which remained as oxbow lakes to the south of the new route and were still clearly visible on maps in 1938.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1938 The canal was privately built, as all the land through which it ran was owned by Sir George William Jerningham, later Lord Stafford. A lease for its use was initially held by Messrs Fereday and Company who owned Gornal colliery. This was later transferred to the Moat Colliery Company, and in 1838, they sold it to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal company for £50. Subsequently, the branch was improved and the tolls were reduced. At Stafford, the navigation had its own channel, separated from the river by a narrow strip of land, which carried the towpath, and there was a coal wharf to the south of the channel. The area was bounded to the west by Green Bridge, originally constructed in the thirteenth century, but rebuilt in brick and stone in 1781/2 and widened in the 1860s. A wooden footbridge carried the towpath from the north bank of the river to the north bank of the coal wharf channel. Decline The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal leased the navigation from Lord Stafford throughout its life, but did not renew the lease in 1927. Adam Boulton leased the coal wharf at Stafford until 1927, but there is no record of its use after that date. The coal wharf channel was filled in during the 1930s, and the writer Tom Rolt wrote that the entrance from the canal was blocked in 1944. Although Stafford Borough Council were hopeful for its future when they surveyed it in 1948, it continued to decline. Most of the infrastructure near the lock was removed in the 1970s, as part of a scheme to improve flood relief on the Penk and the Sow. The Penk itself was diverted into the Deepmoor Drain, over which the aqueduct used to run, and now joins the Sow much closer to St Thomas Bridge.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,000 map, 1973-1990 Restoration The River Sow at Victoria Park. The terminus of the Stafford Riverway Link would eventually be near here. With the steady progress made in restoring and reopening canals during the 1970s, members of a local canal society first suggested that the navigation could be restored in 1975. It was seen as a way to ease congestion on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, and the group suggested that the appropriate authorities should review the possibilities. The next significant event was the publishing of a letter in Waterways World in August 2002, in which a resident of Stafford called Keith Taylor stated that he had found the remains of the lock. The towpath had by then become a recognised walking route, and his suggestion that the navigation should be explored let to research by a number of others, and the formation of Stafford Riverway Link, a group which would spearhead the restoration and attempt to gain local authority support for it. The group became a community interest company in December 2009. Because of the flood relief work and the diversion of the River Penk, the Environment Agency are unlikely to approve the reinstatement of the aqueduct. A feasibility study for reconstruction, carried out by the engineers Halcrow Group, has therefore suggested a lock much closer to the junction with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, to connect the canal to the River Penk. The new route would either follow the Penk downstream to its junction with the Sow, or a new cut would be made between the two. The initial proposal is to reach a temporary terminus just below Green Bridge, close to the Asda Supermarket. The estimated cost for a navigation with a channel which is deep is £4.7 million. In the longer term, the aim is for the terminus to be at Victoria Park, a little way upstream from the town centre, and this would increase the cost to £6 million. Route The navigation left the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal immediately opposite Baswich Salt Works. A roving bridge carried the canal towpath over the channel, which headed north. A small aqueduct carried it over a drainage ditch, and into the lock.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1901 At normal river levels, the fall of the lock was about . The course turned to the north-west, to join the River Sow, with the towpath on the south bank. Most traffic turned left, to proceed upstream, but boats could also reach St Thomas flour mill a little way downstream, although this was not advisable when the river was in flood. Immediately after the junction, the River Penk joined the Sow, and a footbridge carried the towpath over the confluence. The river follows a generally western course towards Stafford. At Fairway Bridge, the site of the first of the oxbox lakes formed by straightening the channel, the towpath crosses to the north bank of the river. The next bridge carried Riverway over the navigation. Its single span is made of reinforced concrete, and it was designed by William Plant, who was the Stafford Town surveyor and engineer at the time. It was formally opened on 15 December 1914. The next bridge is much more recent. It was built in the late 1970s and carries the A34 road, here called Queensway.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,000 map, 1981 The coal wharf channel left the river just to the west of the bridge site, and ended just before Green Bridge, which carries Bridge Street. On the north bank of the river to the east of Green Bridge there were public Brine Baths, which were called the Royal Brine Baths after a visit by Princess Mary, later the wife of King George V, in 1895. There was a boatyard beside the baths in 1907, where canoes and rowing boats could be hired by the public, and boating for pleasure was popular at this time.

In those days, people tried to appease the smallpox demon by assuaging his anger, or they tried to attack the demon since they had no other effective treatment for smallpox. Minamoto no Tametomo defeats a smallpox devil from Yoshitoshi's 36 drawings of Yokai A smallpox demon enshrined History In Japanese, the word hōsōshin or hōsōgami (疱瘡神 (ほうそうしん, ほうそうがみ）) translates literally to \\"smallpox god\\". According to the Shoku Nihongi, smallpox was introduced into Japan in 735 into Fukuoka Prefecture from Korea. In those days, smallpox had been considered to be the result of onryō, which was a mythological spirit from Japanese folklore who is able to return to the physical world in order to seek vengeance.Kyogoku[2008:295] Smallpox-related kamis include Sumiyoshi sanjin Sakurai[1980:262-263] In a book published in the Kansei years (1789–1801), there were lines that wrote that smallpox devils were enshrined in families which had smallpox in order to recover from smallpox. Smallpox devils were said to be afraid of red things and also of dogs; thus people displayed various dolls that were red. In Okinawa, they tried to praise and comfort devils with sanshin, an Okinawan musical instrument and lion dances before a patient clad in red clothes. They offered flowers and burned incense in order to please smallpox demon.Aoyama[1997:200] In Okinawa, there was smallpox poetry in Ryuka; the purpose of smallpox poetry in the Ryukyu language is the glorification of the smallpox demon, or improvement from deadly infection of smallpox.Higa[1983ge:848] There is a collection of smallpox poetry including 105 poems published in 1805.Higa[1983ge:450] Traditional smallpox folk dances have been observed even in present-day Japan, including Ibaraki Prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture, for the avoidance of smallpox devils. Red treatment In European countries the \\"red treatment\\" was practiced from the 12th century onwards; when he caught smallpox, King Charles V of France was dressed in a red shirt, red stockings, and a red veil.Uyeno [2007:264] Queen Elizabeth I of England was likewise wrapped in a red blanket and placed by a live fire when she fell ill with smallpox in 1562, and similar treatments were applied to other European monarchs. In parts of India, China, Africa and Latin America, sacrifices were made to appease the gods of smallpox. In medieval Europe, prayer and pious living were recommended as one way to guard against sickness. Many Japanese textbooks on dermatology stated that red light was able to weaken the symptoms of smallpox.Uyeno[2007:264] This was common in China, India, Turkey and Georgia. In western Africa, the Yoruba god of smallpox, Sopona, was associated with the color red. The red treatment was given scientific authority by Nobel laureate Niels Ryberg Finsen, who claimed that the treatment of smallpox patients with red light reduced the severity of scarring, and later developed rules governing erythrotherapy.Finsen, 1901 These beliefs lingered on into the 1930s until researchers declared it to be useless.

Although the 116-year-old Mullaperiyar dam is located in Kerala, it is operated by the government of Tamil Nadu which signed a 100-year lease agreement with the former British government to irrigate farmland on its side. The agreement was signed by the Secretary of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu) under the British Raj and the King of Travancore. Kerala from technical survey says the old masonry dam built with lime surkhi mortar is structurally getting weaker and costly in leakage and massive cracks -shear maintenance in abutments above all it poses significant danger to approximately 3 million people living in the region and that it needs to be rebuilt - a move opposed by Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu maintains that the endangered dam was repaired in 1979 and insists the dam's walls have been strengthened and that it can hold more water than the current level of 136 ft (41m) and also due to the fact it only takes around 25,000 INR per year payment for an estimated usage of water for 8000 acres per British oppression era lease,http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/images/8/8f/124.pdf this doesn't include how many tmc feet could be shared which is also a blissful loophole in the Mullayar-\\"Periyar Lease Deed of 1886\\" that the government is unwilling to waive. In a 1998 affidavit the Tamil Nadu Government admitted that it drew around 21 tmcft or 594636000000 L (Five hundred ninety-four billion, six hundred thirty-six million litre) annually for around 2,30,000 Acres.http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/tamil-nadu-and- kerala-slug-it-out-over-mullaperiyar-dam-5475 Protests, calling for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene, erupted across Kerala demanding construction of a new dam to replace the Mullaperiyar dam. These new protests were triggered by recent low-intensity earthquakes that prompted scientists to say the dam could not withstand more-intensive tremors. The public and scientific consensus over the seismic vulnerability of the Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, and the Tamil Nadu's resistance to accept the vulnerability of the Dam has strained the inter-state relationship since the 2000s.For details on how Kerala successfully constructed a scientific argument about the seismic vulnerability of the Mullaperiyar dam since 2001, see Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala. Oxford University Press, New Delhi, pp.126-141. This was followed by the chief minister of Kerala's meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to try to resolve the damaging row with neighbouring Tamil Nadu. As the row intensified, police in Kerala banned gatherings of more than five people at the dam near the Tamil Nadu border. The move was followed clashes between people from the two states near the town of Kumali. In the country's capital, Members of Parliament from Kerala and Tamil Nadu clashed in India's upper house of parliament over the Issue. However, the issue is at large in multiple dimensions like water shortage, right to protection, etc.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Rain-dependent-southern- states-spar-over-sharing-water-India-Water-Week-is-currently-being- observed/articleshow/51764291.cms Thousands of people of Kerala have formed a 208 km human wall in a following day to demand a replacement to the dam although Tamil Nadu insists it is safe and that water levels can be raised. The protest was led by the opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) in which politicians, social activists and families along the way took part. The central government has invited senior officials from both states to discuss the issue later in December 2011. In May 2014, Supreme Court of India ruled that Water level in the dam can be increased from 136 ft to 142 ft. It also struck down Kerala Irrigation Water Conservation Act and constituted a permanent Supervisory Committee to oversee all the issues concerning Mullaperiyar dam.  Interstate dispute  A poster in a bus in Tamil Nadu against Kerala's state in this issue For Tamil Nadu, Mullaperiyar dam and the diverted Periyar waters act is a source for Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramnad Districts, providing water for irrigation, drinking and also for generation of power in Lower Periyar Power Station. Tamil Nadu has insisted on exercising its unfettered rights to control the dam and its waters, based on the 1866 lease agreement.Kerala has pointed out the unfairness in the 1886 lease agreement and has challenged the validity of this agreement. However safety concerns posed by the 116 year old dam to the safety of the people of Kerala in the event of a dam collapse, have been the focus of disputes from 2009 onward. Kerala's proposal for decommissioning the dam and construction of a new dam on the basis of environmental and life-threatening risk it possess, has been challenged by Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu has insisted on raising the water level in the dam to 142 feet, pointing out crop failures. One estimate maintains that \\"the crop losses to Tamil Nadu, because of the reduction in the height of the dam, between 1980 and 2005 is a whopping 40,000 crores. In the process the farmers of the erstwhile rain shadow areas in Tamil Nadu who had started a thrice yearly cropping pattern had to go back to the bi-annual cropping.\\"The Mullaperiyar imbroglio. Hard News. April 2006 The Kerala Government states that this is not true and the objections raised are political than for welfare.

The Tamil Nadu government had increased its withdrawal from the reservoir, with additional facilities to cater to the increased demand from newly irrigated areas. In 2006, the Supreme Court of India by its decision by a three-member division bench, allowed for the storage level to be raised to pending completion of the proposed strengthening measures, provision of other additional vents and implementation of other suggestions. Mullaperiyar water level can be raised. Deccan Herald. 28 February 2006 However, the Kerala Government promulgated a new \\"Dam Safety Act\\" against increasing the storage level of the dam, which has not been objected by the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu challenged it on various grounds. The Supreme Court issued notice to Kerala to respond, however did not stay the operation of the Act even as an interim measure. The Court then advised the States to settle the matter amicably, and adjourned hearing in order to enable them to do so. The Supreme Court of India termed the act as not unconstitutional. Mullaperiyar: apex court issues notice to Government . The Hindu. 9 September 2006. Retrieved on 2011-11-25. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court constituted a Constitution bench to hear the case considering its wide ramifications. Kerala did not object giving water to Tamil Nadu. Their main cause of objection is the dams safety as it is as old as 110 years. Increasing the level would add more pressure to be handled by already leaking dam. Tamil Nadu wants the 2006 order of Supreme court be implemented so as to increase the water level to . In 2000 Frontline one author stated thus: \\"For every argument raised by Tamil Nadu in support of its claims, there is counter- argument in Kerala that appears equally plausible. Yet, each time the controversy gets embroiled in extraneous issues, two things stand out: One is Kerala's refusal to acknowledge the genuine need of the farmers in the otherwise drought-prone regions of Tamil Nadu for the waters of the Mullaperiyar; the other is Tamil Nadu's refusal to see that it cannot rely on or continue to expect more and more from the resources of another State to satisfy its own requirements to the detriment of the other State. A solution perhaps lies in acknowledging the two truths, but neither government can afford the political repercussions of such a confession\\". In May 2014, Supreme Court of India declared Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 as unconstitutional.  Justice A.S. Anand Committee (The Empowered Committee)  alt=Oommen Chandy, the Former Chief Minister of Kerala (2004-06 & 2011-16) On 18 February 2010, the Supreme Court decided to constitute a five-member empowered committee to study all the issues of Mullaperiyar Dam and seek a report from it within six months. The Bench in its draft order said Tamil Nadu and Kerala would have the option to nominate a member each, who could be either a retired judge or a technical expert. The five-member committee will be headed by former Chief Justice of India A. S. Anand to go into all issues relating to the dam's safety and the storage level. However, the then ruling party of Tamil Nadu, DMK, passed a resolution that it not only oppose the apex court's decision to form the five-member committee, but also said that the state government will not nominate any member to it. The then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that immediately after the Supreme Court announced its decision to set up a committee, he had written to Congress president asking the Centre to mediate between Kerala and Tamil Nadu on Mullaperiyar issue. However, the then Leader of Opposition i.e., the Ex Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa objected to the TN Government move. She said that this would give advantage to Kerala in the issue. Meanwhile, Kerala Water Resources Minister N. K. Premachandran told the state Assembly that the State should have the right of construction, ownership, operation and maintenance of the new dam, while giving water to Tamil Nadu on the basis of a clear cut agreement. He also informed the media that Former Supreme Court Judge Mr. K. T. Thomas will represent Kerala on the expert panel constituted by Supreme Court. On 8 March 2010, Tamil Nadu told the Supreme Court that it was not interested in adjudicating the dispute with Kerala before the special \\"empowered\\" committee appointed by the apex court for settling the inter-State issue. However, Supreme Court refused to accept Tamil Nadu's request to scrap the decision to form the empowered committee. The Supreme Court also criticized the Union Government on its reluctance in funding the empowered committee. Implementing directions of the Supreme Court, the Central Government extended the terms of Empowered Committee for a further period of six months, namely till 30 April 2012.  Construction of a new dam  Mullaperiyar reservoir Kerala enacted the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 to ensure safety of all 'endangered' dams in the State, listed in the second schedule to the Act. Section 62A of the Act provides for listing in the schedule, \\"details of the dams which are endangered on account of their age, degeneration, degradation, structural or other impediments as are specified\\".Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006\\"Kerala Justifies Enactment of the Act\\", the Hindu, Sept 19, 2006 The second schedule to the Act lists Mullaperiyar (dam) constructed in 1895 and fixes 136 feet as its maximum water level. The Act empowers Kerala Dam Safety Authority (Authority specified in the Act) to oversee safety of dams in the State and sec 62(e) empowers the Authority to direct the custodian (of a dam) \\"to suspend the functioning of any dam, to decommission any dam or restrict the functioning of any dam if public safety or threat to human life or property, so require\\". The Authority can conduct periodical inspection of any dam listed in the schedules. In pursuance of Kerala's dam safety law declaring Mullaperiyar dam as an endangered dam, in September 2009, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of Government of India granted environmental clearance to Kerala for conducting survey for new dam downstream. \\"The New Indian Express\\", 17 September 2009 Tamil Nadu approached Supreme Court for a stay order against the clearance; however, the plea was rejected. Consequently, the survey was started in October, 2009. Later strengthening the dam's previously fractured areas was inspected and have given a temporary extend to the life of the dam. Kerala Govt. has communicated with the Central Govt. and Tamil Nadu for extension of the project and for preparing and acquiring modern and scientific plans with all possible factors tabulated.

His father was a goldsmith and a master of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp. Gillemans was also destined to become a goldsmith and was sent to a family member in Liège to be trained in this craft. While this training included drawing, the young Gillemans wished to become a painter and returned to Antwerp after a stay of 7 to 8 years in Liège. Still life with vegetables and fruits It is not known with whom he trained to become a painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1113-1115 He became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as the son of a member in the guild year 1647/1648.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 186, on Google books In August 1648 Gillemans married Paulina Uyt den Eeckhout. The couple had four sons and four daughters. The needs of his large family forced the artist to open a gold shop. The deacon of the goldsmiths first refused to have him admitted as a goldsmith of the Guild but thanks to the intervention of Antwerp's city magistrate and the submission of his admission piece he was finally accepted in 1662. Gillemans did not abandon painting but continued to paint while running his gold shop. From the records of the Antwerp art dealer Forchondt for the years 1665 to 1673 it is known that Gillemans regularly provided the art dealer with fruit still lifes and garlands with herrings or lobsters for the export. Gillemans died in Antwerp on 12 August 1675. He was the teacher of his son Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Younger and Jan Frans van Son, who was the son of the prominent still life painter Joris van Son. Work Pronk still life with fruit, a lobster and a lute The known work of Gillemans is limited.Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder, Still life with fruit, a parrot and polecat ferrets at the Victoria and Albert Museum Gillemans was a specialist still life painter who is known for his heavy garlands with fruits and flowers set on a neutral background. He also painted pronkstillevens (i.e. sumptuous still lifes of luxurious objects), vanitas still lifes and garland paintings. His work shows that he was in contact with the circle of Jan Davidszoon de Heem, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s. Typical characteristics of his work are the studied compositions, beautifully harmonious colours, accurate depictions of various types of fabric and detailed displays of flowers and vegetables in all their diversity.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (I), Still Life with Vegetables and Fruits at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent Some of his works are pronkstillevens, the sumptuous still lifes that were popular in Flanders and the Dutch Republic from the 1640s. A representative example in this genre is the Pronk still-life with fruit and a lobster, a lute on a chair, a landscape seen through a colonnade beyond (At Christie's London on 3-4 July 2012, lot 152), which represents a table laden with fruit, a ham, a lobster, a lute on a chair all placed in front of a landscape visible beyond a colonnade. Pronk still lifes are often interpreted as having a vanitas meaning.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (I), Pronk still life with a view of a landscape to the left, 1645-1650 at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Garland of flowers surrounding a cartouche containing an angel's head and the Holy Sacrament His fruit still lifes of fruit and flowers were typically of a large format. A few were created on a smaller scale and were popular among contemporary collectors as cabinet pieces. An example is the Still life with lemons, grapes, a pipe and filleted fish (At Dorotheum Vienna on 9 April 2014, lot 566). This signed work shows that in the small format Gillemans preferred narrow views that put the focus on meticulously described objects.Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder, Still life with lemons, grapes, a pipe and filleted fish at the Dorotheum A number of his still lifes fall into the category of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, and in particular Daniel Seghers. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. The figure painter would take care of the figures inside the cartouche while the still life painter was responsible for the flower or fruit garland.Ursula Härting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image The names of the collaborators of Gillemans on his garland paintings are not generally known but a collaboration with Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert is presumed. Jan Pauwel Gillemans (I) and Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Vruchtenstilleven met bloemenkrans, beker en twee putto's at the Netherlands Institute for Art History An example of Gillemans' work in this genre is the Garland of Flowers Surrounding a Cartouche Containing an Angel's Head and the Holy Sacrament (Victoria and Albert Museum). The garland includes thistles, grains, grapes and other flowers and fruit that allude to the Passion of Christ and to the Sacramental bread and wine of the communion which is depicted in the centre of the composition.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (I) (Attr.), A Garland of Flowers Surrounding a Cartouche Containing an Angel's Head and the Holy Sacrament at the Victoria and Albert Museum Vanitas still life Gillemans also painted vanitas still lifes, a genre of still lifes which offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. An example is the composition Vanitas still life (Hermitage Museum).Jan Pauwel Gillemans, Vanitas still life at the Hermitage Museum This composition contains the typical symbolism of vanitas paintings: a crowned skull, a wilting flower, an hourglass, an empty glass and cup, and a book and money bags (symbolising the futility of mankind's higher and worldly aspirations).

Operations will be joint with the CBERS-4 satellite. Background In the early 1990s, the design of SSR satellites, Amazônia-1 precursor, was revised and INPE technicians proposed replacing the polar orbit by an equatorial orbit, and this proposal was accepted. That made sense at that time as Brazil already had coverage by polar orbit with the CBERS satellites. The SSR-1 of the project suffered several delays start, either by lack of resources, whether by barriers in the disputes of the bids. The effective start, only occurred in 2001 when a contract was signed for the development of multi-mission platform specifically (at the time) for this purpose. Amazonia 1 assembled In 2001, a joint study between the INPE and DLR was published, found that most of the SSR-1 requirements can be met by two sensors: the Camera VIS / NIR and other MIR Rudorff, Bernardo (10/04/2003).

Update Between September and October 2012, a structural model of the Amazônia-1 satellite was subjected to a series of vibration test. In the latest review of the PNAE, published in January 2013, the Amazônia-1 resurfaced with this name, and even successors planned (Amazon-1B in 2017 and Amazon-2 in 2018), however, remains the intention of use in orbit polar and the release dates of these satellites can not be maintained.

He worked in a range of still life genres including flower and fruit still lifes, banquet still lifes, pronkstillevens and hunting pieces. He collaborated with figure painters to create landscapes which combined a mythological or allegorical scene with a still life. He worked and lived in Antwerp, Middelburg, London and Amsterdam.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (II) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Younger was born in Antwerp as the son of Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder and Paulina Uyt den Eeckhout. His father was a prominent still life painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1113-1116 He studied with his father and from the guild year 1665-1666 he was formally enrolled at the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp as a pupil of the leading Antwerp still life painter Joris van Son who was also a good friend of his father.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph.

Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 429, on Google books In the same year a Peter Mathys Gillemans also became a master of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp as the son of a member. It is believed that this Peter Mathys who became a successful flower painter was Jan Pauwel's brother.Peter Mathys Gillemans at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Gillemans worked in Middelburg in the Dutch Republic in 1675. That year he was fined for working as an artist without being registered at the local guild of Middelburg. He is believed to have worked in London in 1678 as can be deduced from the inscription 'Londini' on his Still life with fruit by a fountain in a landscape dated 1673 or 1678 (With art dealer Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder, The Hague in 2004, artwork no. 59038). Gillemans was back in Antwerp from 1680. He married late in life on 3 March 1693. His wife was Isabella Maria van den Eynde, daughter of the local sculptor Norbert van den Eynde. One son was born from the union in 1695. His wife died on 6 October 1697. Not long thereafter, on 22 March 1698 he remarried with the wealthy widow Joanna van Hellefort with whom he had two more sons. Still life with a basket of fruit and a parakeet upon a ledge draped with a damask In 1696 Gillemans was elected dean of the Guild but he bought off his duties by a payment to the Guild.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 364, on Google books In 1702 the artist is recorded back in Middelburg where he became a member of the local Guild of Saint Luke. He is subsequently recorded in Amsterdam where he died in 1704. Whether or not he died by drowning in the canals of Amsterdam after drinking too much as stated by the early biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman in The Lives of Dutch painters and paintresses (third volume, 1729 – 1739) is unclear. Weyerman's anecdotes are often fictitious.Jan Pauwel Gillemans II (attributed to, Putti decorating a classical garden ornament with a rich festoon of fruit at Jean Moust Work Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Younger was a still life painter mainly of fruit and flower still lifes. His early works were banquet style still lifes. His later, large compositions with fruit still lifes in outdoor settings often included scenes of animals, putti or mythological figures and were created in collaboration with figure painters. He may also have painted garland paintings.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (II), One of a pair of paintings: A stone niche decorated with fruit and flowers with insects surrounding the representation of the Virgin and Child at Jean Moust Still life with grapes, monkey and parrot His early works are close to that of his father and typically depict still lifes of various objects placed on a tabletop or ledge against a neutral background. This type of painting was particularly popular among Antwerp still life painters who had come under the influence of Jan Davidszoon de Heem, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s. Jan Pauwel's father and Joris van Son who were his teachers both produced similar works. Generally speaking, the works of Jan Pauwel the Younger were more decorative in character than those of his father, who had a more limited colour palette. His work developed away from the style of his father towards a more decorative style, a trend common in Flemish still life painting in the final decades of the 17th century.Sam Segal, A Flowery Past: A Survey of Dutch and Flemish Flower Painting from 1600 Until the Present: Gallery P. de Boer, Amsterdam, March 13-April 11, 1982, Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch, April 29-May 30, 1982, Gallery P. de Boer, 198, p. 59-60 Under the influence of the French Classical movement the dramatic realism of the early Baroque was replaced by an idealised, decorative vision of nature and reality. These compositions sought to evoke an Arcadian vision of an unspoiled and harmonious nature, uncorrupted by civilization. Typical for his work is the gold-colored lighting of the colors as well as the detailed reproduction of the different fruit varieties.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (II), Fruit still life with antique stone vase at Hampel Auktionen Still life of fruit and vegetables in a park landscape, with a macaw and two guinea pigs Jan Pauwel regularly placed his large fruit still lifes in a landscape or architectural setting with columns and fountains. For some of these paintings he worked together with specialists such as Pieter Rijsbraeck who was a landscape painter and Peter Ykens who was a figure painter. The identity of the collaborators on his paintings is often unknown. Gillemans was capable of painting the background landscapes for his still lifes himself. When he did, he would paint the trees, foliage and sky with more accuracy than Rijsbraeck.Jan Pauwel Gillemans (II), Still Life with Fruit by a Fountain in a Landscape at Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder It is not clear whether like his father, Gillemans the Younger also created 'garland paintings', the type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. The figure painter would take care of the figures inside the cartouche while the still life painter was responsible for the flower or fruit garland.Ursula Härting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image A pair of two garland paintings on copper have been attributed to Gillemans the Younger: the Stone niche decorated with fruit and flowers with insects surrounding the Virgin and Child and the Stone niche decorated with fruit and flowers with insects surrounding the Holy Family (At Mercier & Cie, Lille (France) on 26 June 2016, lot 210). While these paintings are quite similar to his father's works in this genre, they have been attributed to the son Jan Pauwel the Younger because they display the more typical traits of his work in their colourful and decorative aspects.

Opened in 1894, the station forms part of the Pisa–Livorno–Rome railway and the Rome–Capranica–Viterbo railway. It is also the junction for the short, single track Rome–Vatican City railway, which crosses into Vatican City after passing over a viaduct. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Roma San Pietro railway station is situated at Piazza della Stazione di San Pietro, west of the city centre, and a short distance to the south of Vatican City; the station owes its name to its proximity to St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican (just away). History Opened along the line to Viterbo on 29 April 1894, the station, before structural changes to its \\"country station\\" features, was one of the favourite locations of the world of cinema. Many of the greatest actors and directors shot a scene in the station or in the forecourt, including Totò, Sordi, Virna Lisi, Buzzanca and many others extending back to the black and white era of film. At that time, the station consisted of two through tracks passing a small passenger building. Although the station was then situated on a secondary line, the passenger traffic, consisting largely of pilgrims, was notable. With the construction in 1990 of the new Maccarese–Roma section of the Pisa–Livorno–Rome railway (Maccarese- Fregene – Roma Aurelia – Roma San Pietro – Roma Trastevere), the station underwent significant changes: the number of through tracks was increased to 6, the line was electrified and a pedestrian underpass was built. To coincide with the Great Jubilee of 2000, and the simultaneous re-opening of the line to Viterbo, the platforms were erected and two lifts installed. Between 2000 and 2006, prior to the opening of the tunnel to Roma Ostiense, Roma San Pietro was the terminus of half the trains from Cesano and Viterbo. Features The station has a passenger building, which houses the waiting area, ticketing booths, ticket machines, a bar, a kiosk and toilets. Five through tracks pass through the station yard. Passenger and train movements View of the station yard, 2012. All regional trains bound for Bracciano, Cesano di Roma, Civitavecchia, Grosseto, Pisa Centrale, Roma Termini and Viterbo Porta Fiorentina stop at the station. The typical offering in off-peak hours on working days is a train every 15 minutes for Roma Ostiense and Cesano, a train every 30 minutes to Bracciano, Civitavecchia and Roma Termini, a train every hour to Grosseto and Viterbo Porta Fiorentina and a train every two hours to Pisa Centrale.

It is located on a huge plain near the Lufira River. Before the Belgian colonial conquest, Bunkeya was the center of a major trading state under the despotic ruler Msiri. Early history In the later 19th-century, Bunkeya was the capital of Msiri, the son of an East African trader. Msiri's father had been in the business of buying copper ore in Katanga and transporting it to the east coast of Africa for resale. As a young man Msiri remained behind in the region as his father's agent. He became leader of a group of Bayeke people, and established a state that extended from the Luapula River south to the Congo-Zambezi watershed, and from Lake Mweru in the east to the Lualaba River in the west. Based on Bunkeya, the state controlled a huge central-African trading network, mostly dealing in slaves but also in ivory, salt, copper and iron ore. Traders came to Bunkeya from the Zambezi and Congo basins, from Angola, Uganda and Zanzibar. The Arabs from the east coast bought guns and ammunition, which Msiri used to maintain his position. European contacts Msiri's boma (compound) at Bunkeya. The objects on top of the four poles, below which some of Msiri's warriors are gathered, are heads of his enemies. More skulls are on the stakes forming the stockade. The German scientist Paul Reichard was the first European to reach Bunkeya, arriving on 20 January 1884. He was followed by Capello and Ivens, two Portuguese explorers seeking a trade route to link Angola and Mozambique. In February 1886 the Scottish missionary Frederick Stanley Arnot arrived at Bunkeya unaccompanied and without food or trade goods. Msiri welcomed him and let him settle, but discouraged him from teaching his religion. Later, several other missionaries joined Arnot. In 1887, William Henry Faulknor, a young Canadian from Hamilton, Ontario who had joined the Plymouth Brethren evangelical movement, arrived at Bunkeya. Another member of the Brethren, Dan Crawford, arrived in 1890 and was to be a witness to Msiri's assassination. Msiri employed Faulknor and other missionaries as \\"errand boys\\", symbols of his influence, while Faulknor taught and converted a small group of redeemed slaves. Although the territory had been ceded to Belgium under the Berlin Conference (1884), Cecil Rhodes began taking an interest and sent agents to Katanga. In 1890 Rhodes sent Alfred Sharpe to Bunkeya to try to obtain a treaty with Msiri. One of the missionaries, acting as an interpreter and witness, read the complete text. Msiri was furious when he heard what he was being asked to agree to, and Sharpe was forced to make a hasty departure to save his life. Unaware of this, and responding to the British challenge, King Leopold II of Belgium dispatched three expeditions to Bunkeya. The first, 300 people under Paul Le Marinel coming from Lusambo, crossed the Lualaba in March 1891, where they met a representative of Msiri. Continuing south, on 18 April 1891 they reached Bunkeya and were received courteously by Msiri. Le Marinel spent seven weeks at Bunkeya, but was unable to persuade Msiri to formally accept Belgian authority. He left a small garrison nearby to observe developments and returned to Lusambo, arriving on 18 August 1891. Another expedition under Alexandre Delcommune reached Bunkeya later that year, but had no more success. Conquest and later years Arkaris and porters of the 1891-2 Stairs Expedition The third expedition, the Stairs Expedition to Katanga, was decisive. At the age of 25 the Canadian-born engineer, soldier and mercenary William Grant Stairs had been second in command of Henry Morton Stanley's 1887 expedition to relieve Emin Pasha in Equatoria. In 1891 he was commissioned to lead an expedition of 336 porters and askaris from Zanzibar to Bunkeya to obtain Msiri's submission. Stairs demanded that Msiri accept the sovereignty of Leopold II over his territory. Msiri again refused and fled to a nearby village where he was killed by Omer Bodson, a member of Stairs' force. Resistance ceased and Katanga came under Belgian rule. The death of Msiri ended a rule that had become tyrannical, but also destroyed political stability. Trading caravans no longer came to Bunkeya, the local people suffered from famine and disease, and many left the town. The Belgians recognized one of Msiri's sons, Mukanda Bantu, as his successor. Stairs had accepted Mukanda Bantu as Msiri's chosen heir, but restricted him to the territory immediately surrounding Bunkeya and removed all real power. Over the next few years the Belgians established their authority in the region and began exploiting its huge mineral resources. The Belgians forced Mukanda Bantu and his followers to move to Lukafu, where they stayed for eighteen years before being allowed to return. The situation gradually improved, with piped potable water being available under the leadership of Musamfya Ntanga (1940–1956). After 1976, the population grew fast. Agriculture is productive, yielding crops of maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, legumes and peanuts. However, the water supply is insufficient and health care is inadequate, with few people able to afford drugs. The village does have a hospital and a tuberculosis clinic.

The iconic artworks depict a shepherd tending sheep with the evening sun shining through snowy trees. The primary, and largest (117 x 171 cm), version of the composition The Shortening Winter's Day is Near a Close (Accession Number LL3152), is at the Lady Lever Art Gallery, in Port Sunlight, England. The 82 x 120 cm version of The Shortening Winter's Day is Near a Close was last sold to a private collector in 2013. The 51 x 76 cm version was last sold to a private collector in 2016 under the name Beneath the Snow Encumbered Branches. The image has become well known through the use of its likeness on popular Hallmark Christmas cards for over 30 years. Background Painter and Laird Farquharson owned a estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, where he enjoyed painting wintery scenes, particularly of sheep. This in turn had led to his nickname of \\"Frozen Mutton Farquharson\\". Farquharson's considerable commercial success was based on the snow scenes he exhibited almost annually at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1894 until 1925, and celebrated printsellers Frost & Reed assured him a steady income by selling deluxe editions of his works. This subject is one of his most celebrated, and the primary version (now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery) was shown at the RA in 1903. Farquharson was known to create several versions of his best works, either to sell as replicas or to retain as aides memoires. Often artists painted replicas for engravers to work from when the original painting was not available and it is possible that one of these replicas served such a purpose; a highly popular print of The Shortening Winter's Day is near a Close sold in the many thousands by Farquharson's publisher Frost & Reed. History The primary version of The Shortening Winter's Day is near a Close (Lady Lever Art Gallery) was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1903. It is not known when the 82 x 120 cm replica was painted but it is probable that it was soon after the exhibition of 1903 and likely to have been painted to satisfy a patron that had been disappointed not to be able to purchase the exhibited painting that Lever had secured when it was on the walls of the Academy. The 82 x 120 cm version under the name The Shortening Winter's Day is near a Close was auctioned in 2008 by Sotheby's and again by Bonhams in 2013. In 2013 it fetched £157,250 (US$200,599) The 51 x 76 cm version was with the Richard Green Gallery in 1972 and reproduced in Country Life on 1 June that year. The Card company WN Sharpe purchased the rights to use the painting in greetings cards in the 1970s. The company later was acquired by the Hallmark Cards company, which continues to own these rights. Over the course of its use as a design on Christmas cards, it is thought to have been reproduced hundreds of thousands of times. The 51 x 76 cm version had been sold in the 1960s to a private Scottish collector for £1,450. When this version went to auction in 2008 it was listed with the title Beneath the Snow Encumbered Branches by Lyon & Turnbull auctioneers with the note \\"A painting of this title was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1901\\". There was some public interest in the piece at this time with the \\"Christmas card painting\\" resurfacing. Sold at Lyon & Turnbull auctioneers in Edinburgh, it was estimated that it would sell for between £50,000 to £70,000, but sold for more than twice that estimate to another private collector in Scotland. The painting was auctioned again by Lyon & Turnbull on 9 June 2016 for £146,500 (US$186,800). In December 2009, Gyles Brandreth presented a piece on the history of the painting for BBC One's The One Show. Aesthetics The painting, like Farquharson's other landscapes, was painted on his estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside. One of his descendants, Sir Angus Farquharson of Finzean, later said that he thought he had found the exact spot at Finzean where the painting was created. The shepherd in the painting was actually an employee of Farquharson whom he had asked to pose for the image. Whilst he was painting he noticed that the model was beginning to turn blue and so offered the man the chance to come inside his painting hut to warm up; the man declined so that Farquharson could finish the painting more quickly.

It was the 21st January 4 Tokyo Dome Show and the sixth held under the \\"Wrestle Kingdom\\" name. This was the final Wrestle Kingdom where a Roman numeral was used as part of the event's name. The event featured twelve matches (including one dark match), three of which were contested for championships. Wrestle Kingdom is traditionally NJPW's biggest event of the year and has been described as their equivalent to WWE's WrestleMania. Outside participants from the All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and Pro Wrestling Noah promotions also took part in the show. Following the conclusion of a working relationship between NJPW and the American Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the show, for the first time in five years, did not feature wrestlers from TNA. Production Background The show is notable for featuring the NJPW return of Kazuchika Okada and the debut of his \\"Rainmaker\\" persona Wrestle Kingdom VI featured the NJPW return of Kazuchika Okada. Okada was a rookie in 2010, when NJPW, through their international connections, sent him to the American Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion to gain experience and grow as a wrestler. During his one and a half years in TNA, Okada did little of note; he was dressed up like Kato from The Green Hornet, dubbed \\"Okato\\" and made Samoa Joe's sidekick in an angle with D'Angelo Dinero, wrestling only a handful of actual matches. TNA's poor handling of Okada was one of the key factors in NJPW ceasing their relationship with the American promotion, which made Wrestle Kingdom VI the first Tokyo Dome show in five years to not feature any wrestlers from the company. On December 9, 2011, NJPW announced that Okada would return to the promotion at Wrestle Kingdom VI, facing Yoshi-Hashi, who was making his own return from the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotion, with whom NJPW also had a working relationship, where, unlike Okada, he had been wrestling a full schedule and improving. Upon his return to NJPW, Okada created himself a new villainous persona named \\"Rainmaker\\". Storylines Wrestle Kingdom VI featured twelve professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event Hiroshi Tanahashi, who defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the show The main event of the show saw Hiroshi Tanahashi defeat Minoru Suzuki to make his 11th successful defense of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, setting a new record for most title defenses in the process. The semi-main event saw All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) representative Keiji Mutoh defeat Tetsuya Naito in a battle between two wrestlers dubbed \\"geniuses\\". The show also featured two matches, where NJPW wrestlers took on Pro Wrestling Noah wrestlers. In the first, NJPW's Hirooki Goto defeated Noah's Takashi Sugiura, while in the second Noah's Go Shiozaki and Naomichi Marufuji defeated NJPW's Shinsuke Nakamura and Toru Yano. There were also two other title matches at the show, which saw Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) defeat Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) to become the new IWGP Tag Team Champions and Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi) defeat No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero) to become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. In their NJPW return match, Kazuchika Okada defeated Yoshi-Hashi in quick fashion. Following the main event of the show, Okada confronted Tanahashi and challenged him to a match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The event also featured a match that saw NJPW's Wataru Inoue and Yuji Nagata take on AJPW's mixed martial arts duo of Masakatsu Funaki and Masayuki Kono in what marked Funaki's first NJPW match in 20 years. Intended as a starting point in a rivalry between Nagata and Funaki, the match ended in a \\"disaster\\", when Nagata crushed Funaki's face with a knee strike, legitimately breaking his nose and left orbital bone. The injury required surgery and sidelined Funaki for six months. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter was positive in his review of the show, offering particular praise to Hiroshi Tanahashi, whom he credited with bringing a new audience to NJPW, comparing him to Bret Hart and John Cena as someone who has the \\"aura of a top guy\\". Meltzer wrote that \\"[w]hile most sports are declining in popularity in Japan, New Japan Pro Wrestling has started making small steps in growing over the past three years\\". Meltzer highlighted Kazuchika Okada as part of the show that did not work, writing that he did not look impressive and was \\"completely unconvincing\\" in his new role as a \\"cocky playboy\\". Aftermath A month after Wrestle Kingdom VI, Kazuchika Okada defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi at The New Beginning to become the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion in what NJPW called the \\"upset of the century\\". The general reaction in Japan to the title change was negative. Dave Meltzer was also negative on the title change, writing that Okada looked \\"green\\" and was hard to take seriously as either a main eventer or a title threat. By the time Okada lost the title the following June, Meltzer wrote that he had silenced his critics, writing that his reign \\"[had] to be considered, in hindsight, a success far beyond what anyone could have reasonably hoped for\\". During the following years, Okada established himself as one of the biggest stars in Japanese professional wrestling, becoming a multi-time winner of both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and NJPW's premier tournament, the G1 Climax.

Sensory maps are the representations of sense organs as organized maps in the brain, and it is the fundamental organization of processing. Sensory maps are not always close to an exact topographic projection of the senses. The fact that the brain is organized into sensory maps has wide implications for processing, such as that lateral inhibition and coding for space are byproducts of mapping. The developmental process of an organism guides sensory map formation; the details are yet unknown. The development of sensory maps requires learning, long term potentiation, experience-dependent plasticity, and innate characteristics.Blum, Kenneth I., and L. F. Abbott. \\"A Model of Spatial Map Formation in the Hippocampus of the Rat.\\" Neural Computation 8.1 (1996): 85-93. Print. There is significant evidence for experience-dependent development and maintenance of sensory maps, and there is growing evidence on the molecular basis, synaptic basis and computational basis of experience- dependent development. Sensory maps List of known sensory maps: *Somatotopic maps: homunculus, rat barrel cortex, star-nose mole nose *Retino- topic maps: visual field position, orientation, direction, spatial frequency *Tonotopic maps: interaural time difference, frequency tonotopic maps of the cochlea Computational maps The computational map is the “key building block in the infrastructure of information processing by the nervous system.” Jeffress, L. A. \\"A place theory of sound localization.\\" J. Comp.Physiol. Psychol. 41(1948): pp. 35-39. Print. Computation defined as the transformation in the representation of information is the essence of brain function. Computational maps are involved in processing sensory information and motor programming, and they contain derived information that is accessible to higher-order processing regions. The first computational map to be proposed was the Jeffress model (1948) which stated that the computation of sound localization was dependent upon timing differences of sensory input.Jeffress, L. A. \\"A place theory of sound localization.\\" J. Comp.Physiol. Psychol. 41(1948): pp. 35-39. Print.Joris, P. \\"Coincidence Detection in the Auditory System: 50 Years after Jeffress.\\" Neuron 21.6 (1998): 1235-238. Print. Since the introduction of the Jeffress model, more general guiding principles for relating brain maps to the properties of the computations they perform have been proposed. One of the proposed models is that computations are distributed across parallel processors like computers; with this model, computer processing is a model for computations performed by the brain.Nelson, M., and J. Bower. \\"Brain Maps and Parallel Computers.\\" Trends in Neurosciences 13.10(1990): 403-08. Print. More recently, the “elastic net” model has been proposed after studying how the primary visual cortex overlaps multiple visual maps, such as visual field position, orientation, direction, ocular dominance, and spatial frequency.Knudsen, E. I., S. Lac, and S. D. Esterly. \\"Computational Maps in the Brain.\\" Annual Review of Neuroscience 10.1 (1987): 41-65. Print. The elastic net uses parallel algorithms to analyze the visual field and allows for optimized trade-off between coverage and continuity.Carreira-Perpinan, M. A. \\"A Computational Model for the Development of Multiple Maps in Primary Visual Cortex.\\" Cerebral Cortex 15.8 (2004): 1222-233. Print. Role of plasticity in map development Maps are highly plastic and can be greatly altered depending on sensory experience. Long term potentiation is the primary mechanism by which plasticity occurs. Sequential firing induces a pattern of LTP that shifts the coded location, and behaviorally generated modifications of synaptic strengths subsequently affect behavior. Experience is crucial in maintaining maps. Experiments with the rat barrel cortex have shown that changes in the pattern of sensory activity can alter configuration of cortical receptive fields; if a particular whisker gets directed stimulus, the cortex will reflect the directed stimulus.Diamond, M. E. \\"Experience-Dependent Plasticity in Adult Rat Barrel Cortex.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 90.5 (1993): 2082-086. Print. Disruptions in sensory maps reflect actual discontinuities in the receptor sheet, and evoked and spontaneous neural activity instruct variable features of sensory maps.Kaas, Jon H., and Kenneth C. Catania. \\"How Do Features of Sensory Representations Develop?\\" BioEssays 24.4 (2002): 334-43. Print. Theory of map formation Sensory maps are formed largely by experience. Basic wiring of the brain is established in vivo by a variety of molecular guidance cues, and the wiring is then refined by patterns of neural activity based in sensory experience.Diamond, M. E. \\"Experience-Dependent Plasticity in Adult Rat Barrel Cortex.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 90.5 (1993): 2082-086. Print.King, Andrew J. \\"Sensory Experience and the Formation of a Computational Map of Auditory Space in the Brain.\\" BioEssays 21 (1999): 900-11. Print. For synchronization of multiple maps, replay of sensory input in circuits allows neurons to be organized into vertical topographic functional units before horizontal integration. Neurons become specialized: in the big brown bat, delay-tuned neurons encode a target range and act as probability encoders, and this comes from experience.Dear, S.P., and N. Suga. \\"Delay-tuned Neurons in the Midbrain of the Big Brown Bat.\\"Journal of Neurophysiology 73.3 (1995): 1084-100. Print. In the owl, auditory units responded to specific locations in space, and units were arranged systematically according to the relative locations of their receptive fields, thereby creating a physiological map of auditory space.Knudsen, E., and M. Konishi. \\"A Neural Map of Auditory Space in the Owl.\\" Science 200.4343 (1978): 795-97. Print. The receptive fields of the neurons found in the midbrain auditory nucleus had receptive fields independent of nature and intensity of the sound. Molecular basis Roger Sperry proposed a chemical gradient model for eye rotation and for neuronal wiring diagram. Retinal neurons and target cells had identification tags in the form of chemical gradients so that the projection of neurons would be orderly. For a topographic map of the visual world, the map first forms during neural development via molecular signals, such as chemospecific matching between molecular gradients.Goodhill, Geoffrey, and Jun Xu. \\"The Development of Retinotectal Maps: A Review of Models Based on Molecular Gradients.\\" Network: Computation in Neural Systems16.1 (2005): 5-34.

The most recent work has shown that gamma oscillations of neurons synchronize the development of the thalamus and cortex in young rats.Minlebaev, Marat, Matthew Colonnese, Timur Tsintsadze, Anton Sirota, and Roustem Khazipov. \\"Early Gamma Oscillations Synchronize Developing Thalamus and Cortex.\\" Science 334.6053 References Category:Neuroethology Category:Developmental neuroscience ","title":"Sensory maps and brain development"},{"id":"34004381","text":"Viola renifolia is a species of violet known by the common names white violet and kidneyleaf violet.

The film is part of the After Dark Action films. Plot The film begins with a man going into a church. He enters the confessional booth where he tells the priest he would like to make a donation to the church, but before the father can accept, the man shoots himself in the head. The film then turns to Amy Nash (Evigan) and her husband, David (Faris). It is Amy's birthday, and David buys her a house. Amy, who seems to hate the house, quickly turns to an upset David and tells him she loves it. A happy David shows his wife the security cameras, that watch over 360 degrees of their premises. Amy's friend, Trish (Alyshia Ochse) stops by and congratulates them for being homeowners. She then gives Amy a gift, and quickly leaves for a date with her boyfriend. After Trish leaves, an officer stops by, and identifies himself as Ray (Huertas) and welcomes the couple to the neighborhood before leaving. Amy and David are about to celebrate, when they hear a noise coming from a stove that is somehow in their room. They dismiss the noise as being rats, and continue their celebration. Amy goes to the restroom to freshen up after hurting herself on the wall. David checks the wall, and finds it to be loose. David takes off the walls and finds heroin stashed in the walls. Amy enters the room, and David quickly lets her know about the situation, and they decide to leave. As they are about to take off, they run into Ray, and tell him about the house. Ray laughs, and reveals to them, that he bet $20 with his buddy that they wouldn't find the stash, before pointing a gun at them. David quickly hits his car, which makes their bikes fall on Ray. The couple quickly takes refugee on the house, as Ray begins to terrorize them. He enters through the back door, and shoots David. As he is about to shoot Amy, she falls on a switch that puts the house on lockdown. Amy then quickly goes to David's aid. Meanwhile, outside, Ray's buddy, Andy Spector (Lundgren) gets to the house, and argues with Ray, for now they must keep the couple alive. As the couple watches the men, David decides to put the stash in trash bags, and give it to them. Amy agrees, and they give it to the men, who throw it on the trash, stating they \\"do not want that poison\\". David then comforts a hysterical Amy. David then shows her that the whole house is designed for drug dealers. The house has bulletproof windows, and is made of metal under the walls. The criminals begin to circle the house, and set up a booby trap. Amy decides to make a run for it, while David distracts the criminals in the front, but David makes a run for it, not wanting Amy to get hurt. Amy looks through the cameras, but before David can make it to the fence, he trips over a rope Spector put. Ray hears David fall in the pool and goes after him. Amy quickly gets in Ray's way, and begins to shoot at her. Ray then immediately puts his attention on David, who has now exited the pool. Amy goes back in the house, and finds Spector inside, who attacks her. Amy grabs a spray for animals, and sprays it on Spector's face, before hitting him with it, and quickly puts the house on lockdown. Spector threatens to kills David if Amy doesn't open the door. Ray shoots David in the hand, and finds David to be in the outhouse. He shoots through the door, thinking its David, but finds out he only shot a raccoon. David, who was in the other side of the house, runs off. Amy, who thinks David was shot, begins to mourn her husband, as she thinks it's her fault David was killed. David attracts Ray into a line of gas, before setting fire to Ray's leg. David then goes to Amy, who lets him in, and covers him in hugs and kisses. Later that night, the couple begins to hear something in the roof, and find Ray has climbed to the roof, and is trying to break into the chimney. David tries to close the chimney, but before he can, Ray drops a grenade that gets stuck on the door. The couple runs for cover, but the grenade still affects the couple's ears. Amy, who has become affected by the loud blow, sits and mumbles random things, while David finds and shoots a flare gun at Ray, who gets burned on his neck, and falls from the roof. An angry Ray then begins to shoot at them, and threatens to kill them, before leaving. The couple then sits down, and Amy confesses to David that they never should have left Ohio. David begins to look around the house to find possibilities of what the criminals might want. Amy finds a switch, and it opens to a hidden room. They begin to hear noise, and go to the stove in their room, where they find a hidden basement, and find a man, who is unconscious. Meanwhile, Spector and Ray find a tunnel that heads into the house. Spector decides to distract the couple, while Ray goes through the tunnel. Spector begins to try to trick the couple into letting him in. He reveals to Amy that David knew the last owner was known as a drug lord who committed suicide in a church (revealed to be the man from the beginning of the movie). The couple then hears Ray climbing through the floor, and they hold him down. Amy also gets Trish's birthday present, and stabs Ray's hand with it. An angry Ray begins to shoot through the floor, which causes the couple to hide in the hidden room. Ray lets Spector in, and they begin to saw through the floor, looking for the man. Dave looks through a peephole, and finds the shotgun all alone, and decides to go for it. As he approaches the shotgun slowly, the man wakes up, and begins to freak out, but Amy calms him down before Spector and Ray hear them. David reaches the shotgun; at the same time that Ray and Spector find the man is gone. A police officer then knocks on the door, and asks Ray, who says he lives in the house, if he knows anything about the flare gun. As Ray is about to answer, David points the shotgun at Spector, and makes the officer think David is an intruder, as the two argue, Ray kills the officer, and then attacks David. Ray is about to kill David, but instead, Spector kills Ray. A few seconds after, Trish enters the house, telling David she and her boyfriend broke up. She quickly realizes what's going on, but is killed before she can react. Spector then forces David to open the hidden room, but finds it empty. Amy then shoots Spector with the shotgun, and they close the door, leaving Spector inside. While Amy calls the police, David finds the front door with a bomb, which he doesn't know how to disarm, and then finds the switch, that can unlock the house, has been broken. They remember the tunnel, and try to open it, for Spector jammed the lock. Meanwhile, Spector, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, blows up the wall, and goes after the trio. The old man tries to run, but is shot in the process. The couple is unable to open the tunnel, and as Spector is about to kill them, they hear the police, and Spector makes a new plan. He tells David that he will pretend to be Amy's father, while David hides, for he is the criminal. He tells David that if David is caught before Spector can flee the country, he will kill Amy. David hides, and Spector pretends to be Amy's father. The police buy it, but suspect something, when Amy seems to be hiding something. The two then see paramedics taking the old man, who is still alive, causing Spector to get distracted a few times. Meanwhile, a police officer unjams the lock, and David knocks him out, and escapes through the tunnel, while a few officers pursue him, but he is able to lock them in, and goes after his wife. The chief of police asks to interview Amy alone, and right when she leaves Spector's side, she tells the chief to shoot Spector, but instead, he tries to calm her down, causing Spector to kill him. David then gets to the scene, and threatens to shoot Spector, causing the other police officers to come, and they shoot David, before he can shoot Spector. Spector then drags Amy to the side, and knocks her out, before turning his attention to the old man. Amy wakes up, and goes after Spector, and wounds him, before Spector can kill the old man. He hits Amy, and is about to kill her but the police get there, and kill Spector. Amy then goes to David's aid, and tells him that Spector's last words were that next time, she should pick the house. The film ends with them going in the ambulance.

The conflagration destroyed the Hotel Polen (Hotel Poland), a five-story hotel in the centre of the city which had been built in 1891, as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore. Many of the tourists staying at the hotel (of whom the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames. Upon their arrival, the fire department used a life net to help people escape, but not everyone could be saved. The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown. In 1986 the Polish-born artist Ania Bien created a photographic installation based on the fire which compared it to the Holocaust. The hotel was located between the Kalverstraat (no. 15–17) and the Rokin (no. 14), near the present day Madame Tussauds. Its place is now occupied by the Rokin Plaza, originally an office building, which today houses several fashion shops. Background In the beginning of the 16th century, there was an inn on the site where the Hotel Polen was later located. At the end of the 18th century, the Poolsche Koffiehuis (Polish Coffee House) was established, which began offering guest accommodation in 1857. Hotel Polen on the website of the Netherlands Architecture Institute (archive) In 1891, after the adjacent space on the Rokin was bought, the Hotel Polen was established by the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van het Poolsche Koffiehuis (Polish Coffee House Society), and a building was constructed there which was possibly designed by the architect Pierre Cuypers, who also designed the Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. *H. Berens (ed.), P.J.H. Cuypers (1827–1921). Het complete werk, Rotterdam, Nederlands Architectuurinstituut, 2007. Another source lists Eduard Cuypers as the architect. The hotel was five stories high and a café- restaurant was opened on the ground level. The Hotel Polen was once known as a fashionable place to stay. (behind paywall) The café-restaurant was closed at the end of 1974 and its location was subsequently rented to the furniture store Inden. The hotel remained open as a part of the Krasnapolsky Concern. The building, including the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 6 It had 94 rooms.Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. pp. 52–56 There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and directions to the emergency exits, Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 9 and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 10 The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, and later in the beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. A list of improvements which the hotel should implement included complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 11 Fire Firefighting on the Rokin side On the night of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, including a large group of Swedish tourists. At about 6:20 am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café- restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. He was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it; he then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 13 and to call the fire department. By 6:30 am the fire was spreading very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached some guests' rooms, they leapt out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street lay several dead and injured people who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to unfold a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg, an alley which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat, Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 50 but it was too narrow. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 21 At the front of the hotel, in the Rokin, rescue operations were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage into the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell to the side of the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00 am the part of the hotel facing the Kalverstraat collapsed. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 16 The burning debris landed on the fire engine there, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out, and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat; these were quickly brought under control. At about 8:30 am the wooden construction of the main part of the building also burned through and collapsed. Although there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The smoking debris was extinguished, and at 9:30 am the fire was declared under control. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 17 The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained. Thirty-three people were killed: 32 tourists (17 of them Swedes) and the occupant of the apartment above the book store. Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris. Thirteen people who had jumped from windows either died or were severely injured. Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 had severe injuries. Two guests from the United States escaped without injury. Possible cause The Rokin Plaza which now stands at the former location of Hotel Polen The cause of the fire could not be determined with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, and the opening of the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. Rapport Brand Hotel Polen Amsterdam. p. 44 There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, there was no evidence of a burglary. The high number of casualties was a consequence of the wooden construction of the building, the poorly marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment. Cultural impact Polish-born artist Ania Bien produced a photographic art installation in 1986 called Hotel Polen. She fabricated 18 replicas of the hotel's menu stands, and used them to display photographs alluding to the Holocaust. David Levi-Strauss wrote that Bien's art piece is a \\"polysemous work of absence, in which what happens between images is the most important\\" The work was displayed at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1987 and at the Amsterdams Historisch Museum in 1988.

At the end of the Edo period, Tanaka Castle was home to a branch of the Honda clan, daimyō of Tanaka Domain. Background Tanaka Castle is located on a hill in a marshy area in the middle of the Shida Plain, between the Seto and the Rokken rivers. Originally, the Imagawa clan used the site as a small stronghold, ordering their vassals, the Isshiki clan to construct a fortification in 1537 to protect the western approaches to Sunpu Castle. However, when Suruga Province came under occupation by the Takeda clan in 1570, Takeda Shingen had the stronghold expanded to guard the western border of Suruga against the increasing strength of Tokugawa Ieyasu in neighboring Tōtōmi Province, and assigned his general Yamagata Masakage as castellan. In 1572, another of Shingen's generals, Inagaki Nobuyasu, replaced Yamagata. The castle withstood an attack by Tokugawa forces in 1582, but was later surrendered after the death of Takeda Katsuyori. The current layout of Tanaka Castle dates from the period of Takeda rule. As there was no limitation due to geography, the fortifications consisted of three concentric circular moats, each with four gates equipped with a \\"maru umadashi\\" style gate, itself surrounded by crescent-moon shaped moats. The outer moat had a diameter of 300 meters.  History  The location of the castle on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto gave it considerable strategic value. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu assigned the castle to Sakai Tadatoshi, who built a small, 2-story donjon and added a fourth moat. Subsequently, as headquarters for Tanaka Domain, it changed hands many times during the early Edo period through a succession of fudai daimyō before coming under the control of a cadet branch of the Honda clan in 1730. Tokugawa Ieyasu and subsequent shōgun used the castle as an occasional base for falconry expeditions, and it was at Tanaka Castle that Tokugawa Ieyasu is alleged to have eaten tempura, just before his death. During the Bakumatsu period, in 1868 the Honda were reassigned to the newly created Nagao Domain in Awa Province in order to make way for an expanded Shizuoka Domain to be ruled by the ex-Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Tanaka Castle was assigned to one of his hatamoto, but was pulled down in 1872, following the Meiji Restoration. Most of the castle area turned to schools, houses and rice fields. The current structures include remnants of the moats and stonework, as well as a large yagura, reconstructed in 1992 to serve as a local history museum.

Arscott, 'Moving liquids with light: Photoelectrowetting on semiconductors', Sci. Rep. 1, 184, (2011). Scientific Reports: Nature Publishing Group. Working principle Whereas ordinary electrowetting is observed in surfaces consisting of a liquid/insulator/conductor stack, photoelectrowetting can be observed by replacing the conductor with a semiconductor to form a liquid/insulator/semiconductor stack. This has electrical and optical properties similar to the metal/insulator/semiconductor stack used in metal- oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Replacing the conductor with a semiconductor results in asymmetrical electrowetting behavior (in terms of voltage polarity), depending on the semiconductor doping type and density. Incident light above the semiconductor's band gap creates photo-induced carriers via electron-hole pair generation in the depletion region of the underlying semiconductor. This leads to a modification of the capacitance of the insulator/semiconductor stack, resulting in a modification of the contact angle of a liquid droplet resting on the surface of the stack in a continuous way which can also be non- reversible. The photoelectrowetting effect can be interpreted by a modification of the Young-Lippmann equation. The figure illustrates the principle of the photoelectrowetting effect. At zero bias (0V) the conducting droplet has a large contact angle (left image) if the insulator is hydrophobic. As the bias is increased (positive for a p-type semiconductor, negative for an n-type semiconductor) the droplet spreads out – i.e. the contact angle decreases (middle image). In the presence of light (having an energy superior to the band gap of the semiconductor) the droplet spreads out more due to the reduction of the thickness of the space charge region at the insulator/semiconductor interface (right image). Optical actuation of MEMS Photoactuation of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has been demonstrated using photoelectrowetting., A microcantilever is placed on top of the liquid- insulator-photoconductor junction. As light is shined on the junction, the capillary force from the droplet on the cantilever, due to the contact angle change, deflects the cantilever. This wireless actuation can be used as a substitute for complex circuit-based systems currently used for optical addressing and control of autonomous wireless sensorsYick, Jennifer, Biswanath Mukherjee, and Dipak Ghosal. \\"Wireless sensor network survey.\\" Computer Networks 52.12 (2008): 2292-330. Web. Droplet transport Photoelectrowetting can be used to circulate aqueous solution-based sessile droplets on a silicon wafer covered with silicon dioxide and Teflon – the latter providing a hydrophobic surface. Droplet transport is achieved by focusing a laser at the leading edge of the droplet. Droplet speeds of more than 10 mm/s can be achieved without the necessity of underlying patterned electrodes.C.

The company designs, manufactures, and services equipment used in the extraction of petroleum and natural gas. The company was formed in 1986 as a joint venture of Dresser Industries and Ingersoll Rand. History Ingersoll Rand Ingersoll Rand's roots date back to 1871 when Simon Ingersoll formed the Ingersoll Rock Drill Company after patenting a steam-powered rock drill design. The company merged with the Sergeant Drill Company in 1888 and became the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company. In 1905, the company merged with Rand Drill Company, which six years prior had begun manufacturing compressors in Painted Post, New York. The result was the Ingersoll Rand Company. Dresser Industries Dresser Industries was created from the 1938 merger of the Solomon R. Dresser Company (founded in Bradford, Pennsylvania) and the Clark Brothers Company (founded in 1880 in Belmont, New York; moved to Olean, New York in 1912). The Dresser Clark Company, which was incorporated in 1956 as Dresser Industries, manufactured steam, diesel, and reciprocating engines as well as centrifugal compressors in Olean, and in a facility in Le Havre, France. In 1984, Dresser Industries acquired Turbodyne Corporation from the McGraw-Edison Company, which had previously purchased the Studebaker-Worthington Company in 1979. In 1985, Dresser Industries acquired a 50% share of the Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk gas turbine division, the producer of the KG2, the world's first radial gas turbine. The remaining 50% share of Kongsberg's gas turbine division was purchased by Dresser-Rand in 1989. Dresser-Rand Dresser-Rand Company was formed in 1986 as an equally-owned joint venture between Dresser Industries and Ingersoll Rand. In September 1999, Dresser Industries merged with Halliburton Industries, and transferred its 51% ownership interest of Dresser- Rand Company to Halliburton. Due to agreements made in the original venture, Dresser Industries, then a unit of Halliburton, was required to either purchase the remaining interest in Dresser-Rand Company or sell it to Ingersoll Rand. In February 2000, the 51% ownership of Dresser-Rand Company was sold to Ingersoll Rand. On August 25, 2004, First Reserve Corporation, a private equity firm, entered into an equity purchase agreement with Ingersoll Rand to purchase the equity interests in Dresser-Rand Company for approximately $1.2 billion. Following the purchase agreement, Dresser-Rand Group, Inc. was registered as corporation in the state of Delaware, and the acquisition closed on October 29, 2004. On August 4, 2005, First Reserve took Dresser-Rand Group, Inc. public through an IPO, selling at $21.00 per share. In 2012 the company acquired Spanish engine supplier Grupo Guascor SL for $690 million, as well as Synchrony, Inc. In September 2014 German conglomerate Siemens AG announced plans to acquire Dresser-Rand Group Inc for $7.6 billion in cash. The deal was completed on June 30, 2015. Operations Dresser-Rand products include turbo and reciprocating compressors, steam turbines, industrial and aero-derivative gas turbines, high-speed engines, and modular power substations. The company is headquartered in Houston, Texas and has a presence in over 150 countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Germany, Norway, Brazil, India, Russia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, China, and the Netherlands.

In 1632 he became a member of the painter's guild of The Hague. In 1636 he received permission to sell 80 paintings on the condition that he leave the city for two years. In that document he is referred to as a painter and a schoolmaster. The same year he claimed the guild forced him to sign the contract and thanks to his father-in- law vouching for him in the city council he was allowed to return to The Hague in 1637. In the years 1637-1642 he bought and sold some properties there and in 1642 he became burger. In 1648 he was paid 1200 guilders for four \\"over- the-mantel\\" pieces for Paleis Noordeinde. In 1658 he married for the second time and in the same year he was one of the founders of the Confrerie Pictura. In 1676 he fled to Zierikzee after accusations of incest with his 17-year-old daughter Maria from his second marriage. He was influenced by Moses van Uyttenbroeck in The Hague, and besides his career there, he spent a year at Leiden in 1636-1637 and some years in Rotterdam in the early 1660s.

Confusion Confusion occurs when a consumer fails to correctly understand or interpret products and services. This, in turn, leads to them making imperfect purchasing decisions. This concept is important to marketeers because consumer confusion may result in reduced sales, reduced satisfaction with products and difficulty communicating effectively with the consumer. It is a widely studied and broad subject which is a part of consumer behaviour and decision making.Soloman, M R Consumer Behaviour: Buying, Having and Being. Prentice Hall p.7 Causes Choice overload Choice overload (sometimes called overchoice in the context of confusion) occurs when the set of purchasing options becomes overwhelmingly large for a consumer. A good example is wine in the UK where supermarkets may present over 1000 different products leaving the consumer with a difficult choice process. Whilst large assortments do have some positive aspects (principally novelty and stimulation and optimal solutions) any assortment greater than around 12-14 products leads to confusion and specifically transferring the ownership of quality assurance to the consumer. What this means in practice is reduced levels of satisfaction with purchases from large assortments as a consumer may be left with doubt that they have succeeded in finding the \\"best\\" product. Choice overload is growing with ever larger supermarkets and the internet being two of the main causes. Similarity Similarity is where two or more products lack differentiating features which prevents the consumer easily distinguishing between them. Differentiating features could be any from the marketing mix or anything else associated with the product such as brand. Similarity of products has the negative effect on the consumer of increasing the cognitive effort required to make a decision. and reducing the perception of accuracy of decision. Both of these reduce the satisfaction with a decision and thereby satisfaction with the purchase. Lack of information A consumer may suffer from lack of information if the information doesn't exist, is unavailable to them at the required moment or is too complex for them to use in their decision making process. Information overload Too much information surrounding a product or service disturbs the consumer by forcing them to engage in a more complex and time-consuming purchasing process. This, and the fact that it is difficult to compare and value the information when it is superfluous, leaves the consumer unsatisfied, insecure regarding what choice to make, and more prone to delay the decision-making, and thereby the actual purchase. Lack of consistency When information provided on a product and/or service is not consistent with the consumer's previously held beliefs and convictions, ambiguity occurs in the understanding of the product.  Law  Trademark infringement is measured by the multi-factor \\"likelihood of confusion\\" test. That is, a new mark will infringe on an existing trademark if the new mark is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company. The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors, including: * Strength of the plaintiff's trademark; * Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue; * Similarity of the goods and services at issue; * Evidence of actual confusion; * Purchaser sophistication; * Quality of the defendant's goods or services; * Defendant's intent in adopting the mark. Initial interest confusion occurs when a mark is used to attract a consumer, but upon inspection there is no confusion. This type of confusion is well-recognized for Internet searches, where a consumer may be looking for the site of one company, and a second site mimics keywords and metadata to draw hits from the \\"real\\" site. Point of sale confusion occurs when a consumer believes their product to be from a company which it is not. Post sale confusion occurs after a product is purchased, and third parties mistakenly think that the product is produced by a different, generally more prestigious, brand.

This research programme will draw on the resources of 14 CGIAR and numerous external partners to provide a more integrated approach to research into managing natural resources. The aim of the research programme is to increase agricultural productivity while protecting the environment, so food security is ensured for most of humanity and that poverty becomes history. The five main strands to the programme are: River basins; Irrigation systems; Information systems; Resource reuse and recovery; and Rainfed agriculture systems. A report released by UNEP and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI – which comes under the CGIAR umbrella and will be a major contributor to the new research programme), exemplifies the concept of conducting agriculture within healthy ecosystems. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to the report,Boelee, E. (Ed) Ecosystems for water and food security, 2011, IWMI, UNEP there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how we use critical water, land, and ecosystem resources to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested that we need to assign value to ecosystems, recognize environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balance the rights of a variety of users and interests. We would also need to address inequities that result when such measures are adopted, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.Molden, D., Opinion: The Water Deficit, The Scientist, 23 August 2011  References   External links  * * Category:Agricultural research Category:Natural resources Category:Research projects Category:Water ","title":"Water, Land and Ecosystems"},{"id":"34004665","text":"John Penn Arndt (November 25, 1780 - June 10, 1861) was an American merchant, pioneer, and legislator.

In 1974, MacInnis was the first scientist to dive in the near- freezing waters beneath the North Pole. In 1976 he became a member of the Order of Canada. MacInnis currently studies leadership in high risk environments and gives leadership presentations in North America and Europe. His audiences have included Microsoft, IBM, National Geographic, Rolex, Visa, Toyota and the U.S. Naval Academy. MacInnis led ten research expeditions under the Arctic Ocean. He was among the first people to dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. In 2012 he was a medical advisor and journalist on the James Cameron-National Geographic seven-mile science dive into the Mariana Trench. MacInnis has worked with the U.S. Navy, the Canadian Forces and the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has written ten books. His latest, Deep Leadership: Essential Insights from High Risk Environments, was published by Random House. Currently, he is producing a multimedia project, CARRY THE FIRE, to inspire enterprise, optimism and leadership in young people.  Education and early career  MacInnis is of Isle of Mull Scottish descent. He was born in Barrie, Ontario, but grew up in Toronto, where his family moved after his father, a Royal Canadian Air Force instructor, died in a plane crash when MacInnis was a few months old. MacInnis was raised by his mother, who remarried when he was 12. He attended high school at Upper Canada College. MacInnis first learned to scuba dive in 1954 in the waters off Florida. He attended the University of Toronto, where he was the captain of the swim team in the mid-1950s. MacInnis held the Canadian record for the breaststroke and tried unsuccessfully to make the Canadian Olympic team in 1956. MacInnis received his MD from the University of Toronto in 1962. He spent his internship at the Toronto General Hospital, where an experience with a tunnel construction worker suffering from decompression sickness helped to point MacInnis toward his post-graduate studies in diving medicine. MacInnis arranged for the worker, John McGean, to be transported to a pressure chamber in Buffalo, New York, where he was successfully treated. MacInnis also interned at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario.  Man-In-Sea and Ocean Systems  After his junior internship, MacInnis hoped to work with inventor and entrepreneur Edwin Link in the field of deep diving, but had no idea how to reach him. In fall 1963 MacInnis placed a person-to-person telephone call to Link, who agreed to meet with him for fifteen minutes the next day at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. At the interview, Link offered MacInnis a position as the full-time doctor for his Man-In-Sea Project. MacInnis received a Link Foundation Fellowship to study diving medicine under Christian J. Lambertsen at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1964, MacInnis became medical director of Man-In-Sea. During his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, MacInnis was a member of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filming expedition to Cocos Island, where a group of treasure hunters were seeking the fabled hoard of Benito Bonito and the Treasure of Lima. In June–July 1964, MacInnis participated as a life support specialist when Link conducted his second Man in Sea experiment in the Berry Islands (a chain in the Bahamas) with Robert Sténuit and Jon Lindbergh, one of the sons of Charles Lindbergh. Sténuit and Lindbergh stayed in Link's SPID habitat (Submersible, Portable, Inflatable Dwelling) for 49 hours underwater at a depth of 432 feet, breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. The dive was successful, although MacInnis made a potentially grave error by placing a cover without a pressure-equalizing valve on a carbon dioxide-filtering device. In 1965, MacInnis became medical director of Link's new company, Ocean Systems Inc. His activities that year included a simulated 650-foot dive in a laboratory pressure chamber and winning a Gold Medal of Excellence at the International Film Festival in Santa Monica for his film, Deep Androsia. In March 1967, Link launched Deep Diver, the first small submersible designed for lockout diving, allowing divers to leave and enter the craft while underwater. Deep Diver carried out many scientific missions in 1967 and 1968, including a 430-foot lockout dive in 1967 (at the same location as the 1964 Sténuit- Lindbergh dive) and a 700-foot lockout dive near Great Stirrup Cay in 1968. MacInnis participated in both of these dives as an observer in Deep Diver's forward chamber. In September 1967 MacInnis took part in a classified Ocean Systems mission aboard Deep Diver on the Grand Banks south of Newfoundland. A cable plow, rumored to be used for burying a strategic communications cable, had been lost in 400 feet of water. Two Navy divers had already been killed trying to recover it. MacInnis was one of a crew of four Ocean Systems personnel who unsuccessfully attempted to recover the cable plow using the submersible. The mission was called off due to rising winds, and Deep Diver was barely brought safely back aboard the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS John Cabot. In 1968 MacInnis took part in a saturation dive aboard the Hydrolab underwater habitat with two other aquanauts, spending 50 hours at a depth of 50 feet, and in the search for the lost submarine USS Scorpion.Deep Leadership (MacInnis), pp. 63-64. In late 1968 and early 1969, MacInnis took part in salvage operations after the crash of Pan Am Flight 217 near Caracas, Venezuela. In 1969 MacInnis served as a medical consultant on the U.S. Navy's SEALAB III project, and was on site the day after the death of aquanaut Berry L. Cannon. MacInnis designed and built Sublimnos, the first Canadian underwater habitat, which was placed in Georgian Bay near Tobermory, Ontario in June 1969.Miller and Koblick, p. 372. Sublimnos had an \\"open hatch\\" policy, allowing access to any diver with a legitimate reason to use the habitat. In July 1969 MacInnis attended the Apollo 11 launch at Cape Kennedy, then traveled to Tobermory, where he dived to Sublimnos and looked up through the water at the Moon at the very moment the astronauts were walking on it.  Arctic research  MacInnis first met Pierre Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, in late 1969. Trudeau and MacInnis would make approximately fifty dives together over the years. In 1970 Trudeau asked MacInnis to help write Canada's first national ocean policy. MacInnis began a series of ten research expeditions to study techniques for working under the Arctic Ocean. Also in 1970, MacInnis founded the James Allister MacInnis Foundation for underwater research and education in Canada. In March 1971 MacInnis was a member of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation crew filming Harp seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, resulting in the first photographs ever taken of the seals in their underwater environment. Author and conservationist Farley Mowat was another member of the expedition. Mowat also helped encourage MacInnis to write. Also in 1971, MacInnis helped oversee the successful decompression of Ocean Systems diver Bill Maltman after he was fouled in wreckage while taking part in salvage operations in the wake of the crash of a B-52 into Lake Michigan. The same year, MacInnis published Underwater Images, a book of poetry accompanied by photographs of undersea life taken by MacInnis. In 1972, MacInnis led the team that constructed Sub-Igloo, the first manned underwater station in the Arctic Ocean. MacInnis took part in a telephone call from Sub-Igloo to Prime Minister Trudeau in Ottawa, Ontario., cited in Joe MacInnis, Underwater Man, pp. 135-142. MacInnis visited the Soviet Union for the first time in autumn 1973 as part of a scientific exchange program, and showed a short film about his underwater polar research in Moscow and Leningrad. In 1974, MacInnis was the first scientist to dive beneath the North Pole. By 1975, MacInnis had taken part in more than 100 major dives and expeditions. In that year, he escorted Charles, Prince of Wales, on a dive under Arctic ice at Resolute Bay. Also in 1975, the MacInnis Foundation donated Sublimnos to Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology, where it was installed in Lake Seneca at the King City, Ontario, campus.Miller and Koblick, pp. 373-374. MacInnis was awarded the Order of Canada on 14 January 1976 and was invested on 7 April 1976. In 1979, he was accompanied on a dive beneath the North Pole by Edward Schreyer, the Governor General of Canada.  The Breadalbane  While diving in 1975, MacInnis found a fragment of the Breadalbane, the northernmost known shipwreck in the world, a British merchant ship that sank in the Arctic in 1853. MacInnis headed the first expedition to find the wreck of Breadalbane in August 1978. In August 1980, after a three-year search, the ship was discovered by Coast Guard cutter John A. Macdonald using side-scan sonar. The first images showed her hull intact and two of her masts still standing. In 1981, supported by the Canadian Coast Guard, the National Geographic Society, and others, the group returned. A remotely piloted submersible was used to examine the wreck, which took the first colour photographs and video footage. The images showed the bow, masts, rudder and anchor. The wood appeared new. In 1983, further visits to the Breadalbane were conducted by Sea-Otter, a submersible, and the WASP, an atmospheric diving suit similar to the Newtsuit.  Titanic and Edmund Fitzgerald expeditions  In 1985, MacInnis was an adviser to the team that discovered the wreck of the RMS Titanic. Between 1985 and 1991 MacInnis made dives in the Russian MIRs research submersibles and the French submersible Nautile, including his first visit to the Titanic in a submersible, in 1987 aboard the Nautile, and a descent 16,400 feet into King's Trough in the eastern North Atlantic aboard Mir 1 with National Geographic photographer Emory Kristof and Russian explorer Anatoly Sagalevich. In 1991, he co-led with Sagalevitch the expedition to the Titanic which made the IMAX film Titanica, on which he served as co-executive producer. On this occasion MacInnis dove to the Titanic's bridge deck. In July 1994, MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to the SS Edmund Fitzgerald over a three-day period. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided the Edwin A. Link as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, the Celia. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation of why the Fitzgerald sank.Fitzgerald's Storm (MacInnis), p. 98. MacInnis helped organize another series of dives in July 1995 to salvage the bell from the Fitzgerald.Stonehouse, p. 219. Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten's atmospheric diving suit, the Newtsuit, was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, replace it with a replica, and put a beer can in the Fitzgeralds pilothouse. At MacInnis' suggestion, the replica bell was inscribed with the names of the Fitzgeralds crew.  Recent activities  From 1996 to 2004 MacInnis was the chair of TD Financial Group's Friends of the Environment Foundation. In October 2001, MacInnis visited the exterior of the Aquarius underwater laboratory near Key Largo during the first of the NASA/NOAA NEEMO missions there. He shook hands underwater with Canadian astronaut/aquanaut Dafydd Williams. In 2003, MacInnis accompanied filmmaker James Cameron on the Disney- IMAX expedition to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans which resulted in the 3-D film, Aliens of the Deep. MacInnis' companion book to the film, James Cameron's Aliens of the Deep, was published in 2004. In 2005, MacInnis joined Cameron's Discovery Channel expedition which explored the last unseen rooms inside Titanic and broadcast live television pictures from the wreck. In March 2012, MacInnis served as expedition physician for Cameron's solo dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the Deepsea Challenger submersible. As part of his ongoing research into leadership in life-threatening environments, in 2010 MacInnis spent time with members of the Canadian Armed Forces in order to research military leadership. This included a visit to Canadian forces in Kandahar, Afghanistan. MacInnis has received six honorary degrees, the Queen's Anniversary Medal and the Admiral's Medal. In 2008, he received the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, from Lakehead University. MacInnis is a Member of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. MacInnis is the president of Undersea Research Ltd., a consulting company which he founded in Toronto in 1968. He is the creator of Wisdom Keepers, a video series featuring interviews with older people of accomplishment in various fields. He has written for such publications as National Geographic, Wired and Scientific American. He makes frequent motivational speeches to Fortune 500 companies.  Personal life  MacInnis is a jazz aficionado. He has counted many astronauts and aquanauts among his personal friends. His son, Jeff MacInnis (born in 1963), has led a sailing expedition through the Northwest Passage. As of 1965, MacInnis lived near the Town of Port Credit, in what is now Mississauga.

Early life and Greek Revolution  Ioannis Orlandos In Hydra, where he had been living since 1811, he married the sister of Georgios and Lazaros Kountouriotis, Hydriote landlords and shipowners. He was also a significant shipowner before the revolution. At the start of it, he gave all his ships to the revolutionary government. He became a delegate from Hydra at the First National Assembly at Epidaurus and a member of the twelve-member committee that modified the text of the first constitution. He had the position of the vice-president of the legislative corps from 13 January until April 1823. On 26 April and after Lazaros Kountouriotis denied the position, he was elected president of the legislative corps. A month later, on 22 May 1823, disappointed by the way politics had taken and anticipating the upcoming civil war, he resigned from his post. His political opponents had already accused him of factionalism due to the assistance he provided to Kountouriotis. In June 1823 he became a member of a committee jointly with Andreas Louriotis and Andreas Zaimis to negotiate about a loan in London. Before departing for the British capital, he wrote a letter about the need for unity and avoidance of civil wars. Also, on November 1823 he visited Lord Byron in Cephalonia. In January 1824, he and Louriotis, a man of Mavrokordatos, was the Greek ambassadors who made the negotiations and finally borrowed the first British loan during the revolution, £800,000. In London, they were formally welcomed and they even met the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, George Canning. He was a member of the delegation who, in 1825, summed the second loan, £2,000,000. He returned to Greece on 1825 and continued representing Hydra at the National Assemblies.  Life in independent Greece  Orlandos was a member of the English Party, considering the UK as the most effective country as of helping the revolution. He selected them due to the Kingdom's liberal political heritage and also its superiority in the sea. Then, he joined the anti-capodistrian faction stating that he preferred Greece a British protectorate instead of tolerating Ioannis Kapodistrias' authoritarian administration. So he took part in the anti- capodistrian demonstrations of Hydra, during the summer of 1831. After all these and in searching for scapegoats to apologize for the loans, he and Louriotis were accused of wrongful administration. They were firstly acquitted but, in 1835 the court characterised them responsible for the loss of £28,769. In 1839 they published their huge apology in two volumes which they later renounced. In 1837 he was one of the founding members of the Archaeological Society of Athens.

Life and career George Kennedy was born on 17 May 1901 in Moganshan, Zhejiang Province, China, where his parents Alexander and Ada Kennedy were serving as Protestant missionaries. Although his family spoke English at home, Kennedy grew up speaking the local Chinese dialect, a form of Wu Chinese, and often said that Chinese was his native language. The Kennedy family left China in 1918 after George's father and brother Fred died less than a month apart. They returned to the United States, where Kennedy attended the College of Wooster. From 1922 to 1925 he studied theology at the Western Theological Seminary and the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. During this time he became friends with Luther Carrington Goodrich, who later became professor of Chinese at Columbia University. He returned to China in 1926 and taught English and Chinese in Shanghai. In 1932, Kennedy went to the University of Berlin, where he studied Chinese and Mongolian under Otto Franke and Erich Haenisch. In 1937, Kennedy completed his Ph.D. with dissertation on the role of confession in Chinese law. He had previously returned to the United States and worked in the Orientalia department of the Library of Congress under Arthur W. Hummel, Sr., writing 72 entries in Hummel's biographical dictionary, Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period. In 1936 he began teaching Chinese at Yale University. He was made an assistant professor in 1937, an associate professor in 1943, and full professor in 1954, the rank he held upon his sudden death in 1960. During World War II, Kennedy served as the director of the Army Specialized Training Program at Yale from 1942 to 1944. In 1960, Kennedy was traveling in Asia visiting some friends and members of his family. In early August 1960, Kennedy planned to return to the United States, and boarded a ship in Yokohama, Japan, bound for San Francisco. During the voyage, Kennedy, who had not been feeling well but had not sought medical attention, died of a heart attack. An autopsy revealed that he had a number of large tumors in his body but had chosen not to have any cancer treatments. Kennedy was the principal author of the Yale Romanization of Mandarin.

EB-57A Air Defense Command Defense Systems Evaluation Aircraft. The Martin B-57 Canberra was first manufactured in 1953, and the United States Air Force had accepted a total of 403 B-57s before production ended in early 1957. The last USAF B-57 was retired in 1983. It was the last tactical bomber used by the United States Air Force, being engaged in combat operations during the Vietnam War (1963–1971). It also performed a wide variety of other missions. This list is of the units it was assigned to, missions performed, and the bases it was stationed. Units Tactical Bombardment The B-57B Tactical Bomber was the replacement for the World War II B-26 Invader. Assigned to TAC, USAFE, PACAF. 202 aircraft produced. Production began in 1952, deliveries began in 1954. TAC aircraft sent to Air National Guard by 1958, being replaced by F-100 Super Sabre. USAFE aircraft withdrawn from France in 1957 by agreement with French Government. PACAF 8th and 13th Bombardment Squadrons flew B-57B Tactical Bombers in combat during Vietnam War, 1964–1969. The B-57G modification (Tropic Moon Night Intruder, 18 B-57B aircraft modified, 1968–1969) flew in combat 1970–1972. Last aircraft retired from Air National Guard, 1974. The B-57Cs was a limited-production dual-control trainer version of the B-57B (1954–1958). 38 produced. A small number of B-57Cs were later re-equipped and redesignated as RB-57C for service alongside RB-57A Reconnaissance aircraft as trainers when the latter were issued to ANG units. * 3d Bombardment Wing, Tactical (B-57B/C) (PACAF) : Johnson AB, Japan, 1956–1960 : Yokota AB, Japan, 1960–1963 :: 8th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 13th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 90th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 345th Bombardment Wing, Tactical (B-57B/C) (TAC) : 345th Bombardment Group (1954–1957) received first production USAF B-57Bs, July 1954 : Langley AFB, Virginia, 1954–1959 ::498th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical ::499th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical ::500th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical ::501st Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 461st Bombardment Wing, Tactical (B-57B/C) (TAC) : Hill AFB, Utah, 1955–1956 : Blytheville AFB, Arkansas, 1956–1958 :: 764th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 765th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 766th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 3510th Combat Crew Training Wing, (B-57B/C) (ATC) : Randolph AFB, Texas, 1954–1956 :: 3511th Combat Crew Training Squadron * 17th Bombardment Group, Tactical (B-57B/C) (TAC) : Hurlburt Field, Florida, 1955–1956 :: 34th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 38th Bombardment Group, Tactical (B-57B/C) (USAFE) :Laon-Couvron AB, France, 1955–1957 :: 71st Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 405th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 822d Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 41st Air Division (B-57B) (PACAF) : Yokota Air Base, Japan, 1964 :: 8th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical :: 13th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical * 405th Fighter Wing (B-57B) (PACAF) : Clark Air Base, Philippines, 1965–1968 :: 8th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical (Tail Code: PQ) :: 13th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical (Tail Code: PV) :: Both squadrons performed rotating temporary duty at: ::: Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Bien Hoa Air Base, Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam, 1965–1968 * 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (B-57B) (PACAF) : Phan Rang Air Base, South Vietnam, 1968–1969 :: 8th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical (Tail Code: PQ) :: 13th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical (Tail Code: PV) * 15th Tactical Fighter Wing (B-57G) (TAC) : MacDill AFB, Florida, 1969–1972 :: 13th Bombardment Squadron, 1969–1970 (Tail Code: FS) :: 4424th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1969–1972 (Tail Code: FS) * 8th Tactical Fighter Wing (B-57G) (PACAF) : Ubon RTAFB, Thailand, 1970–1972 :: 13th Bombardment Squadron (Tail Code: FK) Tactical Reconnaissance The RB-57A was the replacement for the RB-26 night reconnaissance aircraft. 67 produced. The aircraft was filled with various cameras and was unarmed, its mission being day and night, high and low, and visual and photographic reconnaissance. It filled the photo-reconnaissance mission of the RB-26, but were not reliable and also had a high accident rate. Replaced by the RB-66B Destroyer and RF-101C Voodoo by 1958; survivors sent to the Air National Guard. Some were converted to Air Defense Command EB-57A electronic warfare aircraft to provide training for air defense radar units. By 1973, most of the surviving R/EB-57A's had been retired to AMARC at Davis Monthan AFB, Arizona. A few were converted to RB-57F strategic reconnaissance/weather reconnaissance aircraft. Ten RB-57As were modified for high-altitude strategic reconnaissance over non- friendly areas under \\"Project Heartthrob\\". Designated RB-57A-1s, they flew high-altitude reconnaissance missions over Eastern Europe, Communist China and North Korea in the late 1950s. Two other RB-57As, designated RB-57A-2 were modified with a bulbous nose containing AN/APS-60 mapping radar and a SIGINT direction finder system in 1957 under project SARTAC. Eight RB-57Es were modified from B-57E Target Towing aircraft and were fitted with cameras and other sensors as part of the \\"Patricia Lynn Project\\" during the Vietnam War. They were used in spotting Viet Cong river traffic at night along the Mekong Delta southeast of Saigon. In 1969/70, Patricia Lynn missions were flown into Laos and into Cambodia. The Patricia Lynn operation was terminated in mid-1971. * 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (RB-57A) (USAFE) : 1st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron :: Spangdahlem AB, West Germany, 1954–1957 * 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (RB-57A) (TAC) : 22d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron : 41st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron : 43d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron :: Shaw AFB, South Carolina, 1954–1956 :: (First USAF operational B-57 wing) * 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Group (RB-57A) (USAFE) : 30th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron :: Sembach AB, West Germany. 1954–1958 * 33d Tactical Group, Detachment 1, (RB-57E) (PACAF) : Re-designated: 6250th Combat Support Group Detachment 1 : Re-designated: 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Detachment 1 :: Tan Son Nhut AB, South Vietnam, 1963–1971 :: Also operated from: Da Nang AB, South Vietnam * 6021st Reconnaissance Squadron (RB-57A-1) (FEAF) :: Yokota AB, Japan, 1955–1957 * 7407th Support Squadron (RB-57A-1, RB-57A-2) (USAFE) :: Wiesbaden AB, West Germany, 1955–1957 Strategic Reconnaissance The RB-57D was a high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft. 20 produced.

He is widely viewed as a homegrown veteran of Singapore's Mandopop night-scene, often labelled as a local icon. The press continue to credit him as Singapore's Mandopop King, who brought this genre of music to prominence. In 2013, Scorpion resigned as Executive Director of Shanghai Dolly and left the club on 28 February 2013 so as to perform on an ad hoc basis and teach horse-riding in the day at the National Equestrian Centre. He launched his biography-travelogue, Sanuk Jing Jing Na!, at the club venue, Zouk, on 30 May to mark 30 years in show business. He performed with Queen Inc band and his musician-daughter, Zsa Zsa Scorpion. Biography 1961–1982: Early life Scorpion was born in the residential conservation area of Joo Chiat, a district in the eastern region of Singapore. He was born the eldest child into a family of four siblings, with him being the only son in a family of three younger sisters. He received his early education at Bukit Merah Primary School (now demolished) and his secondary education at Anderson Secondary School, before being enlisted into the Singapore Armed Forces, where he eventually vocationed as an Infantry section leader. After his consignment, he ventured into part-time modelling. 1983–1992: Career beginnings Scorpion's singing talent was only first discovered by a chance visit to a friend's club opening, called Gold Leaf Esteem Salon at Parklane Shopping Mall. When dared to sing on stage by his friends, he gamely took on the dare and sang a classic Cantopop ballad \\"上海滩\\" (Sheung Hoi Tan), the theme song from the popular Hong Kong period drama The Bund, originally sung by Frances Yip, in front of a live audience. His performance immediately impressed the club manager and he was offered a singing contract to perform at his club. Within 5 months, he had gained such a fan following and recognition from local music producers that he was offered a starring role in Channel 8's prime time (8:00 – 10:00 PM [UTC+08:00]) live Mandarin singing show, called Live at Studio One, produced by Studio One. It aired every weekday and he was a regular performer from 1983 to 1992. This wide exposure to the local Mandarin-speaking population helped secure his local fan base and increase his popularity. In 1988, he embarked on a solo, three-night, sell-out, summer showcase concert in Guangzhou, China to promote the \\"Singapore-style\\" of Canto and Mandopop. 1993–2005: Continued rise to prominence Scorpion eventually became a crowd-drawing singing staple at many Cantopop-themed clubs, singing to nightly crowds at various night spots, including clubs/bars Canto, Club 1997, Club Chinos, Utopia and many others under the Europa Group. He eventually became the resident star and lead singer of Dragonfly, a Mandopop club situated in St James Power Station, a music and nightlife venue in the HarbourFront area of Singapore, near VivoCity. There, he performed together with a panoply of other local musical icons like Celest Zhang, Fatt Zhai, Jason Chung and Skye Sirena, as well as younger local reality stars such as Jon Toh (卓坊林) of Project SuperStar fame, and Sylvester Sim (沈祥龙), runner-up in the inaugural season of Singapore Idol. 2006–2012: Shanghai Dolly In 2009, Scorpion signed a renewed contract with the St. James Group, becoming the Executive Director of Shanghai Dolly, a new Mandopop club situated in the heart of Clarke Quay. The 1,600 sq m superclub was built as part of a $1-million St. James revamp. He acted as a mentor and guide to his bevy of younger singers, dancers, performers and DJs. In late 2011, a competition was created to \\"find the next William Scorpion\\", called Guinness Live. Scorpion, representing Team Shanghai Dolly, mentored 4 acts (Aydan Ang, Benita Cheng, Jeremy Khoo and Regine Han), and these 4 acts competed against 8 others (4 from Team Dragonfly (Alvin Ng, Goh Yong Wei, Kenny Khoo and Phoebe Ong), mentored by Jason Chung, and 4 from Team Firefly (Alfred Sim, Howie Yeo, Willis Loye and Yee Si Ling), mentored by Fatt Zhai). Scorpion was also a judge for the competition. After 54 live shows, the finals were held on 17 March 2012, which culminated in the 12 finalists performing alongside veteran Mandopop acts Power Station (动力火车) and Liu Liyang (刘力扬). Team Firefly were the eventual champions, winning each member a winner's single. 2013–present Scorpion resigned as Executive Director of Shanghai Dolly on 15 February 2013 and he left the club on 28 February 2013, so as to perform on an ad hoc basis (corporate functions and events) as well as to teach equestrian during the day at the National Equestrian Centre Singapore. He launched his biography-travelogue on 30 May 2013, the first of its kind title for a local celebrity. Titled Sanuk Jing Jing Na!, the book celebrates three decades in show business as well as his frequent travels to Thailand. The book launch/live gig was held at critically acclaimed club venue, Zouk, on 30 May, where he performed with premier Chinese rock band, Queen Inc, and Scorpion's musician-daughter, Zsa Zsa Scorpion. The book covers the challenges Scorpion faced in his entertainment career; how he stayed on top of the game; coming to terms with a tragedy after 15 years; his love for horses; and staying positive. The coffee-table book is written in English by well-known Singaporean entertainment journalist Ivan Lim and is published by Typewriter Books, an indie publisher of several best-selling books. The book project was a collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Personal life Scorpion married in 1985 and the couple had their first child, a daughter, Zsa Zsa, a year later in 1986, and a son, Nicholas, in 1989. Zsa Zsa has since followed in her father's footsteps and was formerly one half of local indie- folk music duo, Zsa & Claire, with band-mate, Claire Goh. Nicholas is an aspiring chef. Nicholas is currently setting up his own restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. Scorpion holds an avid interest in equestrianism. He has worked with horses since 1988. He has earned an International Certification Horsemanship (Level 1) from The Equestrian Federation of Australia as well as Tertiary Studies in Horse Management and Riding. He has worked full-time as an equestrianism/horse-riding coach at The National Equestrian Centre, Bukit Timah Saddle Club in Singapore. He also currently holds a Federation Equestrian Internationale LEVEL 1 in General Coaching. Scorpion started his first proper riding lesson in 1989 with Mrs Lee Rhodes, a German national that based in Thailand since she was 8. Mrs Rhodes passed away at the age of 93 in Kanchanaburi on 14 November 2011 on Scorpion's 50th Birthday. Thru the training and dedication from Mrs Rhodes, Scorpion then decided to become a horse trainer, riding coach and horse rescue worker. Scorpion then trained with many elite equestrian trainers to establish his skills and experience. He currently owns a horse rescue stable in Phayao, Northern Thailand. It comprises 12 stables for 12 horses, rooms for competent riders who wants to hone their riding skills. The rescue stable is solely run on Scorpion's personal funding and some fundings from friends and horse lovers. Scorpion currently still return to the stage to raise funds for this horse rescue projects. Scorpion is fluent in Cantonese, English, Hakka, Hokkien, Mandarin and Thai.

Date unknown, probably c. 1970s The Junior Order of United American Mechanics is an American fraternal order. It began as a youth affiliation of the Order of United American Mechanics, but seceded to become its own organization and eventually absorbed its parent order. Originally, it was an anti-Catholic, nativist group, but eventually abandoned this position and became a general fraternal benefit society open to people regardless of creed, race or sex.Alvin J. Schmidt and Nicholas Babchuk,Fraternal Organizations Greenwood Press Westport, CT, 1980 p.171-2 In 1923 the JOUAM had 253,399 members in its \\"Funeral Benefit Dept\\" and 22,519 \\"Beneficiary Degree\\" members. Its headquarters at that time were located at 741 Wabash Building, and reportedly had state and local councils in nearly every state in the Union. It also ran a home for the orphans of deceased members in Tiffin, Ohio, which housed 800-900 children. While the Order's purposes were mostly fraternal by this point, membership remained restricted to Protestants, and some of its officers still continued to advocate anti-Catholic positions.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.208 By 1969 this had dwindled to 35,172, 15,000 of which were social (non-insured) members. By 1979 the number had dropped to 8,500, evenly divided between social and beneficiary members in 400 local councils. The group was then headquartered in Willow Grove, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and held a national convention biennially. It also had a bimonthly news paper, Junior American,Schmidt p.172 which is still published.http://www.jrouam.org/index.php?pr=Junior_American&=SID Between 1925 and 1932, they constructed the Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans Home near Lexington, North Carolina.

The prevalence of obesity is becoming a worldwide problem, with the American population leading the way. In 2007-2008, prevalence rates for obesity among adult American men were approximately 32% and over 35% amongst adult American women. According to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 66% of the American population is either overweight or obese and this number is predicted to increase to 75% by 2015. Obesity is linked to health problems such as decreased insulin sensitivity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, sleep apnea, and joint pain such as osteoarthritis. It is thought that a major factor of obesity is that obese individuals are in a positive energy balance, meaning that they are consuming more calories than they are expending. Humans expend energy through their basal metabolic rate, the thermic effect of food, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), and exercise. While many treatments for obesity are presented to the public, exercise in the form of walking is an easy, relatively safe activity that has the potential to move a person towards a negative energy balance and if done for a long enough time may reduce weight. Biomechanics Knee osteoarthritis and other joint pain are common complaints amongst obese individuals and are often a reason as to why exercise prescriptions such as walking are not continued after prescribed. To determine why an obese person might have more joint problems than a non- obese individual, the biomechanical parameters must be observed to see differences between obese and non-obese walking. Stride and cadence Numerous studies have examined the differences in stride between obese and non-obese individuals. Spyropoulos et al. in 1991 examined stride length, width, and joint angle differences between the two groups. They found that obese individuals take shorter (1.25m vs. 1.67m) and wider (.16m vs. .08m) strides than their non-obese counterparts. Browning and Kram also observed obese people taking wider strides (~30% greater) across differing walking speeds (0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, and 1.75 m/s), but the stride width did not change with differing speed. They did not find stride lengths to be different across speeds. Along with taking wider strides, several articles have found obese individuals to walk at slower velocities than their non-obese counterparts, claiming that this might be due to balance and body control while walking. Ledin and Odkivst support this theory in a study when they added mass by way of a weighted shirt (20% body weight) to lean individuals and saw sway increase. Increased sway has also been observed in pre-pubertal boys. Though obese individuals may be able to accommodate for the extra mass in terms of balance because they walk with it every day, several studies have found that obese people spend more time in the stance rather than swing phase during the walking cycle and increase double support time. Slower cadences, or number of steps within a certain period of time, have also been associated with obese individuals when compared to lean individuals and would be expected with slower walking speeds. Others have found no difference in obese people walking velocities and find that they share a similar preferred walking speed with lean individuals. Joint angle differences In a study by DeVita and Hortobágyi, obese people were found to be more erect throughout the stance phase with greater hip extension, less knee flexion, and more plantarflexion during the course of stance than non-obese people. They also found that obese individuals had less knee flexion in early stance and greater plantarflexion at toe off. In a study looking at knee extension, Messier et al. found a significant positive correlation with maximum knee extension and BMI. That same study looked at mean angular velocities at the hip and ankle and found no difference between obese and lean individuals. Ground reaction force A ground reaction force is the force that is exerted by the ground onto whatever body is in contact with the ground and is equal to the force that is placed on the ground. An example is the force that the ground exerts onto the foot and then up the leg of a person when walking and making contact with the ground. These can be measured by having a subject walk across a force platform and collect the forces exerted on the ground. These forces have long been thought to increase loads on the knee and would increase with greater mass from an obese person. This may be a predictor of osteoarthritis for an obese subject as the vertical force has been documented to potentially be the most significant force that is transmitted up the leg to the knee. In 1996, Messier and colleagues observed the differences in ground reaction forces between obese and lean older adults with osteoarthritis. They found that when they accounted for age and walking velocity, the vertical force was significantly positively correlated with BMI. Therefore, as BMI increased, the forces increased. They found this in not only the vertical force, but also in the anteroposterior and mediolateral forces. Because of the study population, this study did not compare obese adults with lean counterparts. Browning and Kram in 2006 observed two groups (one obese and one non-obese group) of young adult’s ground reaction forces across different speeds. They found that absolute ground reaction forces were significantly greater for the obese people than the non-obese group at slower walking speeds and at each walking speed the peak vertical force was approximately 60% greater. Absolute peak in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were also greater for the obese group but the difference was erased when scaled to body weight. Forces were also greatly reduced at slower walking speeds. Net muscle moments Lower extremity joint loading is estimated through net muscle moments, joint reaction forces, and joint loading rates. Net muscle moments can increase up to 40% as walking speeds rise from 1.2 to 1.5 m/s. One could then predict that as speed increases, loads felt by the lower-extremity joints would increase as the net muscle moments and ground reaction forces increase. Browning and Kram have also found that stance-phase sagittal-plane net muscle moments are greater in obese adults when compared to lean individuals. Energetics Metabolic rate It is well established that obese individuals expend a greater amount of metabolic energy at rest and when performing some physical activity such as walking than lean individuals,. Added mass demands more energy to move. This is observed in a study by Foster et al. in 1995 when they took 11 obese women had calculated their energy expenditure before and after weight loss. They found that after significant weight loss, the subjects expended less energy on the same task as they did when they were heavier. To determine if walking was more expensive per kilogram of body mass and if obese individuals preferred walking speeds would be slower, Browning and Kram sought to characterize the metabolic energy obese females would expend while walking across differing speeds. They found that walking for obese women was 11% more expensive per kilogram of body mass than lean individuals and that the obese women preferred to walk at a similar speed as the lean individuals that minimized their gross energy cost per distance. Wanting to look at metabolic rates of obese men compared to obese women and determine if the adipose distribution (gynoid vs. android) differing between the sexes play a role in energy expenditure, Browning et al. observed class II obese males and females walking across differing speeds. They found that standing metabolic rate when normalized for body weight was ~20% less for obese people (more adipose tissue and less metabolically active tissue), but that metabolic rates during walking were ~10% greater per kilogram body mass for obese individuals when compared to lean. These researchers also found that increased thigh mass and adipose distribution did not matter, overall body composition of percent body fat was related to net metabolic rate. Therefore, obese individuals are using more metabolic energy than their lean counterparts when walking at the same speed. Normalization Many measurements are normalized to body weight in order to account for differing body weights when doing comparisons (see V02max testing). Normalizing body weight when comparing obese and lean individuals metabolic rates reduces the difference, indicating that body weight rather than body fat composition is the primary indicator for the metabolic cost of walking. Caution must be taken when analyzing the scientific literature to understand if findings are normalized or not because they may be interpreted differently. Possible strategies One possible suggested strategy to maximize energy expenditure while reducing lower joint extremity is to have obese people walk at a slow speed with an incline. Researchers found that by walking at either 0.5 or 0.75 m/s and a 9° or 6° incline respectively would equate to the same net metabolic rate as an obese individual walking at 1.50 m/s with no incline. These slower speeds with an incline also had significantly reduced loading rates and reduced lower-extremity net muscle moments. Other strategies to consider are slow walking for extended periods of time and training underwater to reduce loads on joints and increase lean body mass. Limitations working with obese individuals as subjects It is often very difficult to recruit obese people that do not have other comorbidities such as osteoarthritis or cardiovascular disease. It is also difficult to deduce if a healthy population is representative of the entire obese population because the people that volunteer may already be somewhat active and have a greater fitness than their sedentary counterparts. Another difficulty lies in the ability to characterize biomechanical variables due to the large variability between research groups placement of biomechanical markers. Marker placement often used for lean individuals can be difficult to find on obese individuals due to the excess of adipose between the bone landmark and the marker. The uses of DEXA and x-rays have improved the placement of these biomechanical markers, but variability still remains and should be taken into account when analyzing scientific findings.

It was the center piece of a family farm that included four additional buildings for beef and dairy animals. The three story house has . The house consists of 18 rooms with pine molding and red oak floors. The main rooms include a formal parlor, kitchen, dining room, sitting room, study and several bedrooms. The main hall includes a walnut staircase. From the second level, another stairway leads to the attic and a white cupola on the roof. The cupola is above the ground. The cupola provided a view of the entire farm, as well as Chicago on a clear day.Home for the holidays; The Times, Sunday, November 12, 2011, A3 The building was placed on the National Historic Register in 2007. Over its life, it has been a home, Franciscan monastery of the Seven Dolors Shrine, women's homeless shelter, antique store and a bridal shop. Today, the mansion grounds includes and is being made into a tourist attraction. Significant features The house was built of brick by 300 German bricklayers. The walls are double thick using a common bond. On the interior, the walls are covered using plaster and lath. The sills, lintels and keystones around the openings are made of Indiana limestone. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The main feature of the house is the full width front porch on the west side. There are significant feature in the molding as the ceiling mimics the eaves of the house and the rails and balusters wrap around the porch and are mimicked on the house side as well. The cupola is located over the center of the house and has two windows on each side. The windows are single pane, double hung with a rope trim. The back of the house, the west side, includes a garage, previously a carriage house and is original. The exterior is simpler than that of the house. The original doorway has been bricked shut, but is still visible by the presence of the keystone and the brick arch. Interior The first floor is arranged along the east-west entrance hall. The main doorway is a double door off the porch. The first floor ceiling is high in the main part of the house. The floor is red oak with seven doors leading into adjacent rooms. On the left (south) is the double parlor, which includes the front parlor and the dining room. These are connected by an archway. On the right (north) is the library and the stairway to the second floor. Behind the stairway on the right is a bath and a closet. Across the end of the entry hall is the Great Room, spanning the entire width of the house. Originally, the great room was two dining rooms. In the 1930s the dividing wall was removed. The Great Room provides access to the South Porch, the Kitchen and the rear stairway to the second floor.

Strmiska which was published by ABC-CLIO in 2005. Containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Pagan studies, the book examines different forms of contemporary Paganism as practiced in Europe and North America. Modern Paganism in World Cultures was published as a part of ABC-CLIO's series of books entitled 'Religion in Contemporary Cultures', in which other volumes were dedicated to religious movements like Buddhism and Islam. Edited by Strmiska, then a lecturer at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Connecticut, the volume contained contributions from scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds, some of whom were practicing Pagans themselves. In her paper, the American folklorist Sabina Magliocco discussed \\"ethnic ambivalence\\" amongst the Italian American community in regards to the relationship between Stregheria and Wicca, whilst the Irish folklorist Jenny Butler dealt with the place of contemporary Druidry in Ireland. In a paper co-written by Strmiska and Icelandic anthropologist Baldur A. Sigurvinsson, the religion of Asatru in both Iceland and the United States was compared, which is followed by a piece by British anthropologist Jenny Blain looking at the way in which British Heathens viewed sacred sites. The sixth paper, written by environmental studies scholar Adrian Ivakhiv, looked at Paganism in Ukraine, whilst the seventh, co-written once more by Strmiska, this time with humanities scholar Vilius Rudra Dundzila, looked at Romuva in both Lithuania and the U.S. The final paper, produced by military veteran Stephanie Urquhart, looked at the acceptance of Pagans in the U.S. military. Academic reviews were largely positive, praising the various papers for expanding the knowledge of Pagan studies by focusing on less well known religions like Romuva and Asatru rather than Wicca, the dominant Pagan faith to which the majority of literature in the field of Pagan studies had been devoted up until that point. Background Michael Strmiska had gained an MA in the Religions of India from the University of Wisconsin–Madison before going on to gain a PhD in Religious Studies from Boston University. Proceeding to teach Comparative Religion and World History, he worked at universities in Lithuania, the United States and Japan, and at the time of Modern Paganism in World Cultures' publication was lecturing in World History at Central Connecticut State University.Strmiska (ed.) 2005. p. viii. Strmiska decided to allow the contributing authors to choose whether they would use the term \\"Pagan\\" or \\"Neopagan\\" in reference to the contemporary religious movements, arguing that they should do so according to which term \\"is best suited to their topics.\\"Strmiska 2005. p. 10. Synopsis Strmiska's \\"Comparative Perspectives\\" In his opening chapter, which shares its name with the book, Michael Strmiska discusses the significance of Paganism to the contemporary world, although notes that this volume deals specifically with the movement in Europe and North America, \\"in the belief that this regional focus provides a coherent frame of discussion with a number of intriguing commonalities and contrasts without degenerating into a global encyclopaedia.\\"Strmiska 2005. p. 1. Noting that earlier studies of Pagan studies had focused primarily on the religion of Wicca and on the Pagan movement in the U.S. and U.K., Strmiska explained that in this volume, he had widened the geographical scope by focusing on forms of Paganism other than Wicca and on the movement in other parts of Europe and North America, such as in Canada, Ireland and Iceland.Strmiska 2005. p. 2. Proceeding to look at the various definitions of the terms \\"Pagan\\" and \\"Neopagan\\", Strmiska discusses why some contemporary westerners choose to adopt such terms when they have a pejorative meaning in western culture, concluding that not only was it an \\"appealing marker\\" in expressing their non-Christian beliefs, but that it also served to give them a sense of connection to ancient pre-Christian peoples and as \\"a deliberate act of defiance\\" against a Christian-dominated culture.Strmiska 2005. pp. 4-10. Magliocco's \\"Italian American Stregheria and Wicca\\" The second paper in the volume was provided by the American folklorist Sabina Magliocco, who had studied the Pagan community in the U.S. for a number of years, resulting in the publication of two books, Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work (2002) and Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-paganism in America (2004).Maglicco 2002 and Magliocco 2004.

Considering it to be \\"extremely well written, accessible, and organized\\", Bado-Fralick felt that the work made \\"a delightful addition to the growing body of first-rate scholarship on Contemporary Paganism.\\" Praising the use of maps in the book, she felt however that \\"I found myself wishing for more detailed maps when authors referred to groups from specific counties or regional areas.\\" Ultimately, Bado-Fralick considered the work to be \\"securely placed to become a mainstay of the Pagan scholar's bookshelf.\\"Bado-Fralick 2006. The anthology was also reviewed by Robert Ellwood of the University of Southern California for the Nova Religio journal, who considered it notable that it focused primarily on non-Wiccan variants of Paganism. Considering the work to be a \\"substantial contribution\\" to contemporary religious studies, he notes that the price of the volume will put many individuals off of purchasing it, but that he hoped most major libraries would acquire a copy.Ellwood 2007.

It was first described and named by Canadian lichenologist Irwin Brodo from a population on the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1973.  Description  The thallus (the main body of the lichen) is thick, rough and crusty, taking on the appearance of dry, cracked mud. It is white to pinkish or yellowish-gray in colour, and porous to allow for gas exchange. From a distance, C. maritimum can be seen on the rocks as a white line just above the surface of the water. The outer surface of C.maritimum is scattered with hemispherical nitrogen-fixing structures (cephalodia) that are pinkish to brownish–grey in colour.  Reproduction  As in other lichens, Coccotrema species can reproduce sexually by generating tiny spores. Six to eight spores can be found per ascus (a sac where spores develop). Asci are arranged in two rows with thin, smooth walls; they are initially colourless but become red-brown with age. The asci are stored in the hymenial cavity which is often slightly depressed with a pink or orange tint. Paraphyses (microscopic structures) are long, unbranched, and slender, and can be found lining pores in the hymenial cavity through which spores escape. Coccotrema maritimum lack soredia and isidia (vegetative, or sexual reproductive structures); however, they do possess pycnidia. Pycnidia are located along the summits of long wart-like projections on the surface of the lichen, and are pale red-brown fruiting bodies lined with non-motile spores. When spores are mature an opening appears at the top of these pear-shaped Pycnidia through which these spores are released.  Habitat  Coccotrema maritimum are found on the upper edge of coastal rocks, just above the salt- spray zone. They can extend as far as 700m above the shoreline, and are rarely found on the vertical surfaces of highly exposed rocks. Coccotrema maritimum anchor only to rocky surfaces.  Range  Coccotrema maritimum have a very limited range; they are only seen in coastal British Columbia, Canada. They are abundant in the Queen Charlotte Islands, which are located roughly 80 km off mainland British Columbia, north of Vancouver Island.  Importance to humans  Lichens in general are important bio-indicators as they are highly sensitive to any changes in the environment; this sensitivity is a result of their reliance on atmospheric moisture and nutrients, in combination with their limited ability to rid themselves of toxins. Through observation of their physical appearance and monitoring of their chemical composition lichens are used to indicate the health of environments worldwide. Coccotrema maritimum and other species may be effective indicators of air quality and the effects of oil spills and post spill clean-up. This may be a particularly relevant usage in the Queen Charlotte Islands, as there is an increasing probability of oil and gas development between the Islands and the BC mainland.  Importance to ecosystem  Lichens produce compounds that will chemically degrade rocks thereby aiding in soil formation. The soil formed is then trapped by the lichen and over time, enough accumulates to allow for the growth of additional flora and fauna on these originally bare rock surfaces. Coccotrema maritimum also contains cyanobacteria (in the cephalodia) and are therefore a nitrogen-fixing species. Because cyanobacteria trap nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into a form that is usable by other flora and fauna, the presence of \\"C. maritimum\\" may actually increase nitrogen availability for other plant species. Although many northern lichen species are an important winter food source for many animals, grazers do not appear to consume Coccotrema maritimum.  Conservation  The Queen Charlotte Islands, also known as Gwaii Hannas, are a part of a National Park Reserve. However, Coccotrema maritimum has not yet been assessed by COSEWIC, thus their current conservation status is unknown.

Unlike the dreadnought, the bass register does not dominate. * Alchemist - The Alchemist features distinctive body lines with an OM-style size, a wedge-shaped body (inspired by the innovations of Linda Manzer) a side sound port, extended fretboard, bound fretboard and headstock and Gotoh 510 tuners. * Parlor Guitar - The smaller body size and design of the parlor guitar allows for a balance of frequencies. * Crossover Guitar - A melding of a classical and a steel string guitar, the Crossover has the body and bracing of a Ramirez classical coupled with a radius fret board and a 1-7/8″ nut width. Classical guitars typically have a 2″ to 2-1/4″ nut width and steel string guitars are 1-11/16″ to 1-13/16″. Lichty added a truss rod, a body cutaway and a side sound port (both optional), as well as a K&K; Classic pickup and nylon strings.  Ukuleles  * Tenor Ukulele - A popular choice for performing soloists, the tenor is larger than the concert and soprano size, and therefore produces greater volume and a more complex tone than smaller ukuleles. Its larger size also makes it an easier adaption for guitar players. * Baritone Ukulele - The baritone is the largest of the ukulele sizes and produces the deepest sound. Given its size and tuning (often the same as the bottom four strings of the guitar), it is favored by many guitar players as a cross-over instrument to expand their playing experience.

Service history As cargo ship The wooden-hulled vessel was built in 1918–19 as the Yomachichi by the Oscar Daniels Shipbuilding Company of Tampa, Florida for the United States Shipping Board. Originally fitted with vertical triple expansion steam engines, she was re-equipped with diesel engines in 1926–27. On 11 March 1940 the ship was chartered to the United States Lines by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at Baltimore, Maryland. In United States Navy On 16 September 1943 CinCPac requested a barracks ship to accommodate 50 officers and 800 men for use at an advanced base, and the WSA nominated the motor ship Yomachichi, then under repair at Baltimore, as suitable for the purpose. The ship was accepted by the Navy under a bareboat charter from the WSA on 2 October 1943. Commissioned as Ocelot on 15 January 1944, with Lt. Milton S. Samuels in command, the conversion work was completed on 22 January 1944, but problems with the main engine meant that she did not report for shakedown until early May. Ocelot transited the Panama Canal and, following a brief stop in San Diego, arrived at Pearl Harbor to undergo conversion to flagship for Service Squadron 10. The ship was fitted with extensive radio and visual signaling equipment, with radio and coding rooms in the superstructure, and berths for the squadron commander, staff officers, and enlisted men below. The conversion was completed in October, and Ocelot sailed via Eniwetok for Ulithi where she spent the next six months providing an administrative post at the advanced base. The movement of American forces closer to Japan necessitated advancing support elements as well, and on 24 May 1945 Ocelot shifted to San Pedro Bay, Leyte On 13 September Ocelot again moved, to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. Shortly after her arrival there, on 19 September 1945 Typhoon Ida struck. =Loss and disposal= USS Ocelot (IX-110) aground in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, November 1945. Her stern was cut off when USS Nestor (ARB-6), visible to the right, crashed into her during the storm. Ocelot was involved in a series of collisions with other vessels; the barge YF-1079, the stores ship , the landing ship medium LSM-39, and the victory ship SS Pratt Victory, before she attempted to move into the safer waters of the open sea. However she grounded on a reef, where she was then struck by the merchant ship SS Victor H. Oulanhan. Rapidly taking on water, the crew formed a bucket line, and bailed continuously for six hours. After attempts by tugs to refloat her failed, the ship was abandoned. She was eventually refloated, but on 9 October during Typhoon Louise she was struck by the repair ship , which severed her stern section. Stripped of salvageable items, she was abandoned on 29 October, decommissioned on 6 December, and was struck from the Navy List on 3 January 1946. Ocelot was returned to the custody of the WSA on 5 April 1946 and her hulk was sold by the Maritime Commission, along with seven other wrecks and five civilian liberty ships, to China Merchants and Engineers, Inc. for scrapping on 19 February 1948.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This perennial grass grows in leafy clumps up to 175 centimeters tall. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle with branches upright or pressed parallel to the stem.Achnatherum nelsonii. Grass Manual Treatment. The roots may extend nearly one meter deep into the soil. The grass remains green throughout much of the season, sometimes until the first snowfall. This grass occurs in many types of habitat in western North America. It is a dominant grass in a number of regions, such as shrubsteppe in Colorado and forest and woodland ecosystems in Arizona and New Mexico. In some areas, it is an indicator of climax status in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodland. It indicates true dry grassland in northern Alberta and pristine subalpine habitat on the Wasatch Plateau in Utah. In New Mexico it grows back quickly after wildfire. It tolerates heavy grazing, and is one of the last species to be overgrazed and one of the first to recover when overgrazing stops. Many types of livestock and wildlife feed on the grass, especially when it is immature. As the fruit of the grass develops it becomes hard and pointed and becomes stuck in the mouths and ears of animals; at this point they try to avoid feeding on it.

A mano (Spanish for hand) is a ground stone tool used with a metate to process or grind food by hand.Mano. Merriam- Webster Dictionary. Retrieved December 9, 2011. It is also known by the Nahuatl term metlapil.  History  Manos were used in prehistoric times to process wild seeds, nuts and other food, generally used with greater frequency in the Archaic period, when people became more reliant upon local wild plant food for their diet. Later, manos and metates were used to process cultivated maize.Gibbon, Guy E.; Ames, Kenneth M. (1998) Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. pp. 107, 166. . In its early use in the American Southwest, the mano and metate were used to grind wild plants. The mano began as a one-handed tool and once cultivation of maize became more prevalent, the mano became a larger, two-handed tool that more efficiently ground food against an evolved basin or trough metate.Plog, Stephen. (1997). Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest. London: Thames and Hudson. pp. 68-70. . Besides food, manos and metates were used to separate and pulverize clay from earthen debris and stones. The resulting clay was used for pottery- making.Plog, Stephen. (1997). Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest. London: Thames and Hudson. p. 66. .  Grinding process  Metate and mano. A mano, a smooth hand-held stone, is used against a metate, typically a large stone with a depression or bowl. The movement of the mano against the metate consists of a circular, rocking or chopping grinding motion using one or both hands.Sutteon, Mark Q.; Arkush, Brooke S. (2001). Archaeological Laboratory Methods: An Introduction.] Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. p. 72-75. . Ancient Pueblo People often set up work rooms, called mealing rooms, that were established with sets of manos and metates for mass grinding efforts.Plog, Stephen. (1997).

Blossite was named for mineralogist F. Donald Bloss of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Natural and synthetic occurrence Blossite was first described for an occurrence in the “Y” fumarole in the summit crater of Izalco Volcano, El Salvador. There it occurs with several high-temperature minerals including: stoiberite, fingerite, ziesite, and mcbirneyite. The natural analogues of these compounds crystallize in the CuO-V2O5 binary system first studied by Brisi and Molinari (1958) and were first discovered as synthetic compounds. Blossite is the low temperature polymorph of ziesite, β-Cu2V2O7. All of the blossite crystals identified to date are inter-grown with other fumarolic copper vanadates. The discovered location of these copper vanadates, in the outer sulfate zone of the fumarole, indicates a sublimation temperature between 100 °C and 200 °C. Physical properties Blossite occurs as black anhedral crystals, with dimensions not exceeding 150 um. Crystals of blossite have only been isolated with other fumarolic copper vanadates or sulfates. Blossite demonstrates a red-brown streak, prevalent to the natural copper present, this red-brown coloring is also a prevalent in the internal reflections. No cleavage is observed in blossite, but the size of the natural mineral grains of polycrystalline prohibit the identification of cleavage. In ultraviolet radiation blossite does not fluoresce, it demonstrates a white color when blue-filtered white light in air is present, and is opaque to transmitted light. The density of natural occurring blossite is 4.051 g/cm3. Composition The chemical formula of blossite is, Cu22+V25+O7. Robison et al. conducted quantitative analyses using an ETEC Autoscan microprobe operating at 20kv on a polished sample of blossite-fingerite intergrowth, the results of the oxide weight percentage. Chemical analysis V2O5 53.28%, CuO 46.49% :Total 99.77%; Ideal chemical formula:V2O5 53.34%, CuO 46.66%:Total 100%. Blossite is the only stable phase of the Cu2V5O7 compounds at ambient conditions. The structure A2B2X7, is mostly associated with B= P and V, the B2O7 groups orient and fluctuate size based on the electronic structure of the A cation. Blossite’s atomic structure is formed when three Cu-O bonds are broken during the phase change. The phase transition is of the non-nearest-neighbor reconstructive type, relative high activation energy is required for the phase change. Blossite is also formed when the fumarole temperatures are lower than inversion temperatures of . Crystal structure Blossite is part of the copper vanadates class, the V5+ form a tetrahedral coordination surrounded by oxygen atoms. The VO4 tetrahedra is closely related to thortvetite-group compounds by the formation of [V2O7]4−. The [V2O7] planes lie along [100], the divanadate units are staggered orienting the V-OB-V vector parallel to [120] in one plane and parallel to [120] in the adjacent plane. The independent copper cation in blossite forms as a polyhedral structure coordinated by five oxygen atoms forming an apically elongate square pyramid. The shared edges of CuO5 from chains that lay parallel to [011] and [011], this orientation is common in the three polymorphs of Cu2V2O7. Blossite structure represented in a block form by Krivovichev et al. represents two series of slabs with both lying perpendicular in orientation.

The programme deals with a wide range of topics relating to the Welsh public, and is usually told through the eyes of those at the heart of the story. Up until 1982, HTV Wales' bilingual news department had produced a number of current affairs programmes in both languages including Yr Wythnos, Welshscene and Outlook. Following the creation of S4C, a dedicated Welsh language television channel, HTV formed designated current affairs teams for the first time to produce two programmes - Y Byd ar Bedwar on S4C and Wales This Week on its parent channel. The first edition of Wales This Week was broadcast on 23 September 1982 on HTV Wales.. The first Editor of the programme was Elis Owen, who was at the helm until 1994. It celebrated its 30th year on the air in September 2012 and is currently one of ITV's longest-running current affairs programmes. It has won a number of awards for its investigative journalism and was the first television programme to break the story of child abuse in North Wales Children's Homes during the 1980s. In 2009, Professor Kevin Williams noted that the programme format was changing from that of \\"hard hitting journalism\\" to a format with \\"shorter, more light-hearted and less substantial stories\\" as a result of programme budget cuts by ITV. As of 2017, the programme is presented by Andrea Byrne.

In February 1985 Camarena was kidnapped by drug traffickers in Guadalajara, Mexico. He was interrogated under torture and murdered. Three leaders of the Guadalajara drug cartel were eventually convicted in Mexico for Camarena's murder. The U.S. investigation into Camarena's murder led to three more trials in Los Angeles for other Mexican nationals involved in the crime. The case continues to trouble U.S.-Mexican relations, most recently when one of the three convicted traffickers, Rafael Caro Quintero, was released from Mexican prison in 2013. Early life and career Enrique Camarena was born on July 26, 1947, in Mexicali, Mexico. The family—three brothers and three sisters—immigrated to Calexico, California when Camarena was a child. Camarena's parents divorced when he was young and the family endured considerable poverty after their move. His oldest brother Eduardo joined the Marines and was killed while serving in Vietnam in 1965. His other brother Ernesto had a troubled police record, including drug problems. Despite the family's difficulties, Camarena graduated from Calexico High School in 1966. After graduating from high school, Camarena joined the Marines. Following his discharge in 1970, he returned to Calexico and joined the police department. From regular police work, he moved on to undercover narcotics work as a Special Agent on the Imperial County Narcotic Task Force (ICNTF). After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was established in 1973, it quickly instituted a hiring program for Spanish speaking agents. Both Camarena and his sister Myrna joined the new agency in 1974, Myrna as a secretary and Enrique as a special agent in the DEA's Calexico resident office. In 1977, Camarena transferred to the agency's Fresno field office, where he worked undercover on smuggling activities in the San Joaquin Valley. Author Elaine Shannon describes Camarena as \\"a natural in the theater of the street\\", able to \\"slip effortlessly into a Puerto Rican accent or toss off Mexican gutter slang—whatever the role demanded.\\" Colleagues described him as driven, even by the standards of job-focused DEA agents. In 1980, a colleague and close friend who had moved from Fresno to the DEA resident office in Guadalajara suggested that Camarena also apply for assignment at the office, where a position was open. Foreign assignments were important for job advancement in the DEA and the Guadalajara office was seeing a surge in work, foreshadowing the explosion in drug trafficking of the 1980s. By this time, Camarena was married and had three sons. Guadalajara's spring-like weather and the city's American school and favorable exchange rate convinced Camarena and his family that the move would be good for the family as well.  Mexican background  American anti-narcotic efforts in Mexico long predate the Camarena case. Mexican heroin and marijuana production became a concern to U.S. drug enforcement by the 1960s, but the first major American joint actions with the Mexican government did not begin until the 1970s.  Early anti- narcotic efforts in Mexico  When the French heroin connection was shut down in the early 1970s, Mexico took its place as an important source of American heroin. Mexican marijuana production boomed in the early 1970s as well, and was later a major component of the Guadalajara cartel's production and trafficking. At this point Mexico was not yet a major transshipment point for cocaine, which is produced primarily in the Andean countries of Peru and Bolivia. In response to strong American pressure, and to domestic law enforcement concerns, Mexico began eradication programs of opium and marijuana plantations, with large infusions of U.S. assistance. The first programs were on a smaller scale and used mostly manual eradication, such as \\"Operation Cooperation\\" in 1970. As plantation sizes grew, the eradication efforts also grew. In 1975, Mexican president Luis Echeverría approved \\"Operation Trizo\\", which used aerial surveillance and spraying of herbicides and defoliants from a fleet of dozens of planes and helicopters. The spraying programs required extensive American involvement, both for funding and operations. DEA pilots performed important operational roles; in addition to training Mexican pilots, they helped spot fields for spraying and verified that spraying runs had destroyed targeted fields. As part of the program, DEA was allowed to freely fly Mexican airspace. These flights produced positive results, reducing acreage planted and eventually a reduction in Mexican heroin quality and quantity. Mexican law enforcement on the ground also had some positive results. Alberto Sicilia Falcon, a major trafficker who was one of first to transship cocaine through Mexico, was arrested in 1975. Pedro Aviles, an important Sinaloa trafficker was killed in a shoot-out with Mexican Federal Police in 1978.  DEA personnel abroad  As part of these efforts, the first American narcotics law enforcement office was opened in Mexico City in the mid-1960s by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a branch of the Treasury Department. A Guadalajara office was opened in 1969. These and other offices opened by various agencies remained in place as American drug enforcement agencies first proliferated, then finally merged into the DEA. While the offices were opened with Mexican government permission, they later became controversial, particularly during the Camarena case. DEA agents stationed in Mexico and other countries then and now are also subject to a number of restrictions by the host country. They have no law enforcement powers, instead performing intelligence, liaison, and advisory functions, collecting and passing along information on drug trafficking, and advising on local anti- narcotics programs. In Mexico, although there had been an informal agreement with the Mexican central government that agents could carry personal weapons, it was illegal for foreigners to do so and local officials were free to arrest them for this. DEA agents accredited to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City had full diplomatic status, but agents in the resident offices did not, and could be arrested and imprisoned without any official protections. American law also restricts DEA activities abroad. As a practical result of host country restrictions, DEA policy prohibits agents from doing undercover work abroad. A law known as the Mansfield amendment, introduced by Senator Mike Mansfield and passed by Congress in 1975, prohibited DEA personnel to even be present at the scene of an arrest overseas. It also banned overseas agents from using force, except where lives were threatened. This later complicated DEA efforts in the investigation of Camarena's death.  Camarena in Guadalajara  By the time Camarena took up his post in Guadalajara in the summer of 1980, drug trafficking in Mexico was on the rise. There were several reasons for this. Under Mexican President José López Portillo, the aerial spotting and eradication endorsed by President Echeverría were curtailed, and American participation in these activities was ended in 1978. This made it easier for producers to build the large plantations discovered later in the 1980s and harder to verify that areas identified had actually been sprayed. In addition, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, cocaine trafficking, driven mostly by Colombian smugglers, grew rapidly in the United States and became a primary target of DEA, leaving Mexican enforcement a secondary concern. Finally, during Camarena's four and half years in Guadalajara, major traffickers arose to take the place of the figures arrested and killed in the 1970s. The best- known of these were Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero. These three often coordinated their production and operations, and formed the core of what came to be called the Guadalajara Cartel. All three were eventually found guilty of having participated in Camarena's kidnap and murder.  Resident agent  Many of Camarena's investigations involved the major marijuana plantations that sprang up beginning in the early 1980s. Earlier plantations were usually located in remote mountain areas where they were hard to spot and irrigation did not require drilling wells. Yields were relatively low, quality varied, and transportation was expensive. The new plantations were seeded with an improved variety of marijuana, developed by American cultivators, called \\"sinsemilla\\" (seedless). This more powerful, higher quality variety brought much higher prices in North American markets. The plantations were located in remote desert areas, where transportation was much less expensive. The new plantations faced several problems. Desert production required well drilling for irrigation, and Mexico had strict laws governing well digging, a problem that was eventually solved by massive bribery. It was also easier to spot plantations in the barren deserts; the larger the farm, the easier to spot. With an end to solo American overflights as part of the eradication program, however, money and intimidation allowed farms to grow dramatically without coming to official notice. Prohibited from solo overflights and undercover work, DEA agents in Mexico concentrated on cultivating informants, an often difficult task, especially as informing became more and more dangerous. Camarena, however, excelled at working with informants; Shannon writes that \\"Nobody else in the Guadalajara office could match Kiki's charisma with informants. He had a way of convincing a man to screw up his courage and venture where he never dreamed he would go.\\" Camarena's work with an informant they called \\"Miguel Sanchez\\" led to the first discovery of one of the new style plantations in 1982. \\"Sanchez\\" became friends with the man running the plantation, who told \\"Miguel\\" it was outside a small, isolated town called Vanegas in the state of San Luis Potosi, just across the border from the state of Zacatecas. According to \\"Miguel\\"'s information, the main financier of the plantation was cartel member Juan José Esparragoza Moreno. Camarena and \\"Miguel\\" finally located the plantation in August 1982. Camarena arranged two surreptitious solo overflights to confirm that it was a major plantation. He then briefed Mexican authorities, who raided the plantation in September. To everyone's astonishment, the plantation was over 200 acres large, employing hundreds of growers. The Guadalajara DEA estimated over four thousand tons of sinsemilla marijuana were destroyed in the raid, making it the largest plantation discovered up to that time.  Abduction and murder  In 1984, acting on information from the DEA, 450 Mexican soldiers backed by helicopters destroyed a marijuana plantation in Allende (Chihuahua) with an estimated annual production of $8 billion known as \\"Rancho Búfalo\\".Gorman, Peter. \\"Big- time Smuggler's Blues\\" . Cannabis Culture. Thursday June 15, 2006. Camarena, who was suspected of being the source of the information, was abducted in broad daylight on February 7, 1985, by corrupt Mexican officials working for the major drug traffickers in Mexico. Camarena was taken to a residence located at 881 Lope de Vega in the colonia of Jardines del Bosque, in the western section of the city of Guadalajara, owned by Rafael Caro Quintero,\\"The death house on Lope de Vega\\", MGR - the Mexico Gulf Reporter, 2013 where he was tortured over a 30-hour period and then murdered. His skull was punctured by a metal object, and his ribs were broken.Seper, J. (May 5, 2010). Brutal DEA agent murder reminder of agency priority. Washington Times archive. Retrieved October 16, 2014. Camarena's body was found wrapped in plastic in a rural area outside the small town of La Angostura, in the state of Michoacán, on March 5, 1985.  Investigation  Camarena's torture and murder prompted a swift reaction from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and launched Operation Leyenda (legend), the largest DEA homicide investigation ever undertaken. A special unit was dispatched to coordinate the investigation in Mexico, where government officials were implicated—including Manuel Ibarra Herrera, past director of Mexican Federal Judicial Police, and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, the former director of Interpol in Mexico. The official version said that investigators soon identified Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and his two close associates, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero, as the primary suspects in the kidnapping and that under pressure from the U.S. government, Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid quickly apprehended Carillo and Quintero, but Félix Gallardo still enjoyed political protection.. In July 2020 was released the documentary series The Last Narc where the officer DEA agent Héctor Berrellez leading the investigation alleges that Félix Rodríguez was present when Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena was kidnapped and tortured, and that Félix interrogated Camarena, asking him what he knew about the relation between CIA and the cartel of Guadalajara.https://www.esquire.com/news- politics/a23704/pariah-gary-webb-0998/ Berrelez also explains that when he got this information to DEA Headquarters,the investigation was closed and a CIA member contacted him to advise him to keep silent if he didn't want to end up in a Mexican prison and killed. The documentary points to another agent of the DEA working in Mexico, as a collaborator in the kidnapping. https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/the-last-narc-director-pistol-torture- death-of-dea-agent-kiki-camarena-murder The United States government pursued a lengthy investigation of Camarena's murder. Due to the difficulty of extraditing Mexican citizens, the DEA went as far as to detain two suspects, Humberto Álvarez Machaín, the physician who allegedly prolonged Camarena's life so the torture could continue, and Javier Vásquez Velasco; both were taken by bounty hunters to the United States. Despite vigorous protests from the Mexican government, Álvarez was brought to trial in Los Angeles, in 1992. After the government presented its case, the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict and ordered Álvarez's release. Álvarez subsequently initiated a civil suit against the U.S. government, charging that his arrest had breached the U.S.–Mexico extradition treaty. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that Álvarez was not entitled to relief.Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692 (2004) The four other defendants, Vásquez Velasco, Juan Ramón Matta- Ballesteros, Juan José Bernabé Ramírez, and Rubén Zuno Arce (a brother-in-law of former President Luis Echeverría), were tried and found guilty of Camarena's kidnapping. Zuno had known ties to corrupt Mexican officials, and Mexican officials were implicated in covering up the murder. Mexican police had destroyed evidence on Camarena's body. Legacy In November 1988, TIME magazine featured Camarena on the cover. Camarena received numerous awards while with the DEA, and he posthumously received the Administrator's Award of Honor, the highest award given by the organization. In Fresno, the California Narcotic Officers’ Association (CNOA) hosts a yearly memorial golf tournament named after him and presents an annual scholarship to graduating high school seniors. A school, a library and a street in his home town of Calexico, California, are named after him. Enrique Camarena Junior High School of the Calexico Unified School District opened in 2006. \\\\- see PDF about Kiki Camarena Additionally Enrique Camarena Elementary School in Mission, Texas, of the La Joya Independent School District, is named after him and had its dedication ceremony in 2006. The nationwide annual Red Ribbon Week, which teaches school children and youths to avoid drug use, was established in his memory. In 2004, the Enrique S. Camarena Foundation was established in Camarena's memory. Camarena's wife Mika and son Enrique Jr. serve on the all- volunteer Board of Directors together with former DEA agents, law enforcement personnel, family and friends of Camarena's, and others who share their commitment to alcohol, tobacco and other drug and violence prevention. As part of their ongoing Drug Awareness program, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks awards an annual Enrique Camarena Award at local, state and national levels to a member of law enforcement who carries out anti-drugs work. In 2004, the Calexico Police Department erected a memorial dedicated to Camarena. The memorial is located in the halls of the department, where Camarena served. Several books have been written on the subject. Camarena is the subject of the book ¿O Plata o Plomo? The abduction and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena (2005), by retired DEA Resident Agent in Charge James H. Kuykendall.¿O Plata o Plomo? The abduction and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena. silverorlead.com. Roberto Saviano's non-fiction book Zero Zero Zero (2015) deals in part with Camarena's undercover work and his eventual fate. Lately a Netflix show named NARCOS :Mexico was released in his honor. Personal life Camarena and his wife Mika had three sons.  Media depictions  Drug Wars: The Camarena Story (1990) is a U.S television mini-series about Camarena, starring Treat Williams and Steven Bauer. Heroes Under Fire: Righteous Vendetta (2005) is a History Channel documentary that chronicles the events associated with and features interviews with family members, DEA agents, and others involved in the investigation. In the Netflix drama Narcos, Camarena's death and its aftermath are recapped in news footage in the first season episode \\"The Men of Always\\". The first season of the spin-off series Narcos: Mexico is dedicated entirely to the Camarena story from his arrival to Mexico through his career there and the eventual murder. He is played by American actor Michael Peña. Miss Bala (2011) is a Mexican film that portrays a fictionalized version of \\"Kike Cámara\\"'s murder.

They can use any kind of search, search by keyword, search by concept, search by example,etc.  Introduction  A multimodal search engine is designed to imitate the flexibility and agility of how the human mind works to create, process and refuse irrelevant ideas. So, the more elements you have in the input of the search engine to can compare, the more accurate the results can be. Multimodal search engines use different inputs of different nature and methods of search at the same time with the possibility of combining the results by merging all of the input elements of the search. There are also engines that can use a feedback of the results with the evaluation of the user to perform a more appropriate and relevant search. Schema of a Simple Search Nowadays, mobile devices have been developed to a point that they can perform infinite functions from any place at any time, thanks to the internet and GPS connections. Touch screens, motion sensors and voice recognition are now featured on mobile devices called smartphones. All the features and functions make possible to can execute multimodal searches from any place of the world at any time.  Search elements  The use of text is an option, as well as multimedia searching, image, video, audio, and voice search. Even the location of the user can help the search engine to perform a more effective search, adaptable to every situation. Nowadays, different ways to interact with a search engine are being discovered, in terms of input elements of the search and in the variety of results obtained.  Personal context  Many queries from mobiles are location-based (LBS), that use the location of the user to interact with the applications. If available, the browser uses the device GPS, or computes an approximate location based on cell tower triangulation, with the permission of the user, who must be agree to share his/her location with the application in the download. Therefore, multimodal searches use not only audiovisual content that the user provides directly, but also the context where the user is, like his/her location, language, time at the moment, web site or document where the user is surfing, or other elements that can help to improve of a search in every situation. Example of Contextual Query  Classification of the results  The multimodal search engine works in parallel, whilst at the same time, performs a search of more to less relevance of every element introduced directly or indirectly (personal context). Afterwards, it provides a combination of all the results, merging every element with its associated weight for every descriptor. The engine analyzes every element and tags them, so a comparison of the tags can be made with existent indexed information in databases. A classification of the results proceeds, to show them from more to less relevance. Framework of a Multimodal Search It’s necessary to define the importance of every input element. There are search engines that do this automatically, however there are also engines where the user can do it manually, giving more or less weight to every element of the search. It’s also important that the user provides the appropriate and essential information for the search; too much information can confuse the system and provide unsatisfactory results. With multimodal searches users can get better results than with a simple search, but multimodal searches must process more input information. It can also spend more time to process it and require more memory space. An efficient search engine interprets the query of the users, realizes his/her intention and applies a strategy to use an appropriate search, i.e. the engine adapts to every input query and also to the combination of the elements and methods.  Applications  Nowadays, existing multimodal search engines are not very complex, and some of them are in an experimental phase. Some of the more simple engines are Google Images or Bing , web interfaces that use text and images as inputs to find images in the output. MMRetrieval is a multimodal experimental search engine that uses multilingual and multimedia information through a web interface. The engine searches the different inputs in parallel and merges all the results by different chosen methods. The engine also provides different multistage retrieval, as well as a single text index baseline to be able to compare all the different phases of search. There are a lot of applications for mobile devices, using the context of the user, like based-location services, and using also text, images, audios or videos that the user provides at the moment or with saved files, or even interacting with the voice.

It was made on a budget of 350 million, and was officially launched on 9 December 2011. Principal photography began on 27 April 2012 and lasted until 22 July 2013. The majority of the film was shot in Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, mostly in Ramoji Film City, while two songs were shot in Switzerland and Bangkok. After postponing the release, for multiple times, the film released during the season of the Makar Sankranti festival on 12 January 2014, and received decent feedback from critics. It grossed more than 600 million and collected a distributor share of 471 million, becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2014. This film is partially Remake in Bengali as Gunda:The Terrorist in 2015, directed By ispahani Arif Jahan Starring Bappy, Achol, Amrita, Tanvir & Misha  Plot  Satya and Deepthi are lovers living in Visakhapatnam. A dreaded don, Veeru Bhai, lusts for Deepthi. When Deepthi's parents are killed, she and Satya escape. They board a bus on route to Hyderabad, but the bus is stopped unexpectedly and boarded by three men: Veeru's henchman Deva, Veeru's brother Ajay, and a corrupt police inspector, Shravan. They kill Deepthi in front of Satya, and he suffers an almost-fatal stab wound. Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death after stabbing him. However, Dr. Shailaja saves Satya by giving him a new face and skin. Ten months later, Satya wakes up from his coma. Under the pseudonym of Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Shruti, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Shruti, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a half-constructed apartment (or unconstructed building), where Satya kills Deva. A photo of Deva is discovered by ACP, which has been marked with a \\"1\\". Satya then files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Inspector knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him. During the investigation on Inspector's death, Satya presents himself to ACP as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall in love with Shruti and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pictures, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Shruti in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. Instead, Satya sends copies of the pictures to Veeru, to turn him against both Ajay and Shruti. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Shruti from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay, but Veeru is himself killed by Satya, who reveals his true identity. He apologises to Shruti for using her, before leaving. His vengeance fulfilled, Satya departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a stranger attacks Satya, but is killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Shailaja. When they meet, Shailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan; she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. Charan was a happy-go-lucky rich graduate who hung out with his friends and girlfriend, Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the slum people. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. Charan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, a huge fight ensues. After Charan kills Dharma's henchman, Murugan, Charan tells his inability to kill Sharath as he was his friend. Charan is then stabbed from behind by Dharma, but to Dharma's surprise is still confident. Charan then receives the final and fatal stab from Sharath and dies. Charan's body is sent to Shailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Shailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital. Leaving Shailaja, Satya visits the slum, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. Dharma then tells Satya that even if he dies, he is going to take Satya along with him. He takes a sword and tries to kill Satya, but Satya dodges and Dharma accidentally stabs the corrupt Central Minister. Satya pushes both off the roof. The Minister dies after the fall. However, the mob, which has followed Satya, finally kills Dharma. Afterwards, Manju is shown living in a distant land, mourning Charan's death. The film ends with Satya meeting her.

Raju announced the project officially in early October 2011, as well as announcing that Ram Charan would star as the film's protagonist. The project would be produced under the banner Sri Venkateswara Creations, with the details, including its cast and crew, announced shortly thereafter. Before sharing the script with Charan, Paidipally worked on it for nearly two months, choosing the action genre after having directed family dramas like Brindavanam (2010). Devi Sri Prasad was confirmed as the film's music director in early November 2011, marking his first collaboration with both Paidipally and Charan. The music sittings were held at Goa. The film's production was officially launched on 9 December 2011, in Hyderabad; the film's title was announced as Yevadu and a first look poster was unveiled on the same day. Paidipally based his screenplay from a story written by Vakkantham Vamsi. Anand Sai was the film's art director and completed his work by September 2013. Abburi Ravi contributed to the dialogues. C. Ram Prasad was the film's cinematographer, while Marthand K. Venkatesh was the film's editor.  Casting  Ram Charan was signed as the protagonist in the film in October 2011. Allu Arjun was cast for a crucial cameo appearance along with Kajal, in a role which would bring a twist in the film; the producers wanted an energetic and spirited actor in the part. Samantha Ruth Prabhu was selected to play the female lead to be paired with Charan, and was expected to join the production in October 2012. For the other pairing with Charan, in his alter-ego role, Amy Jackson was selected to play the role of Shruti. This marked her debut in Telugu cinema, and she participated in various workshops to prepare herself for the role before joining the shoot. Jackson revealed that she was afraid to be seen as a glamorous young woman aiming to be an actress; she worked hard to get her diction right and called the workshop an orientation programme to get her used to the Telugu language. For her role, she practised yoga, functional training, and went for jogs in and around Bandra bandstand in Mumbai, before rejoining the film's sets in Hyderabad. Kajal Aggarwal was signed for a cameo appearance and was paired with Arjun. Her inclusion was in doubt due to scheduling conflicts, but she eventually accepted the role, calling it a short and sweet one. Shweta Bhardwaj was approached to perform an item number in early May 2012, which she confirmed the news at the time, but added that although she was approached, she was not officially cast in the film. Scarlett Mellish Wilson was selected for an item number, which was supposed to be her first in Telugu; However the film, Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu, was released earlier, making it her debut. Samantha walked out of the project in mid-November 2012 due to creative differences. She was subsequently replaced by Shruti Haasan, who was reportedly paid a remuneration of 6 million, but her participation was delayed due to scheduling problems. Sai Kumar was signed as the main antagonist. Lyricist Sirivennela Sitaramasastri's second son, Raja, was signed for a supporting role. Arjun's character in the film was reported to be severely injured in a fight and was to be presented as Charan after repeated plastic surgeries to his face. His character's name was revealed as Sathya, and it was speculated that he would be a police officer in the film. Murali Sharma was selected for a supporting role. Shashank and Prabhas Sreenu were seen in cameo roles.  Filming  Principal photography began on 27 April 2012. Ram Charan was involved in two projects simultaneously, Yevadu and Zanjeer (2013). After completing initial filming on Zanjeer, Charan joined the cast and crew of Yevadu on 8 May 2012, to shoot the item number, as well as scenes featuring him, Amy Jackson, and others. After this first phase of production, Charan was scheduled to go back to Bangkok to complete the filming schedule of Zanjeer, before rejoining the Yevadu production on 7 August 2012. Filming continued in Hyderabad until mid-September 2012 after which production moved to Visakhapatnam on 14 September 2012. By early October 2012, 40 percent of the film was completed, consisting mostly of the first half. Shruti Haasan joined the film's sets on 24 January 2013. After a short break, filming recommenced on 5 March 2013, and by the end of the month, 90 percent of the film's speaking sequences were completed. Several action sequences were shot at Ramoji Film City in mid April 2013, under the supervision of Peter Hein. By then, the portions containing Arjun and Aggarwal were almost complete. The film's team left for Switzerland on 20 May 2013, to film a song sequence. Charan and Haasan were on location in Zurich, Switzerland to film one of the songs, which was completed by 27 May 2013. Primary filming recommenced on 29 May 2013, in Hyderabad, with Amy Jackson rejoining the production. The filming was expected to be wrapped up by 20 June 2013. In mid-June 2013, a song featuring Charan was shot at Keesara Stretch, Ramoji Film City. Later, a song choreographed by Shekhar, and featuring Charan and Haasan was shot at Annapurna 7 Acres Studio. Meanwhile, a song featuring Charan and Jackson was shot in Bangkok. The song Freedom which was choreographed by Johnny, was shot in early July 2013 at Ramoji Film City. Principal photography came to an end on 22 July 2013 after the completion of Haasan's scenes. However, in late September 2013, some parts of the film were reportedly re-shot and new scenes were added, in an effort to speed up the pace of the film, after the completion of censor formalities.  Themes and influences  Despite the film's writer, Vamsi, denying it in early June 2013, many critics believed the film was heavily inspired from John Woo's 1997 action film, Face/Off, as well as bearing similarities to the Telugu films Chhatrapati (2005) and Vikramarkudu (2006), both directed by S. S. Rajamouli. While critic Sangeetha Devi Dundoo called the film a combination of Face/Off and Vikramarkudu, another critic, Karthik Pasupulate, wrote, \\"This movie this isn't a rip off of Face/Off. We don't have filmmakers who have the required creativity and technical know how to make half decent adaptation of that 1997 action thriller. The director just borrows the central idea to dish out another silly revenge drama.\\"  Music  Devi Sri Prasad composed the film's soundtrack, which consists of six songs. Ramajogayya Sastry penned the lyrics for two songs, while Sirivennela Sitaramasastri, Chandrabose, Krishna Chaitanya and Sri Mani each wrote the lyrics for one song. Aditya Music acquired the audio rights. The release of the soundtrack was postponed multiple times, due to the delay in the film's release. Later, the audio was officially launched at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad on 27 September 2013 where the star crew of the film attended the launch with Chiranjeevi as the main guest. The audio received positive reviews. The Times of India gave a review stating \\"Devi Sri Prasad has come up with an album that is high on beat and low on melody, but plays to the galleries unabashedly, blending multiple genres. Though there isn't one stand-out song, the album has an overriding happy vibe about it. It isn't a record that you will cherish for long, but might just swing along while it lasts\\" and rated the album 3/5. Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating \\"Devi Sri Prasad has composed some of the youthful and fresh tunes for the soundtracks. Having meaningful lyrics, some of the songs are very melodious and trendy. Devi Sri Prasad has used western instruments as well as rustic beats for them. A couple of songs offer a chance to Ram Charan Teja to show his dancing skills. Like his previous music albums, the composer has played it safe and all his songs are decent and appealing.\\" Track listing  Release  The film was initially slated for a 14 July 2013 release, which was Charan's first wedding anniversary. After few delays, the film's release date was announced as 31 July 2013 to coincide with the fourth anniversary of Ram Charan's 2009 film Magadheera. After several delays, the film was rescheduled to open the same day as Pawan Kalyan's Attarintiki Daredi, but was postponed again to 21 August 2013. The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences. However, due to protests in Seemandhra over the Telangana State formation, the release of both the films were delayed. Raju scheduled the release on either Diwali or Christmas 2013, again postponing the release from 10 October to avoid another release conflict with Attarintiki Daredi. Due to piracy issues, Attarintiki Daredi released on 27 September 2013 which forced Yevadu to enter the theatres as a December release. Dil Raju confirmed that the film's original and Malayalam dubbed version would release simultaneously on 19 December 2013. Regarding the film's release, Dil Raju said \\"I'm planning to release the film on Dec 19 if the Telangana bill is not passed. I haven't decided on postponing the film, but if the bill is passed and it is likely create some agitation, then I plan to release the film during Sankranti next year in January\\". The film finally released on 12 January 2014 as a Sankranthi release clashing with 1: Nenokkadine, Veeram and Jilla at the worldwide box office. Sathyam Cinemas distributed the film in Chennai, where it released in 16 screens. A special paid premier show was held on 11 January 2014 at 9:00 PM and the money made from the premier show was donated to the construction of Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple in Mallepally. Bhadrakali Prasad acquired the film's Tamil dubbing rights under his banner Bhadrakali Films. The Tamil dubbed version was titled Magadheera after the 2009 Telugu film of the same name. The film's dubbing activities commenced in July 2015.  Marketing  The film's posters were designed by Anil and Bhanu of AB Core Design. The first-look poster was unveiled on 24 March 2013, featuring Charan with a rugged look. The first-look teaser of 36 seconds was unveiled on 27 March 2013. The theatrical trailer was launched on 27 September, along with the film's soundtrack, and received a positive response from the audience. The promos for the songs \\"Nee Jathaga Nenundali\\", \\"Oye Oye\\" and \\"Pimple Dimple\\" were released on 10, 25 and 31 October 2013, respectively. The 16 second promo for the song \\"Freedom\\" was unveiled on 31 December 2013, which received positive reviews. Dil Raju started the film's promotional activities 12 days before the film's release, and planned an advertisement campaign on television, newspapers, magazines, and movie portals. Charan released the second trailer of 85 seconds on 3 January 2014, at the Sandhya 70MM theatre in RTC X Roads. Hindustan Unilever became associated with the film by paying 10 million for co-branding activity in terms of hoardings, television, radio, and print. MediaCorp did the marketing tie-ups for the film. The film's official app was launched on 5 January 2014. While promoting the film, Shruti Haasan was admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad, and underwent treatment for suspected food poisoning. The promo of the song \\"Cheliya Cheliya\\" was unveiled on 7 January 2014. The film's crew visited Tirumala Temple on 17 January 2014, and made obeisance to Venkateswara, before interacting with the audience at Group Theatres. A press meet addressing the audience was held at Vijayawada on the next day, with Vamsi, Dil Raju, Sai Kumar, Shashank, L. B. Sriram, Raja and others in attendance. The promo of the song \\"Ayyo Paapam\\" was unveiled on 13 March 2014.  Legal issues  The All India Film Employees Confederation mandated that all regional film productions employ at least 70 per cent local stuntmen. When the Chennai stunt masters, FEFSI Vijayan and Stunt Silva, failed to comply with this mandate, Andhra Pradesh stuntmen obstructed the film's production. K. Nagendra Prasad, a former councillor of Yemmiganur in Kurnool district, lodged a complaint with the police regarding a poster, alleging that it featured an image of a half-nude Amy Jackson. Suits were filed, naming Ram Charan, Amy Jackson, Dil Raju, the film's presenter Anitha, co-producer Sirish, the photographer, and the owner of the Raghavendra theatre which screened the film, citing section 292 of the IPC, as well as section 3 of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act of 1986. Vamsi defended that Jackson's still used in the poster was from a song sequence which had no obscenity in it and called the charges baseless. Justice K. G. Shankar of the High Court stayed the criminal cases on 28 July 2014. Just before the release of Race Gurram (2014), stills of Shruti Haasan from the song Pimple Dimple, taken from obscene angles, were leaked on the internet. Shruti received huge criticism for the photos, while some called it a cheap publicity stunt. Regarding them, she said that those stills were neither pre- approved by the production house or her and were shot during a song shoot and called the leakage a breach of trust. She filed a FIR in Hyderabad. CID began investigation in May 2014. They questioned administrators of the websites which uploaded the photos, and the photographers who reportedly supplied the photos to them. However, it was uncertain whether uploading the photographs, since they were taken in a public place, could be termed as illegal, and sought a legal opinion on how to go about the investigation.  Home media  The film's television rights were acquired by MAA TV for an undisclosed price. The film registered a TRP rating of 10.14 during its television premiere. The television rights of the dubbed Malayalam version, Bhaiyya My Brother, were sold to Mazhavil Manorama for 6.5 million, which was the highest price ever paid for a Telugu film dubbed in Malayalam. The Indian DVD and Blu- ray were marketed by Aditya Videos, and were released in June 2014. Yevadu was also dubbed in Hindi and released in 2015 by Goldmines Telefilms. The television rights for the Hindi version were sold to SET Max.  Reception   Critical response  According to International Business Times India, the film received \\"decent feedback\\" from critics. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu felt that the film was made only for the mass audience. She criticised the film's revenge sequences, calling them \\"non-stop and prolonged\\" but praised Devi Sri Prasad's music and C. Ram Prasad's cinematography. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"For those watching Yevadu, the first half ends quite shockingly as the director tries to wrap up the movie in the first leg itself. It is a treat for Cherry's fans and for others, it's strictly average stuff\\". He felt that the violence, lack of comedy and a predictable turn of events affected the film's narration. IndiaGlitz rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Yevadu has not one but two revenge stories. The first revenge story has not much going for it — perhaps the director deemed it fit not to take it seriously. Followed by this no- brainer, there comes the film's actual story, giving us respite and much- needed entertainment in good measure\\". Sify also rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Yevadu provides novelty in the beginning episodes promising a different commercial film but ends up as a regular revenge drama. Has many clichéd moments but it is also a film that works to some extent. A masala fare\\". Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India was yet another to rate the film 3 out of 5, but he criticised its blatant similarities to Face/Off. He added that the action choreography was \\"undecipherable\\" and called Sai Kumar's character as \\"one of the most over the top villain characters ever\\" adding that he would certainly \\"break the outer limit of human hearing threshold\\". Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment rated the film 3 out of 5 as well, stating, \\"Yevadu is a good action entertainer with all commercial ingredients. Ram Charan Teja is the showman in the film. If you are looking for entertainment without any message, it is good treat for you this Sankrathi\\".

It is located some 69 kilometers south of the capital, Djibouti City, with an elevation of 530 meters above sea level. It is the site of a UNHCR base hosting 12,363 refugees camp as of 2015. It sprawls on a wide basin surrounded by granitic mountains on some sides. The center is run by the UNHCR, and its operations are financed by foreign donors. History The Ali Adde settlement dates back several centuries, and is one of the oldest towns in Djibouti after Tadjoura and Obock. Its place-name literally means \\"the white or clear place\\" in the Afro-Asiatic Somali language. According to an old legend, the present-day territory of Ali Adde was covered by trees, with a wadi crossing the area. Originally a small settlement, the town grew under the reign of the Ifat Sultanate and Adal Sultanate. It later formed a part of the French Somaliland protectorate in the first half of the 20th century. In December 1942, about 1,000 British and French Free troops occupied the town. Ali Adde has an old fort near the Wadi Danan, which was built by the French Army in the 19th century. Overview The town lies on the National Highway 5. Nearby towns and villages include Ali Sabieh, Holhol, Dewele, Assamo and Guisti. Demographics As of 2018, the population of Ali Adde has been estimated to be 3,400. The town inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups, with the Issa Somali predominant. Before the UNHCR camp was opened, the local town population traditionally consisted of nomadic pastoralists, who were mainly camel and goat herders However, since the 1990s, an influx of refugees has dramatically shifted the demographics of the area. Geography Ali Adde is located in a valley in the southern section of the country. The city is situated in a mountainous area, in an enclosed valley of the highlands. It sits at an elevation of 530 meter (1,740 ft) above sea level. One can also take in the local wildlife attracted by the relatively abundant rainfall. Among these are the black-backed jackal, dorcas gazelle, Felis, caracal, birds and the hamadryas baboon. Climate Ali Adde sits at an altitude of above sea level, in low-shrouded mountains and hills. Its weather is characterized by hot and dry summers and mild to cool winters, when most of the precipitation is concentrated (spring and autumn being pleasantly warm transitional seasons). However, due to the town's altitude and inland location, its climate features are the humidity is very low, and temperatures usually fall below at night, which makes summer particularly pleasant compared to coastal cities. Due to its altitude, temperatures are relatively normal for a town located not particularly far from the hottest deserts in the world deserts. The town is known for its normal climate during the summer periods. Between May and early September, the annual high temperature is a high of and a low of . Ali Adde has a Semi-arid climate (BSh) in Köppen-Geiger system.

The ship's 3-pounder saluting guns were removed during the Second World War to allow the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, with two Oerlikons being fitted in March 1941 and a further two fitted in March 1942. The ship's anti-submarine armament was gradually increased during the war, with the number of depth charges carried increasing from 15 to as many as 90. Other wartime changes included the fitting of radar and HF/DF radio direction-finding gear. Service Following commissioning Bideford was sent to the Persian Gulf, serving there from January 1932. Bideford was refitted at Colombo, Ceylon from December 1932 to February 1933 and again from March–April 1934 and from July–August 1936.Hague 1993, p. 33. On 28 August 1936, an Imperial Airways Handley Page H.P.42 airliner went missing on a flight from Basra to Bahrain, and Bideford and sister ship took part in the search for the airliner, which had safely force-landed south of Doha. Bideford underwent another short refit, this time at Bombay, India, from September to November 1937 before returning to the Gulf. In August 1938, Bideford started a more extensive refit at Malta Dockyard, where she was re-armed, this refit continuing until December 1938, when she returned to the Gulf. In May 1939, Bideford transferred to the China Station, based at Hong Kong. Bideford was still part of the China Station on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, continuing to carry out patrols until being ordered to return to Britain in December 1939. On her journey back to home waters, Bideford formed part of the escort of Convoy HGF 14 from Gibraltar to the UK, attacking a suspected submarine contact off Cape Finisterre on 9 January 1940. In February 1940, Bideford joined the 1st Escort Vessel Division of the Western Approaches Command, and was deployed on escorting convoys between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. While escorting one such convoy, the Britain-bound HG 19, on 23 February, Bideford attacked another suspected submarine contact. She attacked another submarine contact on 18 March, while escorting Convoy OG 22F. In May 1940 she took part in the Dunkirk evacuation. On her first evacuation trip, on the evening of 29 May, Bideford was struck by a German bomb, which set off one of Bidefords depth charges, badly damaging the ship, and killing 28, 16 from the ship's crew and 12 passengers. The aft of the ship's stern was blown off and the ship's mainmast collapsed, with Bideford having to be grounded to avoid sinking. The minesweeper took off the surviving troops from Bideford, but despite the damage to the sloop, other troops later boarded Bideford. The towed Bideford back to Dover, the journey taking 32 hours and ending on 31 May.Winser 1999, pp. 19–20, 83. In April 1941 Bideford returned to escorting convoys to and from Gibraltar after completing repairs. In August 1941, Bideford was part of the escort of the Freetown, Sierra Leone-bound Convoy OS.4, which came under attack by U-Boats, with five merchant ships being sunk.Rohwer and Hümmelchen 1992, p. 80. She rescued 63 survivors of the torpedoed on 3 September 1941. On the return journey, Bideford, together with the s and , the corvette and the Free French Aviso , formed the escort for Convoy SL 87 of 11 merchant ships. The convoy came under attack by four U-Boats (, , and ). The escort was ineffective, being inexperienced and short of fuel (having not refuelled at Freetown), and failed to counter-attack against the German submarines. Seven merchant ships were sunk, with no U-boats lost or damaged. The captain of Gorleston, commander of the escort, was heavily criticised for his handling of the convoy, and did not command another escort group.Rohwer and Hümmelchen 1992, p. 87.Blair 2000, pp. 381–383. On 31 October 1942, Bideford rescued 31 survivors from the torpedoed . On 25 August 1943 while serving with the 40th Escort Group in the Bay of Biscay, Bideford was damaged by a Henschel Hs 293 guided missile (failed to explode) launched by a Luftwaffe aircraft, from II.Gruppe/KG 100. After repair, Bideford joined the 41st Escort Group, escorting convoys to Freetown. Bideford survived the war and was scrapped in 1949.

Legislation.gov.uk (1 April 2010). History There is no mention of Chell in the Domesday Book, it is believed to have come under the lands of Wolstanton. The earliest written record of Chell comes from 1212, by which time Chell had already been split into Little and Great Chell. Prior to 1212 the lord of the manor was Adam de Audley. He was succeeded by his son Henry de Audley who in 1212 confirmed in writing his father's decision to award one third of Chell to Robert Blund when giving him a further 14 acres 'in the wood between Chell and Thunstal'.

Allbooks-online.com. There are few records of Little Chell manor after 1344 suggesting it had merged with Great Chell manor. However, the earliest confirmation of this is in 1679 when the Sneyd family, owners of Great Chell Manor, are known to have also taken over Little Chell Manor. The Sneyd family held these manors into the 19th century.Tunstall- Manors. British- history.ac.uk. William Henry Duignan traced the etymology of Chell back to Ceolegh. \\"Ceole\\" meant throat or narrow valley in Old English and Chell is situated at the edge of a ridge of land by a narrow valley.

Chell Heath lies east of both on the eastern flank, separated from Ball Green village by reclaimed spoil from Chatterley Whitfield Colliery. The landscaped spoil heap of the former Chatterley Whitfield mine, viewed across a lake of Whitfield Valley nature reserve. The superficial geology beneath Chell consist of Devensian glacial tills, which overlie the Middle and Upper Pennine Coal Measures; the same sequences of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams as forms the impressive coalfields of Lancashire. There are records of millstone and blackband ironstone being quarried in Chell from at least the 13th century onwards. In 1831–32 Chell provided the stone for Christ Church, Tunstall.Staffordshire Places – Chell . Places.staffspasttrack.org.uk. The main coal producing seam beneath Chell was the Winghay seam. The nearest workings were at Chatterley Whitfield, bordering Chell Heath, which was the first UK mine to produce more than 1 million tons of coal per annum.

Community Profile and Facilities The area is predominantly residential with a good mix of private, council, detached, semi- detached and terraced properties. There is a great deal of open space, with Victoria (Tunstall) Park, Sproson Park, Burslem Golf Course, Spring Bank Recreation Ground and Monks-Neil Park helping distance Chell from the urban area of Stoke-on-Trent to the south and east. To the north and west of Chell the land peters out into the open countryside and heathland of the Staffordshire Moorlands. The area is home to two secondary schools; St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy in Little Chell and James Brindley Science College in Great Chell, which was replaced by Ormiston Horizon Academy in 2011 and relocated to new buildings in 2013.

The Beach Activities such as swimming, diving, water activities, surfing, and sun bathing are all popular at Shoal Beach. The beach is a lovely sandy beach, and the nearby marine reserve in the area offers beach visiters the chance to observe marine life in an unspoiled condition. Dolphins and whales often can be seen in the area. At Shoal Beach is a century old historic woolshed where visiters can learn about the history of the area and see some old farming machinery. Geography Shoal Beach is located at 40°S 176°E on the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Shoal Beach is located at the settlement of Aramoana, Hawke's Bay, which is not to be confused with the coastal settlement of Aramoana, Otago, New Zealand. Shoal Beach is a sandy beach much like other Hawke's Bay beaches such as Ocean Beach and Waipatiki Beach. Residents There are a few coastal beach properties located at Shoal Beach, as there is a coastal subdivision located there. The population of Shoal Beach and Aramoana is low, and there are only a few roads located in the area. However, development in the area is growing with the demand for coastal properties in the Shoal Beach area increasing. Environment The Te Angiangi Marine Reserve covers an area of 446 hectares and extends one nautical mile offshore between Shoal Beach and Blackhead. The Marine Reserve offers the public a wonderful chance to experience an untouched marine natural habitat. School groups, families, and visitors to the area can explore the tidal pools at low tide and dive in the pools within the Marine Reserve so long as no marine life is moved or taken. Scuba diving and snorkelling in the waters within the Te Angiangi Marine Reserve enables the public to enjoy the rich marine life in its natural habitat. The Marine Reserve has an informative board about the many coastal birds in the area. There is a public convenience on the foreshore at Stingray Bay.

The western and eastern box used to calculate SIOD Index are indicated. Water temperatures in the southwestern Southern Indian Ocean are significantly higher than water temperature in the eastern part of South Indian Ocean, off Australia. In this image blue areas are colder than normal, while red areas are warmer than normal. (b)The normalized SIOD index during 1958-2007. The values are normalized by standard deviation of 0.65. Blue line indicates the original time series and the red curve are after applying 1-2-1 smoothing by ten times. The Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole (SIOD) is featured by the oscillation of sea surface temperatures (SST) in which the southwest Indian Ocean i.e. south of Madagascar is warmer and then colder than the eastern part i.e. off Australia.Behera SK, Yamagata T. 2001. Subtropical SST dipole events in the southern Indian Ocean, Geophysical Research Letters 28: 327–330. It was first identified in the studies of the relationship between the SST anomaly and the south-central Africa rainfall anomaly; the existence of such a dipole was identified from both observational studies and model simulationsBehera SK, P.S. Salvekar, and Yamagata T. 2000. Simulation of interannual SST variability in the tropical Indian Ocean, J. Clim, 13, 3487-3499. . The phenomenon Positive phase of Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperature in the southwestern part, south of Madagascar, and colder-than-normal sea surface temperature off Australia, causing above-than-normal precipitation in many regions over south and central Africa. Stronger winds prevail along the eastern edge of the subtropical high, which become intensified and shifted slightly to the south during the positive events, leading to the enhanced evaporation in the eastern Indian Ocean, and therefore result in the cooling SST off Australia. On the other hand, reduced evaporation in the southwestern part causes reduced seasonal latent heat loss, and therefore results in increased temperature in the southwestern part, south of Madagascar. The negative phase of the SIOD is featured by the opposite conditions, with warmer SSTs in the eastern part, and cooler SSTs over the southwestern part. The physical condition favoring negative events is also just opposite. Also, Ekman transport accompanied with surface mixing process also plays a role in the formation of the SST dipole. Generally speaking, the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole mode develops in December–January, peaks in February, then decays in the following two months, and finally dies down in May–June. The evolution and deformation process of the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole event is highly affected by the position of the subtropical high; atmospheric forcing plays a significant role in the evolution process of the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole event. The SIOD and Indian Summer Monsoon Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole related anomalies over the Southeastern Indian Ocean is also suggested to impact the position of Mascarene high and thus the Indian summer monsoon. Positive (negative) Subtropical Indian Ocean dipole events during boreal winter are always followed by weak (strong) Indian Summer Monsoons. During positive (negative) SIOD event, the Mascarene High shifting southeastward (northwestward) from austral to boreal summer causes a weakening (strengthening) of the monsoon circulation system by modulating the local Hadley cell during the Indian Summer Monsoon event.Terray, P., P. Delecluse, S. Labattu, and L. Terray, 2003: Sea surface temperature associations with the late Indian summer monsoon, Clim. Dynamics, 21, 593-618. The SIOD and southwestern Australia rainfall Southwest Australia dry(wet) years are corresponding to anomalously cool(warm) waters in the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean and anomalously warm(cool) waters in the subtropics off Australia, and these appear to be in phase with the large-scale winds over the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean, which modify SST anomalies through anomalous Ekman transport in tropical Indian Ocean and through anomalous air–sea heat fluxes in the subtropics, which also alter the large-scale advection of moisture to the Southwestern Australia coast.England, Matthew H., Caroline C. Ummenhofer and AgusSantoso. 2006: Interannual Rainfall Extremes over Southwest Western Australia Linked to Indian Ocean Climate Variability., Journal of Climate, 19, 1948–1969. The spatial pattern of the dry(wet) composite SSTA shifted to the east of the spatial pattern of the positive(negative) Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole event(previous definition of SIOD), and the calculation based on the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole Index may need re-consideration when the relationship between southwestern Australia rainfall and SIOD index is studied, which may require further work. the connection between Indian Ocean climate condition and (a) dry and (b) wet years over SWWA. SST anomalies are shown in colors. Wind anomalies are indicated as bold arrows, pressure anomalies are shown by H (high) and L (low), and rainfall anomalies are represented by sun/cloud symbols. Dry and wet years are from (England et al. 2006). The SIOD and southeastern Africa rainfall Positive SIOD events also cause increased summer rains over large parts of southeastern Africa by bringing enhanced convergence of moisture. Higher temperature over the Southwestern Indian Ocean warm pole results in increased evaporation, and this moist air is advected to Mozambique and eastern South Africa, which is strengthened by the low pressure anomaly generated over this warm pole.Reason, C. J. C., 2001: Subtropical Indian Ocean SST dipole events and southern African rainfall, Geophys. Res. Lett., 28, 2225-2228, 10.1029/2000GL012735.Xie, P.and P.A.

It has also been suggested that the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole has impacts on the seasonal ocean-atmosphere gas exchanges in the southern Indian Ocean. Also, field experiments indicate that the warm anomalies related to southwestern warm pole are conductive to the reduction of the oceanic carbon dioxide uptake.Jabaud-Jan, A., N. Metzl, C. Brunet, A.

His works include Sampengalu-Sannajajulu i.e., Michelia Champaca and Jasmine flowers), Ketu- Dupliketu (i.e., The mischievous and his duplicate), Pekamukkalu (i.e., The playing cards) and Astipanjaram i.e., The skeleton), Rasavadgita, a pun on Bhagavad Gita), Kadilinche katha (i.e., A moving story). Early life Ramakrishna was born in Tuni in East Godavari district. He worked as a Mathematics and Science teacher there before he did M.A. in English. He had a Ph.D. on George Orwell from Andhra University. Literary career Ramakrishna began his literary career at the age of 17. He authored more than 600 short stories, 15 novels and 4 children's novels. He was known for his wit and humor. Apart from his short stories, he wrote a number of one-act plays, songs and poems for All India Radio and literary magazines, essays on mathematics and science. Avasarala's feature 'Mathe-me-tricks' (మేథ-में-Tricks i.e., tricks to solve Mathematical problems easily) was carried regularly in the children's magazine, Bala Jyothi ( i.e., Light for kids), with a silver jubilee run. This feature posed interesting logical, analytical or mathematical problems every month and the readers would send their answers to win the prize. At the time of his death, he was writing a column called 'Angrezi-Made-Easy' (i.e., English made easy) for a leading Telugu daily. He contributed regularly to book reviews and a feature called Sebhashitaalu (, a pun on Subhashitalu) in the Telugu edition of India Today. According to him, his most satisfying work is Pekamukkalu, a compilation of the short stories published in various magazines over the past 52 years. Personality He described himself in the following four lines. In teaching? Non-stop fun! In writing? Evergreen pun! Even at seventy-one I enjoy being two-in-one! Although he taught English, his writings were in Telugu. His writings reflected his critical views of society and he chose harsh words to describe it according to himself. He was an atheist and wanted people to move from 'foolish faith to pragmatism'. His favorite writers were Ranganayakamma and Volga, both Telugu female writers. Awards He won the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Academy award for his anthology of short stories Ardhamunna Kadhalu ( i.e., Stories with a meaning) in 1969. He was the recipient of \\"Best Writer in Humour\\" award of Sri Potti Sriramulutu Telugu University in 1994 and Delhi Telugu Academy's Ugadi Puraskar in 2000. He was felicitated by the Andhra Sanskriti Sangham, Chandigarh in 2000. Death He underwent a bypass surgery at NIMS, after which he developed complications leading to death. As he wished, his body was donated to the Osmania Medical College for research. He is survived by wife and son.

In 1931 the earthquake struck Napier, reclaiming the Ahuriri lagoon. This freed up land and allowed Westshore to expand as a suburb, as previously a narrow shingle spit was the only land available. The earthquake also transformed the previously dangerous and shingly seashore into a safe and sandy swimming beach.http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=803 Projects such as beach front beautification, landscaping and other improvements have helped to make Westshore one of the most popular and preferred beaches in Napier. The Napier Swimming and Lifesaving Club was amongst the earliest Surf Lifesaving Clubs active in New Zealand, beginning in the 1910s. In October, 1958 the new Surf Section of the Napier Swimming and Lifesaving Club commenced patrols at Westshore Beach which, with improved access, had become the preferred swimming beach for the Napier public.

The 1931 earthquake freed up land which was previously underwater as part of the Ahuriri lagoon, and transformed the once dangerous shingle shore into a safe and sandy beach. Recreational activities popular at Westshore beach include swimming, picnicking and sunbathing.http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=803 The earthquake raised the coastal land around Napier by about two metres. With the land that was made available, housing in Westshore increased, and there are also many motels in the suburb. Reclaimed land also includes the land on which the Hawke's Bay Airport was built. Westshore is one of Napier's most popular beaches. Relative to the steep and shingle beach on the foreshore of Marine Parade, Westshore is the more preferred swimming beach in Napier.

The Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches () was an honorary award () granted by the German president for scholarly or artistic achievements. It was introduced during the Weimar Republic, under President Friedrich Ebert and continued under Nazi Germany. It was a metal disc with a German imperial eagle on a pedestal. It was a high and infrequently awarded honor, received by around 70 people in total. Recipients during the Weimar Republic Article 109, section 3 of the Weimar Constitution entitled \\"Orders and honours may not be given by the state\\" enacted a ban on honorific orders. Nevertheless, there was a desire for the state to be able to confer symbolic honours and the honorific award of the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches was created to meet this desire. It consisted of a 108 mm wide medal of cast bronze, mounted on a bronze pedestal and inscribed on the reverse with an individualised honorific inscription. The designer of the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches was Josef Wackerle. The award was to be given to outstanding individuals in the realms of art, culture, scholarship, science and the economy. The award was made by hand written decree of the President. The Ministry of the Interior made decisions about the honour at the direction of the Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob, who was also responsible for the design. According to Redslob, the form of the eagle expressed the \\"idea of the Reich.\\" In total, the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches was awarded to twenty one people during the period of the Weimar Republic. They were: # Gerhart Hauptmann (15 November 1922) # Paul Wagner (7 March 1923) # Harry Plate (28 August 1925) # Emil Warburg (9 March 1926) # Adolf von Harnack (7 May 1926) # Max Liebermann (20 July 1927) # Max Planck (23 April 1928) # Hans Delbrück (11 November 1928) # Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (22 December 1928) # Wilhelm Kahl (17 June 1929) # Lujo Brentano (18 December 1929) # Oskar von Miller (7 May 1930) # Friedrich Schmidt-Ott (4 June 1930) # Theodor Lewald (18 August 1930) # Georg Dehio (22 November 1930) # Robert Bosch (23 September 1931) # Walter Simons (24 September 1931) # Carl Duisberg (25 September 1931) # Max Sering (18 January 1932) # Ernst Brandes (11 March 1932) # Adolph Goldschmidt (1933)Hans Kauffmann: Adolph Goldschmidt.

He worked for the St. Louis Cardinals in their scouting department from 2003 through 2011, before joining the Astros in December 2011. On January 13, 2020, Luhnow was fired by the Astros after Major League Baseball suspended him for the entire 2020 season as a result of the electronic sign-stealing scandal. Prior to working in baseball, Luhnow was a business entrepreneur. Early life and education Luhnow was born in Mexico City, Mexico, and raised in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood. He is fluent in Spanish. Prior to his birth, his parents had relocated from New York City to Mexico City for business. Luhnow attended schools in Mexico City through 10th grade and a preparatory high school in California for his 11th and 12th-grade years. He graduated from the Webb School of California and holds dual Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in economics and engineering. He earned an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Business career Prior to baseball, Luhnow worked as an engineer, management consultant, and technology entrepreneur. He worked for McKinsey and Company, a global management consulting firm, for five years. He founded and served as president and chief operating officer of Archetype Solutions, and served as general manager and vice president of marketing for Petstore.com. Baseball career St. Louis Cardinals Luhnow joined the front office of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2003. Cardinals owner William DeWitt Jr. had noticed what the Oakland A's had done with their Moneyball tactics and was looking to run his team in a more analytical, data-driven manner when he first hired Luhnow as vice president in 2003. Luhnow knew DeWitt's son-in-law from working at McKinsey & Company and from there, Luhnow met DeWitt and landed the job. Luhnow's hiring initially raised eyebrows, since he had no previous experience in baseball and had not played the sport since high school. He was derided with nicknames like \\"the accountant\\" and \\"Harry Potter.\\" Luhnow began as the Cardinals' vice president of baseball development, as he established a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and extended the Cardinals' scouting in Venezuela. The Cardinals promoted him in 2005 to the role of vice president of player procurement, which made him the director of amateur, international and domestic scouting. He was named vice president of scouting and player development in 2006. During his time with the Cardinals, he developed a reputation for scouting and player development, and he was credited with having a key role in the team's successes in the minor leagues. The Cardinals won five minor league championships under his watch, and had the best system-wide minor league record in 2010. From 2005 to 2007, the first three Cardinals drafts overseen by Luhnow produced 24 future major leaguers, the most of any team during that period. Several players who made important contributions to the Cardinals' victory in the 2011 World Series, including Jaime Garcia, Allen Craig, Jon Jay, and Lance Lynn, were drafted during Luhnow's tenure. Houston Astros The Houston Astros announced Luhnow's hiring as the team's general manager on December 8, 2011, replacing Ed Wade. In making the announcement, team president George Postolos cited Luhnow's past successes in player development and scouting with the Cardinals organization. He also expressed hope that \\"[Luhnow's] bicultural background [would] be an asset in recruiting players from Latin America and developing the Hispanic market for Los Astros.\\" Luhnow \\"was so devoted to efficiency that he engaged consultants from McKinsey to audit the organization (and, inevitably, to disrupt the org chart) every year\\". After Luhnow's first season, he opted to fire Astros' manager Brad Mills, replacing him with Bo Porter after the 2012 season. Porter was forced to keep most of Mills' coaching staff, with third base coach Dave Trembley and hitting coach John Mallee serving as Porter's only additions to the staff for the 2013 season. Luhnow and Porter had a falling out during the 2014 season, leading Luhnow to fire Porter. He chose A. J. Hinch as Porter's successor, and allowed Hinch to choose his coaching staff, with the exception of Brent Strom, the pitching coach, whom the team chose to retain. Luhnow received a contract extension at an undisclosed time in 2014. News of an investigation into potential Cardinals front office personnel hacking into the Astros' baseball operations databases seeking information on player development, evaluation, and compensation broke on June 16, 2015. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"MLB issued a statement saying it has cooperated with the investigation but would take no action until 'the investigative process has been completed by federal law enforcement officials.'\\" On January 13, 2020, Luhnow and Hinch were suspended for the 2020 season by Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, for failing to prevent the Astros from cheating by electronically stealing signs during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. According to Manfred, Luhnow adamantly denied knowing about Astros players banging on a trash can to signal specific pitches, or that employees in the replay room were decoding signs and sending them to the dugout. Manfred stated that while Luhnow didn't know about players' efforts to use technology to steal signs, he should have made it his business to know, given that the general manager is charged with ensuring that the baseball side of a franchise's operations comply with \\"both standards set by Club ownership and MLB Rules.\\" If Luhnow commits another \\"material violation\\" of MLB rules, he will be permanently banned from baseball. Manfred also required Luhnow to undergo \\"management/leadership training\\" during his suspension. It is the longest suspension for a baseball executive since former Atlanta Braves general manager John Coppolella was banned from baseball for life in 2017. According to Manfred, had Luhnow taken \\"adequate steps\\" to ensure the Astros followed the rules, the sign stealing operation could have been shut down as early as Manfred's September 2017 memo reminding all clubs that it was illegal to use electronic equipment to steal signs, and certainly by March 2018, when MLB disciplinarian Joe Torre issued a memo which clarified the ban on using technology to steal signs. As a result of that failure, Manfred decided to hold Luhnow \\"personally responsible for the conduct of his Club.\\" He also harshly criticized the culture of the Astros' baseball operations department, saying that its emphasis on \\"results over other considerations\\" fostered an environment that not only made it possible for the sign stealing to continue for as long as it did, but also allowed Luhnow's assistant, Brandon Taubman, to make inappropriate and sexist remarks to female reporters after the Astros clinched the 2019 pennant. Taubman was fired for lying about the comments, and was subsequently placed on the ineligible list through at least the 2020 season. Manfred later claimed that Luhnow's failure to notify the players about the 2017 memo was a major reason why MLB didn't discipline any players for their roles in the scandal. Manfred told ESPN that had he suspended or fined any players for their roles, the MLB Players Association would have challenged such discipline \\"on the basis that we never properly informed them of the rules.\\" Hours after MLB announced its sanctions, Astros owner Jim Crane fired Luhnow and Hinch. Crane said, \\"Neither of them started this but neither of them did anything about it. Personal life Luhnow and his three children reside in Houston.

The Institute was founded by three American former-athletes. Daryl Hayes (an assistant coach at Shepherd University of West Virginia), Ricardo Dickerson (former football standout at the University of Maryland/Oakland Raiders), and Gregory Hendricks (former professional basketball player/coach) collaborated to bring American football to Nigeria. The three, along with Professional Basketball player and Nigerian National Basketball Team Captain Ejike Ugboaja, found a unique niche for the football while leading basketball camps in Ejike’s homeland of Nigeria. The Ejike Ugboaja Foundation has operated basketball camps for young Nigerian players for many years. With the number of Nigerian descendants currently playing football at the collegiate and professional levels, it seemed a natural fit to begin teaching the sport in Nigeria. The short-term goal of the Institute is to collaborate with eager young players and willing coaches to begin teaching the basics of the sport. The NAIF conducts coaching ‘clinics’ to instruct coaches with the basics of the game. The classrooms and athletic fields of A.B.U. are utilized for instruction. Basic concepts related to rules, filed dimensions, position names, alignments, and timing will provide the groundwork to begin playing. In the long-term, A.B.U. hopes to field an intercollegiate football team to compete against other universities in Africa, and perhaps globally. A.B.U. is also preparing for a Coaching Education ‘Programme of Study’ (similar to an American College Major) related to coaching American Football. The NIAF’s efforts in the United States are centered on fund-raising, collecting football materials, and preparing the curriculum for ABU’s Football Programme of Study. To date, thousands of dollars of donations have been collected. There exists an active attempt to secure long-term support from US citizens interested in spreading football worldwide.

After passing through several cities of the country during his life, he arrived in Brasilia in the 1980s, and there he went through various musical experiences, in addition to making friends with Zélia Duncan. Until the end of the decade, Cássia made numerous presentations in local and music festivals, emphasizing by the serious and powerful vocal tone. In 1988, Cássia moved to São Paulo, where she could achieve greater professional projection. There she met her uncle, Wanderson Clayton, who worked as a producer for the 14 Bis group. He showed him a Beatles song on his guitar, which impressed him. From then on, Wanderson would try to make Cassia the \\"greatest singer in that country,\\" according to his words. Recording Immediately, he put her in a studio owned by a friend. From this first recording came 10 songs in voice and guitar, which would become part of the final repertoire. The bands surprised by the selected composers, the great majority belonging to the independent circuit. There were names like Hermelino Neder, Bocato, Mário Manga and Arrigo Barnabé. During this period Cassia returned to Brasilia, with no hope of success in her endeavor, while Wanderson tried to get money to mix the material in hand. After editing the tape, Wanderson took it to Rio, where PolyGram headquarters were located. There he worked Mayrton Bahia, producer of groups like Legião Urbana and who knew Wanderson of works with the 14 Bis in EMI. After waiting for about six hours, he left the recording for Mayrton and left. When he got home, he got a call from him. When he returned to the office, Mayrton offered a three-disc deal with Cassia. With this, Cássia returned to Rio de Janeiro, and the production process of Cássia Eller began. A band to accompany the singer was assembled (according to Wanderson, the process was complicated by the enormous shyness of Cassia). With the band set up, the rehearsals of the opening ten tracks began in a studio at Cosme Velho. Mayrton, who believed that Cassia was a rough diamond that should not be cut, made a point of letting the musicians take turns and musical decisions. Alongside this, Cássia made her show for the press at the Mistura Fina show house in Ipanema. Wanderson bought her a dress and a high shoe, which she threw away in the first song. In that period, until 1994, when it stopped being produced by the uncle, Cássia wore clothes with style more \\"marginalized\\" and without great preoccupations of style. On the same day, it was reported that Wanderson himself would be the producer of the debut album. At first, PolyGram's claim was that Cassia had a pop repertoire and a better-looking image. Mayrton Bahia, however, believing in the potential of his young and rebellious figure, defended his style against the commercial department. \\"The record company did not believe her, wanted her to have good manners, she was more little girl,\\" says Mayrton. The album counted on the participations of Frejat (that composed \\"Barraco\\") and Peninha, in the percussions. As the musicians of the band had a strong jazz influence, the Baron Red guitarist proposed that they return to the musical origins of the performer, essentially sidewalks in rock. Despite the initial rejection of this idea, it was soon accepted by them. The cover of the album, initially, would be signed by the artist André Peticov, but was not approved by the singer or by his uncle. So, we chose a photo taken at a show in São Paulo, made by Eliane Torino. For the back cover, Peticov gave another idea, this time approved: Cassia would literally kick the bucket. The photo was taken on Barra beach, where the singer spent some time repeating the act. Once the production was over, it was time to set the release. Initially, Globo commissioned the label to release a version of the song Meu Bem, Meu Mal, which would be the opening theme of the eponymous soap opera, released in 1990. The recording, arranged by Cássia's own band, was not approved by the record company or the broadcaster, which considered it out of context. \\"Cássia was yelling,\\" says Wanderson Clayton, who still holds the unreleased recording. To release the album, six music videos were recorded. One, For While, the album's first single and its first hit, was aired on Fantástico in 1990. The other five were shown by the then newly released MTV Brasil in the following months. Initially, all eleven tracks recorded would have music videos, but due to tight budget, the idea had to be abandoned.  Reception  Alvaro Neder of Allmusic says, despite not selling well, it was \\"the aggressiveness of her low voice and the dry arrangements\\" on Eller's debut album that brought her national recognition. The controversial song \\"Rubens\\", expressing ambiguous sexuality, was censored.

During his writing career, he also used the pen names Makar Svirepy, Nikolai Makarov, Sergey Kravtsov, NI chief engineer of the mausoleums, Kamensky and Peter Shortsighted. Early life Nikolay Oleynikov was born in the village of Kamenskaya into a prosperous Cossack family. He graduated from Donetsk College and in 1916 entered the Kamensky Teachers' College. In December 1917 he joined the Red Guards and in March 1918 enlisted in the Red Army, fighting against the Germans and White Cossacks in the Russian Civil War. In 1920 he joined the Russian Communist Party (RKP). He worked on the editorial board of the Red Cossack newspaper, and later moved to Bakhmut where he became the executive secretary of the newspaper Russian Steamshop. With Petrograd writers Mikhail Slonimsky and Evgeny Shvarts, he organized the literary magazine Zaboi (Mine Face) in 1925 in Bakhmut. Career In 1925 Oleynikov received an appointment from the Central Committee of the USSR to the Pravda newspaper in Leningrad, where he also worked as an editor on the magazine New Robinson, created by Samuel Marshak. From 1926-28 he was active in Leningrad magazines, and organized broadcasts for children. In 1928 he was appointed to the Gosizdat, Children's Department of State Publishing House, as editor of the children's magazine Monthly Journal (EF). He also wrote for the children's magazine Hedgehog. From 1926-1937, Oleynikov was active in official duties of staging children's theater with Shostakovich and Schwartz, including Wake Lena (1934), Helen and Grapes (1935) and At Rest (1936). He also wrote humorous but satirical poems like \\"The Carp\\", \\"The Beetle\\" and \\"Cockroach\\". Early in 1937, Oleynikov became editor of Cricket, another children's magazine. During his years in Leningrad, Oleynikov became associated with the avante-garde OBERIU writing group who published in the children's magazines, including the writers Korney Chukovsky, Boris Zhitkov, Mikhail Prishvin, Eugene Schwartz, Vitaly Bianki, Daniil Kharms, Alexander Vvedensky and Nikolai Zabolotsky. He began to privately write ironic verse and parodies which reflected mockery and criticism of the Soviet ideals, counter to his official role as a manufacturer of Party propaganda for children. Some of his early efforts are lost and the first surviving poems include \\"Head\\" (1926), followed by others including \\"Gluttony\\" (1932), \\"In the Art Gallery\\" (1936) and \\"Vulcan and Venus\\" (1937). Only three of these poems were published in Oleynikov's lifetime. In 1934, he published \\"Service Science\\", \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Praise to Inventors\\" in the journal Thirty Days. These were immediately identified as subversive, and he dropped the idea of publishing any others. On 3 July 1937, Oleynikov was arrested as a counter- revolutionary and the editors of the Gosizdat were investigated. After several months of torture, Oleynikov was sentenced to death, was shot in on 24 November 1937 and buried at the Levashovskaya wasteland. His widow received a death certificate from the registry office that listed his death as 5 May 1942 of fever. Posthumous publication Regardless of the light and humorous nature of his work, Oleynikov is considered one of the \\"darkest\\" and \\"most philosophically uncompromising\\" of the Russian avante-garde poets. He was \\"rehabilitated\\" by the Soviets in 1957, and after 1964, more of Oleynikov's poems were published in the USSR as part of articles that professed to ridicule his work. The first exhaustive collection of his poetry was published in 1989. In the summer of 2006, English translations of some of his poetry appeared in the US, published in OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism. In 1997 Ukrainian composer and director Alexey Kolomiytsev wrote a rock opera titled Vivisection based on Oleynikov's poems about animals.

Spread over an area of 27.94 km2, it is one of the spices market in the district of Idukki. The town has a tropical climate with a temperatures ranging from highs of 34.4 °C in the summer to a low of 18.5 °C in the winter, with a healthy rainfall of 3040 mm. Thopramkudy became a village in 1919.  Etymology  The name 'Thopramkudy' might have come from two words, 'thopran' (which is the name of a tribal leader) and 'kudy' (which means colony). It is believed that he was the first man to do cultivation and his place/house came to be known as Thoprankudy and eventually it changed to Thopramkudy. History Most of those farmers who had migrated to Thopramkudy and its environs consisted mainly of Christian believers. In 12 November 1969, a temple dedicated to Shri Dharmasashta was established to serve the spiritual needs of the Hindus. 60 years ago Sree Dharma Sastha Temple (Ayyappa) was established by the Tribals (Anakootil Krishnankutti, Karikallil Kuttan, Kelan Raman (Mannathiparayil), Thandel Kuttappan etc...). From 1959 on, the said temple lay under the protection and jurisdiction of the great association of hill tribals. As for Christian settlers, Kiliyarkadam church served their needs. When people began to migrate in large numbers, the establishment of a church at Thopramkudy became inevitable. The history of Thopramkudy is the story of the fast progress of a densely populated modern day place which was a few years ago a thick uninhabited forest fit only for wild animals. To tell that story is to narrate the saga of the trials and tribulations, sacrifice and hardships, human effort, goodwill, determination, harmony and togetherness of the people of the Thopramkudy area. Transportation Thopramkudy is well connected with other major cities and towns in Idukki district. Alappuzha- Cumbummettu SH 40 is passing through the Thopramkudy town.

An acidophyllic mucopolysaccharide-containing substance was discovered, especially in cochleas, maculas, and crista ampullaris of patients with DFNA9 (a chromosome locus), as well as severe degeneration of vestibular and cochlear sensory axons and dendrites. It is suggested that the mucopolysaccharide deposit could cause strangulation of nerve endings. The maculas and crista ampullaris are what allow for non-visual sensation of head movements. The crista ampullaris resides in the semicircular canals of the inner ear and detects angular acceleration, while the maculas are housed within the vestibule of the inner ear and detect linear acceleration. When affected, these organs can lead to vertigo and nausea because the body would always feel off-balance.

Evans (Jan. 4, 1824 - Dec. 6, 1901), also known as \\"Preacher Dick,\\" or \\"Uncle Dickey,\\" was a Baptist preacher who served in East Tennessee and western North Carolina. Evans was born in Sevier County, Tennessee, the only son of Jacob Evans of South Carolina and Martha Ogle of Tennessee. He died in Sevier County and his remains are interred in Sevier County's Forks of the River Cemetery. Preacher Dick At 16, he was converted by reverends Eli Roberts and William Ogle and joined White Oak Flats Church. That same year, on Jan. 30 of 1840, Evans married Ollief (Olive) Ownby, then 13. The couple would have 12 children. At 20, Evans was licensed to preach by his home church, White Oaks Flat. At 22, he was ordained. Evans had little formal education and was not a trained polemic or skilled debater. He preferred a more direct approach, a \\"running fire\\" teaching of the gospel. He is said to have converted more than 10,000 souls and to have baptized 1,800 converts by his own hand. \\"I fiddle for the Lord!\\" Though Preacher Dick was a resident of East Tennessee, he preached for two years to the Cherokee Indians of Bird Town, North Carolina. He was also known to lead revivals in western North Carolina. On the way to one such revival, accompanied by Russell Ogle, a young man recently called to preach, he came upon a schoolhouse where a crowd had gathered for a dance. Darkness was near and the two were without shelter. Ogle was uncertain. The reverend should not be associated with such sin, he thought. \\"This is the place,\\" Preacher Dick said. \\"We're going to stop here.\\" The two went inside and Preacher Dick made his way to the front of the crowd. The man in charge of the dance asked Preacher Dick if he played the fiddle. Preacher Dick replied he was \\"about the best there is.\\" When it was Preacher Dick's turn to play, he reached into his saddlebag and took out two books — his Bible and his hymnal. \\"This is my fiddle,\\" he said, holding the Bible aloft, \\"and this is my bow. But I fiddle for the Lord!\\" \\"God, the man's a preacher!\\" a man in back yelled. Preacher Dick sang a hymn. The crowd slowly joined in the singing. Then Preacher Dick started preaching. He preached for nearly two hours. When he was finished, 10 people professed their faith in Jesus Christ.

Retrieved 2011-12-09.Thecacera pennigera Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-12-09. Distribution and habitat Thecacera pennigera was described from the south coast of England. It has been reported to have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in temperate waters on either side of the North Atlantic Ocean, in the Mediterranean Sea, around South and West Africa, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Pakistan and more recently in Australia and New Zealand.Rudman, W.B., 1997 (December 19) Thecacera pennigera (Montagu, 1815). [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. There is a significant difference in colouring between Atlantic populations and Pacific specimens which may indicate that this is a complex of several species rather than a single cosmopolitan species. When conditions are suitable, it can occur in considerable numbers, but often it is sporadic or even rare. It is found at depths of down to 36 metres (120 ft) living on arborescent bryozoans. In the N. E. Atlantic (type locality) it feeds exclusively on the bryozoan Bugula plumosa.Picton, B.E. & Morrow, C.C., 2010. Thecacera pennigera (Montagu, 1813). [In] Encyclopedia of Marine Life of Britain and Ireland. These sometimes foul the hulls of vessels and both the bryozoans and the nudibranch have been extending their ranges, presumably travelling by ship. Biology Like other sea slugs, Thecacera pennigera is a hermaphrodite. Packets of sperm are exchanged by mating pairs of slugs and fertilisation is internal. The fertilised eggs are deposited in strings draped across the substrate, usually bryozoans of the genus Bugula, on which the sea slug feeds. It is not clear whether there is a planktonic larval stage or whether juvenile sea slugs hatch direct from the eggs. References * Gofas, S.; Le Renard, J.; Bouchet, P. (2001).

The election's turnout rate was 59%.. One hour before polls closed, 238308/400296=59.53 percent, rounds to 60 percent. However, in June 2012 Kuwait's Constitutional Court declared the elections invalid and reinstated the former parliament. The court said the dissolution of Parliament in December 2011 by Emir Sabah Al-Sabah was unconstitutional.Kuwait court voids election and reinstates parliament BBC News, 20 June 2012 In response, opposition MPs resigned from parliament and demanded a full parliamentary system. After the dissolution of parliament, a new election was set for December 2012. Background Emir Sabah Al-Sabah dissolved the National Assembly of Kuwait on 7 December 2011 citing \\"deteriorating conditions\\" amid an increasingly bitter political showdown over alleged high-level corruption. Major street demonstrations, some with crowds numbering in the tens of thousands, had been occurring with greater and greater frequency, forcing the resignation of the government for the second time in less than a year. A group of former government parliamentarians sued to reverse the dissolution, stating that the act was unconstitutional. In response the decree to set the date for the new election was delayed. The election was eventually set for 21 February. Campaign While operating within the Constitution of Kuwait, opposition candidates are demanding significant reforms, including a constitutional monarchy. Shiite candidate and ex-MP Hussein al-Qallaf accused the opposition of wanting to share power with the ruling family, which he said would lead Kuwait into a state of chaos. Candidates There were 344 candidates, including 24 women, who ran in five constituencies with ten seats each. Opinion polls According to some polls, the opposition may gain as many as 33 seats, up from the 20 seats they held before. Results Liberal bloc won 9 seats. The opposition bloc won 34 out of 50 seats in the parliament. The opposition bloc is a loose coalition of liberals, Islamists, secular nationalists, populists, tribes and a few Shiites. Sunni Islamists and tribes combined won 23 seats.

It is the only fully preserved abbey in the city. The complex includes the former abbey church which is used today as the University Church (Universitätskirche). The remaining former convent buildings house the Museum of Cultural History (Kulturhistorische Museum) for the city of Rostock.  History  The nunnery was founded by the Danish Queen Margaret Sambiria in 1270. According to legend, she founded the abbey in gratitude for a miraculous rescue at sea. She made large donations to the abbey. She died in 1282 and was buried at Doberan Abbey in Bad Doberan which belonged to the Cistercian Order. The abbey gained extensive estates in Rostock and also in the whole of Mecklenburg as a result of donations, endowments and bequests. The nuns came mostly from wealthy families in Rostock. The nunnery was very popular and even had to place restrictions on entry in the 14th century. The abbey church was completed in 1360. The Reformation was accepted into the abbey in 1562 after just thirty years of \\"contemplation time\\" by the nuns in the convent. As a result of the Second Rostock Inheritance Agreement between the city of Rostock and the dukes of Mecklenburg in 1584 the nunnery was turned into a Lutheran damsels' convent (German: Frauenstift). The lives of its conventuals, however, hardly changed at all. The place still resembled a Roman Catholic monastic order. After the Thirty Years' War, however, there were only nine conventuals. In the 19th century, efforts were made to transfer the estate of the nunnery to the state. But it was not until 1920, when the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin constitution was introduced, that the state appropriated all such parastatal entities, such as women's convents. As a result, Mecklenburg-Schwerin's Lutheran church was only allowed to continue legally as an organisation independent of the state. The effect of this was that the nunnery was expropriated by the state without any compensation to the church. On 17 August 1920, the abbey was dissolved, although the remaining conventuals were allowed the right to live there for life. The last abbess died in 1981. The abbey church was renovated both outside and, later, inside from 1997 to 2002. The former convent buildings now house the Cultural History Museum of Rostock.

Construction of the mill was started in 1904 and was completed in 1907. The current owner is the Town of Esterhazy and is run by the Friends of the Flour Mill. The Esterhazy Flour Mill is the only remaining wood-frame construction flour mill in Saskatchewan. The Provincial Heritage Property designation was announced in 2005 and on July 8, 2009 the Esterhazy Flour Mill was designated as a National Historic Site. History Esterhazy Flour Mill, December 2011 The Esterhazy Flour Mill was built by James Saunders during 1904 to 1907. There were many hold-ups in the construction of the Esterhazy Flour Mill due to non-delivery of materials. Milling began on June 18, 1907. James Saunders, of Whitewood, Saskatchewan, was a small operator who serviced consumers in the area that surrounded his mills, by only selling surplus flour for export. Saunders owned mills in both Manitoba and Saskatchewan, including the nearby Whitewood Milling Company in Whitewood, Saskatchewan. The grain was purchased from local producers and produced a local commodity of flour. The mill also generated off-peak business for the area's railroad which ensured year-round rail service to the area. The first manager employed the facility by Saunders was Mr. Snider. Snider left in September 1907 and was replaced by J.A Macdonald for the winter of 1907. W.S. Ford of Whitewood took over as head miller and manager in 1908. The miller from Saunder's Whitewood mill, Frank Size, leased the Esterhazy Flour Mill from Saunders after the Whitewood mill was destroyed by fire in 1909. Frank Size purchased the Esterhazy Flour Mill from James Saunders in 1911 and continued on as head miller. Rudolph Junek purchased the mill in 1939 and operated the facility with assistance from his brother Stanley Junek and Charlie Lake. White flour was the main product produced, by Junek, through the war years, but brown flour was also produced during this time. Junek also advertised, at that time, that farmers could bring in wheat for milling without the quantity being entered in the permit book as long as it was for their own use. Junek converted the mill from steam power to diesel power in 1947. An UD18A International engine was installed, which was able to produce 125 horsepower. The Mill changed ownership a number of times between 1949, with the passing of Rudolph Junek, up until 1979. Joseph Junek, Rudolph's brother purchased it in 1949 after the passing of his brother and operated the mill with help from his brother Stanley Junek and Charlie Lake. In 1959 Junek sold the mill, due to his failing health, to partners John Jurick and Frank Pittner. Pittner's share was soon bought out later that year by John Kacsmar, who operated the mill with Jurick until the fall of 1962. Kacsmar then bought out Jurick's share in the mill. Otto Roseler took over the operations of the mill but Kacsmar helped when needed. The mill was then sold to Kurt Zwolinski of Virden, Manitoba in 1977. Ownership reverted to Roseler when Zwolinski was unable to overcome financial issues. Roseler continued to operate the mill until the spring of 1979 when it was sold to Martin Ritlop. Financial problems also plagued Ritlop and ownership of the mill once again reverted to Roseler. Roseler was the owner of the Esterhazy Flour Mill when he passes away in June 1979. Roseler willed the mill to the Grey Sisters, who operated the Esterhazy Hospital. The Grey Sisters did not take ownership of the mill and Ritlop was able to repurchase the mill. Martin Ritlop was the mill's last owner and operator, owning the mill from 1979 to 1994. Production ceased at the mill in 1980 and the mill sat idle until 1994 when ownership of the mill was transferred to the Town of Esterhazy through tax enforcement. Productivity Productivity of the mill varied depending on the year and the time of the year. The Esterhazy Flour Mill is an example of a mid-sized mill. It was able to process 15 bushels of wheat in one hour, which would create about 600 pounds of flour. Operation at the mill depended on the quality and availability of wheat for milling. Repairs and maintenance were done throughout the summer months in the early years of operation of the mill, and production would resume in the fall with the availability of the new crop. The early years of operation of the mill were quite successful, with 40,000 bushels of wheat ground by the mill by April 1913. Operation of the mill was sporadic during the Depression. Grain was brought in for milling during this time when local grain was of low quality or was not available.Roos, Arnold E. \\"Submission report - place: Esterhazy flour mill, Esterhazy, Saskatchewan\\", Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, November 2007. Milling Process The Esterhazy Flour Mill used a Hungarian-patented roller process for milling the hard spring wheat, which was produced on the prairies at the time. This milling process was state-of-the- art at the time of its installation in 1907. Today The Esterhazy Flour Mill is the only remaining wood-frame construction flour mill in Saskatchewan. The mill is a complete illustration of period flour milling technology as it still contains almost all of the original equipment. Restoration After milling operations ceased no further maintenance was done to the property and the building began to deteriorate. The roof began to leak causing damage to the flooring inside the mill and once the windows had broken it became a nesting site for pigeons. After ownership of the mill was acquired by the Town of Esterhazy an unsuccessful attempt was made to find someone who would reactivate the mill. A feasibility study was proposed in 1995, to determine the costs of putting the mill back into operation. This was later rejected. Due to the poor physical appearance of the facility some citizens of Esterhazy pushed for the demolition of the mill. A demolition order was rescinded by the Town of Esterhazy in February 1996, due to the interest of two parties in the mill facility, Hubert Lacoste, a miller from Quebec, and the Saskatchewan Heritage Branch. A suggestion of producing organic flour was suggested but not realized. The Saskatchewan Heritage Branch pointed out that the Esterhazy Flour Mill was the only one of its kind in Saskatchewan with original equipment still intact and that there was funding available for exterior restoration of the building. A committee called Friends of the Esterhazy Flour Mill was established and a bylaw designated the Esterhazy Flour Mill as Municipal Heritage Property. The committee then set about establishing a list of priorities for the mill, which included: stabilization and repair of the equipment, cleaning the mill, collecting and archiving the documentation concerning the mill, and exterior renovations. A volunteer group set about the initial cleaning of the mill in the summer of 1996. Appropriate restoration knowledge was gathered from the provincial government while seeking heritage status. Restoration was done using appropriate materials and followed the national standards and guidelines of restorative work. Provincial Historic Site Designation The Esterhazy Flour Mill's plaque was officially unveiled on July 30, 2005. The Provincial Heritage Property designation was announced earlier in 2005 but the plaque unveiling was held during Esterhazy's centennial homecoming celebrations. National Historic Site Designation On July 8, 2009 the Esterhazy Flour Mill was designated as a National Historic Site, and is one of 44 National Historic Sites in Saskatchewan. The plaque commemorating the National Historic Site designation was unveiled on September 3, 2011. Mr. Garry Breiktreuz, Member of Parliament for Yorkton-Melville unveiled the plaque on behalf of the Honourable Peter Kent, Canada's Environment Minister and Minister responsible for Parks Canada.

He also founded several nonprofit efforts aimed at helping the impoverished. Cornuelle was featured in a December 1964 Look magazine cover story that called him \\"a former right-wing anarchist who chopped his way out of dark ideology toward a combination of principle and humane concern.\\"Harris, T.

Competing against the federal government's nascent student loan program, Cornuelle's group reinsured bank loans to pay the college tuition of impoverished students. By the fall of 1964, 48,000 students were attending 674 colleges with loans reinsured by the organization. In 1968, Life magazine lauded Cornuelle's Center for Independent Action in Indianapolis, which had trained the \\"unemployable\\" and found them jobs with much greater success than had the federal Job Corps. The Center was also renovating slum housing at a cost local banks had predicted was unachievable.\\"Close-Up: Richard Cornuelle Stirs the Private Sector: Poverty's Free Enterpriser.\\" Life June 28, 1968. pp. 35–50.

Pollster George Gallup later said that this book sparked “the most dramatic shift in American thinking since the New Deal”. Cornuelle refined his ideas in two later books. De-Managing America (1976)Cornuelle, Richard. 1976. De-Managing America.

Due to Petula Clark having reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1965 with \\"Downtown\\" and being afforded a smash follow-up with \\"I Know a Place\\", Connie Francis was eager to work with Clark's main composer and producer Tony Hatch. They met on 26 May 1965 at Philips Studios Stanhope Place in London for a three-song session which yielded a cover version of Connie Smith's 1964 C&W; classic \\"Once a Day\\", the ballad \\"Roundabout\\" (previously recorded by Petula Clark but then unreleased) and the beat number \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\". The session notes indicate two versions of \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\", referred to as \\"US version\\" and \\"UK version\\". Both versions share a very similar orchestral arrangement with only slight differences, but make distinct use of the background vocalists on the song's refrain, the US version featuring the background vocalists singing \\"doo-wop\\" behind Francis' vocal while on the UK version the background vocalists sing- along with Francis. \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" had its original single release serving as B-side to \\"Roundabout\\" in that track's UK single release of 3 September 1965. In the US – where \\"Roundabout\\" had been released with the B-side \\"Bossa Nova Hand Dance\\" – \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" was given an A-side single release in February 1966 to rise to a Billboard Hot 100 peak of #66. In the UK Francis' \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" was given an A-side release in March 1966, two other versions of the song being issued as UK singles that month, the first by Truly Smith (11 March 1966) with a rendition by co-writer Jackie Trent – produced by Tony Hatch – being released 18 March 1966: none of the three versions would reach the UK Top 50. In Canada, Francis' \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" would chart with a #61 peak: in Australia the track would afford Francis her final major hit in that territory with a #31 peak. The Connie Francis single release with \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" as A-side featured as B-side the track \\"I'd Let You Break My Heart All Over Again\\" which Francis had recorded 10 July 1959. In March 1966 Francis recorded a number of non-English renderings of \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\": Despite being largely overlooked in its original English-language version, \\"Love Is Me, Love Is You\\" was recorded in non-English renderings by a number of vocalists:  References  * Feddersen, Jan: Connie Francis, companion book to 5 CD retrospective \\"Lass mir die bunten Träume\\", Bear Family Records BCD 15 786 EI, Hambergen 1994 * Francis, Connie and others: Souvenirs, companion book to 4 CD retrospective \\"Souvenirs\\", Polydor (New York) 1995, Kat.-Nr. 314 533 382-2 * Roberts, Ron: Connie Francis Discography 1955–1975, revised editions 1979 und 1983 * Weize, Richard: Connie Francis, companion book to 8 LP retrospective \\"Connie Francis in Deutschland\\", Bear Family Records BFX 15 305, Hambergen/Vollersode 1988 * Connie Francis discography (Fan Project) Category:Connie Francis songs Category:1966 songs Category:Songs written by Tony Hatch Category:Songs written by Jackie Trent ","title":"Love Is Me, Love Is You"},{"id":"34006192","text":"Pierre Deslongchamps (born 1938 in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Quebec) is a Canadian chemist, and professor at Université de Sherbrooke.

The neighborhood was previously home to such figures as artist Emerson Burkhart, cartoonist Billy Ireland, and judge William Brooks. Established in the early 20th century, Woodland Park has grown from its planned neighborhood roots into a modest neighborhood that contains various faith communities, schools, sources of entertainment and recreation, and borders an extension of the Ohio State University medical center. History The original advertisement for Woodland Park Woodland Park, one of Columbus’ first planned neighborhoods, is named for Woodland Avenue and the Woodland Park Addition. Woodland Park Addition is a subdivision that can be identified as early as 1899. The first homes in the area were built in the mid-1890s. At the center of Woodland Park Addition is Hawthorne Park bounded by Hawthorne Park Road. Development of Woodland Park Addition was limited and located primarily along Long Street and Woodland Ave. An advertisement in the Columbus Dispatch on June 26, 1904 boasted the amenities offered in the neighborhood; \\"We give you paved streets, cement sidewalks, water, gas, sewerage, electric lights, plenty of fine forest trees and one of the best school districts in the city. Woodland Park Addition has the advantage of three electric car lines by which you can reach High Street in fifteen minutes.\\" Throughout the 20th century, owners motivated by racism put restrictions in deeds preventing those of African descent from purchasing homes. However, these restrictions eventually became irrelevant, as wealthy African American professionals and musicians could pay the sellers overwhelming amounts of money for said homes. Wexner Heritage Village can cite its beginnings back to Woodland Park. In an interview conducted by the Columbus Jewish Historical Society, Annette Tanenbaum notes that the Heritage House was located on Woodland Avenue near Long Street. She adds that it was the first facility in Columbus dedicated to taking care of elderly Jewish people. Heritage House was built in 1951. Today the Wexner Heritage Village continues to provide elderly care to people in the Jewish community. Geography Woodland Park is located within the Near East Side of Columbus, Ohio. It is a centrally located neighborhood and two miles away from Downtown Columbus. It is also under the jurisdiction of the Near East Side Area Commission. The boundaries of the Woodland Park Addition are Clifton Avenue to the north, Long Street to the south, Woodland Avenue to the east and Parkwood Avenue (formerly Mulberry Street) to the west. Over time, recognized boundaries of the neighborhood expanded, and the modern boundaries are I-670 or Maryland Avenue to the North, Broad Street to the south, the Norfolk and Western Railroad to the east, and Taylor Avenue to the west. Woodland Park is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Shepard to the north, Franklin Park to the south, Eastgate to the east, and King-Lincoln Bronzeville and Mount Vernon to the west. Portions of Woodland Park also overlap with Eastwood Heights. Landmarks The \\"Martin Luther King\\" branch of the Columbus library on E. Long Street Woodland Park includes a stretch of Broad Street that is included in the East Broad Street Historic District. East Broad Street contains multiple structures that were constructed in the early 1900s, with 88% being residential in nature. These structures represent the height of Broad Street's development. Other landmarks include the following: * East High School * The Mansion Day School * Park Towers * Emerson Burkhart Home * Franklin Park Conservatory * Martin Luther King Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library * Eldon and Elsie Ward YMCA Transportation COTA is one of many ways to get through the city of Columbus. Woodland Park's southern boundary, Broad Street, is notable because of its history as the National Road. Woodland Park’s eastern boundary, the Norfolk and Southern Railroad, is notable as well. Originally constructed as the Scioto Valley Railroad, and later operated as the Ohio Subdivision of the Norfolk and Southern Railroad. The railroad terminated about a mile and a half, or less, north of Fifth Avenue in the modern day Americrest neighborhood. The neighborhood once had a streetcar line that connected it with downtown. The streetcar went east-to-west along Long Street, and turned north-to-south to connect Long to Broad Street, and to the north side of Franklin Park. The Streetcar began service prior to 1905 in ceased operations shortly after 1940. Additionally, there are 10 Central Ohio Transit Authority, or COTA, bus stops in the neighborhood with access to the No. 6, the \\"Sullivant\\" route, and No. 10, the \\"East Broad Street” route. Other COTA routes include the No. 16 and No. 81 routes. Residential A bed and breakfast in Woodland Park Demographics Demographically, the primary residents of Woodland Park are African Americans with the second most residents classifying themselves as White. Median household income in Woodland Park is slightly below the median income of Columbus, measuring at $24,568 in 2011. Accordingly, median rent in the neighborhood measured at $456 per month in 2011 also. The median age of men and women in Woodland Park is 35, with an average of 2.1 people per household. Architecture The residential area of Woodland Park can be described as a variety of houses with different architecture styles. It is made up of large homes and mansions, town-homes, bungalows, and apartments. Architecture styles of Woodland Park homes range from Queen Anne, Tudor, Greek Revival, Cape Cod, Colonial Revival and Dutch Colonial styles. Woodland Park is home to a Lustron Home that was built in 1950 at 1818 East Long Street. The home is a Westchester Deluxe model. The Lustron Corporation of Columbus built these prefabricated homes after World War II to meet housing shortages. =Park Towers= Park Towers is a collection of condominiums found at 1620 East Broad Street in the Woodland Park neighborhood. The structure was built in the early 1960s. Park Towers includes office suites on the first floor and 141 private residences available for purchase on the remaining floors. Common areas of the Park Towers building include a lobby, exercise facility, and community garden for residents. =Emerson Burkhart home= Artist Emerson Burkhart moved to Woodland Park in the mid 20th century and resided at 223 Woodland Avenue until his death in 1969. Annually Burkhart opened his Woodland Avenue home to the public for an open house art show. Thousands of people visited the 22 room home to view the artist's pieces and his home. Religion The largely residential neighborhood boasts several churches, including the Saint Phillip Lutheran Church, Ashbury United Methodist Church, United House of Prayer, and the Jerusalem Tabernacle Baptist Church. The St. Philip Episcopal Church held its first service in 1891 on the corner of Cleveland Avenue and Naughten Street in downtown Columbus, Ohio. In 1962 the church was relocated to Woodland Park at 166 Woodland Ave. The church continues to congregate in Woodland Park. In addition to serving its community in a religious role, Woodland Christian Church serves the community in a political role. The church's website claims that it values justice and provides residents such resources as the opportunity to register to vote, election information, and encourages political organization through its Political Action Team. Education The Mansion Day School The Mansion Day School What is today known as The Mansion Day School was originally a mansion built by William A. Miller in 1904. The structure, known as Miller's \\"statement house\\" has 24 rooms with 15 fireplaces and includes imported Italian tile and mahogany. William A. Miller was the president of the H.C. Godman shoe company, which had four factories in Columbus, Ohio and four factories in Lancaster, Ohio. The H.C. Godman shoe company had up to 3,000 employees at the time of William A. Miller's death in 1921. William A. Miller's wife Anna was a philanthropist and opened the third floor of their home to homeless children. In 1934 the structure was purchased by the Glenmont Home for Christian Scientists and turned into a nursing home. The structure has operated for 2 decades as The Mansion Day School. The elementary school is headed by executive director Dee James and serves students from across greater the greater Columbus, Ohio area, including the cities of Gahanna, Pickerington, and Dublin. The school is unique because it features a competitive application for admittance. Some of the many purposes the school has in its mission statement is its commitment to \\"Celebrating excellence and cultivating a personal commitment to learning, developing the confidence to lead, compete in, and contribute successfully to a global community, and developing critical and creative thinking skills\\" East High School Woodland Park is also home to East High School, a historic public school located at 1500 East Broad Street that is part of Columbus City Schools. Architects Howell and Thomas designed the original school which was built in 1922. East High School was one of five high schools built in accordance with the Smith-Hughes Act whose purpose was to provide federal funding to communities and expand educational opportunities. The school is notable for its connection to the African American population of Columbus and the various famous students that graduated from there, including actor Philip Michael Thomas and athlete and actor Bernie Casey. Today, the school is led by principal Ernest C Wood, Jr. and teaches from the 9th-12th grade. East High School prides itself in offering a college preparatory curriculum and claims that over $3.5 million worth of scholarships were awarded to the graduating class of 2013. Various clubs offered by East High School include a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Club, National Honor Society, a poetry slam, and marching band and drill team. Entertainment and recreation The Eldon and Elsie Ward YMCA is located on Woodland Ave. Franklin Park Conservatory The Franklin Park Conservatory is located just south of Woodland Park, on the south side of Broad Street. The greenhouse, now known as the Palm House, was inspired by the architecture of the Chicago World's Fair and Columbian Exposition and the City Beautiful movement. Franklin Park Conservatory opened to the public in 1895 and in addition to the greenhouse provided the public with carriage paths, a lake, and a boathouse. The park was run by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department until 1989 when ownership was transferred to a 10 member board of trustees and executive director Columbus Metropolitan Library Woodland Park is also home to a branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library. The \\"Martin Luther King\\" branch located on E. Long Street offers programming such as a TedX club, where teenagers can work with students from the Ohio State University to come up with inspirational speeches based on their own life experiences. Other programs include reading workshops to help children develop reading comprehension skills outside of the regular classroom. Daily programs include homework help for children in school and job searching advice for older individuals. Eldon and Elsie Ward YMCA Originally known as the Spring Street YMCA, The Eldon and Elsie Ward YMCA was founded in 1919. It was one of the first YMCAs in the United States that was principally designated to serve a black community. In 1962, the YMCA moved to the Woodland Avenue location where it presently sits and was renamed the East Side YMCA. In 1997 it again underwent a name change and was named the Eldon and Elsie Ward YMCA to honor their lifelong support of the Columbus community. Eldon Ward was most well known as the head of the E.E. Ward Moving and Transit Company, but he was also a Sunday school teacher and leader in the community. Today, the YMCA named after the late couple offers community members recreational classes as well as facilities such as a gymnasium and a pool. The YMCA of Central Ohio cites part of its key tenants as \\"youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility\\".

Before that, she wrote several radio quiz shows, including Take It or Leave It: the $64 Question, which she also produced. She is best known for her coverage of, and support for, Off-Broadway theater. In 1996 she was presented with the Lucille Lortel award for “Lifetime Dedication to Off-Broadway” by the Off-Broadway League. Oliver was a staunch supporter of emerging playwrights. She spent 20 summers (1975–1995) advising playwrights on their works-in- process in her role as a dramaturge at the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. The Conference’s founder, George White, described her this way, \\"She was packaged like the quintessential elderly lady that a Boy Scout would help across the street, except that she drank martinis, smoked cigarettes and could, on occasion, have a mouth like a sailor. She could be tough and would brook no banality, but she truly loved playwrights and loved the theater.\\"Edith Oliver, 84, Drama Critic At New Yorker for 31 Years, The New York Times, Feb. 25, 1998;  Early life and career  Edith Oliver (née Goldsmith) was born in New York City in 1913, to Sam Goldsmith (a wool broker) and his wife Maude Goldsmith. She described her family (which included a younger brother, Robert) as “stage struck.” She attended Smith College but did not graduate. She studied acting privately with the famous English actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell and worked as an apprentice at the Stockbridge Playhouse in Stockbridge, MA.Edith Oliver: One on the Aisle obituary, Whitney Balliett, The New Yorker, March 3, 1998 She was a fan of the novelist, poet and playwright Oliver Goldsmith, and began using the name Edith Oliver, first as a nom de plume at Smith and then as a stage name in her early 20s. She went by Oliver for the rest of her life. An aspiring stage actress, she landed small parts in radio plays that included Gangbusters, Crime Doctor and the Philip Morris Playhouse. In 1937 she began writing questions for the radio quiz show “True or False?”. In 1940 she began writing for “Take It or Leave It: The $64 Question,” for CBS radio and then NBC.Edith Oliver, Longtime New Yorker Critic, Dies at 84, Playbill, February 25, 1998, Paller, Rebecca She later became the producer of the program.  Theater critic at the New Yorker magazine Oliver began working part-time for The New Yorker magazine in 1947, as a nonfiction reader and editor in the book review department, while continuing one day a week as a casting director for the Biow [advertising] Agency. During the 1950s, she wrote short pieces and book reviews for the magazine that ran without a by-line, as was customary.New Yorker\\" archives In 1961 she officially joined the staff. She reviewed movies for five years, and then theater for 32 years—mostly off-Broadway, but sometimes Broadway as well—while continuing to run the magazine’s book department. Unlike many other New Yorker writers, she did not write profiles, publish anthologies of her reviews, or write other books. Known for her “toughness and her love of theater”“Edith Oliver”, obituary; Variety, March 9, 1998. Oliver came to be “among the most influential voices covering off Broadway theater.”\\"New York Times\\", Feb. 25, 1998, op.cit. She was “an astute and open minded reviewer who was the first to recognize and champion such playwrights as David Mamet, Christopher Durang, and Wendy Wasserstein.”\\"Oxford Companion to the American Theatre\\"; Oliver, Edith; Playwright Thornton Wilder wrote to her, “Your immense usefulness did not proceed from your ‘championing’ the new theater, beating the drum, ‘torch-bearing’, but simply from your writing so well, -- quietly, firmly, faithfully reporting what you saw. There is no persuasion equal to that fidelity.”Letter dated December 14, 1942, from Thornton Wilder to Edith Oliver; Private collection of the Robert Goldsmith family. Playwright Edward Albee said of her: “She was tough, she was honest, and she didn't write her reviews before she saw the play. She had an agenda—all critics have an agenda—but hers was really quite simple, I think. If you were any good at all as a playwright, if you were honest, if you were tough, and you realized that a play had to be more than decorative, and have something to say, not matter how badly you said it, she was on your side.... Woe onto you if you consciously did less than she knew you were capable of.”Edith Oliver Memorial Service, May 17, 1998, New York, N.Y. She tried to be kind to actors: “I have the greatest sympathy for actors and their problems,” she once told an interviewer. “They don’t need me to add to their burden.”  A time of change and growth in American theater  In the 1960s and ‘70s theatrical experimentation was burgeoning. Oliver was an astute witness and commentator. According to Lloyd Richards, former Artistic Director of the O’Neill Playwrights Conference: “Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway were finding out what they were by doing what they did. And Edith Oliver was there helping to define them, through caring, through being there when few others came, by writing about them and revealing themselves to themselves. Her words helped to shape the Off Broadway Movement.\\" By covering theatrical companies like the Negro Ensemble Company, Café La Mama and the New Federal Theater, she provided them with visibility and support they would not have had otherwise. “Off Broadway was the love of my life,” she said. “I was young enough to be all over town, four or five nights a week. The thrill was Harlem in the 60’s... “  Awards, honors and memorials  * 1994.

They number around 75,000 to 80,000.Georgians in IsraelCensus of Georgians in Israel History Ottoman period The Georgian Jews have traditionally lived separately, not only from the surrounding Georgian people, but also from the Ashkenazi Jews in Tbilisi, who had different practices and language. Beginning in 1863, groups of Jews began making aliyah, mostly for religious reasons. By 1916, 439 Georgian Jews lived in Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, mostly in Jerusalem city near the Damascus Gate. Most Georgian Jews who made aliyah were poor and worked as freight-handlers in Jerusalem. Israeli period After the Six-Day War, huge numbers of Soviet Jews began protesting for the right to immigrate to Israel, and many applied for exit visas. Georgian Jews made up a large percentage of this number. They were among the very first to begin protesting, and were among the most militant of campaigners. In August 1969, eighteen families wrote to the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations demanding permission to make aliyah. This was the first public insistence by Soviet Jews for immigration to Israel. The Israeli government and the Jewish world campaigned heavily on behalf of the plight of the Soviet Jewry. In July 1971, a group of Georgian Jews went on a hunger strike outside a Moscow post office. The determination of Soviet Jewish activists and international pressure led the Soviets to lessen their harsh anti-Jewish policies. During the 1970s, the Soviets permitted limited Jewish emigration to Israel, and about 30,000 Georgian Jews made aliyah, with thousands of others leaving for other countries. Approximately 17% of the Soviet Jewish population emigrated at this time. In 1979, the Jewish population in Georgia was 28,300 and, by 1989, it had decreased to 24,800. Thus, the community, which had numbered about 80,000 as recently as the 1970s, largely emigrated to Israel. While most Soviet Jewish emigration was individual, Georgian Jewish emigration was communal. Due to Georgian Jewish traditions of strong, extended families and the strict, patriarchal nature of Georgian Jewish families, Georgian Jews immigrated as whole communities, with emigration of individuals causing a chain reaction leading to more emigration, and brought their community structures with them. For example, nearly the entire Jewish population of at least two Georgian towns made aliyah. At the time the emigration started, Israel had a policy of scattering the population around the country, and was experiencing a housing shortage, with the result that Georgian Jews were assigned housing in different parts of the country. The Georgian Jews began demanding that they be concentrated together, and the crisis reached a fever pitch when several families threatened to return to Georgia, and new immigrants, forewarned by predecessors, began demanding to be placed in specific areas upon arrival. Although Prime Minister Golda Meir criticized the Georgian Jews' desire to \\"isolate themselves into ghettos\\", the Israeli Immigrant Absorption Ministry eventually bowed to their demands, and began to create concentrations of around 200 families in twelve areas of the country. In Israel, Georgian Jewish immigrants successfully integrated into society, but faced certain problems. Georgian Jewish immigrants were usually able to find jobs with ease, and often worked in light industry jobs, such as dock workers, porters, and construction workers, but faced certain issues. One major issue was religion; the Georgian Jews were often devout and had fiercely clung to their traditions in the Soviet Union, and were stunned to discover that Israeli Jews were mostly secular. As a result, Georgian Jewish immigrants demanded their own separate synagogues to continue their unique religious traditions, which the government agreed to, and enrolled their children in religious schools rather than regular schools.Michael Curtis, Mordecai S. Chertoff: Israel: Social Structure and Change. In Israel, most Georgian Jews settled near the coast in cities such as Lod, Bat Yam, Ashdod, Holon and Rehovot. There are Georgian Jews in Jerusalem as well, with several prominent synagogues.

She has enjoyed singing and making sweets since she was a child, despite the fact that she seems to be quite inept as a cook in general. She is easily excited and a bit clumsy, admitting herself that she usually falls down somehow at least once a day. However, Haruka remains positive and keeps a strong resolve, always working the hardest to make the Producer happy. Even though her character image color is red, Haruka actually tends to be more partial toward the color pink (which is Iori's image color). Apart from her dream of becoming a popular idol, she's very grounded in her roots and is comfortable just having work in general, as well as spending time with her fellow idols. Haruka is close to the other idols, but she is the closest to Chihaya Kisaragi, whom she helps to overcome her past. ; : : Cool and serious, Chihaya has the greatest enthusiasm towards music and the greatest natural talent of all of the girls, earnestly believing that if she were no longer able to sing, she would rather die. She does not very much care for the title \\"idol\\" though, and prefers to refer to herself as a \\"vocalist\\" instead. Chihaya enjoys listening to classical music, along with spending time by herself, giving an aura of maturity about her, though she is really just awkward when it comes to communicating with other people. Despite her age, she has the smallest bust out of all of the characters which makes her feel envious at times when she sees other members with a bigger bust such as Takane and Azusa during their beach trip. Chihaya has a tragic past due to the death of her younger brother in a car accident eight years ago, which lead her to blame herself for what happened. This also lead to her parents divorcing and driving a wedge between her and her parents. She overcomes her past thanks to her friends, and after that, she is more expressive and cheerful. Chihaya is Haruka Amami's best friend. ; : : A terrible crybaby, Yukiho aspires to become an idol in order to one day shed her cowardly disposition. She is afraid of dogs (even chihuahuas seem threatening to her) and also does not do well with boys. Having grown up in a strict, traditional Japanese household, Yukiho's drink of choice is tea, predominantly green tea. Among her hobbies is writing poetry (mostly haikus), but she is usually too shy to even share her poems with anyone. Though her image color is White, she tends to be partial to the color \\"Baby Blue\\". Whenever she is depressed or scared, she has a habit of running off exclaiming she will go \\"dig a hole and bury herself in it,\\" she grabs a shovel and digs a hole with the others telling her to stop. She is Makoto Kikuchi's best friend since childhood, with whom Yukiho successfully complementing the opposite personalities of each other. ; : : Yayoi is a bright and cheerful girl who cares for her family very much. Due to her father's unstable occupational status, her family is actually quite poor, as indicated by Yayoi's plain clothing, which she has actually had for a very long time. To earn extra money, Yayoi often does cleaning and other odd jobs around the 765 Production building, and continues to do so even after she debuts as an idol. She is endlessly energetic, however, and never lets the weight of the world discourage her. Yayoi is the oldest of six siblings and always has to be the one to look after them, but also wishes that she had an \\"older brother\\" type around to look after her. Yayoi is very close to Iori despite their different backgrounds. ; : : The cool, smart-girl type, Ritsuko believes in theory more than her own inner strength. Originally an intern working at 765 Production after graduating from high school, due to a lack of girls scouted by 765 Production, Ritsuko became an idol herself. Ritsuko's family consists of herself, her mother, and her father. Her parents share the same trait as Ritsuko: being business-like and hardworking. They own a shop in the city. Despite being an idol, she still has one hand in the business side of her own celebrity, and is quick to chide the Producer if she thinks he is not doing his job correctly. : In The Idolmaster 2, Ritsuko becomes the producer for the idol group Ryūgū Komachi and ties her hair up. She'll tie her hair in pigtails again when using a Ryūgū Komachi costume in the game. In the anime, she was a former idol before becoming a producer for 765 Production, and ties her hair in pigtails for the concert in episode 18. ; : : The oldest amongst all idols in the game, Azusa's personality reflects that of a kind- hearted but air-headed \\"big sister\\" type. She has a very easy going and carefree personality, though also an incredibly terrible sense of direction, and while walking her dog will occasionally end up in strange, distant places with nary a clue of how she got there, or how to get back. Her air headed personality is shown when she 'assumed' that Hibiki's hamster is a valuable thing and attempts to put it inside a safe to safeguard it during the beach trip. as Azusa also enjoys giving and reading fortunes, and has a firm belief that she will one day fall in love with her \\"destined someone\\". One of her motivations for becoming an idol, in fact, is to someday find her true love. : In The Idolmaster 2, Azusa cuts her hair short (which was originally long) and makes an idol group with Iori and Ami called Ryūgū Komachi. In the anime, Azusa still retains her long hairstyle but later cuts her hair short after she joins Ryūgū Komachi. ; : : The daughter of one of the associates of the 765 Production president, Iori is a spoiled rich girl who flaunts her family's wealth. Although she is quite polite and refined on stage and in public, when with the Producer and other girls she has a very sharp tongue, and is quick to berate other people's intelligence, especially the Producer's. Probably due to having two older brothers, Iori has grown up with a deep complex of hating to lose, and thus rarely shows any weaknesses. She does have a much softer side that she shows from time to time, making her personality that of a perfect tsundere character. She is sometimes seen carrying around a stuffed rabbit with her, which she named \\"Usa-chan\\" (also known as \\"Charles Donatello the 18th\\" in the anime). Though very rich and spoiled, her best friend is Yayoi, who is much poorer than her. : In The Idolmaster 2, Iori makes an idol group with Ami and Azusa called Ryūgū Komachi. She also changes her hairstyle, leaving a bang of hair out of her hairband. ; : : Makoto is popularized as the \\"pretty-boy idol\\" within 765 Production and, as such, she has accumulated more female than male fans, becoming the cause of her psychological complex and constant running gag in the plot. She is usually seen in sporty outfits and was already rather popular among her fellow students at the all-girls school she attends, and her current work as an idol does not make the situation any easier for her. Her father is a famous race-car driver and wished for a son instead, so he raised Makoto as a boy. Even though she is not ungrateful of her popularity, underneath her gruff, boyish exterior, Makoto is actually an honest, sensitive girl, and wishes to make herself more feminine. Therefore, unbeknownst to her father, she decided to become an idol in order to find a way to a new, more feminine presence for herself and to show others that she can have a girly side as well. She also is Yukiho Hagiwara's best friend since childhood, with whom Yukiho successfully complementing the opposite personalities of each other. : As of The Idolmaster 2, Makoto grows her hair longer and parts her bangs in the middle, and she is also revealed to be a skilled mixed martial artist. ; : : Ami and Mami are playful pair of twin sisters who make a two-girl singing sensation. Ami and Mami both enjoy doing impressions and teasing their friends, though Mami seems to somewhat be a little more obedient than Ami. The only way to tell the two girls apart is through their hairstyles—Ami ties her hair to the right, Mami to the left—otherwise, they are completely identical. They use this to their advantage by switching their hairstyles and both performing as idols, but only underneath Ami's name. In the first Idolmaster the only people who know about it are the members of the 765 Production. : By the time of The Idolmaster 2, the public has acknowledged the existence of the twins. As a result, Ami makes an idol group with Iori and Azusa called Ryūgū Komachi. They've also had a growth spurt. In the anime, the twins are already produced as separate idols. Compared to Mami, Ami is considered more playful. ; : : The other half of the Futami twins, she is available to produce as a solo idol from Idolmaster 2 onwards, by which point Mami extends her ponytail longer to further differentiate herself from her sister. She has many similarities to Ami in terms of personality but is described as mature compared to Ami, and she worries she doesn't get as much work as Ami due to the time they spent as the same idol. =Project Fairy= Project Fairy is an idol unit introduced in The Idolmaster SP, produced by rival studio 961 Production. The group was specifically created so that each of its three members harmonize perfectly, and have different specialties in singing. In The Idolmaster Dearly Stars and onward, the members of Project Fairy have become part of 765 Production. ; : : Introduced in the Xbox 360 port of the original arcade game, Miki has rarely had to work hard for anything. It is because of this that she always approaches tasks with a very laid back attitude. She manages good grades with minimal effort, and was born with natural good-looks that belie her age, but she can sometimes be found annoying by others because of her rare attitude she has sometimes. She even receives about 20 confessions of love per day from boys. She's grown up in a very laissez-faire family, who had no problems with her becoming an idol. While she doesn't really have cruel intentions, she believes like everything else, she can make her way to becoming top idol easily. In the Xbox 360 game, Miki is in some ways the secondary main character (behind Haruka), and her character has developed considerably over the game's year-long time span. If special conditions are met in the game, she cuts her hair short and no longer dyes it blonde. : In The Idolmaster SP, Miki was unsatisfied with the way she was being managed, and switched to rival production company, 961 Production, as a member of the group \\"Project Fairy\\". : As of The Idolmaster Dearly Stars, she re-joins 765 Pro. Her hair color has also been retconned as naturally blonde. ; : : Introduced in The Idolmaster SP as a member of \\"Project Fairy\\", Hibiki is a highly energetic and cheerful girl hailing from Okinawa. Despite rivalries with the other idols, she remains friendly and happy, without becoming overly competitive like Takane. Hibiki has an outstanding number of pets, which she happens to lose quite frequently; her pets include a mouse, a hamster (named Hamuzō in the anime), a gerbil, a parrot, a rabbit, a cat, a dog (named Inumi in the anime), a pig, a flying squirrel, and oddly enough, a crocodile. She also has a pet chicken (named Kokemaro), but apparently it is kept at her parents' home in Okinawa. : As of The Idolmaster Dearly Stars, Hibiki is part of 765 Pro. Her three sizes also shrank, since she is the only character that happens to, leading some fans to theorize that President Kuroi was lying about her measurements. ; : : Introduced in The Idolmaster SP as a member of \\"Project Fairy\\", Takane is an elegant young woman from an affluent background, as seen in her outfits. While she has an elegant, snobby attitude due to her wealthy upbringing, she also has a refined, regal personality and has a princess-like air to her. She hardly sees her mother, so she lives with her butler due to her father's frequent business trips. Her father owns a large company - like Iori's father - which causes tension to spark between the two. Takane has an amazing passion for music. She is considered one of the smarter characters in the series, and is fluent in numerous languages, including German. She also often observes far more detailed things than most characters, most of which they miss. Furthermore, it is implied in the anime that she was not born in Japan. She is also very mysterious in more ways than one as she keeps most of her personal information hidden, especially where she came from. She also takes to the commoner lifestyle and really enjoys ramen. : As of The Idolmaster Dearly Stars, she has signed up to 765 Pro. 765 staff ; : : The protagonist of The Idolmaster. He is a young rookie producer who has been put in charge of a new set of pop idols. In the game, his name is never given, and is decided by the player. His personality is also dependent on the player's choices, and can range from sweet and protective to perverted. However, in the drama CDs, he's most usually portrayed as somewhere in between. : In the anime, he is depicted as a young man with dark blue hair, glasses and a business suit. As the girls' producer, he is a very hard working individual who tries his best to help the idols as their mentor figure. As their producer, he will go to whatever lengths to make sure the girls are happy, healthy, and able to make their appearances. Like Yukiho, he too is afraid of dogs. While he mainly produces the rest of the girls, he sometimes co-produces Ryūgū Komachi with Ritsuko, often taking over when she is unable to, usually when it only involves a single member or when Ritsuko is busy, even temporarily producing Ritsuko when she goes back on stage for a concert. He is often Yukiho's manager most of the time. ; : : The president of 765 Production, he takes the Producer under his wing and monitors his performance in charge of the girls. He is never seen as anything but a silhouette, and rarely encountered outside of the 765 building, except at the final performance in The Idolmaster game. In The Idolmaster Break! manga, his appearance is revealed to be a middle-aged man around his fifties or sixties. : Before The Idolmaster 2 entered development, Jun'ichirō's voice actor, Kan Tokumaru died. As a result, in The Idolmaster 2, Junichirō gives the position of president of 765 Production to his cousin, Junjirō Takagi, so he would avoid traveling around Japan while moving to Hawaii and becoming chairman of 765 Production. ; : : Jun'ichirō's cousin and the new president of 765 Production in The Idolmaster 2. Like his cousin, only his silhouette appears in the game. However, he does appear in the anime, although his face is not fully shown. He puts a lot of faith and trust that his idols will make it through, wanting to promote them simply as themselves and relying on their own talents to pull them through. Because of this, he uses his resources well to help his idols mostly to stay happy as he believes that they are at their best when they are happy. ; : : An office clerk at 765 Production. Kotori originally only appears at the end of The Idolmaster arcade game, but then becomes a recurring character within the drama CDs. Originally featured on The Idolmaster arcade game webpage in the F.A.Q. section, she has accumulated enough fans to appear in other aspects of The Idolmaster franchise. Among the few things disclosed about her personality and character, Kotori is known to be a little older than Azusa (making her somewhere in her early twenties), and despite not being an idol herself, loves to sing.

She is known to have a massive amount of energy. Unfortunately, this tends to work against her at first as her energy would end up overwhelming the judges. Her mother, Mai, was in fact one of the most well-known idols in Japan, before she became pregnant with Ai when she was only 15 years old. As a result, 876 Pro took interest in promoting her as Mai's daughter, but Ai insists on becoming a popular idol on her own. This becomes a problem when Mai suddenly returns to the stage as Ai now has to contend with being compared to her own mother.

While she can perform well online, in real life, she is very shy and does not like talking to people outside of her friends. She is also known to like cats. Owing to her background as a hikikomori, she's also really prone to spouting out memes. As Eri begins to grow more as an idol, she becomes more interested in how other idols are able to stand out. But when Eri encounters a series of strange incidents, the truth about her producer, Reiko Ozaki, comes out as she also reveal how she couldn't deal with the gossip on the net during her time as an idol. In response, Eri decides to trust in her producer as she adapts Ozaki's unfinished song Precog and continues her career as a live idol. : In the PlayStation 3 version of The Idolmaster 2, Eri appears as a DLC character in catalog 5 as a S4U character. Once she is unlocked in S4U, players can have her perform with the songs, \\"Precog\\" or \\"Shiny Smile\\". ; : : Ritsuko's cousin who's very soft-spoken compared to her. Ryō is actually a boy trying to pass as a female idol, keeping that a secret from the other idols. Because of his girly appearance, he was often mistaken for a girl, and so he wanted to become a male idol, but when he went to see Ritsuko about it, she took him to 876 Pro to become one. There, he ends up covering for a female idol, much to his chagrin. He does so well and, as a result, the studio hires him as a female idol. After a series of pranks done by rival idol, Yumeko Sakurai, he successfully befriends her and becomes more motivated by her dreams and becomes more focused on his own dream on finally becoming a popular male idol. Starting when Sōichi Takeda writes \\"Dazzling World\\" for Ryō to compete with Chihaya, he begins to pick up momentum to finally convince the staff on re-debuting as a male idol. He finally gets the chance on Takeda's \\"Old Whistle\\" show. The end result has him accepted by his fans and becoming more popular than ever as he continues on his dream. That he switches between glasses and contact lenses whenever he is or isn't doing idol work becomes important in distinguishing between his male and female personas. : In the PlayStation 3 version of The Idolmaster 2, Ryo appears as a DLC character in catalog 7 as a S4U character. Once he is unlocked in S4U, players can have him perform with the songs, \\"Dazzling World\\" or \\"Kiramekirari\\". : Ryō also appears in The Idolmaster SideM, where he now performs as a male idol in 315 Production. This seems to be a continuation of his good ending in Dearly Stars, as his background as a female idol in 876 Pro is still referenced. He is part of the F-LAGS idol unit. 876 staff ; : : Ishikawa is the president of 876 Production. She is never seen as anything but a silhouette, but appears much more often than her 765 counterpart, Jun'ichirō Takagi. She is said to be very good friends with both President Takagi and Yukio Igarashi. While she does believe in her idols like Takagi does, Ishikawa is not hesitant to use tricks to make her idols popular like Mai's celebrity for Ai and Ryō's charm as a girl for him. ; : Manami acts as both Ai and Ryō's manager, though she focuses more on Ai due to her lack of self confidence. Because of this, the two form a close bond.

After his original idols join with 765 Pro in The Idolmaster 2, he forms a new idol group called \\"Jupiter\\", formed by male idols. He is depicted as a cruel and ruthless businessman who will do anything, legal or not, to sell his idols and get ahead of 765 Pro and tell lies about them to his idols. He tends to treat his idols more like tools choosing the most appealing and talented rather than building their abilities, the complete opposite of Junjirō's methods. : He and Junjirō were once old colleagues and friends, but later they had a falling out after Junjirō disagreed in the way Kuroi raised his idols. Since that incident, Kuroi has vowed to destroy Junjirō's company and his idols by any means necessary. : His company is actually named after him, as \\"961\\" is pronounced ku-ro-i in Japanese. 346 Production A talent agency where the cast of The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls works.

Although sometimes overly emotional, she generally acts as the friendly-type \\"good girl\\". Scouted early on, she doesn't get to do any work at first, due to not enough girls being in the project at the time. Once two more girls are recruited, she gets put into a unit called \\"New Generations\\" with Rin and Mio, after the three performed as backup dancers onstage with Mika. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 8 August 2012, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for eight weeks and topped at #12 on 20 August.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 010 島村卯月, Oricon (jp) ; : : A cool girl whose family runs a flower shop.

Although cool and serious, she has a more feminine side that shows on occasion, usually when she is flustered or surprised by others. She is part of the unit \\"New Generations\\" with Uzuki and Mio. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 18 April 2012, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for eight weeks and topped at #6 on 30 April.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 001 渋谷凛, Oricon (jp) ; : : Mio is an energetic girl who tends to get ahead of herself when it comes to wanting to become a popular idol. She is the leader of \\"New Generations\\" and seems somewhat similar to the Futami twins, Ami and Mami, both in her expression and playful attitude. She even has a habit of referring to people around her with nicknames, much like the Futami twins. Although she had auditioned for the Cinderella Project before, she came up short. She eventually managed to get through on her second try. She tends to be very good with singing and dancing, though she can get tired quite easily during lessons. During the first mini-concert for \\"New Generations\\" to promote their Debut CD, she became disappointed with the small crowd that turned up and almost quit being an idol altogether. After some time, the Producer and her friends convinced her to stay as an idol, and she has been less focused on the size of crowds at concerts, instead focusing on the excitement of the crowd. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 23 January 2013, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for four weeks and topped at #9 on 4 February.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 015 本田未央, Oricon (jp) ; : : Kanako is a girl who enjoys doing idol work, but is also a little nervous at times. Her hobby is making sweets. She seems similar in demeanor to Azusa, disliking when things do not go as planned. However, unlike Azusa, she tends to get flustered and nervous when things go wrong, rather than not really caring all that much.

She is part of the unit called \\"Candy Island\\" with Chieri and Anzu. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 18 April 2012, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for seven weeks and topped at #6 on 30 April.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 003 三村かな子, Oricon (jp) ; : : Chieri is a very shy girl with a demeanor and voice similar to Yukiho. She doesn't like being on stage, which is something that tends to make her nervous, although she seems to be able to control herself somewhat when she thinks of the audience as frogs. It seems she is even nervous when her fellow idols are on stage too instead of her, as she was very anxious during the performance where \\"New Generations\\" was doing the backup dancing at Rika's concert. She carries a four-leaf clover around with her, although it's unknown if she keeps it for luck, or just happens to like clovers. She is in the unit \\"Candy Island\\" along with Anzu and Kanako. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 13 November 2013, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for four weeks and topped at #15 on 25 November.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 023 緒方智絵里, Oricon (jp) ; : : Miku is a girl aiming to be a cute pop idol. She seems similar in demeanor to Iori, especially with her different attitudes on stage and off. She almost always wears cat ears and punctuates her sentences with the kitty sound \\"nya\\" (Japanese onomatopoeia for \\"meow\\"). She has an inexplicable affinity for cats, although she doesn't have one as a pet, and even hates fish. Although she really wants to act cute, she can get mad when she feels she isn't getting enough attention. She appears to have a large collection of different cat ears, but tends to always wear the same pair at work. According to her, she works hard like a cat, and is always ready for work. She carries cat ears everywhere she goes so she can be ready for work at any time. She often has a totally different attitude when not on camera or onstage. However, as soon as she knows the fans are watching, she puts on the cat ears and acts like a cute and innocent idol. She is one half of the unit \\"Asterisk\\" along with Riina. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 8 August 2012, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for eight weeks and topped at #11 on 20 August.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 007 前川みく, Oricon (jp) ; : : Anzu is a young lazy girl who hates to work. She tend to be similar to Miki (although much younger) with her lazy personality and tendency to fall asleep. She is initially seen sleeping at any possible time, since she is incredibly lazy. She also demanded \\"8 days off every week\\" during a protest when she and the other idols thought they should have debuted earlier than New Generations since they had been part of the Cinderella Project longer. Although very lazy, she learns to work normally later on. Apparently she is a bit of a genius, as showcased when she was on a quiz show with her unit against a rival idol group, easily answering obscure questions and solving a complicated math problem incredibly fast in her head with almost no effort. Later on in the series, she seems to have mostly fixed her lazy personality, but is still seen being somewhat lackadaisical about hard work.

She is somewhat similar in demeanor to Makoto. Although almost the opposite of Miku, she and Miku were paired up as a unit, mainly because they were the only idols who hadn't debuted at the time. After some seriously heated arguments and fights, they learned to get along and perform together, although they still tended to be at odds with each other often. Riina plays guitar, but apparently only knows some simple chords and has headphones on most of the time, listening to rock music. Like Miku, who has a large collection of cat ears, she has a large collection of headphones, but is always seen with the same pair at work. She has a great admiration for a young boy who tries out her guitar and plays an amazing sequence of riffs on it, despite him being left-handed and her guitar being a right-handed one. She also has a tendency to say that something is \\"rocking\\", usually when she likes something, like her unit's name, which was originally just a placeholder placed by the Producer, since the unit didn't have a name on the sign-up sheet for the idol festival. She is one half of the unit \\"Asterisk\\" along with Miku. : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 23 January 2013, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for five weeks and topped at #7 on 4 February.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 012 多田李衣菜, Oricon (jp) ; : : Minami is a college student who plays lacrosse. She is similar to Ritsuko, being hardworking and responsible. She doesn't have a lot of character development, despite that fact that during the idol's training camp, she was elected as the Cinderella Project's supervisor due to being the oldest idol.

Disregarding her strange speech, she is very similar in looks and demeanor to Takane. Her unusual style of speech makes it hard for the Producer to understand her, so much so that he writes down her phrases in a notebook along with their \\"translation.\\" She is the only idol in the Cinderella Project to have debuted by herself and not get put into a unit. Although she dresses in a goth-loli style and talks like she is from \\"the abyss\\" (according to her), she actually hates scary movies and stories, and can become frightened incredibly easily. Initially, the Producer had decided to promote her debut and song with a straight-up horror theme, but he was told that she didn't like horrific things, so he changed it to a Gothic theme. During the idol fest, since Minami was unable to perform with Anastasia, she went on with her and performed with her surprisingly well, despite never having practiced it (although she returned to solo work afterwards). Her stage name is \\"Rosenburg Engel\\". : Her Cinderella Master single, released on 8 August 2012, charted on the Oricon Singles Chart for thirteen weeks and topped at #9 on 20 August.THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA MASTER 006 神崎蘭子, Oricon (jp) ; : : Nicknamed \\"Anya\\", she is a half-Russian girl.

Since she is Russian, she often speaks in Russian accidentally (which is subbed as gibberish), before remembering to switch back to Japanese, though she is not as fluent in Japanese. However, she has no problem in listening to any conversation in Japanese, seemingly able to understand it. She often asks Minami how to say certain things in Japanese or whether she said something correctly or not. She is very talented in singing initially, which lead to her being paired with Minami, who is apparently very hardworking.

Similar to Azusa, not caring about the small things and being an \\"older sister\\" type, she tends to be laid-back with her approach to work and events.

Despite this, he has good intentions and loves his fellow teammates. He is also not good at smiling or television appearances, and manages to achieve a more natural smile by thinking about his fans' support when made to improve his stage presence and fanservice ability on one occasion. However, he has a poor relationship with his family except his younger brother. He performs mathematical calculations in his mind and does the laundry. ; : : A former flower shop clerk who has admired idols, notably Jupiter, for as long as he can remember, to the point where he collects all DVDs of live idol performances. Despite his calm and friendly nature, he was a former delinquent, as evidenced by his past as a gang member, and as such is immune to threatening or scolding someone while at the same time looking calm. He compares other people to flowers when talking about them. Due to being skilled at sewing and cooking and doting on Pierre so much, he is considered the leader of his own unit. As an aficinado of idols, Minori understands what other fans want and as such takes pictures with Kyoji and Pierre on his smartphone and emphasizes the importance of his unit's costumes.

Other characters The Idolmaster Dearly Stars ; : : Mai is the mother of Ai Hidaka. She is 29 years old, which means that she became a mother at the age of 16. Because of her youth, Mai is rather sporadic and very energetic, though never to the point Ai can get to. She was once a legendary \\"S Rank\\" super idol who won the Ultimate Idol, but she was only active for three years before abruptly retiring. Her image song \\"ALIVE\\" was extremely popular, which she later allowed her daughter Ai to use when she became an idol. Later in Ai's story, she comes out of retirement with Manami Okamoto as her manager. Her sole reason for coming out of retirement at all is because she thought it would be fun and interesting to stand on stage again with Ai. ; : : Ayane Suzuki, who prefers to be called Cineria, is a fairly high ranking net idol, as well as Eri Mizutani's chat buddy. When Eri was still a net idol, Ayane was supportive of Eri, wishing the best of her ability whenever she could. As someone who looked up to Eri ever since her net idol days, she believes that Reiko Ozaki tricked the pure Eri into joining the \\"Dark Side\\" and tries to make Eri reconsider her choice. : In The Idolmaster 2, Cineria is the name of a news reporter. This seems to allude to the ending of The Idolmaster Innocent Blue volume 3. A unit with this name also appears on the \\"DO-TOP TV\\" ranking. ; : : Reiko Ozaki is the freelance producer who discovered the talents of Eri Mizutani. Ozaki emailed Eri every day, asking her to debut as a real idol instead of a net idol, and eventually she built up the courage to meet her in person. Ozaki temporarily makes a contract with 876 Production and debuts Eri under the company label. Ozaki herself was once an idol, part of an idol duo known as riola, paired with another girl, Satomi Kondou. During her idol career, Ozaki never got past F Rank due to slanderous comments about their unit and their office's president that were posted online. This caused her to hate the internet and drives her desire to protect Eri from it. The song \\"Precog\\" was going to be her last image song, but went unfinished by the end of her career. She later allowed Eri to finish the song and use it as her own. ; : : Sōichi Takeda is a talented music producer who also writes songs on the side, depending on his mood. While he plays a minor role in the series, Takeda has the biggest role in Ryō's story. He also has his own music station called \\"Old Whistle\\" to honor classical music. In fact, until he became invested in Ryō, Takeda has only allowed one other idol to appear on Old Whistle because of her talent, Chihaya Kisaragi. Takeda has a strong passion for vocal-less jazz music and classic music. In fact, he wrote the song \\"Dazzling World\\" for Ryō. He has been approached by Chihaya several times about writing a song for her, but has turned her down as he feels that talent like hers would be wasted on a song written on a whim. Despite being a songwriter, he always had a dream to create an idol that could help ascend music, regardless of gender. With Ryō, he manages to have him learn and has him challenge himself until the point where Ryō can finally stand and achieve both Takeda's and his own dreams. ; : : Yumeko is a freelance idol who's determined to achieve her dream no matter what it takes. Introduced as rival to Ryō Akizuki, she is thought to be an extremely talented idol, though it is only because she cheated her way to the top by sabotaging rival idols through various means, including giving them candy that clogs the vocal chords or making the stage floor slippery. After Ryō convinces her to stop, she reveals that her dream was to appear as a guest on Takeda's show \\"Old Whistle\\". Despite being rivals, she hangs out with Ryō frequently to talk about their upcoming auditions. After Ryō reveals himself as a boy, Yumeko starts to have a crush on him. She also has an extremely high admiration for Azusa Miura, so much so that she considers her an older sister. Reception Bandai Namco Entertainment (and to an extent, Aniplex) has allowed third party companies and organizations to use the franchise's characters in their promotions both individually or as a group. Miki Hoshii was named the store manager of Tower Records' Japanese branches on March 21, 2011 at the retailer's Shinjuku branch. In 2012, the Tokyo Shrine Agency distributed posters and pamphlets featuring the 765 Production idols as part of a campaign to attract hatsumōde visitors. Sagan Tosu featured the idol characters of Cinderella Girls on the tickets and merchandises for their September 12, 2015 match against the Shimizu S-Pulse and September 26, 2015 match against the Ventforet Kofu. In November 2016, Mimura Kanako was appointed as the campaign girl for Boul'mich, a French chocolate shop in Japan. On September 6, 2018, Nissin Foods teamed up with Bandai Namco for a music video featuring Honda Mio, Hino Akane and Takamori Aiko as the unit Positive Passion advertising their Curry Meshi product titled \\"Spice Paradise\\", produced by Sanzigen. A CD including eight versions of \\"Spice Paradise\\" was released in a special box also including 6 Curry Meshi cups and a clear file on September 18. The music video features Curry Meshi's mascot, Curry Meshi-kun. Five months earlier, SideM also had its own collaboration with Nissin Foods, albeit with their Cup Meshi instant rice product. The SideM/Cup Meshi collaboration featured Michio Hazama, Rui Maita, and Jirō Yamashita, all three of which form the S.E.M unit in SideM. 2019 Cinderella Girls general election In late April 2019, non-Japanese fans of the Cinderella Girls sub-series of the Idolmaster franchise started pairing the then-unvoiced Brazilian character Natalia with Solid Snake of Konami's Metal Gear franchise. On 22 April 2019, Canadian YouTuber Mahado, a fan of the series, released a video in which Solid Snake, voiced by David Hayter, urges players to vote for Natalia in the 2019 Cinderella Girls general election, with audio by PepsiJohnny and Japanese subtitles by ThePascalPama. The campaign involved both players in and outside Japan, and at the end of September 2019, Natalia placed 9th in the overall preliminary rankings (3rd in Passion idol rankings) in the election and finally got a voice actress in the form of Teru Ikata.

The society is based in the UK but has members and supporters internationally. The society was founded by a group of individuals working in both academia and the voluntary sector, including Colin Rochester (now an Honorary Research Fellow at Birkbeck College, University of London) and Justin Davis Smith (now the Chief Executive of Volunteering England), who felt that the history of voluntary action and charities was being forgotten or ignored.Melanie Oppenheimer and Nicholas Deakin (eds) Colin Rochester, George Campbell Gosling, Alison Penn and Meta Zimmeck (eds) History The Voluntary Action History Society was formed because voluntary action was not seen as a subject its own right, often considered only as a minor part of social policy. Where it was studied historically it was as an insignificant aspect of social history. The founders believed that all too often studies undertaken were left to academics with little thought of the relevance to those active as researchers and practitioners in the voluntary sector. While some excellent histories of charities were available, they were rarely disseminated in the voluntary sector. Since its inception the society has carried out a number of activities including running a series of seminars on the history of voluntary action, hosting conferences and workshops. The society became a registered charity in March 1995. It has also engaged with particular issues affecting the historical study of voluntary action, including the problems facing the archiving of charity history. In the 1990s the society conducted a survey of major voluntary organisations which revealed a number of challenges facing such organisations in archiving their records. In 2011 the society launched a new campaign for charity archives. Activities The Voluntary Action History Society carries out a number of activities including: * Convenes the 'Voluntary Action Seminar' at the Institute of Historical Research, London * Runs a programme of New Researchers’ workshops held throughout the UK * Organises biennial research conferences and occasional conferences and symposia * Edits a blog on topics of interest to historians and contemporary researchers of voluntary action * Leads a campaign on charity archives, in partnership with others * Facilitates a Transnational Histories of Voluntary Action network References External links * Voluntary Action History Society * Catalogue of the Voluntary Action History Society contained within the Volunteering England Collection, deposited at LSE Archives in March 2011 Voluntary Action History Society Voluntary Action History Society Voluntary Action History Society Category:1991 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Voluntary Action History Society"},{"id":"34006398","text":"C.H.

In 1918 Skarning made a trial recording of \\"Old Comrades\\" (Alte Kameraden) for Victor Records. The same year he released four songs on Columbia Records. In 1930 he put out two songs on the Brunswick label.Ethnic Music on Records: A Discography of Ethnic Recordings Produced in the United States, 1893-1942 by Richard K. Spottswood, (University of Illinois Press, 1990) LCCN 89-020526. Volume 5, p. 2633. Popular artist Skarning adapted to the changing tastes of the public and during the 1930s performed with his sons Thorstein and Osmund as \\"Thorstein Skarning and his Norwegian Hillbillies\\", a group whose broadcasts aired three times a week on WDGY radio in Minneapolis. One of their most popular numbers was a country western rendition of Farvel Mit Fædreland (Emigrantvalsen). The violinist Ted Johnson and musicians Ernest and Clarence Iverson also played in a hybrid manner that was both Scandinavian and American. In the early 1930s Skarning and Ted Johnson were the leading Nordic bandleaders in the Twin Cities as well as good friends. The Minnesota Historical Society has an autographed photo of Skarning that he inscribed to his \\"old friend Ted Johnson, violinist par excellence.\\" Thorstein Skarning died in 1939, but his son Thorstein kept the orchestra going into the 1950s, promoting it as \\"the only Norske band in the United States featuring old style mixed music.\\" Gallery File:Edvard Grieg (1888) by Elliot and Fry - 02.jpgEdvard Grieg File:Violinist Ted Johnson.jpgTed Johnson File:Ernest and Clarence Iverson.jpgErnest and Clarence Iverson References External links * *A Passion For Polka at the University of California Press.

Many prominent northerners and southerners sent their daughters to such institutions to participate in rigorous academic curricula and learn about elite aspects of culture.Kilbride 2006, 55-6. The school is an example of the fashionable French-centered education, popular throughout the nineteenth century.  Background  Deborah Grelaud emigrated as an exile from Saint-Domingue in 1793 during the Haitian Revolution. She fled with her four young children: John, Arthur, Titon, and Aurora. After spending a few years in Annapolis, Maryland, she moved to Philadelphia and opened the academy. Deborah Grelaud's husband is believed to have had a position with the successful merchant Stephen Girard, who was known to help refugees of the Haitian and French Revolutions.Bowie 1944, 142. Her sons subsequently served as supercargoes on Girard's ships.John Bach McMaster, The Life and Times of Stephen Girard, Mariner and Merchant (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1918) 110-234. Many refugees of both the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution lived in destitution in the United States, despite their previous status.Catherine A. Hebert, “The French Element in Pennsylvania in the 1790s: The Francophone Immigrants' Impact,” The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 108 (1984): 456. Whether or not Grelaud risked destitution, she and other exiles from Haiti, including Anne Marie Sigoigne and Charles and Marie Picot, opened French schools in Philadelphia to support themselves.Daniel Kilbride, An American Aristocracy: Southern Planters in Antebellum Philadelphia (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 2006) 58. Grelaud was a widow when she opened her school in Philadelphia. Nevertheless, she possessed the skills to operate a successful school. Grelaud had been a woman of high social standing in Saint-Domingue. She had notable intellect, proficient training in music, and excellent administration skills.Townsend Ward, “The Germantown Road and its Associations,” The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 5 (1881): 246. There is not a known portrait of Madame Grelaud, however, the artist Henry Dmochowski Saunders produced her likeness on a bronze medallion.M. Liguori, “Henry Dmochowski Saunders: Soldier-Sculptor,” Polish American Studies 6 (1949): 20. A photograph of the possible medallion can be found here: Her name has also been spelled “Greland.”Bowie 1944, 141 footnote 2. Women's education grew in importance following the American Revolutionary War. The social elites sought the finest education for their daughters as education reflected class and could result in agreeable marriages.Catherine Clinton, “Equally Their Due: The Education of the Planter Daughter in the Early Republic,” Journal of the Early Republic 2 (1982): 41. Philadelphia, a cosmopolitan city of the antebellum era, was an opportune setting for French boarding schools. Both northern and southern elites appreciated the cultured, sophisticated atmosphere and sent their daughters to such schools as Madame Grelaud's. While daughters learned the essentials of being a lady of the elite class, the arrangement encouraged and maintained valuable connections between Philadelphians of high status and southern planters.Kilbride 2006, 59-60.  Locations  The first location of the school was 105 Mulberry Street. Grelaud moved her school to Germantown during the War of 1812 because many feared an attack on Philadelphia.Bowie 1944, 145. She rented the Loudoun Mansion for the academy through the duration of the war and during the summer months of the school year from 1820 to 1835 or later. Loudoun is remembered as a site where wounded Americans were brought during the Battle of Germantown, some of whom were buried on the grounds.Rev. Samuel Fitch Hotchkin, Ancient and Modern Germantown, Mount Airy, and Chestnut Hill (Philadelphia: P.W. Ziegler & Co., 1889) 29. When Grelaud moved her school back to Philadelphia, she relocated to 89 South 3rd Street and remained there for ten years. In 1824 or 1825 she moved the school to a house on the next block at 102 South 3rd Street.  Instruction  The school year at Madame Grelaud's began October 1 and went through August 31. The girls had the month of September for vacation. Each girl was required to bring an initialed silver mug and teaspoon for the school year.Bowie 1944, 143. The girls wore coal scuttle bonnets with short, narrow frocks for school uniforms.Bowie 1944, 144. Grelaud's students underwent a rigorous academic curriculum. Girls at these schools were expected to speak French fluently and to excel in history, philosophy, natural science, and geography. Ornamental subjects were also emphasized, including art, dance, languages, and music. Outings into the city provided opportunities to not only shop in upscale boutiques, but also to observe the manners and fashions of elite ladies and gentlemen.Kilbride 2006, 75-6. Parties and balls were also considered an important part of the young ladies' education, allowing practice in conversation and interaction with other members of the upper class. Madame Grelaud often hosted parties featuring accomplished musicians. She also allowed students to accept invitations to parties and the theater under proper supervision. The cost for one year at Madame Grelaud's boarding school was $500, an exceptionally high fee and a reflection of the clientele. Madame Grelaud likely followed the examples of other French boarding institutions and charged beyond tuition for extra music or language lessons, laundry, and concert tickets. Young ladies left Madame Grelaud's school with highly cultivated intellect; however, these schools were not established to enhance a young woman's competitive edge for the workforce. As Daniel Kilbride explained, “Young women studied the sciences because gentlewomen were expected to be conversant with contemporary intellectual currents, not because they might use what they learned in the household or workplace.”Kilbride 2006, 68. This elitist teaching style was a cause for contempt to the growing American middle class. Middle-class women had educational opportunities in this period. The difference was that these schools taught with the understanding that education provided opportunity for upward mobility and supported the ideals of independence and democracy. Women could use this education to be useful members of society. Middle-class girls usually learned only the basics of \\"reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, and needlepoint.\\"Megan Marshall, The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005) 120. While these educators saw the importance of learning French, the lingua franca of the day, they often rejected the ornamental subjects such as painting, drawing, and dance. Because elite academies favored European culture over that of the new Republic, many reformers considered them un-American. They argued that students learned skills necessary for only a leisure class.Kilbride 2006, 56-7.  Students  Several notable women attended Madame Grelaud's academy. Varina Davis, the First Lady of the Confederacy, attended the academy twice. Writer Sarah Dorsey attended with Davis.Joan E. Cashin, First Lady of the Confederacy: Varina Davis's Civil War (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006). President James Monroe's daughter, Maria Hester, attended from about 1815 through 1819 and played the harp and piano.Patricia P. Norwood, “Historians' Corner: Salon Music of President Monroe's Family,” American Music 26 (2008) 104-5. Angelica Singleton Van Buren, President Martin Van Buren's daughter-in-law and First Lady, also attended the school.Jennifer Talley, “Introducing Angelica Singleton,” University Libraries Rare Books & Special Collections. Retrieved 2011-12-2. Stephen Girard's nieces, Antoinette and Caroline, entered the school in 1809 and 1812. Three great grandchildren of Martha Washington attended the school: Eliza Law, Columbia Peter, and America Peter. Most of the girls that attended Madame Grelaud's French School were Episcopalian, but Roman Catholics and Sephardic Jews were also enrolled.
