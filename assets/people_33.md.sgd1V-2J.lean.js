Like other works of the composer's early maturity such as the First Piano Sonata and the First String Quartet, the Concerto is characterized by rhythmic energy and a direct melodic appeal. Representing both a meeting point for many of his early influences and a release for the catalytic experiences that defined the decade after leaving London and the Royal College of Music, the Concerto was an experiment in multiplicities, where the diversity of the thematic material (invented and imported) became synthesized through the timbral unity of the ensemble‚Äîtwo ensembles in fact, a further manifestation of the opposition and divisions contributing to the work‚Äôs multi-dimensionality.Thomas Schuttenhelm, The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 35. The influence of Bartok and Stravinsky can be shown, as well as that of the 17th century English Madrigal School. From these, and from folk-song, Tippett derives his distinctive and personal technique of 'additive rhythm'. This has been described as 'a kind of rhythm the effect of which is determined by an accumulation of irregular, unpredictable accents in the music'.Bowen, Meiron (1988). CD Liner notes, VC 7 90701-2 The composer David Matthews describes the effect thus: \\"[I]t is the rhythmic freedom of the music, its joyful liberation from orthodox notions of stress and phrase length, that contributes so much to its vitality\\".Matthews, David (1980). Michael Tippett: An introductory study. Faber and Faber. p.27 By dividing the orchestra into two equal and identical sections Tippett is able to play one off against the other, using syncopation and imitation to add further to the rhythmic vitality and propulsion of the music. This antiphonal effect is similar to that found in Renaissance and early Baroque choral music by composers such as Monteverdi and Gabrieli. The first movement (Allegro con brio) is in sonata form and contrasts a vigorous, driving theme in octaves with a more delicate, lightly scored idea on violins and cellos. The slow movement (Adagio cantabile) opens with one of Tippett's most affecting and heartfelt melodies for low solo violin, revealing the composer's deep love of Blues, especially the singing of Bessie Smith. A fugue offers chromatic contrast, and the movement is rounded off by a return of the opening tune on solo cello. In the rondo finale (Allegro molto) Tippett uses a melody generally described as 'based on a Northumbrian bagpipe tune' to bring the work to an exciting and uplifting climax. However this melody, as it appears here, is unlike any traditional Northumbrian bagpipe tune, and, having a compass of two octaves, would be unplayable on the instrument. As in the 1941 oratorio A Child of Our Time and the Symphony No. 3 of 1973, Tippett's humanitarian concerns are clearly evidenced in his use of melodies deriving from, and referring to, folk and popular musical sources. Tippett completed the score on June 6 1939 and it was premiered April 21 1940.Thomas Schuttenhelm The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 57.

Korean Company, The New York Times, June 24, 2008 History StarKist was founded in 1917 in San Pedro, California (known historically as \\"Fish Harbor\\") as the French Sardine Company of California, by Martin J. Bogdanovich (an immigrant from Croatia) and several partners. Bogdanovich is known for his innovations related to refrigeration of the seafood product with crushed ice. They first marketed tuna under the Starkist name in 1942. Bogdanovich died in 1944 and his son Joseph (1912-2005) took over the business. The company changed its name to Starkist Foods in 1953; at the time, its facility on Terminal Island was the largest tuna processing facility in the world. Since 1961 its mascot has been Charlie the Tuna, an anthropomorphic cartoon tuna. Commercials usually featured the phrase \\"Sorry Charlie\\". StarKist was acquired by the H.J. Heinz Company in 1963. In 1984, the Terminal Island cannery operations were shut down after decades of operation. In 1988, Heinz spun off its pet food brands (including its flagship 9Lives cat food brand, which was introduced as a tuna- based cat food in 1959) into a separate division (Joseph Bogdanovich became a Heinz vice-chairman). Heinz sold both divisions to Del Monte in 2002. In August 2015, StarKist settled a class-action lawsuit claiming that the company was guilty of deliberately \\"under-filling\\" five-ounce cans of tuna. Earlier that same month, StarKist was sued, accused of colluding with Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea to fix prices. On October 18, 2018, StarKist agreed to plead guilty to a felony price fixing charge as part of a broad collusion investigation of the canned tuna industry by the United States Department of Justice. On September 11, 2019, StarKist was fined $100 million, the maximum statutory fine. In September 2019, the plaintiffs who had signed up for the class-action lawsuit that was \\"settled\\" in August 2015 were finally paid their share of the settlement. Plaintiffs who signed up for the $50 in tuna certificates received a coupon good for $5.03 provided they buy at least three Starkist products totaling more than that amount. Plaintiffs who signed up for the $25 cash received a PayPal payment of $2.38 representing their share of the settlement after the law firm's costs had been deducted.

Lucio Fulci and Paolo Heusch were assistant directors. It was shown as part of a retrospective on Italian comedy at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. It took in around 473 million lire at the Italian box office.Chiti & Poppi p.172 A young Lucio Fulci originated the idea and format for this film, and then helped to write the screenplay and assist Steno in directing it, making it the largest screen credit in his career up to this point.Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 30. Critics said the film was carried by the versatile acting of Peppino De Filippo, who was convinced to become a comedian by the Italian actor Tot√≤. Alberto Sordi's character of Nando Moriconi became so popular, he reprised the role in several later Italian comedies, such as An American in Rome (1954), without ever sharing the credit with Fulci. Fulci always took credit for creating the Nando Moriconi character, although Alberto Sordi said it was his portrayal of the character that made it so popular. Fulci said that in post production, producer Carlo Ponti almost cut the segment out for time constraints, but Ponti's wife Silvana Mangano made him leave it in. The film made a fortune as a result, according to Fulci, and helped launch Sordi's comedy career.Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 30. Plot The film is an anthology composed of four separate court cases all being heard by Magistrate Lorusso in his courtroom in Rome. The four stories all involve bawdy incidents, with titillating chapter titles such as The Priest and the Prostitute\\", \\"The Lustful Lieutenant\\" etc. A woman named Elena brings charges against her own husband, but gets humiliated when he produces pornographic films which he took of her without her knowledge. A priest named Don Michele claims to have been assaulted by a prostitute he patronized and beaten up by her pimp, foreshadowing Fulci's later ambivalant views of the Catholic Church. A crude bully named Moriconi is accused of public nudity after his clothes are stolen by kids at a local swimming hole, and in the fourth segment, an accused prostitute reveals she has had a lascivious relationship with the Magistrate himself, exposing the judge as a hypocrite.

On the early afternoon of 23 January 1917, Benbow was in the midst of a dogfight when his gun jammed. While clearing his weapon, he evaded a head-on assault by the Red Baron, who went on to down Benbow's squadron comrade Lt. J. Hay for Jasta 11s first victory. Benbow did not succeed in returning to the attack on that occasion, but on 14 February using F.E.8 Serial No. A4871, he destroyed another Albatros D.II.

FilmoFilia. Retrieved February 11, 2010. It was released on September 30, 2011 in the United States and Canada and was panned by critics. It was released by Warner Bros. in international markets. Plot Will Atenton (Daniel Craig), a successful editor for a New York City publishing house, quits his job to focus on writing a book while spending more time with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and their young daughters, Trish and Dee Dee. The family is initially happy to live in their Fairfield County \\"dream house\\" near the forest. Soon, however, they grow uneasy because of a series of unsettling events, including their daughters seeing a strange man lurking outside and teenagers gathering in the basement. It all seems to tie to a crime committed in the house five years earlier, when a man named Peter Ward apparently murdered his wife and two children and was committed to a mental hospital from which he has been recently released due to lack of evidence. Will tries to enlist the help of the local police, but they appear strangely unwilling to assist. He also approaches his neighbour Ann (Naomi Watts), who seems apprehensive, while her estranged husband Jack (Marton Csokas) appears outright hostile to Will. Will decides to conduct his own investigations, visiting the facility where Peter Ward was housed, and in doing so he finds out that he actually is Peter Ward. Five years earlier, during the attack that claimed the lives of his wife and daughters, Peter was shot in the head, so he has no memories of the murders. In order to cope with the grief, he fabricated a delusion in which his family is still alive and a new identity for himself based on his inpatient ID band \\"W1-1L 8-10-10\\". Once dismissed, Peter moved back to his abandoned house, which is now condemned and covered in graffiti, but in Peter's disturbed mind, it's still unspoiled and inhabited by Libby and the girls. Peter is forcibly removed from the dilapidated house and is taken in by Ann, who believes in his innocence and used to visit him at the facility. She encourages Peter to move on, but Peter eventually returns to the house to confront his memories, ultimately realising that he did not kill his wife and children. It was a local man named Boyce (Elias Koteas), who broke into the house and shot Peter's family, while Libby, trying to subdue the intruder, shot Peter inadvertently. Peter and Ann are suddenly attacked by Jack, who reveals that he had hired Boyce to kill Ann so he could get revenge against her for divorcing him, as well as full custody of their daughter, Chloe. However, Boyce went to the wrong house and accidentally killed Peter's family instead. Still helped by Boyce, Jack decides to kill Ann and set the house on fire, framing Peter for her murder. He also shoots Boyce as punishment for his early failure. As Jack ignites a fire, Peter overpowers Jack and saves Ann with the help of his wife Libby who is revealed to be a spirit and not a mental projection. A wounded Boyce douses Jack in gasoline, but Jack shoots him in the head and tries to escape through the flames. Since he is covered in gasoline, he catches fire, and burns to death. While Ann and Chloe reunite, Peter says goodbye to the spirits of his wife and children. Some time later, Peter has returned to New York and published a best-selling book called Dream House, in which he recounts his tragic experiences.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Sheridan tried to take his name off the film after being unhappy with it and his relationship with Morgan Creek Productions. Reportedly Sheridan, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz disliked the final cut of the film. The trailer, cut by Morgan Creek Productions, was criticised for revealing the film's main plot twist. Soundtrack The score to Dream House was composed by John Debney and conducted by Robert Ziegler. Christian Clemmensen, reviewer of Filmtracks.com, gave it four out of five stars, declaring it \\"among the biggest surprises of 2011\\" and stating, \\"It's not clear how badly Debney's work for Dream House was butchered by the studio's frantic last minute attempts to make the film presentable, but Debney's contribution does feature a cohesive flow of development that is, at least on album, a worthy souvenir from this otherwise messy situation.\\" The soundtrack was released on 11 October 2011 and features 15 tracks of score at a running time of 56 minutes.

In December 2017 the Ircle home page displayed a poll, to end Q2 2018, to determine whether a new version should be released on OS X and iOS. The results of the poll were 311 votes in favor of a new Mac OS version, 43 votes for an iOS version, and 117 votes for both a Mac OS and iOS version, out of 528 votes cast.  History  Ircle was originally written in THINK Pascal by Olaf Titz and released in 1993, with the source code licensed under the GPL up to version 1.56. Titz then gave up on the project and Tijdgat took over. Tijdgat continued development privately, rewriting it in C under Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro and updating it for the then-new Power Macs. Ircle 3.0 was released in 1994. The Talk City internet chat service supported Ircle, and as of 2000, negotiated for a custom version called \\"Talk City Ircle\\", free for subscribers, with \\"comparable features without the disruption\\" from flood attacks. Tijdgat announced in December 2005 that extensive work was underway to update Ircle for x86 based Macs. The upgrades were to be backward compatible with older CPUs, while development for Mac OS 7, 8, and 9 would cease. On September 21, 2006, the Intel compatible (universal binary) version was released with a number of new features.  Features  Ircle supported up to ten simultaneous server connections, and comes configured with a \\"long list of servers\\". The \\"channelbar\\" feature simplified managing the otherwise large number of windows in Ircle. Applescript allowed detailed control and modification of the client. Third party developer Public Access Software hosted Ircle Scripting Resources, Applescript scripts for Ircle-based tools, applications and even games, until 1999. The Ircle \\"faces\\" window displays updateable images of chat contacts.  Reception  Ircle was once described as \\"the most widely used IRC client for Macintosh computers\\", \\"stable, full-featured\\", with \\"good user support,\\" and \\"one of the best\\" Mac IRC clients. The \\"one downside\\" to Ircle was \\"a rather intimidating preferences dialog\\".\\"Preferences\\" . ircle.com. One author described it as \\"the godfather of Mac IRC clients.

He served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and rose to the rank of admiral. He was also a Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1832 to 1837. He was the fifth laird of Pitfour in Aberdeenshire from 1821 until his death in 1867. Family Ferguson was the illegitimate son of George Ferguson (1748-1820) the fourth Laird of Pitfour, a large estate in the Buchan area of north east Scotland. His father was usually referred to as \\"the Governor\\" and Ferguson inherited the sizeable estate, money and also property in Trinidad and Tobago. As he shared the same name as his father, to help differentiate the two, he is generally known as the \\"Sailor\\" or the \\"Admiral\\", an acknowledgement of his naval career. Ferguson was the fifth laird of Pitfour and held the title from 1821 until 1867. He enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and squandered much of his inheritance gambling. In 1812 he married the heiress Elizabeth Holcombe and received an annuity from her wealthy father, John Woodhouse of Aramstone in Hereford. She died a few weeks after giving birth to their only child, a daughter, in early 1814. His second marriage was on 7 April 1825. This was to Elizabeth Jane Rowley, the eldest daughter of Clotworthy Rowley, 1st Baron Langford and a niece of the Duke of Wellington. The couple had five children: four daughters ‚Äì Frances Harriet, Georgina Harriet, Elizabeth Ann and Emily Ann ‚Äì and a son, George Arthur. Career In 1798, aged ten, Ferguson volunteered to join the navy but never actually served on . He was midshipman on , a 38-gun frigate before continuing his career on HMS Loire. At 17 years of age he was promoted to lieutenant. He continued to rise through the ranks until he left the service in September 1815, at age 27. In November 1811, Ferguson was commander of the sloop . Together with , the Pylades had towed two damaged ships to Peterhead harbour. Ferguson then went to visit his father at Pitfour. However, early the next morning while Ferguson was still ashore, the Pylades broke anchor and was grounded on rocks. Local inhabitants helped throw all the guns overboard and cut away the mast, which successfully re-floated it. The Admiralty refused Ferguson's request for a court-martial to clear his name. Ferguson went back to sea after his first wife died shortly after giving birth in spring of 1814 and served on . He rose to the rank of rear-admiral in 1849, vice-admiral at the beginning of 1856 and admiral in February 1861 by which time he was 72 years of age. Electoral reforms were scheduled to be enacted in 1832; Ferguson sought election for the Banffshire constituency in 1831 when only landowners were eligible. The seat was, however, retained by the sitting candidate. At the 1832 general election Ferguson was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Banffshire. He held the seat until 1837. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Ferguson was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Ferguson was associated with \\"T71/891 Tobago no. 67\\", he owned 299 slaves in Tobago and received a ¬£5,724 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in ). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Death and legacy Ferguson died in March 1867 at 37 Charles Street, in Berkeley Square, London, a mansion he had purchased from the Marquess of Bute a number of years earlier despite his financial difficulties. He is buried in a family vault at Kensal Green Cemetery. His second wife and two unmarried daughters are also buried there. His estate passed to his son, George Arthur.

It can be found in a wide range of habitat types, including disturbed and recently burned areas. It is sometimes weedy. Description Silene antirrhina is quite variable in appearance, its morphology depending on several environmental factors, such as moisture level and available nutrients.Flora of North America In general it is an annual herb growing erect to a maximum height near 80 centimeters. The slender stem grows from a taproot and branches near the top. There are dark-colored internodes on the stem, the upper ones often glandular in sticky in texture. Insects become trapped in the sticky patches on this protocarnivorous plant, but it does not obtain any nutrients from them.Illinois Wildflowers The lance-shaped leaves are up to 6 centimeters long near the base of the stem, and are smaller and narrower farther up. The flower is enveloped in an inflated ovate calyx of fused sepals with ten veins. The calyx is open at the top, often revealing five double- lobed petals in shades of pink, red, or purple to white; the petals are sometimes absent.

Front row from left: Wellington Koo, Horace James Seymour, T. V. Soong, Hugh Edward Richardson, and Wu Guozhen. The Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China,Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China or the Sino-British New Equal Treaty, was a bilateral treaty concluded between the British and the Chinese governments in Chongqing on 11 January 1943. The formal name of the treaty was Treaty Between His Majesty in Respect of the United Kingdom and India and His Excellency the President of the National Government of the Republic of China for the Relinquishment of Extra- Territorial Rights in China and the Regulation of Related Matters. Under that treaty, the British government relinquished any special rights it had in China. This was done as a conciliatory step towards the Chinese government in order to boost up its cooperation with the Allied Powers in the Second World War. The United States and China concluded a similar treaty on the same day. Ratifications were exchanged in Chongqing on 20 May 1943, and the treaty became effective on the same day. It was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on 30 September 1944.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 205, pp. 70-107. Background China ‚Äì the cake of Kings and Emperors cartoon showing Britain, Germany, Russia, France and Japan dividing China Since the Treaty of Nanjing, concluded in 1842, the British government enjoyed extra- territorial rights in China, which included mainly commercial rights for British companies and extra-territorial rights for British nationals in China.Shin Shun Liu, Extraterritoriality: Its Rise and Decline (1925) British subjects could only be prosecuted for crimes or have civil cases brought against them before British Consular courts or the British Supreme Court for China and Japan. The need to modify the conditions of extra-territorial rights in China arose from the dire situation of Chinese-British-U.S. military cooperation following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and later during the Second World War. On 18 July 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared in Parliament his government's intention of relinquishing extra-territorial rights in China once peace was concluded.Churchill statement in Parliament The issue was raised again following the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941, and at this point the British position was greatly influenced by the U.S. position. Already in March 1942, agreement was reached among State Department officials regarding the need to modify existing agreements with the Chinese government in the latter's favour in order to improve relations.Memorandum by Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs (Maxwell Hamilton), 27 March 1942, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1942 China, pp. 271-274. On 25 April 1942, the British government sounded its positions on the matter in a memorandum to the U.S. government, in which it agreed to abolish extra-territorial jurisdiction in principle, but suggested to postpone negotiations to that effect until the end of the war.Aide-Memoire, 25 April 1942, ibid, pp. 276-277. On 6 May 1942, the U.S. government responded to the British memorandum that it was not desirable to abrogate extra- territoriality in China at the moment, but that it would consider doing so in case approached about it by the Chinese government.Secretary of State to the British Ambassador, 6 May 1942, ibid, pp. 277-278. On 27 August 1942, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull suggested that in case negotiations for relinquishing extra-territoriality commence, the following provisions should be included in the treaty: * Abrogation of the Boxer Protocol of 1901 and of the international settlement in Shanghai. * Settling legal issues resulting from the termination of the diplomatic quarter in Beijing. * New legal arrangements to be entered in order to allow the retention of some foreign landed property in China under the new policy. * Granting similar rights to Chinese nationals in the U.S. as U.S. nationals in China. * Reciprocity in consular representation for the U.S. and China. * Negotiations for comprehensive new treaties on commerce to start 6 months following the termination of the war. * Settlement of all disputes on the rights of Americans in China according to norms of international law. The British government was not receptive at first to Hull's proposals, but the U.S. government began pressing London to start negotiations with Chongqing right away, fearing lest waiting until the war's end will strengthen Chinese public pressures to adopt stiffer positions vis-a-vis the U.S. and British governments. On 3 October 1942, the U.S. government submitted to the British government a draft U.S.-Chinese treaty based on Hull's proposal of 27 August. First indication for Chinese aspirations to abolish extra-territoriality came around August 1942, in a conversation between Wang Beng-shen, advisor to Chiang Kai-shek on Japanese affairs, and member of the British embassy in Chongqing. The Chinese adviser stated that the Chinese government desired to abolish extra-territorial rights in Shanghai, and was willing to grant some special status to British companies in that city.U.S. Ambassador in London to the Secretary of State, 15 September 1942, ibid, p. 293. As a result of U.S. pressure, the British government agreed in early October 1942 to enter into negotiations with the Chinese government regarding the abrogation of extra- territoriality, and on 9 October the U.S. and British governments officially notified the Chinese government of their initiative to that effect. Negotiations eventually led to the conclusion of two similar treaties in January 1943 between China and the U.K. and U.S. respectively for the relinquishment of extra-territorial rights in China. Terms of the treaty The wording of the treaty was similar to the proposal made by Hull on 27 August 1942, as it remained brief in order to allow for more detailed agreement once the war was over. *Article 1 stipulated the treaty shall apply to all territories of the British Empire and the Republic of China. *Article 2 abrogated all international agreements which granted extra-territorial rights in China to any British nationals and companies. *Article 3 specifically abrogated the Boxer protocol of September 7, 1901 and promised in the future to restore to the Chinese government the control over the Legations Quarter in Beijing (this provision was mainly symbolic, since Beijing was at the time under Japanese occupation). *Article 4 terminated all British extra- territorial jurisdiction in Shanghai, Tianjin and other main cities (most of which were under Japanese occupation at the time). *Article 5 permitted the operation of British companies in China, as long as they obeyed Chinese law. *Article 6 bound the British and Chinese governments to reciprocity in their commercial relations. *Article 7 regulated the work of diplomatic agents in each country. *Article 8 provided for negotiations for new treaties of commerce, to begin six months following the conclusion of the war being waged. *Article 9 provided for ratification of the treaty.  Hong Kong  Chiang Kai-Shek attempted to put the issue of Hong Kong onto the two parties' agenda, suggesting that the Kowloon concession should be returned to the Republic of China along with the other foreign concessions. This was fiercely rejected by the United Kingdom's prime minister at the time, Winston Churchill. The United Kingdom also demanded that the Republic of China give their written consent that the Kowloon concession was not included within the unequal treaties, or else they would refuse to sign, so the Republic of China was forced to drop the concession of Kowloon from the agenda. The two sides signed the treaty, with the Republic of China writing a formal letter to the United Kingdom and securing the right to raise the issue of Hong Kong on a later occasion.

A boxing match that has not ended in a knockout, technical knockout (TKO) or disqualification (DQ), having reached the limit on the preset number of rounds has \\"gone the distance\\" and the fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner.

A draw will result if all three judges call the fight even or if one judge favors one fighter, a second judge's card supports the other and the third calls the fight a draw. The March 1999 heavyweight unification bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis at Madison Square Garden is an example of a draw where all three judges had scored the fight differently, with Eugenia Williams favoring Holyfield, Stanley Christodoulou favoring Lewis and Larry O'Connell calling the fight a draw.

On 25 June a new temperature record was set in the Asian portion of Russia, at Belogorsk, Amur Oblast, at . The previous record in the Asian portion was at Aksha on 21 July 2004. A new record for the highest nationwide temperature in Russia was set on 11 July, at , in Yashkul, Kalmykia (in the European portion), beating the previous record of set on 6 August 1940, in Kalmykia. Average temperatures in the region increased to over . The mean high for European Russia recorded on 26 July reached during the day. During July 2010, a large portion of European Russia was more than 7 ¬∞C (12.6 ¬∞F) warmer than normal. According to the director of the Global Fire Monitoring Centre (GFMC) Johann Goldammer, the wildfires were caused by \\"negligent [human] behaviour\\", such as lighting barbecues and fireworks in a densely wooded area. Such human activity, coupled with the unusually high temperatures over the Russian territories, catalyzed this record disturbance. Timeline =29 July= Peat fires causing significant loss of properties and an unverified number of human fatalities started in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, the Voronezh Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Ryazan Oblast and across central and western Russia due to unseasonably hot weather. =31 July= Regions with wildfire spreading on 31 July.

The head of EMERCOM, Sergey Shoygu, reported on 31 July 2010 that the fire situation in the seventeen federal subjects of Russia, especially in Vladimir and Moscow Oblasts, may be complicated. He claimed that in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast the velocity of fires was 100 meters per minute, and the fiery air flow tore trees from the root, like a hurricane.area of forest fires in Russia decreased A YouTube video was uploaded, showing a group of men escaping from a burning village in Vyksa district by driving their car over a burning road.Youtube video of car driving through fire =1 August= On 1 August 2010, the area of the forest fires was . The Central Regional Center MOE Russia website reported that in Moscow Oblast 130 foci of natural fires were detected, covering the area of 880 hectares.

According to \\"Interfax\\" referring to the head of the National Center for Crisis Management of EMERCOM Vladimir Stepanov, as of 2010, Russia revealed approximately 7,000 fires in the area over . Fire was also burning in 14 federal subjects of Russia, and on 2010, officials reported the death of 34 people.Area fires in Russia increased to hectares Moscow on Monday was covered in smoke, with reduced road visibility.\\"Moscow once again enveloped with smoke from fires\\" On Monday, 2 August 2010, Vladimir Putin scheduled a meeting with the Governors of Voronezh, Novgorod, Samara, Moscow, Ryazan, and Vladimir Oblasts, as well as the Head of the Republic of Mordovia. =4 August= By 4 August, the wildfires were still burning over , with a death toll of at least 48. Some fires burned in areas near the nuclear research center in Sarov. However Rosatom head Sergey Kiriyenko dismissed apprehension of an atomic explosion. President Dmitry Medvedev cut short his summer break to return to Moscow for an emergency meeting of the national security council to address the crisis. At an international meeting on 30 July, amid the ongoing heat wave and wildfires, Medvedev announced on television that \\"practically everything is burning. The weather is anomalously hot. What's happening with the planet's climate right now needs to be a wake-up call to all of us, meaning all heads of state, all heads of social organizations, in order to take a more energetic approach to countering the global changes to the climate.\\" JournalistsResource.org. Retrieved 21 August 2012. Medvedev sacked some of his senior navy officers after one fire destroyed Russian navy equipment. The officers were accused of \\"incomplete professional responsibility\\" after several buildings were allowed to burn down and vehicles and equipment destroyed. He suggested anyone who had neglected their duties would be prosecuted. On the same day it was reported that another fire was approaching a major secret nuclear research facility in the city of Sarov. Environmental groups, such as the WWF, and \\"non-systemic\\" opposition politicians suggested firefighting has been slowed down by the Forest Code law passed by the Duma in 2006 at the order of Putin. The legislation transferred responsibility for the country's vast woodlands to regional authorities, putting 70,000 forestry guards out of work. =5 August= According to the Emergencies Ministry, there were 843 reported outbreaks of fires, including 47 peat fires. There were 73 large fires. The fires threatened an animal sanctuary for over 1,800 animals, including dogs and retired circus animals. Almost 600 fires were still burning in the country, and around 2,000 homes had been destroyed. The President fired several high-ranking military officials after fires burned through a secret military base. Carbon monoxide pollution in Moscow was four times above normal. Firefighters fought to prevent the wildfires from reaching Bryansk, an area bordering Ukraine contaminated with radioactive material, including cesium-137 and strontium-90, in the soils following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Emergencies Minister Sergey Shoygu warned that fires could release radionuclides into the air. He said that a new zone of radioactive pollution could emerge. Two fires broke out in the region but were contained. =6 August= Smoke in Moscow on 6 August 2010 Smoke in Kharkov on 14 August According to the Emergencies Ministry, there were registered 831 fires, including 42 peat fires. 80 large fires were registered in an area of . Almost 162,000 people were reported to be fighting with the flames in the regions of Moscow, Voronezh, Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan, Ivanovo, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Tver, Yekaterinburg, Republic of Mordovia, and Mari El Republic. According to the State environmental agency \\"Mosekomonitoring\\", in the morning in Moscow, the maximum concentration of carbon monoxide in the air exceeded the acceptable norm by 3.6 times, the content of suspended particles by 2.8 times, and specific hydrocarbons by 1.5 times. The Moscow airports of Domodedovo and Vnukovo were unable to land more than 40 planes and were only able to send about 20 planes due to the strong haze caused by the smoke. As of 10 a.m., visibility at Domodedovo was 350 m and 300 m at Vnukovo. According to the Federal Air Transportation Agency, the Sheremetyevo airport works as usual because of visibility of about 800 m. An international football friendly match (Russia‚ÄìBulgaria) scheduled for 11 August was moved to Saint Petersburg. Two Russian Premier League football games were postponed because of the severe environmental situation. According to the spectrometric data received from the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua, the smoke from the fires in some places rose to a height of about 12 kilometers and ended up in the stratosphere, which usually only occurs during volcanic eruptions. Satellite imagery showed that a cloud of smoke wide covered Western Russia. =7 August= Moscow, Yasenevo, Aivazovskogo street. Left ‚Äì 17 June 2010, 20:22. Right ‚Äì 7 August 2010, 17:05.

Emergency officials registered 853 outbreaks of fire by 7 August, including 32 peat fires, with a total area of , in which 244 islands of fire were put out, and 290 new fires sprung up. In Moscow, by noon the concentration of airborne pollutants intensified and reached at 6.6 times normal level for carbon monoxide, and 2.2 times for suspended particulate matter. Seven flights heading for Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports were redirected to alternative airfields. The temperature may have reached in Moscow Oblast. At Sheremetyevo International Airport, visibility was reduced to 325 meters. =8 August= Smoke from fires in the Novgorod region travel north, arriving in Saint Petersburg. =10 August= Early in the afternoon of 10 August Greenpeace Russia stated that fires were raging in radioactive polluted areas near Bryansk, which is quite polluted due to the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. This area is still heavily contaminated and has no inhabitants. In the Moscow area a heavy thunderstorm broke over the city. NO2 rates decreased from 8 times normal to normal NO2 rates. Unfortunately expectations are not favorable with temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius. Experts stated that the polluted air would continue again within a few days. Environmental scientists stated that the brown cloud produced by the fires may cause soot to land on Arctic sea ice, causing faster melting. The release of industrial polychlorinated biphenyls from the fires and cryoconite causing melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet were also concerns. =12 August= With the number of fires being reduced from 612 to 562, the skies over Moscow were mostly clear on 12 August, giving the city a much needed break from the devastating smog. Residents in the city told reporters that they were overjoyed with the suddenly improved air; most of whom stopped wearing their masks as the air was safe to breathe. However, forecasts indicated that a shift in the winds was likely to occur in the coming days, likely bringing the smog back into Moscow. Reports indicated that roughly 80,000 hectares of land were still burning. Press reports stated that a preliminary estimate of damage to the Russian economy as a result of the fires was ‚Ç¨11.4 billion ($15 billion). =13 August= Roshal town (Shatursky District) on 13 August 2010. After weeks without rain, heavy downpours soaked Moscow and nearby areas, bringing further relief to the extended heat wave. However, in Sarov, about east of Moscow, a new fire started near the country's top nuclear research center. Earlier in August, radioactive and explosive materials were moved out of the facility due to the threat of fires; however, they were later returned when the threat lessened. Over 3,400 firefighters were battling the blaze and were being assisted by a special firefighting train. =2 September= A new wave of wildfires flared up in Russia in September, killing at least 8 people and destroying nearly 900 buildings. Public health effects Temperatures on 31 July 2010. Deaths in Moscow averaged 700 a day, about twice the usual number. The heat wave is believed to have been unprecedented in Russian history, and killed 55,736 people, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. Fires have affected areas contaminated by the Chernobyl incident, specifically the surroundings of Bryansk and border regions with Belarus and Ukraine. Due to this, soil and plant particles contaminated by radioactive material could be released into the air and spread over wider areas. The Russian government indicated that there had been no discernible increase in radiation, even though Greenpeace accuses the government of denial. France's Institut de radioprotection et de s√ªret√© nucl√©aire (Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute) issued its own analysis on 12 August, and concluded that there was no health risk at the time, but that marginally elevated levels of radiation may be detected in the future.

In 2002, a series of hard-to-extinguish peat fires led the government to recognize that the peat fields needed to be re-watered to prevent wildfires. By 2010, however, large expanses of peat areas had not been rewatered and were kindling wildfires. Government officials said they could not have anticipated the heatwave, but critics blamed complacent officials for ignoring warnings of blazes near villages. Sergey Robaten, Vadim Tatur, and Maksim Kalashnikov argued that the fires and the inability to contain and extinguish them was due to \\"the inaction of bureaucrats\\" and Putin's elimination of the Russian State Fire Service in 2007. Putin had transferred responsibility for fighting fires to those renting state property and the subjects of the federation, with the assumption that owners or renters would invest in whatever was necessary to prevent forest fires. However, the reality was more complex; Russian companies were seeking to turn a quick profit and thus neglected forest firefighting. Putin's spokesman remarked, \\"this is a well-functioning system which only needs some minor adjustments\\".

Description Silene bernardina is a variable plant and it is divided into several subspecies. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a taproot and leafy caudex unit, the hairy, erect stems growing up to about half a meter tall. The slender stems have glandular, sticky patches on their upper parts. The linear or lance-shaped leaves are up to 8 centimeters long low on the stem and smaller on the distal branches. Flowers occur in a terminal cyme at the top of the stem, as well as in some of the leaf axils. Each has a hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals with ten red veins. The calyx is open at the top, revealing five white or purple-pink petals which may be almost 3 centimeters long. The petals have usually four fringelike lobes at the tips and feathery appendages at their bases. The stamens and three or four long styles protrude from the flower's center.

Traver in the mid-1920s (the rides were, in fact, anything but safe, and became known as the \\"terrifying triplets\\"Harry G. Traver and the \\"Terrifying Triplets\\" Designboom.). Lightning was the only Giant Cyclone Safety Coaster not to bear the \\"Cyclone\\" name, as a roller coaster named Cyclone already existed at Revere Beach when Lightning was constructed in 1927. The other two members of this group of coasters included the Crystal Beach CycloneRCDB listing for Crystal Beach Cyclone and the Palisades Park CycloneRCDB listing for Palisades Park Cyclone (A fourth Traver roller coaster named Zip had a similar‚Äîbut smaller‚Äîdesign and was installed at Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon).RCDB listing for Zip Ride layout and structure Although the precise dimensions of Lightning are not reported, its common design heritage with the Crystal Beach Cyclone suggests that these coasters share many technical specifications, such as heights around , many steeply-banked turns and a ground-level figure 8 track. In fact, there was no truly straight track apart from the station.Revere Beach historical site Lightning's hybrid steel structure allowed for much more steeply banked curves than would have been possible in an ordinary wooden-framed roller coaster of the day. These steeply banked tracks often made quick transitions to steep banks in the opposite directions. These quick rolling transitions were one of the primary reasons for the violent nature of the Lightning. Ride experience and safety Although the ride length was said to be fairly short (about 40 seconds in duration from the top of the lift hill), all the Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters were known for their intense and often brutal ride experience. The Lightning had already killed a rider by its second day of operation at Revere Beach. The incident occurred when a girl fell to her death from the coaster. The ride was then shut down for 20 minutes so that her body could be removed before operation resumed. The Lightning was not the only roller coaster at Revere Beach with a poor safety record, however. Derby Racer, for example, killed or critically injured at least 5 people in its 25 years of operation. Despite the safety concerns, Lightning was initially popular. That popularity soon faded, however, due in part to its uncomfortable ride experience. Traver rides were called \\"rib-ticklers\\" because of the violent side-to-side motions that would inflict rib injuries on riders. The ride was so rough, in fact, that the phrase \\"take her on the Lightning\\" became a folk remedy for the termination of unwanted pregnancies in the Greater Boston area. High insurance premiums, the financial pressures of the Great Depression, and high maintenance costs inflicted by the Lightning's violent operation also contributed to its demise. Its demolition in 1933 meant that Lightning was the shortest-operating of the \\"Terrifying Triplets\\".

Summary  The story takes place in Rome during the second half of the eighteenth century. Cardinal Trebaldi decides to reinstate the power of the nine families, based on papacy. Armando Catalano, also known as The Scorpion, is a holy relics dealer. He is the son of a heretic who was burnt alive for misdirecting a priest from the church and Christian beliefs. Armando, the bearer of a birthmark in the shape of a scorpion known as the \\"mark of the devil\\", challenges the cardinal‚Äôs authority. The cardinal, who seems to be filled with hatred for The Scorpion, sends the young gypsy Mejai, a specialist in poisons, to kill him. The adventures of the Scorpion lead him to the treasure of the Templars and to discover an interpretation of what might have happened to it.

The area is historic due to the many ornate homes and mansions‚Äîmany dating back to the 19th century‚Äîthat lie within its boundaries.Lawrence County Historical Society  Architecture  The district includes a variety of architectural styles. Its 1,888 buildings include Late 19th and Early 20th Century, Late Victorian, and Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals. One such residence was built in 1895 for Mathias Holstein Henderson, a prominent New Castle resident who at the time was vice-president of Lawrence Saving and Trust (now National City Bank). The home is now maintained by the Meehan family. The Reis Home, formerly located at 318 East Street, was built for steel manufacturer William Reis. The two-story Colonial Revival home remained in the Reis family until 1993 and was eventually demolished to make room for the new New Castle High School. In addition to these and other historic buildings, a concrete girder bridge on Boyles avenue was reportedly built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Also located in the district is the Scottish Rite Cathedral. Most of the homes in the district are built of either masonry or wood and contain multiple floors. Though the district consists primarily of single and multiple dwellings, there exists a very small percentage of commercial and health care properties.

Shot primarily in three days for a paltry three thousand dollars, the film is the second of Webber's films based on a manifesto which has been likened to DIY Dogme films which use limited equipment and other resources in an attempt to create an atmosphere of realism not present in most traditional schools of film-making. The Boston Globe‚Äôs Ty Burr called it \\"DIY Dogme dedicated to Webber‚Äôs guiding maxim: 'The movie already exists, it‚Äôs just waiting to be found.‚Äô\\" During an interview for Gerwig's Greenberg starring Ben Stiller (Gerwig's first mainstream movie) she was asked whether she'd be doing more films for $3000 and replied, \\"[Laughs] Maybe not $3,000 budgets but maybe $50,000 budgets. I'm interested in making low-budget films not for the sake of making low-budget films but because a lot of filmmakers that I want to work with and that I like are working on a smaller scale.\\" Synopsis The film tells the story of Horace (Webber) and Cassandra (Gerwig) who meet while traveling to Canada. The pair skirt around their feelings as Gerwig deals with an illness which she's keeping to herself. \\"Because they‚Äôre damaged in similar ways ‚Äî we learn they‚Äôre both the black sheep of their respective families ‚Äî they make for sweet-and-sour traveling companions, or would if Cassandra didn‚Äôt keep disappearing on Horace. The people they meet on the road offer varying object lessons in coping with the disaster of living. A comically mismatched couple at a roadside motel (Joseph James Bellamy and Irina Peligrad) seem ready to seduce our heroes or at least drag them into a discussion of superheroes as modern gods. A hermit (Markus Nechay) offers Horace and Cassandra beds for the night, a musical interlude, and a glimpse of one man‚Äôs sad isolation. The closest the movie gets to a statement comes from an older man in a diner (Robert Koch) who locates nirvana in the act of tying flies.\\" Critique The Boston Globe described the film as \\"a tiny movie that casts a tiny but genuine spell.\\" Paul Ryan of the Weekly Dig draws several comparisons between Webber and big budget director James Cameron saying, \\"God knows what James Cameron makes his movies for,\\" says filmmaker Rod Webber. There are real awkward moments, real distress and very little CGI as the pair bumbles their way through the plot, meets real people along the way, awkwardly waxing philosophy and never mentioning their feelings to each other, while being filmed. All of which makes Webber, decidedly anti- James Cameron.\\" Reel Fest Northern Comfort premiered at Reel Fest. Reel Fest 2 was May 28 to June 2, 2010.

In 1911, the first motor vessel to cross the Atlantic, the Swan Hunter-built ore-carrier Toiler, was powered by a Polar engine. At about the same time Roald Amundsen in the Fram was conquering the South Pole, and it is from that successful expedition that the engine derives its name. Other ships that have made history with Polar engines include the Girl Pat, the rescue tugs , and Canadian sealer, , chosen for the 1956 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition. British Polar engines were of the two-cycle type, built under licence from Nydqvist & Holm, Trollh√§ttan, Sweden. Their development has continued over the years. The basic design with airless injection was introduced in 1928. It was an immediate success: reliable, economic, easy to manoeuvre and remarkably simple in design and construction. This early design has been developed and extended to a wide range of engine sizes covering powers from without supercharging. In 2000, the company purchased Kelvin Diesels, concentrating engine production at Helen Street in Glasgow.

Hy≈çgikai was founded at a conference in Kobe on May 24‚Äì27, 1925.Beckmann and Okubo, pp. 87, 90. As of late 1925, Hy≈çgikai had 59 affiliated trade unions and around 35,000 members. The organization was affiliated with the Pan Pacific Trade Union Secretariat.Beckmann and Okubo, p. 91. When the organization was crushed in a government crackdown in the spring of 1928, it had 11 regional councils, 82 affiliated unions and around 23,000 members.Beckmann and Okubo, p. 159.  Background  Hy≈çgikai was founded as a continuation of the Reform Alliance, a group of 25 trade unions which merged out of the Eastern Local Council (a body that had separated itself from the Eastern Federation of the Sodomei trade union centre, but retained a direct affiliation to Sodomei. The Eastern Local Council had been dissolved by Sodomei, accused of being a communist plot), and on May 16, 1925 the Reform Alliance unions were expelled from Sodomei. The expelled Reform Alliance unions were joined by seven other unions in forming Hy≈çgikai. At the time of its foundation Hy≈çgikai counted with 32 trade unions and 10,778 members.International Labour Office. Industrial Labour in Japan. Japanese economic history, 1930-1960, v. 5. New York: Routledge, 2000. pp. 101-102 Ritsuta Noda was elected Hy≈çgikai chairman at the Kobe meeting. A 17-member Central Committee was formed. Noda was not a communist, but communists played a dominant role in the Central Committee. Prominent communist Central Committee members were Nabeyama, Yamamoto, Taniguchi and Mitamuro Shiro. Hy≈çgikai appealed to Sodomei to unite all trade unions in a single national federation, a proposal which Sodomei rejected. In response, Hy≈çgikai denounced the Sodomei leadership as 'bureaucratic' and 'right wing'. Both Hy≈çgikai and Sodomei took part in the discussions on the formation of a joint legal proletarian party. The two sides submitted their own drafts for a party platform. On November 29, 1925, Sodomei withdrew from the party-building process, stating that it would not be part of any party which included Hy≈çgikai. In response Hy≈çgikai also pulled out of the party-building process the following day, in order not to obstruct the creation of a broad-based proletarian party. In the end, the short-lived Farmer-Labour Party was founded in December 1925.Beckmann and Okubo, pp. 96-99. When the Labour-Farmer Party was founded in March 1926 (by Sodomei and others), Hy≈çgikai members were barred from becoming members of the party. However, this policy was relaxed after internal disagreements in the party, resulting in the withdrawal of Sodomei from the party and the establishment of a close relation between Hy≈çgikai and the party.Beckmann and Okubo, p. 101.  Strike actions  Hy≈çgikai launched a number of lengthy strikes in 1926. In that year, around 5,000 Hy≈çgikai activists were detained by police and 196 were imprisoned for having organized strikes.Beckmann and Okubo, p. 92. The third convention of Hy≈çgikai, held in May 1927, adopted a new platform. Focus was shifted to economic issues, on 'concrete immediate demands of the workers'. Demands raised included the struggle for 8-hour working day. Around the country, which suffered from economic crisis at the time, Hy≈çgikai was busy forming labour councils together with other trade unions at major factories.Beckmann and Okubo, pp. 125-126. The organizational structure of Hy≈çgikai was severely weakened by the mass arrests of March 15, 1928. An effort to rebuild the organization was initiated, but Hy≈çgikai and the Labour-Farmer Party were banned by the Home Ministry on April 11, 1928, accused of being linked to the communists.Tsuzuki, Chushichi.

The Kant≈ç Metal Workers Union made an attempt to hold a refoundation meeting of Hy≈çgikai on April 22, 1928, but its leaders were arrested and the meeting was never held. Communist trade unionists then changed tactics, concentrating on building local union federations.

Characters *Cedric is a boisterous little boy arriving at his new school in the first volume. He quickly meets Christian, his best friend, and Miss Nelly, his teacher whom he falls in love with. He lives with his grandfather and his parents with an often tensed atmosphere between his father and his grandfather (on his mother's side). Regularly, his mother does not cook so his irritated grandfather threatens to leave for the hospital ... Cedric is a very bad student since he is in love with Miss Nelly. Whenever he has to show his grades to his father, he finds a trick to go out and play with his friends. In all the volumes or episodes he has a fight with someone. *Marie-Rose, Cedric's mother. She is a housewife and regularly tries to avoid arguments with her husband and her father. She loves Cedric, even though he sometimes puts it in all its forms. She knows how to be strict with her son, for example when he has to walk his neighbor's dog. *Robert, Cedric's father and is an Oriental rug salesmen. He met his wife in his shop and he resents his father-in-law. He is often angry and shouts, especially when Cedric brings back his grades. But he can give good advice to his son when it is most needed. *Cedric's grandfather, is the father of Marie-Rose who hates his son-in-law and he's not hiding it. He doesn't really like the fact that he is a carpet seller. He often threatens to go to the hospital if he is not treated properly. He says Robert is a seller of \\"mats\\", which really irritates him. He shares a great complicity with Cedric, his grandson: Always telling him stories of his youth, but he can commit blunders sometimes. For example, once, Cedric is aware of the financial difficulties of his parents. He will therefore seek employment in all businesses in the city to earn money, even though he's only eight years old!. His grandfather often gives him advice based on his own experience. *Chen Liaoping, a Chinese girl who arrives at the school in the third volume. Immediately, Cedric falls in love with Chen and becomes gently possessive and jealous if another guy comes up to her or to him to talk about her. Chen is annoyed by Cedric but still considers him as her friend. She often plays jump rope with a bunch of girls. Cedric does everything to please her but she doesn't seem to be aware of it. Nicolas d'Aulnay des Charentes du Ventou is also charmed by her. And as he is rich, he does not hesitate to offer any tremendous presents: horse riding, evening dress... But Chen is indifferent with all the boys. *Christian, C√©dric's best friend. He helps him in trying to obtain Chen's affections. *Nicolas, a wealthy schoolboy who is Cedric's rival and talks to Chen which makes C√©dric jealous. *Miss Nelly, Cedric's teacher. She loves Cedric a lot, but whenever he hasn't read his lessons, she becomes very angry and she punishes him. *Stephane, another Cedric's schoolmate. *Lily is the new eccentric girl who soon falls in love with Cedric. *Yeti, C√©dric's proud and arrogant cousin. Her real name is actually Yolanda. *Sophie, a friend of Chen. *Laurent, a comrade of Cedric. His parents divorce in the episode 61 Le Divorce. *Val√©rie, a friend of Chen. *Adeline, a friend of Chen and the sister of Christian. She wears a bow and a pink t-shirt. *Jean- Bernard, a student. He has an orange flat-cap. *Julien, a student. *Manu, a friend of Cedric. He has a flat pink cap, black hair and a white waistcoat. He likes watching TV. *Caligula, the dog of Mrs. Bertrand. *Tib√®re, the dog of Nicolas. He has a moustache. *Aunt Martha, Cedric's evil aunt.

The club competes in Meath competitions. With 20 Senior Football wins they are the most successful football club in Meath. The club has also won 2 Senior Hurling Championships placing them in the top 15 most successful hurling sides in the county. History The idea of forming a new Gaelic football club in Navan was first mooted during a late evening discussion at the house of the late Peter Hughes, Rathaldron, Navan, with co-founders, the late Eddie Duignan and Jack Callaghan spearheading the move. The house of the late Peter Hughes was a regular haunt for local neighbours. An impromptu meeting was called for the purpose of forming the new club but just nine men turned up for this meeting. They were; Peter Hughes, Jack Callaghan, Eddie Duignan, Paddy Cahill, Benny Gartland, Tom Duignan, Patsy Reilly, Terry O'Dea and Jackie Carroll. =Inaugural meeting on 28 October 1948= Not discouraged by these numbers and refusing to be daunted, these men called a second meeting for 28 October 1948. The venue was the local A.O.H. hall at the bottom of Watergate Street in Navan. This hall was subsequently demolished to make way for the present Navan ring road. There was a small attendance at this meeting but those present showed a desire to form a new Gaelic Football Club and the first officers elected at that meeting were: President James O'Rourke, Chairman Terry O'Dea, vice chairman Jack Callaghan, Secretary Jackie Carroll and Treasurer Thomas Deery. =Name of the club= It was agreed that the name of the club should be Navan O'Mahonys after the Navan Pierce Mahonys which was formed in September 1887 and derived its name from Pierce O'Mahony M.P. for north Meath, a Parnellite and advocate of home rule. In choosing the name they were honouring a club which was one of the most successful in the county and also what Pierce O'Mahony stood for at the time ‚Äì home rule. The Pierce Mahonys won the 1894 and 1895 Meath Senior Football Championship. In fact in 1895 Pierce Mahonys carried the banner for Meath and contested the All Ireland Final against Arravale Rovers from Tipperary, only to lose in controversial circumstances. Incidentally this was the first final to be played in what we know today as Croke Park. The first game ended in a draw and in the replay the referee reported Arravale as having won the match but later in a letter to the press he admitted having recorded the score incorrectly and that Pierce Mahonys should have been declared the winners. The press at the time were in full agreement with this statement but the ruling body of the G.A.A. could not see its way to alter the original report of the referee. A special set of medals was struck and presented to Meath as virtual winners of the championship. However the club subsequently disbanded as a result of the unfair treatment at the hands of the Central Council in 1897 and it was fifty-one years before the name O'Mahonys appeared among the clubs of Meath. =First team= The committee began to field their first team from the small number of players at their disposal. The club colours were to be blue and white ‚Äì blue jersey with white collar and cuff. The hooped blue/white jerseys followed some years later. Club finances were naturally low and bicycles were used for transport to local games. Fortunately the fullback Eric Doyle was the owner of a lorry and this was used to convey players to away games. Dressing facilities or showers were unheard of at the time and players had to tog out along the nearest ditch to the playing area. Funds were raised by running concerts, card games, and membership contributions of 2/6d. The team won the Meath Junior Football Championship in 1949 at the first attempt. The club went senior in 1950 but had little immediate success in the higher grade. They won the Feis Cup in 1951 with a victory over Skryne in the final at P√°irc Tailteann. The Feis Cup final was played in conjunction with Feis na M√≠. Irish dancing, singing story telling and Irish music formed part of the Feis which was organised by the Gaelic League. The \\"man in the cap\\" Peter McDermott came to live in Navan and joined O'Mahonys where he made a contribution to that victory. =First Keegan Cup winners= O'Mahonys were the first winners of the Keegan Cup in 1953, defeating Trim 3‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì4., with Tony McCormack accepting the cup for the first time. They won the 1956 Meath Intermediate Football Championship against Dunshaughlin and after a lapse of four years they regained the Keegan Cup in 1957 and went on to win the five times in a row from 1957 to 1961. They won it again in 2014 and 2015 =Twenty Senior Football titles= Since its establishment in 1948 the club heads the roll of honour in Meath with 20 senior football championship titles. =Hurling= The club also has a hurling tradition and has won titles at all levels in under age competitions, completing seven in a row under 21 hurling titles in 2003 as well as back to back minor hurling titles in 1999/2000. They reached the final of the Meath Junior Hurling Championship in 1956 but were defeated by Boardsmill Gold was struck in 1961 when they won the Intermediate Hurling Championship final against Salesian College, Warrenstown by 5‚Äì8 to 4‚Äì4. Intermediate successes were also recorded in 1970, 1979, 1993, 1997 and senior in 1985/86. =Camogie and Ladies' Football= The club also organises camogie and ladies football. In the Club's Golden Jubilee Year (1998) it was awarded the camogie club of the year award and young camogie player of the year. Navan Omahonys have underage girls teams all the way up to senior. On 8 September 2013, the determined intermediate team of 2013 defeated Summer hill in the intermediate championship in Ashbourne in wet and windy conditions. Final score was Omahonys 3‚Äì5 to Summerhill 1‚Äì7. The team was successfully captained by Aedin Murray. =Nursery for O'Mahonys= The Navan De La Salle Juvenile Hurling and Football Club which was originally based at the old De La Salle Brothers School, was the nursery for Navan O'Mahonys as the majority of their players progressed to O'Mahonys on reaching minor age to play a major role in many of their successes. The old De La Salle School which was a military barracks in the early days has since been demolished. The residence attached to the old school is still in situ and is off the Navan ring road and opposite the Navan Fire Station. The De La Salle club had no grounds of its own and all training etc. was done in the old jumping enclosure, beside P√°irc Tailteann. This is now the O'Mahony's grounds. Following the departure of the De La Salle Brothers from Navan due to the fall in vocations, it was agreed that the De la Salle and O'Mahony clubs should amalgamate. The departure of the Brothers from Navan was a tremendous blow to the club as the Brothers devoted much time to the promotion of hurling and football in club and school, especially Brothers Brendan, Finbar, Celestine, Anthony, Norbert, Cornelius and Francis. Many of them also played hurling and football with O'Mahonys. The amalgamation went ahead in 1989 and heralded a new era of unprecedented success at underage level with the winning of a record number of titles in subsequent years. =Contribution at intercounty level= The development of O'Mahonys as a force in hurling and football coincided with the rise of Meath in making an impact at intercounty level. Meath's first All Ireland winning team had included the Peter McDermott who also captained Meath to victory in the 1954 All Ireland Final. He is now one of the club's Hon. Presidents. Since then the club has been represented by footballers such as Joe Cassells, David Beggy, Finian Murtagh, Donal Smyth, Patsy Ratty, Willie McGuirk, John Brady and S√©amus Clynch. Some O'Mahony hurlers have also represented Meath at inter- county level such as Ben Tansey, Gerry Kelly, P√°draic Coone, Niall and Shane McKeigue, Trevor Donoghue and Seamus Duignan. =Club development= The club draws its membership from the greater Navan area. A major part of the club's success is identified with the community links which have been forged over the years with families, business and community groups. The stunning success of St.Patricks Classical School in its All Ireland Senior Football Colleges success in 2000 and 2001 under Team Manager Colm O'Rourke highlights another dimension involving O'Mahony players. The starting lineup at Croke Park in May 2001 against St. Jarlaths of Tuam contained nine O'Mahony players with another five in the support panel. =Club grounds= The O'Mahonys were formerly owned by the Royal Meath Agricultural Society grounds on which the club house is situated at Brews Hill. They were later acquired by Meath County Board and subsequently purchased by O'Mahonys. Many local people still refer to these grounds as the \\"Jumping Enclosure\\" as they were used by the Agricultural Society for shows which included horse jumping and pony racing. The indoor show events took place in the \\"Pavilion\\" which occupied the site where the O'Mahonys' club house now stands. The grounds are in constant use by the club teams in hurling, football, camogie and ladies' football as well as by the local schools. State of the art flood lights were installed in 2003 to facilitate the playing of hurling and football matches during the winter evenings. Mr Fintan Ginnity, Chairman, Meath County Committee, performed the official \\"switch on\\" and Se√°n Boylan, Meath Football Manager, refereed the first juvenile football game to be played there under lights. This first match was followed by an under age hurling match and ladies' football game. The pitch has also been redeveloped and lights installed at the lower training pitch. The navan O'Mahonys football grounds are slowly developing more. More facilities are currently under construction on the Trim Road on the outskirts of Navan. An extra two state of the art pitches are being developed in order to provide the huge community that has increased within the club. The new grounds also include a new clubhouse with dressing rooms. The existing grounds on Brews Hill in Navan was named Paddy O'Brien Park in summer 2015, named after an iconic figure in O'Mahonys who died not too long ago. =Officers of Meath County Board= Many members of O'Mahonys have given sterling service while serving as officers on the Meath County Board. Liam Creavin a former secretary and treasurer served as board secretary from 1965 to 2000. Peter McDermott, 1954 All-Ireland winning captain also held the positions of Meath Delegate on Central Council and Leinster Council., deputy vice chairman, vice chairman and secretary of Meath County Board during the years between 1945‚Äì1955. Ned Giles, a former chairman of the club, served as Minor Football Secretary for many years. Hurling The club also has a hurling tradition. Currently the team plays at Senior and junior levels of the Meath Hurling Championship. The team beat Killyon in the 1985 final and in the 1986 final defeated Clann na nGael. The club has also won tournaments at Junior and intermediate level.

The single species, T. matuastensis, is known from one tooth, a first lower molar. It is from the Allen Formation, which is probably Maastrichtian in age, and was first described in 2009. The tooth bears two rows of cusps, one at the inner (lingual) side and the other at the outer (labial) side, which are connected by transverse ridges separated by deep valleys. This pattern is reminiscent of Ferugliotherium, a gondwanathere mammal from similarly aged deposits in Argentina, and Trapalcotherium is therefore recognized as a member of the same family Ferugliotheriidae. Ferugliotheriidae is one of two families of gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group without close relationships to any living mammals.  Discovery and context  The only known fossil of Trapalcotherium was found at Cerro Tortuga in R√≠o Negro Province, southern Argentina. This locality is in the Allen Formation, one of three formations (rock units) that have yielded Late Cretaceous gondwanathere fossils from Argentina (the others are the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations). All three are probably about equally old, from the Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous, about 71‚Äì66 million years ago, mya) and perhaps partly the Campanian (84‚Äì71 mya). The mammals from the Allen Formation are known from seven teeth, six of which represent four species of dryolestoids‚Äîa group of primitive mammals that dominates the Late Cretaceous mammalian faunas of Argentina. The fauna was described in a 2009 paper by Guillermo Rougier and colleagues, who named Trapalcotherium as well as several new dryolestoids.Rougier et al., 2009, pp. 223‚Äì224, 226‚Äì229 The generic name, Trapalcotherium, combines the name of the basin where Cerro Tortuga is located, Bajo Trapalca, with the Greek therion \\"beast\\", commonly used to mean \\"mammal\\" in scientific names. The specific name, matuastensis, derives from Puesto El Matuesto, a shed used by the paleontologists who collected the fossils from the Allen Formation.  Description  The single tooth of Trapalcotherium is identified as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, in the direction of the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction of the tongue).Rougier et al., 2009, p. 232 The tooth is 2.48 mm long and 2.07 mm wide.Rougier et al., 2009, p. 233 Part of the back labial corner is missing. The lingual row contains three cusps and the labial probably five (the broken corner renders the number uncertain). Transverse ridges, separated by deep valleys, connect the lingual and labial cusps; therefore, the cusps are not strongly separate, but rather fused. The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones. At the front of the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial cusps. A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and a stronger crest, separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley, connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side (the back of the two is broken away, but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern). The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove. The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests, which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial cusps, which are missing from the fossil.  Relationships  Trapalcotherium is identified as a member of Gondwanatheria‚Äîa small and enigmatic group of mammals from Cretaceous and Paleogene of the southern continents (Gondwana)‚Äîon the basis of the transverse ridges and triangle on its crown. It resembles Ferugliotherium from the Los Alamitos Formation, the only previously known uncontroversial member of the family Ferugliotheriidae, but differs in some characters: the triangle at the front is narrower in Trapalcotherium; the valley behind the front triangle is less curved; the ridges attached to the second lingual cusp form another triangle; the tooth is relatively shorter; Trapalcotherium does not have the Y-shaped valleys between cusps seen in Ferugliotherium; and the tips of the lingual cusps are more labially placed. The evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres, which include the Ferugliotheriidae and the higher-crowned Sudamericidae, are controversial, though a relationship with multituberculates (a large group mainly known from the northern continents of Laurasia) has repeatedly been proposed; the identification of Trapalcotherium does not provide additional information that has a bearing on the relationships of the gondwanatheres.

It consists of an artificial turf football pitch, a club house and an indoor ice rink‚ÄîGr√ºnerhallen. The facilities are owned by the Municipality of Oslo and used and operated by Gr√ºner IL, the local sports club. The venue opened in 1916 and was originally used for football, athletics and speed skating. The club house was completed in 1928 and has since been used for martial arts. From 1929, a velodrome course was installed, which remained in use until 1940. During the 1930s, the venue was the main Oslo stadium for the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF). A speedway course was installed in 1947 and remained in use until 1968. The venue featured eight ice hockey matches and two bandy matches during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Artificial ice was laid in 1985 and the skating hall opened in 1995, two years before the artificial turf was laid. History Construction started in 1915.Fossen (1998): 143 The stadium opened in 1916 as a combined football and athletics venue with a capacity for 10,000 spectators.Bryhn (1990): 75 The track was iced during winter and used for speed skating. D√¶lenenga was one of two multi-sport venues serving eastern Oslo, along with Jordal Idrettspark.Fossen (1998): 123 The club house, used for wrestling and boxing, opened in 1928. The following year, the ice rink was decommissioned and a velodrome was instead installed, which remained in use until 1940. During the Second World War, the club house was used as a school.Fossen (1998): 18 Aerial view from 1951 In 1947, the velodrome was removed and the track converted for use for speedway. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded with a new ice hockey clock, a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards.Organising Committee for the VI Winter Olympic Games (1952): 32 The speedway course was dismounted in 1968. During the 1980s, the stadium became a central location for drug dealing, but the traffic moved away during the 1990s.Fossen (1998): 145 In 1985, artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Of this, NOK 1.3 million was financed by Gr√ºner IL through loans. At the same time a new gravel pitch was laid on the football field. The artificial ice increased the popularity of playing ice hockey in the neighborhood. The club therefore started working on plans to build an indoor ice rink over the artificial rink. Planning of the hall started in 1989, and in 1990 a proposal for a steel structure was launched. However, it was rejected by the municipality. The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design, resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991. Financing of the steel structure had been secured in loans, but these were stopped following a credit crunch. In 1994, the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas, which included grants to build Gr√ºnerhallen. The hall was estimated to cost NOK 23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax. Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995, as the 30th indoor ice rink in Norway. In 1996, the city council had to grant an additional NOK 4.6 million to cover cost overruns. Ahead of 1997, the municipal council granted NOK 3.2 million to lay artificial turf at D√¶lenenga. Construction started in May and the pitch was taken into use on 4 September 1997. The new turf was Belgian-manufactured, sand-filled Superfoot 32. The upgrade also saw the first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium's history. New artificial turf was laid in 2008. Facilities The club house D√¶lenenga idrettspark consists of a club house, an artificial turf football pitch and an indoor ice rink. The venue is owned by Oslo Municipality, but the day-to-day operation is undertaken by Gr√ºner IL, the main tenant. The park covers an area of . The football pitch has artificial turf and measures . The club house has a floor area of and is built in brick. The building has suffered under lack of maintenance and has been subject to water damage, although the outer walls and foundation are in good condition. The club house has an impractical floor plan, and contains gyms for martial art and changing rooms for the pitch. Gr√ºnerhallen has a single ice rink. It has a capacity for 200 sitting and 400 standing spectators and features six player and two referee change rooms. The hall's lighting produces 600 lux. The building also features a weight lifting room, a cafeteria and club offices. D√¶lenenga idrettspark is from downtown Oslo and is located on Ruter bus route 30 and close to the light rail station Birkelunden on the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. Events During the late 1920s and 1930s, D√¶lenenga was dominated by the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF) and served as its main stadium in Oslo. AIF's Gr√ºnerl√∏kka chapter was established at D√¶lenenga and used it as its training ground.Fossen (1998): 115 D√¶lenenga was used for major AIF tournamentsFossen (1998): 113 and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929, with 500 participants. It also served as the terminus of many of AIF's and other labor movement parades. Each May Day the stadium would be packed.Fure (1996): 37 From the early 1930s, AIF moved its largest tournaments to Jordal.Eriksen (1995): 101 The local AIF club was particularly good at boxing, and in 1937 gathered thousands of spectators to watch a boxing match at D√¶lenenga.Fossen (1998): 119 From the 1920s to 1946, the √òstkantstafetten relay race was held with start and finish at D√¶lenenga. The route ran through various streets in eastern Oslo and was a counter-measure to Holmenkollstafetten in the western part of town.Fossen (1998): 124 From 1929 D√¶lenenga became a center of velodrome cycling. During the Second World War, D√¶lenengen was used for sports training in football and handball by the German Wehrmacht.Fossen (1998): 142 After the war ended, the clubs in the neighborhood went through a consolidation process. In 1952, the clubs Spero, Strong and B-14 merged to create Gr√ºner IL, which became the dominant club at the venue. Speedway events took place between 1947 and 1968, with D√¶lenenga growing to become a prime national venue, especially during the 1950s. The most notable regular local drivers were Basse Hveem, Henry Andersen, Werner Lorentzen and Aage Hansen. As of 2012, Gr√ºner Fotball remains the football venue's tenant. Their main football team plays in Third Division. Gr√ºner Hockey uses the hockey rink, with their main men's team playing in the First Division. The club house is used by Sportsklubben av 1909, Gr√ºner IL and Fighter Kickboxingklubb. =Speed skating= The first speed skating competition took place on 24 January 1917, and the stadium remained in use for speed skating until 1929. AIF arranged their Norwegian championships in speed skating at D√¶lenenga in 1926 and 1929.

The first attempts to define the Nanyang Style were made by art historians, Redza Piyadasa and T.K. Sabapathy, in 1979, during a retrospective study of Nanyang artists‚Äô works. This study was done in tribute to the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). The Nanyang style of painting was practised by migrant Chinese painters in Singapore in the 1950s. Nanyang artists The pioneers of the Nanyang Style are Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng and Georgette Chen, the first four of whom had received training in traditional Chinese watercolor painting in China. Art historian Redza Piyadasa states that Nanyang artists must be affiliated to NAFA, or a teacher or student in the school. This includes artists who studied privately under NAFA teachers. History The Chinese phrase 'nanyang' ‚ÄúÂçóÊ¥ã‚Äù, meaning south seas, stirred visions of tropical paradise. In the mid-20th century, a group of Chinese immigrants founded the Nanyang Style of art in Southeast Asia when they portrayed the rural scenes of Bali. Styles The primary medium of Nanyang Style is Chinese ink and colour, or oil on canvas. A simple use of colours and lines is similar to those of post-Impressionists, such as Vincent van Gogh. The art style reflects the universal culture of migrants, who in this case adapted to and accepted a new mix of Western, Chinese and indigenous beliefs and practices.

Using the tail code BH, they are the only squadron currently supporting the S-3B Viking platform, as well as flying Lockheed P-3 Orion and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, in support of the United States Navy's Sea Test Range, off the shores of central California. History Established as the Naval Weapons Test Squadron Point Mugu on 8 May 1995, the squadron was redesignated Air Test and Evaluation Squadron THREE ZERO (VX-30) in May 2002. Today, VX-30 is the principal naval flight and ground test unit for all Point Mugu Naval Air Systems Command aircraft and aircraft functions, including logistics and training support. The VX-30 logo was designed by Ralph R. Abel, Jr., GS Federal Civil Service, a Graphic Technical Illustrator for VX-9 Detachment, Naval Base Ventura County(NBVC), Point Mugu requested by Lt. Cmdr Mark Thomas VX-30 Maintenance Officer who had the idea to use Cerberus, the guardian of the gates of Hades in Greek mythology in 2003. The design was based on Mr. Abel's dog, a rottweiler. Aircraft Flown =Current aircraft= VX-30 is one of the most diverse squadrons in the Navy today, as its flight line encompasses three different Naval Aviation platforms. Each one of these platforms is used in various Research Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E;) of current and future weapons systems, which are being tested at Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division both at Point Mugu and China Lake.  C-130 / KC-130 Hercules VX-30 uses the C-130 and KC-130 extensively as an aerial refueling platform for units that are conducting tests on the Sea Test Range, as well as for surveillance and clearance on during hazardous operations that are being conducted on the range as well. To this date, the squadron flies the oldest C-130s in active military history, dating back to 1957.  P-3 Orion The squadron's most used aircraft is the P-3 Orion. These aircraft are used in conjunction with the testing on the Sea Test Range for surveillance and clearance, as well as providing telemetry data during missile testing. VX-30 also flies two of the fleet's only \\"Billboard\\" NP-3D, a P-3A that has been upgraded with a large billboard-esqe radar, that can provide over-the-horizon radar capabilities. The NP-3D aircraft were also used to support five NASA Space Shuttle missions using the Cast Glance optical system to monitor re-entry. S-3 Viking First appearing in late 2009, the S-3 Vikings were used for their surveillance capabilities on the Sea Test Range. Because of their agility and speed, they were able to much more quickly identify and locate various vessels which may impact the operations being conducted. In November 2010, VX-30 helped to celebrate the Centennial of Naval Aviation by sporting an S-3 with a paint scheme that dates back to aircraft that were flying during the Battle of Midway. In January 2016, the Navy retired the S-3 Viking from service completely, and thus, the S-3 is no longer flown by VX-30, or any other command in the US Navy.  Gulfstream G-550  One G-550 AEW in 2018.

On 15 February 1989 the ship was lost in heavy weather near the port of Skikda in Algeria. Two sailors, who were swept overboard when they tried to work on the anchor, survived this accident. The other 27 crew lost their lives. For his brave actions in trying to rescue the ship and her crew first officer Peter Korsen was posthumously promoted to captain. Events The ship was empty and with a minimum amount of ballast lie for anchor for the port of Skikda when very bad weather and high winds were expected. When the wind reached force 10 on the Beaufort scale the ship pulled loose from her anchors and smashed against the piers of the harbour.Website Nieuwsdossier on Sinking of Maassluis, retrieved 3 August 2010 The captain and first officer had tried to start the engines to sail clear from the nearby pier-heads, but it was too late. The disaster with this Dutch ship was the single most serious shipping disaster for a ship under Dutch flag since the second World-War. Cause As the Maassluis was expected to enter the port of Skikda the next day to load the captain dropped her anchor very close to the head of the pier of the port. Also because she would enter the port the next morning to load up the ship was empty and her ballast-tanks were also (nearly) empty. During the evening a fierce storm broke out and waves reached a height of 9 to 12 meters. The wind reached a force of 10 Beaufort and was directed inland.All KombuispraatW8 website Around 23:00 hours the captain, with help from the 1st officer, started the engines and tried to sail free from the pierhead using full power. Two Indonesian sailors were sent forward to raise the anchor so the ship would be able to sail away from the shore. These two sailors were swept overboard by the wind and waves but managed to reach the shore with minor wounds. These two sailors were the only survivors of the disaster. Despite using full engine- power the Maassluis wasn't able to move free from the piers and around 23:30 the ship comes in contact with the piers and breaks up.

The film is based on actual events, but the scenario has been fictionalized for entertainment purposes.\\"A Devilish Jackson in 'Empty Cradle'\\", Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1993.  Plot  Jane Morgan (Lori Loughlin) is the mother of two children, Sally (Camilla Belle) and Sam (Zachary Browne), and pregnant with a third. She has been separated from her husband Bob (David Lansbury) for a while, who is desperate to win back his wife's affection. At five days past her due date, Jane goes into labor. Everything is going well, until she is suddenly sedated by a nurse, Rita Donahue (Kate Jackson). Hours later, she regains consciousness. The doctor wrongly informs her that she went into labor prematurely and that her baby was stillborn. Noticing the level of drugs that were in her body after labor, he suspects that she has abused pills, which he thinks caused the death. Little does Jane know that Rita - with the help of her teenage son Patrick (Jonah Blechman) - kidnapped her baby daughter, and switched records between a stillborn child and healthy child to make it appear as if Jane's baby was stillborn. Rita faked a pregnancy for months to keep her drifting lover Frank (Don Yesso) from leaving her. When Frank- who is married to another woman- shows his disappointment that \\"their\\" child is not a boy, Rita responds in anger and immediately sets out to somehow get a baby boy as well. Sometime later, she announces that she is pregnant again, and poses under the assumed name Elaine Crisp to take care of a pregnant woman who will deliver a boy. When Rita finds out that the woman knows about her true identity, she instead induces the labor of a 30-year-old woman named Theresa Richland (Elizabeth Daily) in her home, cuts her throat, and steals her baby. Meanwhile, Jane becomes convinced that her baby wasn't stillborn, but instead of receiving support, her relatives and best friend Sharon (Michelle Joyner) believe that she is addicted to drugs and suffering from a depression, and suggest her to visit a psychiatrist. Even though she is estranging herself from everyone she knows, Jane continues to find out the truth and slowly recollects all the memories of her labor. In the hospital, she runs into Nurse Ramsey (Karmin Murcelo), who helped her with her labor before Rita stepped in. Ramsey admits that she remembers that her baby was alive and healthy when she last checked up on her, but she is too afraid to support her theories. Therefore, Jane hires attorney Gail Huddle (Penny Johnson) to sue the hospital, only to find out her case is hopeless since her records have gone missing (due to Rita). Back in the hospital, Detective Knoll (Eriq La Salle) suspect Rita as Theresa's killer, because Theresa's boyfriend Tom Burke (Blake Gibbons) identified her as her midwife. After giving him a false alibi, she instructs Patrick over the phone to give Knoll the same story if he is questioned. Nevertheless, Knoll instructs an examination, during which her doctor concludes that she has had a hysterectomy over ten years ago and cannot give birth to children. Afterwards, Rita admits to the murder of Theresa and having stolen two babies, but refuses to tell who the first baby's mother is. Nonetheless, Knoll locates Jane, and happily reunites her with her daughter. The true story behind this movie is told in the non-fiction book \\"Masking Evil\\" by Carol Anne Davis (Summersdale, 2016).

She started judging amateur fights and in March 1975 became one of the first female professional boxing judges licensed by the New York State Athletic Commission, following in the footsteps of Carol Polis, who received her license several months earlier. Shain was asked to judge the September 29, 1977, fight between Muhammad Ali and Earnie Shavers at Madison Square Garden just a few hours before the fight began. Ali was the unanimous winner, with Shain giving the champion 9 of 15 rounds. This made her the first woman to be a boxing judge for a heavyweight championship bout, which felt to her \\"like when an opera singer sings at the Met\\". Ali once asked her if she would be bothered if she got blood on her clothing while at a fight, and Shain responded \\"Well, it's not my blood\\". New York State Athletic Commissioner John R. Branca announced that he would have all three judges be women for the October 1984 middleweight title fight between Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Mustafa Hamsho, saying \\"This fight needs some publicity\\". After Pat Petronelli suggested that \\"there's going to be a lot of blood and I don't want the three judges throwing up\\", Shain remained as the only woman to judge the fight. A resident of Fort Lee, New Jersey, Shain died at age 81 on August 19, 1999, of cancer at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. She was survived by her husband, as well as by a daughter and son from an earlier marriage.

It opened in 1994 and is situated in a former abbey called Katharinenkloster in the historical core of the city. The college is a member of the Association of Baltic Academies of Music.  History  In 1947, a University of Music, Theatre and Dance was inaugurated in Rostock under the direction of the composer Rudolf Wagner-R√©geny. In 1978, it became a branch of the Hans Eisler University of Music in Berlin and was directed by Professor Karl-Heinz Will up until 1990. After the political revolution of 1989, this branch was incorporated into the university as the department of musical science. The Drama College (Rostocker Schauspielschule) was founded in 1968 as the state drama school in Rostock, which in the 80s was turned into a branch of the \\"Ernst Busch\\" Academy of Dramatic Art in Berlin. By the turn of 1990/91, the college became the Academy of Dramatic Art of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, a German federal state, and was temporarily continued as the drama department of the University of Rostock. The University of Music and Theatre in Rostock was legally established by the government of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania on January 1, 1994. The founding rector was Professor Wilfrid Jochims from the University of Music in Cologne. Today, the Rostock University of Music and Theatre is a favourite choice among students throughout Europe. Since June 2004, Prof. Christfried G√∂ckeritz has been the rector of the University. The first accommodation was in a former school at Bussebart and at the Ulmenstra√üe, which soon revealed to be very small for the increasing number of students. Since its move in 2001 into the beautifully restored Katharinenstift, made by architect Jons Reimann, the University of Music and Theatre has become a noticed venue for concerts, plays and events. Students and lecturers of the University stage over 300 performances every year for the Rostock public. The actor, painter and writer Armin Mueller-Stahl is since 2009 part of the direction of this University.

It consists of two large upland areas north of the Tees valley, one to the north and east of the village of Newbiggin, the other to the north-east of Middleton-in-Teesdale. The area, which adjoins the Upper Teesdale SSSI, consists of enclosed upland grazings, and is of national importance for its bird populations. Species that breed in the area include Northern lapwing, common snipe, common redshank, Eurasian golden plover, black grouse and Eurasian curlew, all except the last of which are declining in numbers nationally. Densities of breeding waders are among the highest in Britain, with up to 90 pairs recorded from one 1 km square. The black grouse population is particularly important: while this species has declined almost everywhere in England, and is now extinct in some former breeding areas, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor, the population in Teesdale has remained relatively stable, and the area now holds 30 percent of the English population, 7 percent of it in the Teesdale Allotments. Other breeding birds include common teal, merlin, red grouse, short-eared owl, ring ouzel, and Northern wheatear, all of which are listed, or are candidates for listing, in the United Kingdom's Red Data Book (Birds).

Legal history While in the Rangers organization Lueke was arrested following a May 2008 incident and charged with having committed rape and non-consensual sodomy. During the investigation Lueke lied to the police by denying he had sexual contact with the victim (an assertion proven false by DNA testing), and he pleaded no contest to lesser charges of false imprisonment with violence and was sentenced to 42 days in jail, time served prior to making bail. An additional 20 days were discounted due to good behavior and Lueke received three years of felony probation. After the July 9, 2010 trade that sent Lueke to the Seattle Mariners, team president Chuck Armstrong denied having any knowledge of Lueke's criminal past, and stated if he had known, he would have stopped the deal with Texas. Up to that point, the Mariners organization had a long history of supporting groups who oppose violence against women, running a campaign called \\"Refuse to Abuse\\" and had previously suspended and traded reliever Julio Mateo, who was accused of beating his wife. After an interview with Lueke, Mariners GM Jack Zduriencik reported that he was \\"satisfied with the interview and it's an issue that's behind us.\\" Former Mariners pitching coach Rick Adair later told reporters that he had informed Zduriencik of Lueke's legal troubles, and that Rangers GM Jon Daniels had made a standing offer to take Lueke back on the night of the trade. Adair had been the Rangers minor league pitching coordinator in 2008, when Lueke was charged.

History The houses were built by Charles James Freake, on land belonging to Smith's Charity. His building agreement with the trustees of the charity stipulated that they should be stuccoed, and constructed to elevational designs and specifications provided by the trustees' architect and surveyor, George Basevi. The first four houses in the square, numbers 1,3,5, and 7, were begun in September 1845, and were occupied by 1847. The whole square was completed by 1865. After the building of the first four houses, and Basevi‚Äôs sudden death in 1845, the style of the houses diverged from agreed design, using exposed grey stock brick, nonetheless of similar elevations and with substantial stucco dressings.

It caused great destruction in Heraklion, some damage from Malta to northern Egypt and was felt from central Italy to Syria. 2,000 fatalities were reported from Candia (Heraklion). Tectonic setting The Hellenic arc is an arcuate tectonic feature related to the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Aegean Sea Plate. It is one of the most active seismic zones in western Eurasia and has a history of large earthquakes that also affect Egypt. Large earthquakes with epicentres near Crete and to the north of the island are typically intermediate depth events located at the subducting plate interface. Such events are often M>7, but due to their depths cause relatively little damage for their size, while being very widely felt. Damage The earthquake caused severe damage in Heraklion and northeastern Crete. Damage was also reported from islands in the south Aegean, Cairo, Rosetta, Alexandria in northern Egypt and on Malta. Reports of the collapse of part of the Temple of Amon at Siwa Oasis in 1811 have been also been attributed to the 1810 event, rather than a separate earthquake, which is now regarded as a 'spurious event'. Characteristics The earthquake was widely felt, and recorded from as far away as Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, central Italy and various parts of North Africa. The main shock is reported to have lasted for two minutes in Malta. There are reports of a tsunami, with waves being recorded in the harbours of Malta and Alexandria and nearby canals, although these have more the character of seiches.

Biography Godolphin was the second son of Sir William Godolphin (died 1613) of Godolphin, Cornwall, by his wife, Thomasin, and was baptised on 15 January 1610. He was admitted a commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, 25 June 1624, aged 18,'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500‚Äì1714: Gilpin-Greenhaugh', Alumni Oxonienses 1500‚Äì1714: Abannan-Kyte (1891), pp. 569‚Äì599.

He was elected Member of Parliament MP for Helston in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Godolphin was elected again as MP for Helston to the Short Parliament in March 1640, and to the Long Parliament in October 1640. He was known as an adherent of Strafford, and was one of the last royalist members to leave the house. When the civil war broke out, he made a final speech of warning, and left to raise a force in Cornwall. Despite his diminutive stature he, refusing an officer's commission and choosing to serve as a trooper, joined the cavalry of the army commanded by Sir Ralph Hopton, which crossed the Tamar and advanced into Devon. History of Parliament Online article. Their declaration signed by Godolphin is in ‚ÄòLismore Papers‚Äô. Godolphin, whose advice, according to Clarendon, was highly valued by the commanders in spite of his lack of military experience, was shot in a skirmish at Chagford. Godolphin and three other Royalist commanders, all who were killed during the Civil War, were known as the \\"Wheels on Charles's Wain\\". A seventeenth century ode included the distich: :\\"Gone the four wheels of Charles's wain, :Grenville, Godolphin, Slanning, Trevanion slain\\" Godolphin was buried in the chancel of Okehampton Church on 10 February 1643.

It is part of the university's Faculty of Fine Arts and Music. It is located near the Melbourne city centre on the Southbank campus of the university. Courses and training offered at the VCA cover eight academic disciplines: dance, film and television, drama, Indigenous arts, music theatre, production, theatre, visual art, and writing, alongside the Centre for Ideas and the Wilin Centre for Indigenous Arts and Cultural Development. The library on the Southbank campus is known as the Lenton Parr Music, Visual and Performing Arts Library. History The Victorian College of the Arts was established in 1972 by a government order under the Victorian Institute of Colleges Act 1955, initiated by the Premier of Victoria and Minister for the Arts, Rupert Hamer. Subsequently, in 1973 the VCA was affiliated as a college of advanced education with the Victorian Institute of Colleges. The National Gallery of Victoria Art School, founded in 1867 to teach fine art, was the VCA's foundation school. This was followed by the establishment of the School of Music in 1974, the School of Drama in 1976, the School of Dance in 1978 and Film and Television (1992). Elisabeth Murdoch Building at the VCA on St Kilda Road Also in 1978, the Victorian Education Department under the direction of the Deputy Premier and Minister of Education, Lindsay Thompson, established the Victorian College of the Arts Technical School, a government secondary school for dancers and musicians (see VCASS) in close association with the VCA and located on the same campus. In March 1981, the Minister for the Arts, Norman Lacy, had the Victorian College of the Arts Act passed through the Victorian Parliament.https://archive.org/stream/VictorianCollegeOfTheArtsBill-2ndReadingSpeech/VictorianCollegeOfTheArtsBill#page/n0/mode/1up Its purpose was the reconstitution of the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) made necessary by the repeal in 1980 of the Victorian Institute of Colleges Act and to make it \\"better able to provide for the preparation of young people to enter upon careers as professional artists. It also represents a most significant development for the Victorian Arts Centre.\\"The Victorian College of the Arts Bill Explanatory Second Reading Speech by the Hon. Norman Lacy, M.P. Minister for the Arts in the Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of Victoria on 19 March 1981. Lacy laid out a rationale for the re-constitution of the college under a VCA specific act which was derived firstly \\"from the quite specific demands and circumstances of preparing young artists for professional practise.\\" He asserted that \\"the basic concept upon which the college is built is that young artists intending to enter careers as practitioners in their various fields are best assisted to achieve their ambitions in a milieu of continuous artistic activity and endeavour of a fully professional nature. To the extent that artistic education is separated from normal professional practice it is so much less effective.\\" Secondly, the rationale related to the adjacent location of the VCA campus to the National Gallery of Victoria and the Victorian Arts Centre. He said that this \\"Greater Arts Centre concept is central to the Government's decision to reconstitute the college by separate statute as well as to the development of the arts in general. It represents a simple, readily achievable and highly effective means of creating a substantial milieu of continuous professional activity of the highest standards. It also has ramifications which extend far beyond the college and its partner institutions. Its implementation will shape and invigorate the arts in many ways and lead to a dynamic, cultural and social facility without peer in Australia\\" and that it \\"afforded an unparalleled opportunity and challenge to present total programmes in the arts which should encourage creative exchanges between the art forms, give inspiration to students of the arts and provide for the public an experience which few places in the world can match.\\" The government therefore believed that the VCA's role was substantially different from other educational institutions. On 1 January 1992 further expansion of the college took place when the fine arts programs of the former Faculty of Art and Design, Victoria College (formerly Prahran College of Advanced Education), were incorporated into the School of Art. At the same point in time in 1992 the Swinburne Film and Television School, established as Australia's first Film school in 1966, also transferred to the VCA.For more on the Film and Television School see the book Paterson, Barbara, Renegades: Australia's first film school: from Swinburne to VCA, Helicon Press, 1996 The VCA's School of Film and Television remained at Hawthorn until 1 July 1994 when it moved into a purpose-built federally funded building on the VCA campus at Southbank. =Association with the University of Melbourne= In 2006 the VCA became an affiliated college of the University of Melbourne, and on 1 January 2007 the VCA became known as the Faculty of the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne. In April 2009 the school became part of the new Faculty of the VCA and Music (VCAM). The School of Music was amalgamated with the University of Melbourne's Faculty of Music and the VCA Secondary School was separated and given a new campus.

A portion of the funding is to be spent acquiring and redeveloping the nearby Dodds Street Stables of the Victoria Police mounted branch. Major contributors include the Myer Foundation, the Ian Potter Foundation and Martyn and Louise Myer, their combined donation totalling $10 million. Deans or heads The policy of the VCA has always been to enrol only those students who demonstrate the talent and dedication essential for courses as practising artists and performers.

Biography Monast on √âsot√©risme Exp√©rimental speaking to host Richard Glenn. In the 1970s and 1980s, Monast was a journalist, poet and essayist. He was an active member of the Social Credit Party of Canada. In the early 1990s, he started writing on the theme of the New World Order and conspiracies hatched by secret societies, being particularly inspired by the works of William Guy Carr. He founded the International Free Press Agency (AIPL, l' Agence Internationale de Presse libre), where he published most of his work on these themes, achieving some prominence with an interview on esotericist and ufologist Richard Glenn's TV show √âsot√©risme Exp√©rimental, in which he repeatedly warned his audience about the dangers of a World Government.Serge Monast (√âsot√©risme Exp√©rimental) He was interviewed by Glenn a number of times up to 1996. In 1994, he published Project Blue Beam (NASA), in which he detailed his claim that NASA, with the help of the United Nations, was attempting to implement a New Age religion with the Antichrist at its head and start a New World Order, via a technologically simulated Second Coming of Christ. He also gave talks on this topic.e.g. NASA's Project Blue Beam (transcript of tape, 1994) Other conspiracy theorists have notedProject Blue Beam Exposed!

In 1995, he published his most detailed work, Les Protocoles de Toronto (6.6.6), modelled upon The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, wherein he said a Masonic group called \\"6.6.6\\" had, for twenty years, been gathering the world's powerful to establish the New World Order and control the minds of individuals. By 1995 and 1996, Monast said he was being hunted by the police and authorities for involvement in \\"networks of prohibited information.\\" He had homeschooled his two children, who were then taken away and made wards of the state in September 1996 so that they would receive a public education.

Koppen (1901 - 1991 ) was an American aircraft engineer.  Early life  Otto Koppen graduated with a Bachelor of Science from MIT in 1924.  MIT  Koppen was the professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1929 Koppen returned to teach stability and control at MIT, where he remained until his retirement in 1965 As part of the course, Koppen took students up in a Fairchild 24 to demonstrate stability principles. In 1936, Koppen published a paper called \\"SMART AIRPLANES FOR DUMB PILOTS\\". In 1939, a student brought a model of the new Curtiss XSB2C-1 to the MIT wind tunnel. Koppen was quoted as saying, \\"if they build more than one of these, they are crazy\\". He was referencing controlability issues with the small vertical tail. The eventual production aircraft did have issues, and needed over 880 modifications before entering combat in WWII. =Project Whirlwind= In 1944 America recognized a need for a universal flight trainer more advanced than the analog Link Trainer. What started as the development of the Aircraft Stability and Control Analyzer (ASCA) for the Navy became \\"Project Whirlwind\\". Headed by Captain Luis deFlorez, Otto Koppen, John R. Markham, and Joseph Bicknell put together the requirements for a simulator that factored in winds and aerodynamic forces. The byproduct that was developed to compute the data was one of America's first high-speed, prototypical, digital computer.http://computerrefuge.org/bitsavers/pdf/mit/whirlwind/Redmond_Project_Whirlwind_A_Case_History_In_Contemporary_Technology_1975.pdf Koppen took a two-year break from teaching after the loss of his daughter in a flight accident involving loss of control in low visibility conditions. Koppen promised his wife never to fly again afterward, but restarted after her death. Koppen flew a Grumman Yankee and experimented with wing-leveling and other controls. Koppen acquired his FAA instrument rating at the age of eighty. At one point Koppen was the oldest instrument rated pilot in America. Koppen is regarded as providing the basis for most stability and control research since the 1930s.  Designer  After a fire at the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company, which destroyed the Ford 3-AT Trimotor prototype, Tom Towle hired MIT graduate Otto Koppen, John Lee, and James Smith McDonnell (co- founder of what is now McDonnell Douglas). Koppen, along with Harold Hicks and Tom Towle, are credited with refining the Stout-designed Ford 3-AT into the well known Ford Trimotor.http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/classic/ford-tri- motor.htm In 1926, Koppen designed the Ford Flivver. As the first criterion for the design was that it had to fit in an office, his first task was measuring the dimensions of Ford‚Äôs office.http://www.airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/Ford- EAA%20Chapt%20_159%20Flivver.asp Koppen designed the Fairchild FT-1 in 1929. The aircraft was the model for the Fairchild Model 21, a two-seat low-wing aircraft that bore a similarity to the Ford Flivver. Production was halted during the depression.http://www.aerofiles.com/_fair.html In 1943 Koppen was brought on as an engineer to help design larger cargo aircraft for the Franklin Institute for 20,000 dollars a year. He was a designer for General Aircraft Corporation. Koppen designed an early two-control aircraft, the General Skyfarer. Using just ailerons and elevators for directional control. 17 were built. The aircraft was later licensed as the Mars M1-80 Skycoupe, but did not go into production. In 1949, Koppen, and Lynn Bollinger formed the Helio Corporation of Massachusetts. They developed a \\"helioplane\\" prototype for a cost of 6000 dollars that was built based on a modified Piper Vagabond with a short wing, with leading edge slats, with high lift and STOL capabilities.\\"Flying the World's Slowest Airplane\\", Popular Science, March 1956 Greater Boston Metropolitan Airport fixed-base operator, E.W. Wiggins Airways converted the Piper PA-17 Vagabond with volunteer assistance to make the 2-place Helio No.1. Koppen also served as test pilot. This aircraft was the basis for the Helio Courier series of aircraft. The Helio Aircraft Corporation was formed in 1950 after merging with Midwest Aircraft Corporation, the company produced a variety of types for the Navy. The prototype aircraft \\"Helio-1\\" has been donated the National Air and Space Museum in 1963. Koppen developed a simplified autopilot that could be affordable enough to be used by general aviation aircraft. The bang-bang, or discontinuous, control device featured an innovative use of a tilted gyroscope that sensed roll and yaw, to provide input to the autopilot. After his formal NACA report was published, his ability to file for a patent was nullified. In 1991 EAA Chapter 159 from Midland, Michigan, donated a replica Ford Flivver to the EAA Airventure Museum.

Life Born and raised in London, Forrester attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School from 1960 to 1966 and read natural sciences at King's College, Cambridge (1967‚Äì70), graduating with a First in Part II History and Philosophy of Science. In Cambridge he was taught by Gerd Buchdahl, Mary Hesse and Robert M. Young. In 1970‚Äì72, as a graduate student in the History of Science Program at Princeton University, he took courses with Thomas Kuhn, Gerald Geison, Theodore M. Brown and Charles Coulston Gillispie. In 1972 he spent six months teaching science in London secondary schools and in 1973‚Äì74 worked for the Science Policy Foundation. From 1973 to 1976 he was a graduate student at King's College, Cambridge, a junior research fellow in the college (1976‚Äì80) and a senior research fellow (1980‚Äì84); during this time he researched in Vienna (1975) and while in Paris (1977‚Äì78), attached to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, was much influenced by the lectures of Michel Foucault at the Coll√®ge de France. In 1984, he was appointed to a university lectureship in history and philosophy of science at Cambridge, was promoted to reader in 1996 and to professor in 2000. He was head of department from 2007 to 2013. He was visiting professor at the Institute of Logic and the Epistemology of the Human Sciences, University of Campinas, Brazil (1988); visiting professor at the Institut f√ºr Wissenschafts- und Technikforschung, University of Bielefeld in Germany (1997); research scholar, Getty Research Institute in the History of Art and the Humanities, Santa Monica, California (1998); Whitney J.

He taught at the School of Criticism and Theory when it was located at Dartmouth College (1995). Work Much of his research was devoted to the history of psychoanalysis and the life and work of Sigmund Freud; he also studied the work of Jacques Lacan for many years, including co-translating two of Lacan's Seminars. His PhD thesis became his first published book, Language and the Origins of Psychoanalysis (1980), which argued for the considerable influence of the sciences of language, from neurology (aphasia) to philology, on the development of Freud's psychoanalysis. Freud's Women (1992), co-written with Lisa Appignanesi, explored the part that women played in Freud's work and the history of psychoanalysis, from patients to practitioners, including the extensive debates over the nature of femininity that took place in Freud's work, during his lifetime and in second wave feminism of the 1960s and 1970s. He has also published three collections of papers: The Seductions of Psychoanalysis. Freud, Lacan and Derrida (1990); Dispatches from the Freud Wars. Psychoanalysis and its Passions (1997), about the so-called Freud Wars, in which he contends with some contemporary critiques of psychoanalysis (Stanley Fish, Adolf Gr√ºnbaum, Frederick Crews, Frank Sulloway, criticising their outmoded conceptions of science, and the sterility of contemporary debates concerning the scientific status of psychoanalysis;Dispatches from the Freud Wars. Psychoanalysis and Its Passions By John Forrester. and Truth Games. Lies, Money, and Psychoanalysis (1997). He had extensive interests in cases as a genre and as a style of reasoning, linked to the prominence of the case history in psychoanalytic work and writing, and has published a series of papers on cases, including the influential 'If p then what?

Timms is credited as one of the first of a wave of promoters to launch public amateur food contests in New York City and throughout the United States in the early 2000s. Food contests Timms' first \\"Takedown\\" was a \\"Chili Takedown\\" in New York City in 2004. Tofu, Fondue, Cookie and Grits Takedowns followed, as well as a \\"Lamb Takedown\\", the \\"Brooklyn Beer Experiment\\", and the \\"Park Slope Pork Off\\". Hormel meats later sponsored a \\"Bacon Takedown\\". Timms says his events are a reaction to the more midwestern sensibilities of nationwide contests such as the Pillsbury Bake-Off, and the more structured, rules-oriented approach of the American Chili Society's sanctioned chili cookoffs. The Takedowns have become popular among what the New York Times describes as \\"obsessive home cooks\\" and \\"sustainability enthusiasts\\", due in part to Internet social connections. In addition to New York, takedowns have also been held in Boston, Massachusetts, Nashville, Tennessee, Saint Paul, Minnesota, and San Francisco, California. In the lamb event, sponsored by the American Lamb Board, contestants are each given fifteen pounds of lamb to cook how they see fit, with awards from expert judges, as well as a people's choice award by vote of those who have paid to attend the event.

Leighton Kenneth Leighton (2 October 1929 ‚Äì 24 August 1988) was a British composer and pianist. He had various academic appointments in the Universities of Leeds, Oxford and Edinburgh. His compositions include church and choral music, pieces for piano, organ, cello, oboe and other instruments, chamber music, concertos, symphonies, and an opera. Biography Leighton was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 2 October 1929, to parents of modest means, who noted his musical ability early on and enrolled him as a chorister at Wakefield Cathedral. Encouraged by his mother and the parish priest (who helped obtain a piano), he began piano lessons and progressed precociously. In 1940, he gained a place at the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, played at school assemblies and concerts, and composed settings of poetry for voice and piano and solo piano pieces (including the Sonatina Op.1a, 1946, his first published work). While still at school (in 1946) he obtained the Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music (LRAM) in piano performance. With the benefit of a State scholarship to study Classics at University, Leighton was admitted to the Queen's College, Oxford in 1947, where he also won a Hastings Scholarship, obtaining a BA in Classics in 1950. After commencing his Classics degree he began to study simultaneously for a degree in Music, tutored by the composer Bernard Rose, and gained the Oxford Bachelor of Music in 1951. At Oxford he came to the attention of Gerald Finzi, an early supporter and friend, who performed some of his works (e.g. Symphony for Strings, Op.3, 1949) with the Newbury String Players and introduced him to Vaughan Williams, who facilitated and attended some of his performances in London.D. McVeagh, 2005, Gerald Finzi. His Life and Music, Boydell Press, 182, 194; K. Leighton, Memories of Gerald Finzi http://www.geraldfinzi.org/01-about/articles_03.php; cf. in R. Jordan (ed.), 2007, The Clock of the Years. A Gerald and Joy Finzi Anthology, Chosen Press, 45-6. GF's letters to Leighton are in Leeds University Library \\"Kenneth Leighton collection\\". Leopold Stokowski premiered his overture Primavera Romana (Op.14) with the Royal Philharmonic in Liverpool in 1951. In the same year he was awarded a Mendelssohn Scholarship, which enabled him to study with Goffredo Petrassi in Rome,He applied initially to study with Luigi Dallapiccola, who was unable to take him on. Largely on Leighton's instigation, Dallapiccola was awarded an honorary doctorate by Edinburgh University, where they met in 1973. where he met his first wife, Lydia Angela Vignapiano, by whom he had two children (Angela and Robert). On his return from Italy in 1952, Leighton taught briefly at the Royal Marine School of Music in Deal. He held a Gregory Fellowship in music from 1953‚Äì56 at the University of Leeds, and in 1956 was appointed Lecturer, then Reader, in Music at the University of Edinburgh. In 1968, he moved to Oxford University, where he succeeded Edmund Rubbra as Fellow in Music of Worcester College. Leighton returned to Edinburgh as Reid Professor of Music in 1970, holding the chair until his death in 1988.Music Web International; Smith 2004, 8 He married Josephine Anne Prescott in 1981. Unlike most of his Oxford contemporaries, Leighton came from a working-class area of an industrial northern town; so his early rise to prominence is all the more remarkable.For Finzi's visit to the Wakefield home, see McVeagh 2005, 215. And: https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2438315 Although he spent much of his adult life in Scotland, he always regarded himself as a down-to-earth Yorkshireman. He eschewed the possibility of a career as a pianist, hoping that a University position would allow him greater creative freedom and time to compose, although he periodically gave recitals and broadcasts, and occasionally conducted the University orchestra. After the spell in Italy, his life was dominated by composing, which continued uninterrupted, notwithstanding an unsettled period in the late 1970s and early 1980s associated with divorce and remarriage. Leighton was a rather private man, averse to self-promotion and slightly shy of social occasions, who treasured peace and quiet, although he enjoyed family life and teaching (notably harmony and counterpoint). For most of his career he managed to reconcile university commitments with composing, but found this increasingly difficult in later years and was intending to retire early to have more time for composition. Indeed, Leighton never felt entirely at home or at ease with the title of 'university professor' and became increasingly disenchanted with the burden of administrative duties at Edinburgh. At Leeds he formed friendships with the poet Geoffrey Hill and the painters Terry Frost and Maurice de Sausmarez. A lasting friendship with the Wallfisch family (musicians Peter, Raphael and Anita Lasker-Wallfisch) also dates from this period. Amongst his distinguished students at Oxford and Edinburgh were Donald Runnicles, Nicholas Cleobury, and the composer Nigel Osborne, who succeeded him as Reid professor at Edinburgh. James MacMillan also studied at Edinburgh during Leighton's tenureR.Dunnett \\"Learning with Leighton\\", The Full Score (Novello) Winter 1998, 103; P. Spicer, 2011, Invocation. Choral Music by Kenneth Leighton and James MacMillan, REG CD348, p.3. and described him as \\"a marvellous teacher\\". While Leighton wrote a good deal of church music (and has occasionally been categorised too reductively as a church-music composer), he was not a church-goer or member of any congregation, nor even conventionally religious. His interests in literature and love of nature and countryside are reflected in the settings of English poetry in many works, such as Symphonies 2 and 3 (Opp.69 & 90) and Earth, Sweet Earth (Op.94).Earth, Sweet Earth, \\"monumental in concept and execution\\" (ABACUS CD 109-2; Linn CKD329), using poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins; Symphony 3 (CHAN8741) has a setting of 'A Musical Instrument' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning; \\"Animal Heaven\\" (Op.83) has settings by the Americans, Walt Whitman and James Dickey (MetierCD MSV92036). Fond of walking his dog on the hills, Leighton loved the Scottish highlands and frequently visited the western islands (in the 1960s often in an old camper van). Trips to Mull and Iona in the early 1970s foreshadow the opera Columba (Op.77, 1978). He also had friends on the island of Arran, which he visited regularly. He died at home in Edinburgh in 1988, six months after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. His grave is in the Glen Sannox cemetery on Arran. Music Leighton's earliest youthful works, characteristic of his Oxford years and well exemplified by Veris Gratia (Op.9, 1950), were influenced in part by the English tradition as represented by Vaughan Williams, Finzi, Herbert Howells, and Walton.Veris Gratia (RLPO/Handley/Wallfisch/Caird CHANDOS 8471), posthumously dedicated to Finzi, received various performances under Finzi's baton with Jacqueline du Pr√© and Anna Shuttleworth as soloists. His own more distinctive style, however, emerged and consolidated rapidly between 1950 and 1955, and probably owes as much to the period of study with Petrassi in Italy and familiarity with the work of a wide range of 20th-century European composers. He maintained a lifelong passion for the music of Bach (cf. his award-winning Fantasia Contrappuntistica Op.24, 1956).Subtitled 'Homage to Bach', also a reference to Busoni, this won the Busoni prize for composition at the competition in Bolzano in 1956, where it was premiered by a very young Maurizio Pollini. A few pieces reflect experimentation or flirtation with serialism, although Leighton's works are more generally typified by a strong sense of lyricism, diatonicism, contrapuntal mastery, chromaticism and rhythmic invention. He composed a wide range of music (over 100 works, 96 with opus numbers, below) for many different configurations of instruments, often for commissions, specific occasions and performers. His output includes church music, chamber, organ and solo piano music, as well as large-scale orchestral works and an opera (Op.77, 1978) based on the life of Columba (libretto by the poet Edwin Morgan).First performed in Glasgow theatre Royal in 1981, Roderick Brydon conducted; performed again in Glasgow Cathedral in 1986 and 1990 The sacred and liturgical music is widely known and performed regularly across the UK (and extensively recorded, e.g. on Chandos, Hyperion, Naxos, ASV, Priory labels).P. Hardwick, \\"The Liturgical Church Music of Kenneth Leighton, part 1\\", The Diapason, Feb 2005, 22‚Äì25; P. Hardwick, \\"The Liturgical Church Music of Kenneth Leighton, part 2\\", The Diapason, March 2005, 15‚Äì17 Leighton did much to keep alive and transform the Victorian tradition of English choral music, purge its piety and drag it into the (late) twentieth century.J. Craig- McFeely, 1993, Howells and Leighton, Sacred Choral Music, ASV CD DCA 851. See also H. Truscott, 1975, \\"Two traditionalists: Kenneth Leighton and John McCabe\\" in L. Foreman (ed), British Music Now: 145‚Äì54. London, Paul Elek. An enduringly popular early piece is \\"Lully, Lulla, Thou Little Tiny Child,\\" Op.25b, a setting of the Coventry Carol, while the hymn \\"Drop, drop, slow tears\\" (concluding Crucifixus pro nobis, Op.38, 1961) has also appeared in numerous recordings.E.g. Layton, Polyphony, Hyperion CDA66925; Spicer/Lumsden, Finzi Singers, Chandos 9485; C. Robinson, St John's, Cambridge, Naxos DDD8.555795; Scott, St Paul's Cathedral, Hyperion CDA66489; Shepherd, Schola Cantorum Oxford, Manor MLR0191; Jeffcoat, St.Catharine's, Cambridge, PRCD436; Rowland, Of a Rose, Christ's Cambridge REGCD243; Layton, Trinity College Cambridge, CDA68039. The boundaries between sacred, choral and secular music, however, are often blurred in Leighton's oeuvre, which makes extensive use of vocals. Hymns and chorales feature prominently in the instrumental music as well.P.Spicer, KL Premier Recordings, CHAN9132, p.3. A good example is 'The Shining River', which is at the core of the Fantasy on an American Hymn Tune (Op.70, for clarinet, cello and piano), and also permeates the 2nd Symphony (Op.69, below), juxtaposed with the Last Sermon of John Donne in the finale.Hilton/R.Wallfisch/P.Wallfisch, CHAN9132; Hickox/BBC Wales, Leighton Orchestral Works vol.2, CHAN10495. The solo piano music, which ranges from miniatures for younger players to demandingly advanced works, has been recorded by various artists (Eric Parkin, Peter Wallfisch, Margaret Fingerhut, Angela Brownridge, Stephen Hough),E.g. Parkin, Abacus ABA402-2; Fingerhut, Chandos CHAN9818, CHAN10601; Wallfisch, Chandos 9132; Hough, English Piano Album CDA67267; Brownridge, Delphian DCD34301. as also the works for organ, which include the celebratory Paean (1966), the duet Martyrs (Op.73), the Prelude, Scherzo and Passacaglia (Op.41), Missa de Gloria (Op.82) and an organ concerto with timpani (Op.58, cf. Poulenc), widely credited with injecting new life and vigour into the British organ repertoire of the late 20th century.F. Jackson, York Minster, Chandos 6602; J. Scott, Twentieth Century Organ Masterpieces, Priory PRCD643; Harrison/Leigh, Organ Duets, Lincoln Cathedral, Guild GMCD7368; Weaver, Indianapolis, Gothic G49060; Townhill, Complete Organ Works of KL, St. Mary's, Edinburgh, PRCD326. An acclaimed recording of the organ works (Gramophone editor's choice Sep 2014) is that by Stephen Farr on the Rieger organ of St.Giles, Edinburgh, Resonus10134. The works for cello (the lyrical Elegy (Op.5) written while he was a student) appear on various recordings, notably by Raphael Wallfisch; the cello concerto was premiered by Florence Hooton and Sir John Barbirolli in 1956.Wallfisch/Terroni BMS439CD; Naxos DDD8.571352; Thomson/Wallfisch/SNO Chandos8741. Chamber works include the prize-winning Piano Trio (Op.46), three string quartets, piano quintet and quartet, and the Fantasy Octet (Op.87), incorporating themes by Percy Grainger, commissioned for the 1982 Edinburgh Festival Grainger centenary concert.Themes of Grainger, Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Chandos 9346; Dutton Digital CDLX7118; Meridian CDE 84460 (Edinburgh Quartet); and CDE 84465. In recent years the larger-scale works have also become better known thanks to new recordings. Amongst these is the second symphony (Sinfonia mistica, Op.69, 1974), a meditation on death in memory of his mother (CHAN10495). Albeit a profoundly spiritual work, this does not lack theatrical flair, including two scherzos, with jazzy touches (taken as menacing by one reviewer), suggesting a composer with a sly sense of humour. The last piano pieces include three major works. They mark the culmination of a lifetime of writing for the instrument: a Sonata for Four Hands (Op.92, 1984/5) with jazzy rhythms and a haunting chorale;Written for the piano duo David Nettle & Richard Markham, who gave the first performances; H.&H.Davies;, 20th century piano duets, ASCCSCD12. a Prelude, Hymn and Toccata (Op.96, 1987) for two pianos, with a central Hymn (Abide with Me, heavily disguised), and final Toccata;Goldstone/Clemmow, Explorations, CD DivineArt25024. and the revelatory Four Romantic Pieces (Op.95, 1986), described by one reviewer as some of the most powerful and imaginative piano music of the late 20th century.P.

Early life He was born at Trevaunance, St Agnes, Cornwall, and baptised in its parish church on 26 September 1678, was the eldest son of Hugh Tonkin (1652‚Äì1711), vice-warden of the Stannaries 1701, and High Sheriff of Cornwall 1702, by his first wife, Frances (1662‚Äì1691), daughter of Walter Vincent of Trelevan, near Tregony. Tonkin matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 12 March 1693‚Äì4, and was entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn on 20 February 1694‚Äì5. At Oxford he associated with his fellow-collegian, Edmund Gibson, afterwards bishop of London, and with Edward Lhuyd, who between 1700 and 1708 addressed several letters to him in Cornwall and he was friendly with Bishop Thomas Tanner. Landowner Tonkin withdrew into Cornwall and settled on the family estate. From about 1700 to the end of his days he prosecuted without cessation his inquiries into the topography and genealogy of Cornwall, and he soon made 'great proficiency in studying the Welsh and Cornish languages'; but he quickly became involved in pecuniary trouble. To improve his property he obtained in 1706 the queen's sign-manual to a patent for a weekly market and two fairs at St. Agnes, but through the opposition of the inhabitants of Truro the grant was revoked. His progenitors had spent large sums from 1632 onwards in endeavouring to erect a quay at Trevaunance-porth. By 1710 he had expended ¬£6,000. upon it, but the estate afterwards fell 'into the hands of a merciless creditor,' and in 1730 the pier was totally destroyed 'for want of a very small timely repair and looking after'. Tonkin's wife was Elizabeth, daughter of James Kempe of the Barn, near Penryn. Thomas Worth, jun., of that town, and Samuel Kempe of Carclew, an adjoining mansion, were his brothers-in-law. He had by these connections much interest in the district, and from 12 April 1714 at a by-election, to the dissolution on 5 January 1714‚Äì15, he represented in parliament the borough of Helston. Alexander Pendarves, whose widow afterwards became Mrs. Delany, was his colleague in parliament and his chief friend; they were 'Cornish squires of high tory repute'. On the death of the last of the Vincents, Tonkin dwelt at Trelevan for a time; but the property was too much encumbered for him to retain the freehold. The latter part of his life was passed at Polgorran, in Gorran parish, another of his estates. He died there, and was buried at Gorran on 4 January 1741‚Äì2. His wife predeceased him on 24 June 1739. They had several children, but the male line became extinct on the death of Thomas Tonkin, their third son. Works and writings Tonkin put forth in 1737 proposals for printing a history of Cornwall, in three volumes of imperial quarto at three guineas; and on 19 July 1736 he prefixed to a collection of modern Cornish pieces and a Cornish vocabulary, which he had drawn up for printing, a dedication to William Gwavas of Gwavas, his chief assistant (this dedication was sent by Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte on 30 November 1861 to the Cambrian Journal, and there reprinted to show the indebtedness to Tonkin's labours of William Pryce). Neither of these contemplated works saw the light. On 25 February 1761 Dr. Borlase obtained from Tonkin's representative the loan of his manuscripts, consisting 'of nine volumes, five folios, and four quartos, partly written upon,' a list of which is printed in the 'Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall,'. On the death of Tonkin's niece, Miss Foss, in 1780, the manuscripts of the proposed history of Cornwall became the property of Lord de Dunstanville, who allowed Davies Gilbert to edit and to embody them in his history of the county 'founded on the manuscript histories of Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin' (1838, 4 vols.). Dunstanville published in 1811 an edition of Richard Carew's Survey of Cornwall, with Notes illustrative of its History and Antiquities by Thomas Tonkin. Those on the first book of the Survey were evidently prepared for publication by Tonkin, and the other notes were selected from the manuscripts. His journal of the convocation of Stannators in 1710 was added to it. Tonkin's manuscript history passed from Lord de Dunstanville to Sir Thomas Phillipps, and was sold by Messrs. Sotheby & Co. for ¬£51 to Mr. Quaritch on 7 June 1898. Two volumes of Tonkin's Alphabetical Account of all the Parishes in Cornwall, down to the letter O, passed to William Sandys, and then to William Copeland Borlase, from whom they went into the museum of the Royal Institution of Cornwall at Truro. Four of the later parts were presented to the same body by the Rev. F. W. Pye, and another page by Sir John Maclean. Several manuscripts transcribed by Tonkin are in Addit. MS. 33420 at the British Museum, and numerous letters by him, in print and in manuscript, are mentioned in the Bibliotheca Cornubiensis. Tonkin gave much aid to Browne Willis in his Parochiale Anglicanum. Polwhele called Tonkin 'one of the most enlightened antiquaries of his day.‚Äô References ;Attribution * Further reading A fuller biography can be found in an article by H. L.

The historian Eveline Cruickshanks called him \\"one of the most zealous Jacobites in England\\".Eveline Cruickshanks, Political Untouchables: The Tories and the '45 (Duckworth, 1979), p. 40. Early life Cotton was baptized on 7 April 1686, the eldest and only surviving son of Sir John Cotton, 2nd Baronet, of Landwade and Madingley Hall, Cambridgeshire who had been MP for Cambridge. He was educated at Westminster School and was admitted at Emmanuel College, Cambridge on 29 September 1701 and awarded MA in 1705. He succeeded to the baronetcy and Madingley Hall on the death of his father on 15 January 1713. He adopted the surname of Hynde Cotton in deference to the Hynde family, traditional owners of the Hall. Politics Cotton was returned as the Member of Parliament for Cambridge for 1708‚Äì1722 followed by terms as the member for Cambridgeshire for 1722‚Äì1727, Cambridge again for 1727‚Äì1741 and Marlborough for 1741‚Äì1752. After an MP deserted the Tories and made a speech loyal to Sir Robert Walpole, Cotton criticised him to Walpole, saying \\"That young dog promised that he would always stand by us.\\" Sir Robert replied: \\"I advise my young men never to use always.\\" \\"Yet\\", said Cotton, stammering, \\"you yourself are very apt to make use of all ways.\\"Horace Walpole, Memoirs of King George II. I: January 1751 - March 1754 (Yale University Press, 1985), p. 21, n. 10. Horace Walpole wrote that Cotton \\"had wit and the faithful attendant of wit, ill nature; and was the greatest master of the arts of the House, where he seldom made but short speeches, having a stammering in his elocution, which however he knew how to manage with humour. In the end of Queen Anne's reign he was in place; during Sir Robert Walpole's administration constantly and warmly in opposition; and was so determined a Jacobite, that though on the late coalition he accepted a place in the household and held it two years, he never gave a vote with the court, which argued nice distinction, not only in taking the oaths to the King (for that all the Jacobites in Parliament do) but in taking his pay and yet obstructing his service: and as nice in the King's ministers, who could discover the use of making a man accept a salary, without changing his party\\".Walpole, pp. 21-22. Private life Madingley Hall, Cambridgeshire Cotton married firstly (with c.¬£8,500) Lettice Crowley, daughter of Sir Ambrose Crowley of Greenwich on 24 May 1714. She died in August 1718 and he married secondly Margaret Craggs, the daughter of James Craggs on 3 June 1724. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his only surviving son, John Hynde Cotton, child of his first wife. They lived at Madingley Hall for 40 years during which time he transformed it from a panelled Tudor house into a Baroque building.

It has been designated a SSSI as an oligotrophic mire rich in Sphagnum moss, and other plant and animal life are present in sufficient numbers and rarities for it to have been designated as a protected area since 1968. Cop Mere was created as a hollow in the Keuper marl of North Staffordshire/South Cheshire (which was laid down approx 200 million years ago, roughly) as a result of the retreat of the last ice age. It differs from other ponds and meres in the region because it sits on the route of the River Sow, the flow of which encourages the growth of algae necessary for the growth of freshwater mosses. The River Sow has been dammed upstream at Jackson's coppice from around AD 1250, which altered the flow of water and created a unique albeit man-made environment that encourages birdlife and fishlife. There is evidence that fishing in Cop Mere dates back at least to the reign of Henry VIII. Entomologists have recorded the presence of two uncommon species each of beetle and fly. The SSSI also includes a number of plants currently rare in Staffordshire, specifically herb paris (Paris quadrifolia) and the thin-spiked wood sedge, Carex strigosa. Birds commonly found on the mere include the reed warbler and sedge warbler, the great crested grebe and the little grebe, the sparrowhawk, and three woodpecker, species including the lesser spotted woodpecker. Cop Mere is used for coarse fishing and the British record for rod caught common bream has twice been held by fish landed at Cop Mere, although today the main fish angled for is the tench while there are also perch, roach and pike in the mere's waters.

Description  Sphaerocarpos texanus are small, thalloid, dioecious liverworts. The species is sexually dimorphic, with male plants usually 3‚Äì5 mm in diameter, females up to 12 mm in diameter. Both male (bearing antheridia) and female (bearing archegonia) plants are bright green, with the thallus branching up to several times. The plant is a winter annual, appearing in autumn and dying in spring. Notably, the spores occur in sets of four, called tetrads. Unlike most other species of liverwort, the spores stay in these tetrads until they germinate.  Habitat  The plant is found on flat, lightly shaded soil. Usually by roadsides.  Distribution  Sphaerocarpos texanus has a wide range, probably the widest of any species in its genus. It has been found on several continents, in the United States, Uruguay, England, Germany, France and Morocco.

His portrait by Vandyck was formerly displayed at Tehidy (now demolished). He appears to have been a sportsman, much addicted to hawking and cock-fighting. He was the son of Revd. James Bassett of Tehidy and his wife Jane, the daughter of Sir Francis Godolphin. He served as Vice-Admiral of North Cornwall from 1623 to his death in 1645 and was High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1642‚Äì1644. There is a complaint against him in the Star Chamber, 18 May 1625. During the Civil War in 1643, he acted as a Royalist in the western part of Cornwall, raising money and drilling forces for the king. Letters of his to his wife ‚Äòat her Tehidy‚Äô are preserved, recording the Royalist victories of Stamford Hill near Stratton, and of Braddock Down near Lostwithiel, at the latter of which (or at any rate very shortly after the fight) he, with most of the Cornish gentry, was present, and was knighted on the field. He records in another letter to his wife that after the battle ‚Äòthe king, in the hearing of thousands, as soon as he saw me in the morning, cryed to mee ‚ÄúDeare Mr. Sheriffe, I leave Cornwall to you safe and sound‚Äù‚Äô. In 1640, he presented to the borough of St Ives a loving-cup bearing the following inscription: If any discord 'twixt my friends arise Within the borough of belov'd St. Ives, It is desir√®d this my cup of love To everie one a peace-maker may prove. Then am I blest to have given a , So like my harte, unto posteritie. Personal life In 1620, Bassett married Ann Trelawny, a daughter of Sir Jonathan Trelawny (1568-1604) of Trelawny, Cornwall. Their children included John Basset (died 1661), eldest son and heir and Francis Basset, second son, of Taunton, Somerset, a puritan who in 1661 was accused of a conspiracy against King Charles II, of which charge he was honourably acquitted after a letter which he was alleged to have written was proved a forgery. Bassett died 19 September 1645. The full vengeance of Cromwell fell upon his first son, although he had never taken up arms, who was compelled to compound for his estates, and had to sell St Michael's Mount in 1660 to a member of the St Aubyn family, in whose possession it has remained ever since.

Securities are issued under the authority and oversight of these bodies with the result that a broad range of rules apply to companies seeking to raise capital and to the parties acting as their agents in such transactions. However, there is a useful simplification that can be applied in Canada to provide some clarity for issuers - based on the criteria below securities issuers fall into two broad categories: Reporting Issuers (‚ÄúRI‚Äù) * prospectus offerings * exchange listed * highest level of mandatory regulatory compliance * higher G&A; * most expensive to raise capital Non- Reporting Issuers (‚ÄúNRI‚Äù) * exempt offerings (OM; accredited investors) * non-listed * lower level of mandatory regulatory compliance (mostly dictated by constating document of the issuer) * generally lower G&A; * generally less expensive to raise capital * tends to be smaller issuers with unique ideas or niche strategies Difference Between NRIs and RIs A common question is what are the differences between RIs and NRIs and does either type of security have clear benefits over the other?

His works, especially the Treaty of Discovery that was published in Lisbon in 1563 and in English by Richard Hakluyt in 1601, are notably accurate. Life Ant√≥nio Galv√£o was the son of Duarte Galv√£o, who was chief diplomat and chronicler to King Afonso V of Portugal. In 1527, Ant√≥nio Galv√£o sailed for Portuguese India where he became captain of Maluku and governor of the fort of Ternate from 1536 to 1540. He is described in Chapter II of the Fifth \\"Decade of Asia\\" as a respected governor, having sent a mission to Papua and received local embassies. He funded a seminar in Ternate, where he spent 12,000 cruzados from the inheritance he had received from his father, and was known for his integrity. In 1540, Galv√£o handed the governance of the fortress to D. Jorge de Castro and returned to Portugal, where he learned he had fallen into disgrace. He spent his last years in anonymity and poverty in the Royal Hospital awaiting a pension. He died in the hospital and was buried in 1557. Works Ant√≥nio Galv√£o left two manuscripts; one was the treaty of the discoveries that was printed in 1563 in Lisbon by his friend Francisco de Sousa Tavares. The work, which was based on numerous written sources and documents, presented for the first time a synthesis of all of the discoveries that were made by Portuguese and Spanish explorers until 1550. Richard Hakluyt had the treaty translated into English and published in 1601 as \\"The discoveries of the world - by Antonio Galvano\\". The second manuscript was a history of the Moluccas (Maluku) with the title: \\"Historia das Molucas, da natureza, e descubrimento daquellas terras divida em 10 livros\\". (\\"History of the Moluccas, nature and discovery of the lands divided into 10 books\\"). This remained unpublished; Francisco de Sousa Tavares passed the manuscript to the crown. It is referred to by 16th-century chroniclers Jo√£o de Barros and Jo√£o Baptista Lavanha; a good part of it is said to have been reproduced verbatim within Dami√£o de G√≥is's 1566-67 Chronica del rey D. Manuel but all trace of the original Galv√£o manuscript disappeared after G√≥is's death.Diogo Barbosa Machado (1741) Bibliotheca Lusitana, v.1, p.285 In 1928, a document was found in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville with a history of the Maluku that was identified as being part‚Äîperhaps an early draft‚Äîof Ant√≥nio Galv√£o's lost document. It was published in 1971 a in bilingual (Portuguese-English) edition that was arranged by Hubert Jacobs with the title A Treatise on the Moluccas (c. 1544), probably the preliminary version of Ant√≥nio Galv√£o's lost Historia das Moluccas (Rome: Jesuit Historical Society).

This structure varies from the 6/8/6 or 6/10/6-membered core ring found in conventional taxoids such as paclitaxel or docetaxel. The core carbon skeleton of a normal natural product taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) has a 6-membered A ring, 8-membered B ring and a 6-membered C ring, combined with conventional side chains. It is the side chains that provide most of the activity for regular taxanes. Abeotaxanes are compounds containing 3 altered ring structures, where ring A is 5 members, ring B is 7 members and ring C is 6 members, combined with conventional side chains. Like taxanes, abeotaxanes are diterpenes produced by the yew tree (genus Taxus). These agents inhibit the growth and replication of cancer cells by affecting microtubules. Taxanes are highly effective anti-cancer agents and are utilized as first and second-line therapy in the treatment of many solid-tumor cancers. Since the FDA approval of paclitaxel in 1998, subsequent research has focused on the synthesis of new and improved taxanes to address the issues of multi-drug resistance and central nervous system bioavailability, as well as on improvement of the side effect profile. Taxchinin A was the first naturally occurring rearranged taxoid identified as an 11(15‚Üí1)-abeotaxane. Taxchinin B was the first identified 11(15‚Üí1)-abeotaxoid with an oxetane ring. The first natural taxoid, identified to have an 11(15‚Üí1)-abeotaxane ring was brevifoliol. TPI 287 (formerly ARC-100), a 11(15‚Üí1)-abeotaxane that was in phase I clinical development in 2010, has demonstrated potent activity in multi-drug resistant tumor types, including taxane-resistant tumors, as well as efficacy in crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.

It is located at 32 Sevilla Street. It was dedicated to the memory of his daughter Jennie Louise Benedict, who died following complications from childbirth at sea in March 1889.  History  Flagler was a life-long member of the Presbyterian Church, and upon his daughter's death chose a plot of land on the corner of Sevilla and Valencia Streets, which was very near his hotels, to construct a new church building for the Presbyterian congregation in St. Augustine, the first in Florida. The building, the land it sits on, and the parsonage at the time were all donated to the Presbyterian Church and exchanged for land they owned on St. George and Hypolita Streets (Flagler would later build a Municipal building for the city on this site). Like Flagler's other St. Augustine buildings (the Hotel Ponce de Leon, the Hotel Alcazar, and Grace United Methodist Church), Memorial Presbyterian was designed by John M. Carrere and Thomas Hastings of Carrere and Hastings architecture firm in New York; however, it greatly differs in architectural style. The Venetian Renaissance style and Latin cross-shaped sanctuary was inspired by St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. It contains design elements of Spanish, Moorish, Italian, and Baroque style. The building was constructed by builders McGuire and McDonald using poured concrete mixed with coquina, a process also used in Flagler's other buildings as well as in Franklin W. Smith's nearby Villa Zorayda and Casa Monica Hotel. The cost of the construction was around $250,000. Many of the exterior architectural details were created with gold and white terracotta.Flagler's St. Augustine Hotels: The Ponce de Leon, the Alcazar, and the Casa Monica by Thomas Graham p. 57 The copper dome was created in Italy, the floors are Italian marble, the pews are carved from mahogany, and the baptismal font was carved from a single block of Siena marble. The baptismal font's inscription reads, \\"'In Memoriam‚ÄîF. H. B. to J. L, B.‚ÄîMarch 25th, 1889. I will be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. (Genesis 17:7)\\". The church was dedicated on March 16, 1890, and the ceremony was attended by many dignitaries, including First Lady Caroline Harrison, and Vice President Levi Morton. Stained glass windows designed by German artist Herman T. Schladermundt took twelve years to complete and were finally installed in 1901. When Flagler died in 1913, he was interred in a marble mausoleum connected to the church alongside his daughter Jennie, his infant granddaughter Margery, and first wife Mary Harkness Flagler.Legends and Tales: Remembering St. Augustine, Volume 2 By Karen Harvey p. 13 In 2012, CNN included Memorial Presbyterian in a list of one of the top eight religious wonders to visit in the United States. Following Hurricane Irma in 2017, Memorial Presbyterian's copper dome underwent a major restoration costing $3.5 million. The 900 pound cross that sat at the top of the dome fell and pierced several holes through the copper. The cross was removed while the dome was repaired, but was later returned. As of March 2019, the church is continuing renovation work to repair damage from Hurricane Matthew and Hurricane Irma. The current Pastor and Head of Staff is Flagler College graduate Rev. Dr. W. Hunter Camp, II. Free self-guided tours of the building are available to the public on Mondays-Saturdays from 11AM-3:45PM.

Pursuant to this goal new national securities regulations have been drafted - NI 31-103 National Instrument 31-103 to provide uniform requirements and categories of registration for dealers in exempt market securities across the country. Exempt Market Dealer Requirements NI 31-103 introduces consistent rules for Exempt Market Dealers concerning proficiency, conduct, capital and compliance requirements and makes it clear that EMDs are subject to the same know-your-client (‚ÄúKYC‚Äù) and suitability requirements as other dealer categories. Exempt market dealers, and the registered individuals who work for them, may act as a dealer or underwriter for any securities which are prospectus exempt, as a dealer for any securities sold to clients who qualify for purchase of exempt securities, and as a dealer for investment funds which are either prospectus qualified or prospectus exempt. Exempt market dealers are different than: -Full service investment dealers which engage in trading for all types of clients including retail clients and are required to be members of the self-regulatory organization, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC); -Mutual fund dealers which are restricted to trading in mutual funds and are required to be members of the self-regulatory organization, the Mutual Funds Dealers Association (MFDA); scholarship plan dealers which are restricted to trading in scholarship plans and educational trusts; and -Restricted dealers. Exempt market dealers must follow the same \\"Know Your Client\\" procedures as other registered dealers which ensures that each client's personal, financial and investment profile is understood and confirmed prior to any trading activity. Loewen, Jacoline (2008). Money Magnet: Attract Investors to Your Business. Canada, Toronto: John Wiley & Sons. Exempt market dealers must also ensure that any exempt security is suitable for a particular client by considering the particular investment product as well as each individual client's investment goals and profile. EMD advisors need to make sure their letters of engagement and investment policy statements clearly outline mutual expectations and the manner in which the advisor is being paid. There are key regulatory documents for EMDS. The applicable provincial and territorial securities legislation, regulations and rules for any person or firm will generally depend on the jurisdiction of residence of the investor and dealer or adviser and the jurisdiction in which the registerable activity occurs.

The simple, clapboard-covered dwellings were built in 1848 in what became known as Little Liberia, a neighborhood settled by free blacks starting in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. As the last surviving houses of this neighborhood on their original foundations, these were added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1999. and . The houses are the oldest remaining houses in Connecticut built by free blacks, before the state completed its gradual abolition of slavery in 1848. The homes and nearby Walter's Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church are also listed sites on the Connecticut Freedom Trail.  The Houses  The Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses are transitional late-Greek Revival/early-Victorian houses typical of their time and place. They are wood-frame structures built atop high masonry basements, necessitated by their location in a low-elevation shorefront environment. Mary's house, the northernmost, was erected first, begun in April 1848 and completed by the following September. It is of Italianate vernacular design. It is a double house, four bays in width, with opposite side entrances, and two stories in height over a full English basement. It is surmounted by a pair of low-pitched hip roofs, and there is a veranda across the facade. The interior has undergone very little remodeling from its time of construction, and retains original doors, mantels, and window and door casings. There are indications that it was originally constructed as a single- family house, and that that portion to the south was a subsequent addition. Eliza's house was built beginning in September 1848, and completed over the fall and winter months. It is a Greek Revival half-house, three bays wide with a side entrance and side-gable roof. An attic dormer in the Victorian Gothic style was added circa 1862. A storefront was extended out from the facade in 1903 that was removed in the summer of 2013. The interior was scorched by fire in the late 1980s; however, enough original fabric survives so that a complete restoration is feasible. The Owners The original owners, Mary (1815-1883) and Eliza (1805‚Äì1862) Freeman, were free women of color born in Derby, Connecticut, then a center in the state for the free African American population. In 1848, the year rail transportation was inaugurated between Bridgeport and New York, they purchased two adjoining building lots in the South End of Bridgeport. The sisters had houses built and initially leased them out as rental properties while they continued to live and work in New York City. Eliza Freeman returned to Bridgeport around 1855 to work as a domestic in the home of a well-to-do sea captain, and Mary (who is known to have been a hotel chef in the city) followed her around 1861. They both died quite well off for their times and situations (Mary's 1883 obituary in the Bridgeport Standard reads, 'Miss Mary Freeman, an old and well known colored lady, died at her residence at 114 Main Street yesterday ... The deceased ... had during her life accumulated considerable property, which is variously estimated from $30,000 to $50,000. She owned several houses on Main and Gregory Streets'), and as well-respected members of the community. The Little Liberia Community Little Liberia was first settled by African Americans in 1821, the year Bridgeport became a municipality independent of Stratford. This was one of several similar neighborhoods in urban centers in the Northeast where free blacks gathered to make progress socially and economically. Other African-American communities developed in cities with growing job markets in the same time period include Trowbridge Square in New Haven, Jail Hill in Norwich, the northern slope of Boston's Beacon Hill, Sandy Ground on New York's Staten Island, and Hard Scrabble in Providence, Rhode Island. According to oral tradition, the name \\"Little Liberia\\" came from the community's inhabitants identifying with the new African colony of Liberia, established for American free blacks and freed slaves in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. In 1831, Joel Freeman (1795-1865), brother of Mary and Eliza, purchased land where Whiting Street ended at Bridgeport Harbor; he moved a vacant shop building to the site and apparently converted it to his residence. In 1828‚Äîthe year he moved to Bridgeport from Derby‚Äîhe had been instrumental in establishing Zion Church, Fairfield County's first African-American congregation. The new organization erected a permanent home, officially the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, in 1835 at the southwest corner of Broad and Gregory streets. The church split into two societies in 1843, with a second edifice constructed at the northwest corner of Broad and Gregory. The smaller congregation retained the original building and became known as Ebeneezer (later Bethel) Church. The Stratfield Special School for Colored Children was built soon after (1845), following a petition for State funds by Joel Freeman, at the southeast intersection of Main and Whiting streets. Zion Church, later renamed Walters Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, reputedly served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. The AME Zion churches were part of an independent black denomination founded in 1787 in Philadelphia. By 1850, the Collins & Clark map showed the two churches on Broad Street, designated (improperly) North African Church and South African Church. In 1998, a 104-year-old resident, who had arrived in Bridgeport nearly a century earlier when her family moved north from Virginia, described her neighborhood: > Little Liberia was a close-knit, safe African-American community where > family life was highly respected and the spirit of the community was evident > and prevailed, even during hard times. First called \\"Ethiope,\\" the community developed as a village of free blacks, Native Americans, and Haitians. In addition to the churches and school, the village had its own commercial businesses, free lending library, and social organizations. In addition, there was a seaside resort hotel ('Duncan House') built in 1853 that catered to a well-to-do African American clientele from the major metropolitan centers of the Northeast. \\"Ethiopis,\\" as they were called, were in touch with other free black communities‚Äîfor instance, hosting lecturers from New York City and Brooklyn. In 1895, orator and author Willis Augustus Hodges, who had been an abolitionist in Brooklyn, New York,Edward Rothstein, \\"When Slavery and Its Foes Thrived in Brooklyn\\", New York Times, 17 January 2014 addressed the \\"Young Colored Men's Republican Club\\" of Bridgeport on the topic of not being misled by \\"Negro Democrats.\\" He spoke out against African Americans in New York and other mid-Atlantic states who were encouraging their fellows to vote for Democratic candidates. Hodges noted that the Democrats in the South had worked against African Americans to deprive them of suffrage and other rights. At the time, southern legislatures dominated by white Democrats were passing new constitutions and laws to disfranchise blacks throughout the South and prevent them from voting. Blacks were essentially shut out of the official political system in the South from the turn of the century until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Preservation By early 2010, the two Freeman houses had long been vacant, and in initial reports were said to be near collapse. For one, rebuilding, as opposed to restoration, was reported as possibly required (demolition of non-historic additions to the properties in the Summer of 2013 proved that both structures were, in fact, quite sound). At that time, Mayor Bill Finch announced $47,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds for the houses. A newly formed Mary & Eliza Freeman Center for History and Community set about fundraising, including appeals to organizations such as the 1772 Foundation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Freeman Center's goal is to operate these as a Little Liberia joint house museum, available to school groups and historical tours and researchers. The city sold the houses to the Freeman Center, clearing up a dispute over back taxes and fees with an earlier organization seeking to preserve the homes.

He also accompanied many other blues musicians, including Otis Spann, Willie Cobbs, Eddie Boyd, Roy Brown, Big Mama Thornton, John Lee Hooker, James Cotton and Junior Wells. Biography Lawhorn was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. His parents soon separated, and his mother remarried, leaving him in the care of his grandparents. He made his own diddley bow, nailing baling twine to the side of their house. He frequently visited his mother and stepfather in Chicago. They bought him a ukulele, then an acoustic guitar and finally an electric guitar. By the age of fifteen, he was proficient enough to accompany Driftin' Slim on stage. With further guidance from Sonny Boy Williamson II, Lawhorn began playing with him on the radio program King Biscuit Time. He was conscripted in 1953 and served in the United States Navy. On a tour of duty in Korea, he was injured by enemy fire during aerial reconnaissance. He remained in the Navy until his discharge in 1958. He then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he played on recordings with the \\"5\\" Royales, Eddie Boyd, Roy Brown and Willie Cobbs. An argument with Cobbs arose over the writing credits for the song \\"You Don't Love Me\\". Finding work on his own in Chicago in 1958, Lawhorn soon moved there, despite the theft of a guitar at one of his early club performances. By the early 1960s, Lawhorn had found regular work as a club sideman to Junior Wells, Otis Rush and Elmore James and sat in with Muddy Waters's band on a couple of occasions. By October 1964, he had been invited to become a full-time member of Waters's band. Over the next decade, he played on several of Waters's albums, including Folk Singer, Live at Mr. Kelly's and The London Muddy Waters Sessions. His guitar playing was also featured when the band supplied backing for John Lee Hooker, Big Mama Thornton and Otis Spann. Citing Lawhorn's use of the tremolo arm on his guitar and his overall playing expertise, Waters later referred to him as the best guitarist he ever had in his band. However, Lawhorn's career was beginning to be hampered by his drinking. He passed out on stage over his amplifier and off stage while sitting in clubs, and he missed some shows altogether. Waters lost patience and fired him in 1973. He was replaced by Bob Margolin. Lawhorn returned to playing in Chicago clubs and remained in the recording industry, contributing to Junior Wells's On Tap (1974) and James Cotton's Take Me Back (1987). He also played guitar on recorded work by Koko Taylor, Jimmy Witherspoon, Little Mack Simmons, and L. C. Robinson. Working in several Chicago haunts, he played alongside his childhood idols T-Bone Walker and Lightnin' Hopkins. He offered assistance to up-and-coming musicians, including John Primer, who became his disciple. Lawhorn's health began to fail as a result of alcoholism and arthritis. A factor contributing to his arthritis was his having broken bones in his feet and ankles when he was thrown from a third-floor window by a burglar. He died on April 29, 1990, at the age of 54. His death certificate cited death by natural causes.

More muscular and aggressive than the females of the species, the cows, bulls have long been an important symbol in many cultures, and play a significant role in beef ranching, dairy farming, and a variety of other cultural activities, including bull fighting and bull riding.  Nomenclature  The female counterpart to a bull is a cow, while a male of the species that has been castrated is a steer, ox,Delbridge, A, et al., Macquarie Dictionary, The Book Printer, Australia, 1991 or bullock, although in North America, this last term refers to a young bull, and in Australia to a draught animal. Use of these terms varies considerably with area and dialect. Colloquially, people unfamiliar with cattle may refer to both castrated and intact animals as \\"bulls\\". A wild, young, unmarked bull is known as a micky in Australia.Sheena Coupe (ed.), Frontier Country, Vol. 1 (Weldon Russell Publishing, Willoughby, 1989), Improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer, also known as a stag in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In some countries, an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig or ridgling. The word \\"bull\\" also denotes the males of other bovines, including bison and water buffalo, as well as many other species of large animals, including elephants, rhinos, seals and walruses, hippos, camels, giraffes, elk, moose, whales, and antelopes.  Characteristics  Scottish Highland bull Bulls are much more muscular than cows, with thicker bones, larger feet, a very muscular neck, and a large, bony head with protective ridges over the eyes. These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction.C. J. C. Phillips, Principles of Cattle Production (2010), p. 50. The hair is generally shorter on the body, but the neck and head often have a \\"mane\\" of curlier, wooly hair. Bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller, but because of the additional muscle and bone mass, they often weigh far more. Most of the time, a bull has a hump on his shoulders. In horned cattle, the horns of bulls tend to be thicker and somewhat shorter than those of cows,Klaus-Dieter Budras, et al, Bovine Anatomy: An Illustrated Text (2003), p. 36. and in many breeds, they curve outwards in a flat arc rather than upwards in a lyre shape. It is not true, as is commonly believed, that bulls have horns and cows do not: the presence of horns depends on the breed, or in horned breeds on whether the horns have been disbudded. (It is true, however, that in many breeds of sheep only the males have horns.) Cattle that naturally do not have horns are referred to as polled, or muleys. Castrated male cattle are physically similar to females in build and horn shape, although if allowed to reach maturity, they may be considerably taller than either bulls or cows, with heavily muscled shoulders and necks. = Reproductive anatomy = The reproductive system of a bull Bulls become fertile around seven months of age. Their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum; a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches ; that of a fully adult bull may be over .Bulls have a fibroelastic penis. Given the small amount of erectile tissue, little enlargement occurs after erection. The penis is quite rigid when not erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure. Bulls are occasionally affected by a condition known as \\"corkscrew penis\\". The penis of a mature bull is about 3‚Äì4 cm in diameter, and 80‚Äì100 cm in length. The bull's glans penis has a rounded and elongated shape. = Behavior = A common misconception widely repeated in depictions of bull behavior is that the color red angers bulls, inciting them to charge. In fact, like most mammals, cattle are red‚Äìgreen color blind. In bullfighting, the movement of the matador's cape, and not the color, provokes a reaction in the bull.  Management  = Beef production = Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years, except where they are needed (castrated) as work oxen for haulage. Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating,Castration of Calves Factsheet, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, June 2007. although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef. A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female, and produces proportionately more and leaner muscle. Frame score is a useful way of describing the skeletal size of bulls and other cattle. Frame scores can be used as an aid to predict mature cattle sizes and aid in the selection of beef bulls. They are calculated from hip height and age. In sales catalogues, this measurement is frequently reported in addition to weight and other performance data such as estimated breed value. = Temperament and handling = A bull paws up dust in a threat display A warning sign for a bull-occupied field Adult bulls may weigh between . Most are capable of aggressive behavior and require careful handling to ensure safety of humans and other animals. Those of dairy breeds may be more prone to aggression, while beef breeds are somewhat less aggressive, though beef breeds such as the Spanish Fighting Bull and related animals are also noted for aggressive tendencies, which are further encouraged by selective breeding. An estimated 42% of all livestock- related fatalities in Canada are a result of bull attacks, and fewer than one in 20 victims of a bull attack survives. Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the United States.Cumberland County (Pa.) Sentinel, Shippensburg, Pa., February 12, 2008 A farmer in Southampton County, Michigan, was killed by a 2000-lb Holstein bull in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in February, 2008.The Reading [Pennsylvania]Eagle, March 1, 2010 On February 28, 2010, a farmer near Reading, Pennsylvania was trampled and gored to death by a 2000-lb black Angus bull that he had been urged to get rid of by friends after earlier mishaps. Michelle Park, \\"Bull attacks, kills owner at South Heidelberg Township farm\\". The need to move a bull in and out of its pen to cover cows exposes the handler to serious jeopardy of life and limb.Alvin H. Clement, We Gotta Have More Jails, The Writer's Club Press, New York (1984‚Äì87), at pp. 79-80. A humorous description of moving a cow to a neighbor's Jersey bull for breeding purposes, and the use of a 12-foot bull staff to get the loose-running bull under control after he had already spotted the cow Being trampled, jammed against a wall, or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry before 1940.O.C. Gregg, Ed., Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual No. 15, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902), at p. 125; The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), p. 103. With regard to such risks, one popular farming magazine has suggested, \\"Handle the bull with a staff and take no chances. The gentle bull, not the vicious one, most often kills or maims his keeper\\".Helpful Information for Dairymen, The Farmer, Webb Publishing Co., St. Paul, Minnesota, Mar. 12, 1927, p. 6. = Handling = nose ring that tethers him to a picket In many areas, placing rings in bulls' noses to help control them is traditional. The ring is usually made of copper, and is inserted through a small hole cut in the septum of the nose. It is used by attaching a lead rope either directly to it or running through it from a head collar, or for more difficult bulls, a bull pole (or bull staff) may be used. This is a rigid pole about long with a clip at one end; this attaches to the ring and allows the bull both to be led and to be held away from his handler. An aggressive bull may be kept confined in a bull pen, a robustly constructed shelter and pen, often with an arrangement to allow the bull to be fed without entering the pen. If an aggressive bull is allowed to graze outside, additional precautions may be needed to help avoid him harming people. One method is a bull mask, which either covers the bull's eyes completely, or restricts his vision to the ground immediately in front of him, so he cannot see his potential victim. Another method is to attach a length of chain to the bull's nose-ring, so that if he ducks his head to charge, he steps on the chain and is brought up short. Alternatively, the bull may be hobbled, or chained by his ring or by a collar to a solid object such as a ring fixed into the ground. In larger pastures, particularly where a bull is kept with other cattle, the animals may simply be fed from a pickup truck or tractor, the vehicle itself providing some protection for the humans involved. Generally, bulls kept with cows tend to be less aggressive than those kept alone. In herd situations, cows with young calves are often more dangerous to humans. In the off season, multiple bulls may be kept together in a \\"bachelor herd\\". = Artificial insemination = Bullfighting Many cattle ranches and stations run bulls with cows, and most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one, if not several, bulls for purposes of herd maintenance.U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Yearbook 1922, Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. (1922), pp. 325-28 (noting a national on-farm bull population of over 600,000 \\"scrub\\" bulls in addition to a multiyear supply of \\"pure bred\\" bulls)O.C. Gregg, Ed., Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual No. 15, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902), pp.129-32 (recommending the keeping and testing of sires for dairy herd improvement). However, the problems associated with handling a bull (particularly where cows must be removed from his presence to be worked) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination (AI) of the cows.C. J. C. Phillips, Principles of Cattle Production (2010), p. 121. Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen, where it is kept until it can be sold, at which time it can be very profitable; in fact, many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose. AI is also used to improve the quality of a herd, or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines. Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher-quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright. AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds.  Relationship with humans  An aurochs bull in a cave painting in Lascaux, France A bull used in heraldry: Coat of arms of Mecklenburg region, Germany Aside from their reproductive duties, bulls are also used in certain sports, including bullfighting and bull riding. They are also incorporated into festivals and folk events such as the Running of the Bulls and were seen in ancient sports such as bull-leaping. Though less common than castrated males, bulls are used as draught oxen in some areas. The once-popular sport of bull-baiting, in which a bull is attacked by specially bred and trained dogs (which came to be known as bulldogs), was banned in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. As with other animals, some bulls have been regarded as pets. The singer Charo, for instance, has owned a pet bull named Manolo.  Significance in human culture  Bulls have held a place of significance in human culture since before the beginning of recorded history. They appear in cave paintings estimated to be up to 17,000 years old. The mythic Bull of the Heavens plays a role in the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, dating as far back as 2150 BC. The importance of the bull is reflected in its appearance in the zodiac as Taurus, and its numerous appearances in mythology, where it is often associated with fertility. See also Korban. In Hinduism, a bull named Nandi, usually depicted seated, is worshipped as the vehicle of the god Shiva and depicted on many of the images of that deity. Symbolically, the bull appears commonly in heraldry. Bulls appears as charges and crests on the arms of several British families. Winged bulls appear as supporters in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Butchers.Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, 205-207, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft. In modern times, the bull is used as a mascot by both amateur and professional sports teams.

The propaganda depicts the inquisition as the epitome of human barbarity with fantastic scenes of tortures, witch hunting and evil friars. As such, it is a part of the Spanish Black Legend propaganda, as well as of Anti-Catholic propaganda, and one of its most recurrent themes. Historian Edward Peters defines it as: Henry Kamen: Black legend The black legend mechanism operates by taking a fact (the Spanish Inquisition existed, it was a phenomenon of religious intolerance, and it practiced torture), twisting it, mixing it with fabrications and blowing it out of proportion (the impossible and baseless numbers reported, that would account to one third of the population and impact the economy in ways that were not observed, the fantastic descriptions of torture machines and stories of sadism and mutilation of millions of people, often fabricated in propaganda workshopsart by Theodor de Bry); ignoring or twisting the context (both religious intolerance and torture were common practices all across Europe, and among the manifestations of it the Spanish inquisition proved itself among the most mellow ones);Haliczer, Stephen, Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834, p. 79, University of California Press, 1990Peters, Edward, Inquisition, Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), . ignoring any positive traits (it was the first judicial body in Europe that operated according to a system and not to judicial discretion, torture was restricted to 15 minutes per session and only allowed on adults under very specific conditions for a set number of times,Bethencourt, Francisco.

This construction, the Black Legend, turns a relatively regular or unremarkable ‚Äì for the context ‚Äì event into an exceptionality in scope and nature, attached to one nation alone. As such, the Black Legend of the Inquisition is created to demonize the other - Spain and/or Catholicism - and maintained as self-justification for those whose own deeds are overshadowed or ignored. Origin Typical 18th-century European image of the Inquisition. KamenKamen, Henry (1999). The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision. Yale University Press, establishes two sources for the Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition. Firstly, an Italian Catholic origin, and secondly, a Protestant background in Central and Northern Europe. Most historians place the bulk of the weight on the Protestant and Calvinist origin, since in the Italian propaganda Spaniards were more often portrayed as atheists or Jews than as fanatics.Elvira, Roca Barea Mar√≠a, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Espa√±ol. Madrid: Siruela, 2017 = Italy = The increasing influence during the sixteenth century of the Aragonese Crown and later of the Spanish one on the Italian Peninsula led public opinion, including the Papacy, to see the Spaniards as a threat. An unfavorable image of Spain grew that naturally ended up involving a negative view of the Inquisition. Revolts against the Inquisition in Spanish Crown territories in Sicily occurred in 1511 and 1526 and mere rumors of the future establishment of tribunals caused riots in Naples in 1547 and 1564. The ambassadors of the independent Italian governments promoted the image of an impoverished Spain dominated by a tyrannical Inquisition. In 1525, Contarini, Venetian ambassador, said that all tremble before the Inquisition. Another ambassador, Tiepolo, wrote in 1563 that everyone is afraid of its authority, which has absolute power over property, life, honor and even the souls of men. He also, commented that the King favors it as a way to control the population. Ambassador Soranzo stated in 1565 that the Inquisition had greater authority than the King. Francesco Guicciardini, Florentine ambassador at the court of Charles I, stated that Spaniards were \\"in appearance religious, but not in reality\\", almost the same words by Tiepolo in 1536. In general, Italians considered the Inquisition as a necessary evil for the Spaniards, whose religion was questionable if not false, after centuries of mixing with Jews and moriscos.Arnoldsson (1960), p.20-22, 95; Peters (1989), p.132; Garc√≠a C√°rcel (1997), p.27-29; Kamen (1999), p. 309 In fact, after 1492, the word marrano became synonymous with Spaniard and Pope Alexander VI was called the \\"circumcised marrano\\". However, it was seen as insulting to place an inquisition in Naples since they \\"didn't need an Inquisition\\". The argument against the Inquisition was often one of indignation and not of fear. The explanation was that the Spaniards were by nature more prone to heresy than Italians, so it was still seen as not necessary in Italy. Another force in this rejection was the force of the Papal States. The Papal Inquisition had been operating in Naples as a way of controlling the territory since the Middle Ages. One of the reasons why Spain wanted to introduce the Spanish Inquisition instead was precisely to counter or reduce that foreign influence in Spanish territory, and as such the Pope and powers rival to Spain invited, or even brived, disobedience to try and preserve their power in Naples.The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571. Setton, Kenneth Meyer. American Philosophical Society, 1984 Italian sources can hardly be considered as \\"part of the legend\\" since their deformation of the facts is not systematic and sustained through time but a reasonable reaction to having a foreign institution imposed upon them, but have been used out of context once said legend was already established. = Habsburg Spain = The Spanish Inquisition was one of the administrative and juridic arms of the Spanish Crown. It was created, among other things, to keep both powerful noble families and the Roman Catholic Church in check. This sectors of society had the power to dispute, or dodge, the authority of the king at a local level, and were also the demographics with higher literacy rates, wealth, and international relationships. The main role of the Inquisition was to prevent internal division in the empire and, even though the religious aspect of it is overly emphasized in the popular image, the fragmentation of power and local coalitions to dispute Royal power were an important part of this cohesion as well. It investigated nobles who wished to put their own local interests over the interests of the crown, and the Pope's desires to intervene and gain control over the Empire, usually with the aid of foreign powers (here is where the religious aspect comes and mixes since said powers usually were Protestant). As an independent body from the Pope, the Spanish Inquisition also had the ability to judge clergy for both corruption and treason without the interference of the Pope, which allowed the king to hold clergy accountable in his realm and limit Papal influence in it. As a consequence, the Inquisition systematically ruffled the feathers of the most powerful people inside the Spanish Empire as well as in the Vatican. The Spanish Inquisition's trial records show a disproportionate over-representation of nobility and clergy among those who are being investigated and prosecuted. The vast majority of the investigations that the Inquisition initiated itself (investigations on middle and low-class people were usually the consequence of the denounce of neighbors and rarely self-started by the institution). Among the trials, those who are conducted over nobility and clergy were also far more likely to be found guilty and convicted. While for the lay Spaniard who had no education to put their thoughts on paper nor the power to spread them, the Inquisition was far more compassionate and lenient than the civil alternative (the civil tribunals and the King's prisons, with no food and unrestricted use of torture), for the powerful the Inquisition was far worse than what they were used to in civil courts (no accountability at all). The sectors the Spanish Inquisition was designed to address and control were also the same sectors that had the education and resources to write and spread said writing, as well as the ones with something to win from any propaganda campaign. Either by accident, just as the result of mostly discontent people were the only ones who could write and talk about the institution internationally, or by design, the negative accounts from Spain's very international nobility constituted a large number of the total accounts of the Inquisition produced.Elvira, Roca Barea Mar√≠a, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Espa√±ol. Madrid: Siruela, 201 =Protestantism= In Northern Europe, the religious confrontation and the threat of Spanish imperial power gave birth to the Black Legend, as the small number of Protestants who were executed by the Inquisition would not have justified such a campaign. Protestants, who had successfully used the press to disseminate their ideas, tried to win with propaganda the war they could not win by force of arms.Madden, Thomas F. (2004). \\"The Real Inquisition: Investigating the popular myth.\\", National Review On one hand, Catholic theologians criticized the Protestants as newcomers, who, unlike the Catholic Church could not prove a continuity from the time of Christ. On the other hand, Protestants theologians reasoned that this was not true and that theirs was the true Church which had been oppressed and persecuted by the Catholic Church throughout history. This reasoning, which was only outlined by Luther and Calvin, was fleshed out by later Protestant historiography identified with Wycliffe or the lollards of England, the Hussites of Bohemia and the Waldensians of France. All this despite the fact that in the 16th century heretics were persecuted in both Catholic and Protestant countries.Lutherans and Catholics were violently persecuted and tortured in the England of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I by civil courts. In Europe, Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, Zwingli and other reformers persecuted the anabaptists, catholics and jews. For more information see also The Protestant Inquisition . By the end of the 16th century the Protestant denominations had identified with the heretics of previous times and defined them as martyrs. When the persecution of Protestants started in Spain the hostility felt towards the Pope was immediately extended to include the King of Spain, on whom the Inquisition depended, and the Dominicans who carried it out. After all, the greatest defeat suffered by the Protestants had been at the hands of Charles I of Spain in the battle of M√ºhlberg in 1547. An image of Spain as the champion of Catholicism spread throughout Europe. This image was in part promoted by the Spanish crown. John Foxe (1516‚Äì1587) in an engraving by an unknown artist. This identification by the Protestants with heretics from the time of the conversion of Imperial Rome until the 15th century lad to the creation of martyrologies in Germany and England, description of the lives of martyrs in morbid detail, usually heavily illustrated, that circulated among the poorer classes and which incited indignation against the Catholic Church. One of the most famous and influential was the Book of Martyrs by John Foxe (1516‚Äì1587). Foxe dedicated an entire chapter to the Spanish Inquisition: The execrable Inquisition of Spayne.The execrable Inquisition of Spayne on John Foxe's Book of Martyrs Extract: Many of the themes that are repeated later on are to be found in this text: anyone can be tried for any triviality; the Inquisition is infallible; people are usually accused to gain money, because of jealousy or to hide the actions of the Inquisition; if proof is not found it is invented; the prisoners are isolated with no contact with the outside world in dark dungeons where they suffer horrible torture etc. Foxe warned that this sinister organization could be introduced into any country that accepted the Catholic faith. Another influential book was the Sanctae Inquisitionis Hispanicae Artes (Exposition of the Arts of the Spanish Holy Inquisition) published in Heidelberg in 1567 under the pseudonym Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus. It appears that Gonzalvius was a pseudonym of Antonio del Corro, a Spanish Protestant theologian exiled in Holland. Del Corro added credibility to his tale with his knowledge of the tribunal. The book was an immediate success, two editions were printed between 1568 and 1570 in English and French, three in Dutch, four in German and one in Hungarian, and the book continued to be published and referenced until the 19th century. The largely fabricated story relates the tale of a prisoner who passes through all the stages of the process and above all the interrogation, allowing the reader to identify with the victim. Del Corro's description presents some of the most extreme practices as being routine, such as the innocence of all the accused, the officials of the Inquisition are shown as being devious and vain and each step of the process is shown as a violation of natural law. Del Corro supported the initial purpose of the Inquisition which was to persecute false converts and he had not foreseen that his book would be used to support the Black Legend in a similar manner to that of Bartolom√© de las Casas. He was convinced that the Dominican friars had converted the Inquisition into something execrable, that Philip II was not aware of the true proceedings and that the Spanish people were opposed to the sinister organization. = Bourbon Spain = Spanish Bourbons brought French absolutism and centralization to a largely decentralized and relatively liberal nation. The reaction was one of resentment and further polarization of Spanish society as the high nobility and the church, happy with the new acquisition of power, sided and supported the French monarchy (\\"afrancesados\\") while other sectors got polarised in growing antimonarchic and anti-French hostility. This situation contributed to the feeding of the black legend of the Inquisition from both extrema. On one side, the court of Spain was suddenly dominated by French intellectuals that came along with the first Bourbon king. As a result, the predominant historiographic view was the French view, which portrayed Spain and the Inquisition as violent and barbaric as consequence of centuries of rivalry between both powers. Those Spanish intellectuals who wished to advance and earn recognition in the court had to adopt said views in order to earn respect. On the other extreme, the protection for the absolutist Bourbons of the church generated a growing identification of the church, the old regime, monarchic absolutism and the king. Eventually, antimonarchic intellectuals and Spaniards resenting the new rule started identifying with the alleged cruelties of the medieval church and the Inquisition as reflections of their own perceived oppression under the Bourbons. The Black Legend of the Inquisition, already created and packed for consumption through the 16th and 17th century by England, the Netherlands, and Germany, and introduced in Spain through France was adopted by both sides as throwing accusation. Since the legend used the alleged cruelty of the Inquisition to diminish both Spain and Catholicism, each side picked half of it and used it to either defend the \\"illustrated\\" French rule or to attack absolutism. This strife provided with a new body of completely misinformed and undocumented texts on the Inquisition written by Spaniards as propaganda against certain aspects of the government. During the 18th century, the existence of said Inquisition itself seemed to calm the waters and most criticisms was focussed towards the past. During the severe unrest of the 19th century, it was turned by the king not against foreign powers but against Spanish liberals.‚ÄòGoya‚Äôs Inquisition: from Black Legend to Liberal Legend‚Äô, Vida Hisp√°nica, no. 46, September 2012. Some examples of these Spanish Liberal contributions to the black legend would be Goya's engravings, Jos√© del Olmo‚Äôs narrative accounts, Francisco Rizi (Italian but Spanish sympathiser) engravings.Representational strategies of inclusion and exclusion in Jos√© del Olmo‚Äôs narrative and Francisco Rizi‚Äôs visual record of the Madrid Auto de Fe of 1680‚Äô, Romance Studies, vol. 29, no. 4, November 2011, pp.223-41.  European politics in the 16th century  A number of books appeared between 1559 and 1562 that presented the Inquisition as a threat to the liberties enjoyed by Europeans. These writings reasoned that those countries that accepted the Catholic religion not only lost their religious liberties but also their civil liberties due to the Inquisition. To illustrate their point they would describe autos-da-f√© and tortures and they would provide numerous stories from people that had fled from the Inquisition. The Reformation was seen as a liberation of the human soul from darkness and superstition. France, Britain and Holland had the most active presses on the continent and they were used very effectively as a means of defense when these countries felt threatened. The documents generated between 1548 and 1581 became reference materials in the studies of later historians. = Holland = There was a generally held fear in Holland dating from the reign of Charles I that the king would try to introduce the Inquisition in order to reduce civil liberties, even though Phillip II had stated that the Spanish Inquisition was not exportable. Phillip II recognized that Holland had its own inquisition more ruthless than the one in Spain. Between 1557 and 1562 the courts in Antwerp executed 103 heretics, more than were killed in the whole of Spain in this same period. Various changes in the organization of the Dutch Inquisition increased people's fears of both the Spanish Inquisition and the local one. In addition, opposition grew to such an extent through the 16th century that it was feared anarchy would break out if Calvinism was not legalized. William Of Orange (1533‚Äì1584) painted by C. Garschagen. This fear was manipulated by Protestants and by those calling for Dutch independence in pamphlets such as On the Unchristian, tyrannical Inquisition that Persecutes Belief, Written from the Netherlands or The Form of the Spanish Inquisition Introduced in Lower Germany in the Year 1550 published by Michael Lotter. In 1570, religious refugees presented a document to the Imperial Diet entitled A Defence and true declaration of the things lately done in the lowe countrey which described not only the crimes perpetrated against Protestants but also accused the Spanish Inquisition of inciting revolts in Holland in order to force Phillip II to exercise a firm hand, and accused him of the death of Prince Carlos of Asturias. = Great Britain = The English fear to a Spanish invasion since the Anglo-Spanish War, and the need of Elizabeth I of England to legitimate herself on the throne after 20 years of conspiracies against her stimulated anti-Spanish propaganda. The Catholic monarchs in England, had created religious courts to fight against heresy, the last being created by Mary Tudor. The English monarchs, above all Elizabeth I, preferred to create civil tribunals to repress religious dissidents, above all Catholics, distancing themselves from the previous practices. Catholic heretics were identified as traitors by a system that was not that much different from the Inquisition. It even went so far as to kidnap an English Catholic lawyer from the Netherlands, John Story, before taking him to England to be tortured, accused of treason and conspiracy and executed. The system by which the government insisted on trying traitors, not heretics, remained in place until the reign of James I which maintained the illusion that the Inquisition was a catholic institution clearly identified with Spain and Rome. In this way the religious fanatics gained the support of others who were more moderate and above all of the government, which financed pamphlets and published edicts. During this time many pamphlets were published and translated including A Fig for the Spaniard.A list of some of these pamphlets and the text of A Fig for the Spaniard can be found at A leaflet published by Antonio P√©rez in 1598 entitled A treatise Paraenetical repeated William of Orange's claims conferring a tragic aspect to Prince Carlos of Asturias and one of religious fanaticism to Phillip II and the Inquisition that survived into modern era.  The 17th century  During the 16th century some Catholic and Protestant thinkers had already begun to discuss the freedom of conscience, but the movement was marginal up until the start of the 17th century. It considered that those states that carried out religious persecution were not only poor Christians,Jacobus Acontius stated that \\"killing a man is not defending a doctrine, it is killing a man but also illogical,. The reasoning behind this is that no dogma is infallible, therefore it can not be used to persecute people given that they acted on the basis of a conjecture and not a certainty. These thinkers attacked all types of religious persecution, but the Inquisition offered them a perfect target for their criticism. These points of view were most popular with the followers of minority religious beliefs, \\"dissidents\\", such as Remonstrants, Anabaptists, Quakers, Unitarians, Mennonites etc. In fact, Philipp van Limborch, the great historian of the Inquisition, was a Remonstrant and Gilbert Brunet, an English historian of the Reformation was a Latitudinarian. Towards the end of the 16th century the religious wars in Europe had made it clear that any attempt to make religiously uniform states were bound to fail. Intellectuals, starting in Holland and France, affirmed that the State should occupy itself with the well-being of its citizens even if this allowed the growth of the heresy of allowing tolerance in exchange for social peace. By the end of the 17th century these ideas had spread to Central Europe and diversity was beginning to be considered more \\"natural\\" than uniformity, and that, in fact, uniformity threatened the richness of a nation. Spain was the perfect demonstration of this. It had started to decline economically by the middle of the 17th century and the expulsion of the Jews and other rich, industrious citizens was thought to be one of the main reasons for this decline. Also, the fines and seizures of property and wealth would make the problem worse, as the money was being directed to unproductive areas of the Catholic Church. The Inquisition was therefore converted into an enemy of the state and as such was reflected as such in the economic and political tracts of the time. In 1673, Francis Willoughby wrote A Relation of a Voyage Made through a Great Part of Spain in which he concluded the following: Pierre Bayle (1647‚Äì1706) in an engraving by Pierre Savart. The liberal European societies started to look down on those societies that maintained their uniformity, they were also the object of social analysis. The existence of the Inquisition in Portugal, Spain and Rome was thought to be due to the use of force or because the spirit of the people was weakened, it was not considered possible that the Inquisition was supported voluntarily. This supposed weakness of spirit combined with the strength of the Inquisition in these countries was predicted to lead to a lack of imagination and learning as well as hindering advances in science, literature and the arts. Spain, despite the golden age of the Siglo de Oro and although the Inquisition generally only focused on doctrinal matters, is represented after the 17th century as a country without literature, art or science. As of the 17th century the \\"Spanish character\\" was included as part of the analysis of the Inquisition. This supposed \\"Spanish character\\" was publicized in many travel books which were the most popular type of literature of the period. One of the first and the most influential was written by the Countess d'Aulnoy in 1691 in which she consistently belittled Spanish achievements in the arts and sciences. Other notable books from the 18th century include those by Juan √Ålvarez de Colmenar, (1701), Jean de Vayarac (1718), Pierre-Louis-Auguste de Crusy, Marquis de Marcillac,Pierre-Louis- Auguste de Crusy, Marquis de Marcillac, Nouveau Voyage en Espagne fait en 1777 & 1778, dans lequel on traite des Moeurs, des Monumens anciens & modernes, du Commerce, du Th√©√¢tre, de la L√©gislation, des Tribunaux particuliers √† ce Royaume & de l'Inquisition; avec de nouveaux d√©tails sur son √©tat actuel, & sur une proc√©dure r√©cente & fameuse, Londres 1782, P. Elmsly, 2 vol. in-8¬∞. After classifying the Spanish as lazy, vengeful and proud he writes \\"aside from a crass ignorance, which is due to the education they receive and whose origins is in that court which meets in order to shame philosophy and the human spirit, I have not seen more than virtues in the Spanish. Edward Clarke,Anglican priest, in 1763 he published Letters concerning the Spanish Nation: Written at Madrid during the years 1760 and 1761. Clarke excused the Spanish people's backwardness, blaming it on the Inquisition. Henry Swinburne,(1743‚Äì1803); Travels through Spain in the Years 1775 and 1776. Swinburne, for example, stated that Pablo de Olavide, Mayor of Sevilla, who was tried by the Inquisition in 1776 \\"was held prisoner in the dungeons of the Inquisition, where he will probably end his days.\\" Olavide in fact fled to France where the philosophers received him as a hero. He was a victim of the Reign of Terror and so returned to Spain where his possessions were restored to him and he died peacefully in 1803. Tobias George Smollett,(1721- 1771), in his book The present State of All Nations containing a geographical natural, commercial and political History of all the Countries in the Known World. London (1769), vol. V. pp. 205 onwards Richard Twiss and innumerable others who perpetuated the Black Legend.For example, an anonymous book published in London in 1770 states that \\"...the mind of the inhabitants is darkened by superstition and the efforts of erudition are beset by the terrors of the Inquisition and many other shackles, by which the tyranny of the clergy maintains the people in slavery.\\" It has been noted that influential Enlightenment writers such as Pierre Bayle (1647‚Äì1706) obtained much of their knowledge of Spain from these stories.  The Enlightenment  Montesquieu saw in Spain the perfect example of the maladministration of a state under the influence of the clergy. Once again the Inquisition was deemed to be guilty of the economic ruin of nations, the great enemy of political freedom and social productivity, and not just in Spain and Portugal, there were signs throughout Europe that other countries could come to be \\"infected\\" with this contagion. He described an Inquisitor as someone \\"separated from society, in a wretched condition, starved of any kind of relationship, so that he will be tough, ruthless and inexorable...\\". In his book \\"The Spirit of the Laws\\" he dedicates chapter XXV.13 to the Inquisition. The chapter is written in such a way as to call attention to a young Jew who was burnt to death by the Inquisition in Lisbon. Montesquieu is therefore one of the first to describe the Jews as victims. Voltaire (1694‚Äì1778) painted by Nicolas de Largilli√®re. No 18th- century author did more to disparage religious persecution than Voltaire. Voltaire did not have a deep knowledge of the Inquisition until later in life, but he often used it to sharpen his satire and ridicule his opponents, as shown by his Don Jer√≥nimo Bueno Carac√∫carador, an Inquisitor who appears in Histoire de Jenni (1775). In Candide (1759), one of his best known titles, he does not show a knowledge of the functioning of the Inquisition greater than that to be found in travel books and general histories. Candide includes his famous description of an auto-da-f√© in Lisbon, a satirical gem, that introduces the Inquisition to comedy. Voltaire's attacks on the Inquisition became more serious and acute from 1761. He shows a better understanding and knowledge of the internal workings of the tribunal, probably thanks to the work of Abbe Morellet who he used extensively and to his direct knowledge of some cases, such as that of Gabriel Malagrida, whose death in Lisbon caused a wave of indignation throughout Europe. Abbe Morellet published his Petite √©crit sur une mati√®re int√©resante and Manuel des Inquisiteurs in 1762.A summary / translation of the Directorium Inquisitorum by Nicol√°s Aymerich and also adding data from the work by Lu√≠s de P√°ramo. Roderich Usher, a character in Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The fall of the House of Usher\\" often read it. Both works extracted and summarized the darkest parts of the Inquisition and focussed on the use of deception to secure convictions, thereby making procedures known that even the most bitter enemies of the Inquisition had ignored. Abbe Guillaume-Thomas Raynal attained a fame equivalent to that of Montesquieu, Voltaire or Rousseau with his book Histoire philosophique et politique des √©tablissements et du commerce des europ√©ens dans les deux Indes, even to the point that in 1789 he was considered one of the fathers of the French Revolution. His History of the Indies gained fame thanks to its censorship and a number of editions were published in Amsterdam, Geneva, Nantes and The Hague between 1770 and 1774. As one would expect, the book was also about the Inquisition. In this case Raynal did not criticize the deaths or the use of torture, instead he stated that thanks to the Inquisition Spain had not suffered religious wars. He thought that in order to return Spain to the Concert of Europe the Inquisition would need to be eliminated which would require the importation of foreigners of all beliefs as the only means of attaining \\"good results\\" in a reasonable amount of time; as he considered that the use of indigenous workers would take centuries to achieve the same results. One of the most important works of the century, L'Encyclop√©die, dedicated one of its entries to the Inquisition. The article was written by Louis de Jaucourt a man of science who had studied at Cambridge and who also wrote the majority of the articles about Spain. Jaucourt was not very fond of Spain and many of his articles were filled with invective. He wrote articles on Spain, Iberia, Holland, wool, monasteries and titles of the nobility etc. which were all derogatory. Although his article on wine praised Spanish wine his conclusion was that its abuse can cause incurable illnesses. The article on the Inquisition is clearly taken from Voltaire's writings. For example, the description of the auto-da-f√© is based on that given by Voltaire in Candide. The text is a ferocious attack against Spain:English translators version of the authors translation into Spanish from the original French: L'Encyclop√©die Vol VIII, page 774 b Repeating what Voltaire had already said: ¬´The Inquisition would be the cause of the ignorance of philosophy that Spain lives in, thanks to which Europe and \\"even Italy\\" had discovered so many truths.¬ª After the publication of L'Encyclop√©die came an even more ambitious project, that of the \\"Encyclop√©die m√©thodique\\" which comprised 206 volumes. The article on Spain was written by Masson de MorvilliersAuthor of the famous question \\"What do we owe to Spain? And during the last two centuries, the last four, the last ten, what has Spain done for Europe? The implied response being \\"nothing\\". and it naturally mentions the Inquisition. He advances the theory that the Spanish monarchy is nothing more than the play thing of the church and specifically the Inquisition. That is to say, the Inquisition is the true government of Spain. He explains that the cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition is due, in part, to the rivalry between the Franciscans and the Dominicans. In Venice and Tuscany the Inquisition was in the hands of the Franciscans and in Spain it was in the hands of the Dominicans. Who \\"in order to distinguish itself in this odious task, were led to unprecedented excesses\\". He recounts the legend of Philip III who on seeing the death of two convicts commented \\"Here are two unfortunate men who are dying for something they believe in!\\"Translated from the French: Voil√† duex hommes bien malheureux de mourir pour une chose dont ils sont persuad√©s! When the Inquisition was informed it demanded a phlebotomy of the King whose blood was then burnt.  The 19th and 20th centuries  The Historian Ronald HiltonHilton, Ronald, SPAIN: The Black Legend in the 18th century (2002) has attributed much importance to this 18th- century image of Spain. It would have given Napoleon the ideological justification for his invasion in 1807: the enlightened French taking their light to the backward and benighted Spain. In fact, one of the reforms that Napoleon introduced in Spain was the elimination of the Inquisition. In addition, Reverend Ingram Cobbin MA, in a 19th-century reissue of Foxe's The Book of Martyrs regaled his readers with the most fantastic tales about what the French troops found in the Inquisition's prison when they occupied MadridBack translation from Spanish of Kamen's book; The Book of Martyrs, ed. 1863, p. 31 = America = In the same way that England had used the Black Legend as a political weapon in the 16th century, America used it during the Cuban War of Independence. The American politician and orator Robert Green Ingersoll (1833‚Äì1899) is quoted as saying:Spain and the Spaniard. In America in the 19th century, knowledge of the Inquisition was spread by Protestant polemical writers and historians such as Prescott and John Lothrop, whose ideology influenced the story. Along with the myths woven around the execution of witches in America the myth of the Inquisition was maintained as a malevolent abstraction, sustained by anti-Catholicism. According to Peters, the terms inquisition, inquisitorial and witch hunt became generalized in American society in the 1950s to refer to oppression by its government,In fact in Tree of Hate (page 28) Philip Wayne Powell states that the terms inquisition and witch hunt had become interchangeable even though the Inquisition hardly ever persecuted witchcraft. whether referring to the past or the present, this was possibly due to the influence of contemporary European authors. Carey McWilliams published Witch Hunt: The Revival of Heresy in 1950 which was a study of the Committee of Un-American Activities in which wide use was made of the term Inquisition to refer to the contemporary phenomenon of anticommunist hysteria. The tenor of the work was later widened in The American Inquisition, 1945‚Äì1960 by Cedric Belfrage and even later in 1982 with the book Inquisition: Justice and Injustice in the Cold War by Stanley Kutler. The term inquisition has become so widely used that it has come to be a synonym for \\"official investigation, especially of a political or religious nature, characterized by its lack of respect for individual rights, prejudice on the part of the judges and cruel punishments\\".  The Black Legend in Spain  The degree to which the Spanish people accepted the Inquisition is hard to evaluate.On one hand, none of the popular revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries attacked the Inquisition. The only problem occurred in 1640 when the Inquisitor was expelled from Barcelona, however, this was not for being an Inquisitor but because he was Castilian. It was not until March 1820 that a mob attacked the palace of the tribunal in Madrid, which was by that time virtually empty. On the other hand, it is clear that the conversos and the peoples of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre were to a greater or lesser extent opposed to the Inquisition. A few particular cases, such as the abuses of the Cordovan Inquisitor Diego Rodr√≠guez Lucero or the trial against the Archbishop of Granada Hernando de Talavera caused the ire of the populace at large. The Castilian Parliaments (in 1518 in Valladolid and in 1520 in La Coru√±a etc) and that of Aragon tried on a number of occasions to limit the power of the Inquisition's Tribunal in order to remedy abuses but never with the intention of eliminating the institution. Kamen tried to summarize the situation by saying that the Inquisition was considered as an evil necessary for maintaining order. It is not as if there were not any critics of the Tribunal, there were many as is evident from the Inquisition's own archives, but these critics are not considered relevant to the Black Legend. For example, in 1542 Alonso Ruiz de Viru√©s, humanist and Archbishop, criticized its intolerance and those that used chains and the axe to change the disposition of the soul; Juan de Mariana, despite supporting the Inquisition, criticized forced conversions and the belief in purity of blood (limpieza de sangre). Public opinion slowly started to change after the 18th century thanks to contacts with the outside world, as a consequence the Black Legend began to appear in Spain. The religious and intellectual freedom in France was watched with interest and the initial victims of the Inquisition, conversos and moriscos, had disappeared. Enlightened intellectuals started to appear such as Pablo de Olavide and later Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Campomanes and Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who blamed the Inquisition for the injust treatment of the conversos. In 1811 Morat√≠n published Auto de fe celebrado en la ciudad de Logro√±o A facsimile edition can be obtained from the Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library: Auto de fe celebrado en la ciudad de Logro√±o en los d√≠as 7 y 8 de noviembre del a√±o de 1610, siendo Inquisidor General el Cardenal, Arzobispo de Toledo, Bernardo de Sandobal y Roxas (Auto de fe held in the city of Logro√±o) which related the history of a large trial against a number of witches that took place in Logro√±o, with satirical comments from the author. However, these liberal intellectuals, some of whom were members of the government, were not revolutionary and were preoccupied with the maintenance of the social order. The Inquisition ceased to function in practice in 1808, during the Spanish War of Independence as it was abolished by the occupying French government, although it remained as an institution until 1834. A school of liberal historians appeared in France and Spain at the start of the 19th century who were the first to talk about Spanish decline. They considered the Inquisition to be responsible for this economic and cultural decline and for all the other evils that afflicted the country. Other European historians took up the theme later on and this position can still be seen today. This school of thought stated that the expulsion of the Jews and the persecution of the conversos had led to the impoverishment and decline of Spain as well as the destruction of the middle class.According to Kamen, none of these statements have never been proved; the Inquisition never interfered with commerce nor with industrial policy and although in the short term it is possible that it caused damage, even important damage, it could not have caused long term damage. (Kamen, p√°g. 313) This type of author made Men√©ndez y Pelayo exclaim: This school of thought along with the other elements of the Black Legend would form part of the Spanish anticlericalism of the end of the 19th century. This anticlericalism formed part of many other ideologies of the left wing, such as socialism, communism and anarchism. This is demonstrated by a statement made by the Socialist Member of Parliament Fernando Garrido in April 1869Fernando Garrido, Diario de Sesiones III, 1512 (30 April 1869), (cited by PETSCHEN, op. cit., Pp. 89); in Una aproximaci√≥n al anticlericalismo decimon√≥nico by Mirta N√∫√±ez D√≠az-Balart that the Church had used the \\"Court of the Inquisition as an instrument for its own ends. The Church used the Inquisition to gag freedom of expression and impede the diffusion of the truth. It imposed a rigid despotism over three and a half centuries of Spanish history\\".  Misunderstandings Some common mistakes when reporting inquisitorial activity done by 20th century historians can't be considered fully part of the black legend, even though they are likely prompted by assumptions created by the Black Legend in Historiography. They tend to stem from a lack of awareness of the modern- bureaucratic nature of the Spanish Inquisition in a time in which most trials were still left to the judge's personal discrection and will. This are the most common: =Trial-execution ratio= High volume of investigations Like any bureaucratic system, the Inquisitorial tribunal had an obligation to consider and investigate every case that any citizen of Spain brought to them, regardless of social level of the accuser or the previous opinion of the tribunal about the veracity of the claim. As a consequence the number of raw cases that the inquisition had to handle and the number of processes it opened was astronomical, even if the actual conviction rate of the Inquisitorial tribunal was low, 6% on average. The raw numbers of trials usually include cases of witchcraft or false accusations that were quickly identified as neighbours' fabrications and dismissed by the system. For example, the Spanish Inquisition trialed 3687 people for witchcraft from 1560 to 1700, of whom only 101 were found guilty.G. Parker, ‚Äòsome recent work on the inquisition in Spain and Italy ‚Äô, Journal of Modern History 54 (London, 1982) P.529 Other estimates of trial-conviction ratio for witchcraft are even lower. A common mistake in some inquisitorial historiography has been to report the number of trials as number of convictions, or even of executions.J. Marchant, A Review of the Bloody Tribunal (1770) Another mistake is to assume that the elevated number of trials indicated an active prosecution and search by the inquisitors instead of cases brought to them, or to assume a high ratio of conviction per trial instead of reading through the entire sentences. The mistake comes from the high trial-conviction ratio in cases of heresy observed in Northern Europe in the same period, where verdict was not based on a system but left to individual discretion.Elvira, Roca Barea Mar√≠a, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negro: Roma, Rusia, Estados UNIDO Y El Imperio Espa√±ol. Madrid: Siruela, 201 Multiple charges Another factor that contributed to the high number of inquisitorial investigations was the low conviction ratio. Due to its reputation of relative impartiality during its first two centuries of existence, Spanish citizens preferred the inquisitorial tribunal to the secular courts and presented their cases to them whenever possible. Those held in secular prisons also did all they could to be transferred to Inquisitorial prisons, since prisoners of the inquisitions had rights while those of the king did not. As such, defendants accused of civil infractions would blaspheme or self accuse of false conversion to be transferred to the Inquisition courts, which eventually made the Inquisitors elevate a complaint to the king.Railings, Helen, The Spanish Inquisition, Blackwell Publishing (2006) Another factor that helped inflate the number of trials the inquisition is reported to have conducted, especially regarding witchcraft and false conversions, were the groups of accusations that often were investigated together. Accusers tended to throw \\"witchcraft\\" or other vague accusations into the mix, along with legitimate claims. Those cases in which witchcraft was tried along with other, serious accusations, are sometime reported as \\"trials of witchcraft by the inquisition\\". For example, Eleno de C√©spedes was accused of witchcraft during a trial and is often reported as \\"having been trialed for witchcraft by the inquisition\\", although the trial began on charges of sodomy, and the later additional charge of witchcraft was dismissed by the tribunal, which convicted de C√©spedes only of bigamy.Robin Briggs, Witches and Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft, Harper Collins, 2002.Sabrina Petra Ramet, Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures (2002, ), chapter 7. =Role of the Inquisitor= In popular culture the Inquisitor is an all, powerful, evil and sadistic entity. Even serious work who didn't take the time to investigate the Spanish legal system as a whole tend to make the mistake of attributing him more power in the final verdict than he held. As it has been estated, the Inquisitorial court was a court regulated by a system, not by a person, much like courts work in modern European democracies. The inquisition was merely a civil servant, a bureaucrat. As such the inquisitor had no power to introduce his own judgment in the trials, he had power only to apply the law. This had its problems, but was more beneficial than not. A popular example of this can be found in Alonso de Salazar Fr√≠as¬¥s intervention in the case of the Witches of Zurragamurdi, one of the few cases of witchcraft in Spain that ended in actual execution. During the trial, the Inquisitor Fr√≠as, whom like most educated Spaniards did not believe in witchcraft, refused to condemn the witches despite their voluntary confessions-no torture was used. He declared that \\"These women think that they can turn into ravens, but they are just mentally ill!\\" and \\" There were no witches in Spain until the French started talking and writing about them\\". However, he didn't have the power to arbitrary declare them innocent. The case was taken to the General-Inquisitor in Madrid, who agreed with Fr√≠as in considering that the women were not witches, just mentally disturbed. However, and even though both men considered that the women were not guilty, they had to be convicted because the neighbors refused to drop the charges and the legal requisites for conviction of any crime-voluntary confession of it combined with unanimous and consistent testimony from a lot of eyes witnesses- had been met. The judges had no right to make an arbitrary decision over the written law.Henningsen, Gustav (1980). The Witches' Advocate: Basque Witchcraft and the Spanish Inquisition (1609-1614). Reno: University of Nevada Press. . This shows both the bureaucratic and modern nature of the Spanish Inquisition when compared to other European courts, and the limited power the inquisitors themselves held.

Cultures and customs Like other tribes of the world, Zo people have some cultures, traditions and customs which only Zo people preciously keep and conserve. At the same time, this fact makes Zo generations superior to all other tribes who claim to be Zo descendants. This practice can only be found in Zo generations.

The intention of exposing of these Zo customs and cultures is that Zo people are derived of the Progenitor, Zo with customs and traditions handed down by our forefathers from age to age and at the same time that they also prove the identity of Zo people though many today merely and mistakably interpret Zo in various ways without knowing and understanding of the core meaning of it.

Since 1752 it has also been the cathedral of the Diocese of Fulda, of which the Prince-Abbots of Fulda were created bishops. The abbey was dissolved in 1802 but the diocese and its cathedral have continued. The dedication is to Christ the Saviour (). The cathedral constitutes the high point of the Baroque district of Fulda, and is a symbol of the town.  History  View of the abbey, showing in the centre the Ratgar Basilica, predecessor of the present cathedral (copper engraving 1655) The present cathedral stands on the site of the Ratgar Basilica (once the largest basilica north of the Alps), which was the burial site of Saint Boniface and the church of Fulda Abbey, functions which the new building was intended to continue. The plans of the new church were drawn up in 1700 by one of the greatest German Baroque architects, Johann Dientzenhofer, who was commissioned by the Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Schleifras for the new building on the recommendation of the Pope after Dientzenhofer's study trip to Rome in 1699. The deliberate similarity of the church's internal arrangement to that of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is testimony to Dientzenhofer's visit. The Ratgar Basilica was demolished to make way for the new Baroque structure, on which construction began on 23 April 1704L. Pfaff: Der Dom zu Fulda., publ. J. L. Ath, 1855, p.19 using in part the foundations of the earlier basilica. In 1707 the shell was completed. The roof was finished in 1708 and the interior in 1712. The new abbey church was dedicated on 15 August 1712. The dedication tablet placed on the facade by von Schleifras gives the dedication as Christus Salvator.Freunde Mainfr√§nkischer Kunst und Geschichte: Mainfr√§nkisches Jahrbuch f√ºr Geschichte und Kunst. Unterfranken 1949, Seite 280 The new Baroque building, like its predecessor, served as the abbey church and the burial shrine of Saint Boniface. In 1752 it was elevated to a cathedral on the creation of the Diocese of Fulda. In 1802 Fulda Abbey was dissolved and the cathedral's function as the abbey church ceased, but it continued in operation as the seat of the Bishops of Fulda. On 4 June 1905 during celebrations of the 1150th anniversary of the death of Saint Boniface a stray firework lodged in the righthand tower and started a fire (it is presumed to have set light to old jackdaws' nests). The tower was burnt out, and the bells Osanna and Bonifatius were destroyed. Other parts of the cathedral were not damaged. After damage caused by air raids during World War II the cathedral was closed for restoration until 1954. Pope John Paul II visited Fulda on 17 and 18 November 1980. More than 100,000 people were present on the cathedral square on 18 November to attend the open-air mass celebrated by the Pope.hr-online: Glockengel√§ut ‚Äì Beten f√ºr das Kirchenoberhaupt ‚Äì Stand: 2. April 2005  Architecture  = Orientation = Like the Ratgar Basilica before it, and St. Peter's in Rome, but unlike the great majority of European churches, Fulda Cathedral is oriented to the west. The main facade onto the cathedral square is the east front, and the choir is located at the west end of the nave. (The Ratgar Basilica had a second choir to the east, which Dientzenhofer did not replicate in his new building). = Dimensions = The cathedral is 99 meters long and 39 meters high into the top of the dome. The main frontage is flanked by two towers 65 meters high. = Form and ground plan = The building is a basilica, with a central aisle and two side aisles, and two transepts separated by the crossing, over which is the dome. The ground plan is thus a cross with double arms. The nave is extended to the east by the addition of an entrance hall, the two facade towers and two domed chapels (St. Andrew's Chapel and St. John's Chapel). Beyond the crossing and the northern transept the chancel continues, with the high altar and beyond it the choir, with the crypt of Saint Boniface beneath. The side aisles run parallel to the main aisle up to the sacristy and the Lady Chapel, which is directly adjacent to the former monastic buildings. = Exterior = Exterior  Bell towers  The facade is flanked by two towers 65 metres high, the four storeys of which are clearly delineated by ledges. Sandstone statues, greater than life size, by Andreas Balthasar Weber, represent to the right Saint Sturm as abbot, with a mitre, abbot's staff and book, and to the left Saint Boniface as bishop with a crook and a Bible pierced by a dagger. On the third storey are copper and gilt numerals and hands belonging to a mechanical clock and a sundial.  Main portal  Main portal Four massive three-quarter columns accompanied by half-pilasters stand to either side of the main portal and support the architrave, the frieze with its triglyphs and the heavy cornices. On the architrave over segments of a round arch sit two large angels, supporting the arms of the Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Schleifras, sculpted by Balthasar Esterbauer, consisting of the arms of Fulda Abbey quartering those of von Schleifras. The portal door is ornamented with Corinthian pilasters and wrought iron door fittings. The upper storey of the facade is divided by massive pillars. A large round-topped window is decorated with columns, inflexed arches and urns. The window is surrounded by sandstone sculptures representing the patron saints of Fulda, the twin brothers Simplicius and Faustinus, as knights. Their shields bear their symbol - three lilies - and the cross, the device of the abbey, both of which appear in the arms of the town of Fulda. The central part of the facade is terminated by a triangular gable filled with urns and a round window. On the point of the gable stands a figure of Christ giving a blessing.  Obelisks  Next to the two domed chapels stand a pair of sandstone obelisks about 11 metres high, the function of which, besides being decorative, is to make the facade appear broader. On the Abschlussplatte is a pedestal with four rampant lions, and above them the arms of von Schleifras with various inscriptions. = Interior = View towards the high altar The white interior combines elements of St. Peter's Basilica and St. John Lateran in Rome. The magnificent decoration shows the influence of Roman Baroque. The overall effect is dominated by the contrast between the white of the walls and of the stucco on the one hand and the black and gold of the architectonic elements and of the fittings on the other. Giovanni Battista Artari, a stuccoist, decorative artist and sculptor, created the stucco work of the interior as well as the larger than life-size stucco figures of the Apostles, who are represented in accordance with their description by the Apostle Paul in Galatians 2.9 as \\"pillars\\" of the church.  The Golden Wheel  A great curiosity in both the old Ratgar Basilica and the later Baroque church and cathedral was the so-called \\"Golden Wheel\\" (), a medieval musical apparatus, which was made in 1415 during the rule of the Abbot Johann I von Merlau and for over 370 years delighted the faithful with its evocation of the \\"music of the spheres\\". It was in the form of a great star, consisting of 14 rays about 2.5 metres long mounted on a round metal plate; from the rays hung 350 bells. It was set and kept in motion by two ropes or cables running round an axle, by which the star could be kept turning and the bells ringing. It was lavishly decorated with glittering golden Gothic floral finials and vesica-shaped decorations. and Fischblasenornamente By the time it was reinstalled in the new Baroque church in 1712 there were only 127 bells remaining. It was hung in the nave to the east of the dome. In 1781 a cable broke during the Whitsun service and the heavy wheel crashed to the ground causing deaths and injuries. It was left in a barn for two years, and before a decision could be reached about whether it should be re-hung, all the bells had disappeared. The bishop's smith then broke it up and reused the metal.  Dome  View of the dome Dientzenhofer was inspired in the design of the dome by that of the Church of Il Ges√π in Rome, the mother church of the Jesuit Order, and like that of Il Ges√π, the dome of Fulda Cathedral is intended to be the visual focal point of the building. In the spandrels above the pillars of the dome are well-preserved frescoes by Luca Antonio Columba, depicting the four Evangelists. In the niches are stucco figures greater than life-size by Giovanni Battista Artari: directly in front of the high altar stands the Archangel Michael holding scales and a sword, with the devil at his feet; to the left, the Archangel Gabriel holding a lily; to the right the Archangel Raphael holding a censer; and at the back a guardian angel, showing a child the way to heaven. Finally in the dome itself is a stucco figure of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove in a burst of radiance.  Fittings and furnishings  Pulpit = Bells = The cathedral has ten bells hung in the two towers: bells 1‚Äì3 in the north tower, and bells 4‚Äì10 in the south tower. The Salvator is the only bell now surviving of the set cast in 1897 by Carl & Rudolf Edelbrock. In 1908 Carl Edelbrock added an Osanna. The Osanna which now hangs in the top storey of the north tower is a different bell, cast by Friedrich Wilhelm Schilling. It is supposed to be one of the best bells he ever cast: the story is that it did not need to be tuned after casting. The present Sturmius and Lioba bells were recast from bells of 1897 which were not in tune with the 1908 Osanna. In 1994 the Karlsruher Glocken- und Kunstgie√üerei cast five bells to replace another five smaller bells from the set of 1897. = High altar = The sculptor Johann Neudecker and the stuccoist Giovanni Battista Artari worked together to make the high altar, which on 15 August 1712 Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Schleifras dedicated in honour of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as she is received by the Holy Trinity. = Organ = Organ Between 1708 and 1713 an organ was built in the new church by the Franciscan Adam √ñhninger, with 41 registers on three keyboards and pedals.Bistum Fulda ¬© ‚Äì Die gro√üe Orgel Andreas Balthasar Weber and the artist-woodworker Georg Blank undertook the carvings on the organ case. In a comprehensive restoration of the cathedral between 1992 and 1996 the case was restored and the old colours that were discovered were replaced as close as possible in the original. The Rieger Orgelbau company completed in 1996 the new organ works, using some of the pipes from the old Sauer organ. The present organ comprises 5 divisions on 4 manuals and the pedals with 72 registers. = Crypt = The tomb of Saint Boniface The Boniface Chapel in the crypt is a survival from the Ratgar Basilica and houses the remains of Saint Boniface, the \\"Apostle of the Germans\\", in a sarcophagus, which also has a relief carving and an antependium by Johann Neudecker. During his visit to Fulda in 1980, Pope John Paul II prayed at the tomb of Saint Boniface and in his sermon emphasized Boniface's importance as the beginning of the gospel in Germany.Bildungsserver Hessen: Jahres- und Gedenktage im November, Stand: 20. Mai 2005  Surroundings of the cathedral  To the north of the cathedral is the former St. Michael's Priory, since 1831 the bishop's residence, and the Carolingian St. Michael's Church. Directly attached to the cathedral to the west are the Baroque former conventual buildings of the abbey, constructed between 1771 and 1778, now the Theological Department of the University of Fulda. Nearby is the modern chapel of the Catholic seminary, which was built 1966-1968 by the architect Sep Ruf. South of the monastery is the deanery and the dean's garden, where a lapidarium is now located. In part of the deanery buildings is the cathedral museum.  Cathedral museum  The adjoining cathedral museum contains numerous liturgical vestments and vessels, including the \\"Silver Altar\\", dating from the 18th century, which includes a reliquary for the head of Saint Boniface and the dagger with which he was murdered, besides others of his relics.  Cathedral square  On the cathedral square directly in front of the main entrance large open-air concerts regularly take place, sometimes featuring international stars (e.g., Jos√© Carreras, Chris de Burgh).  Burials  In the cathedral are buried: * Saint Boniface, d. 754 * Saint Sturm, d. 779 * King Conrad I, d. 918 * Anna, Landgravine of Hesse, d. 1918 * many of the Prince-Abbots and Bishops of Fulda, including Heinrich von Bibra (d. 1788) and Johannes Dyba (d. 2000)  Images  File:396Fulda dom.jpgEast front and cathedral square File:Catedral de Fulda.jpgView from the Michaelsberg File:Fulda cathedral southside.jpgView from the south File:Fuldaer Dom, Nordfassade-Eduard-Schick-Platz.jpgView from the north-west across the Eduard-Schick-Platz  References   Further reading  * Hanke, Daniel, 2008: Der Dom zu Fulda: der Bau und seine Ausstattung.

He played and coached all three sports at the University of Michigan and was selected as the Most Valuable Player on the 1936 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was also the first University of Michigan football player to be selected in an NFL Draft. He was an assistant football coach at Western Michigan University (1944, 1948‚Äì1951) and the University of Michigan (1953‚Äì1958). Early years in Elkhart, Indiana Patanelli was born in Elkhart, Indiana, in 1914. He was a star athlete at Elkhart High School, earning 12 letters in football, basketball and track, and serving as the captain of the football and basketball teams. He was selected as an All State football player in 1931 and 1932, and graduated from Elkhart High School in 1933. Matt's younger brother, Joe Patanelli, was a professional basketball and minor league baseball player. University of Michigan Patanelli enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1933 and played for the Michigan Wolverines football, baseball and basketball teams. He played on Michigan's freshman football team in 1933, and received the Chicago alumni award, also known as the Meyer Morton Award, during spring practice in 1934 as the most promising freshman prospect. As a sophomore in 1934, Patanelli played at both the end and halfback positions as a teammate of Gerald R. Ford. He was a starter for Michigan at the end position in 1935 and 1936. In October 1935, Patanelli recovered an Indiana fumble in the end zone for the game's only touchdown, giving Michigan its first Big Ten Conference victory since 1933. At the end of the 1935 season, Patanelli was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player.(Patanelli selected as first-team All-Big Ten player by the United Press) He was also elected by his teammates to serve as captain of the 1936 Michigan Wolverines football team. In 1936, Patanelli started all 8 games at the left end position for Michigan despite suffering from a strained ankle. The team finished with a record of 1-7, achieving its only victory against Columbia University. Patanelli's play was one of the few bright spots for Michigan in the 1936 season, and he was selected as the team's Most Valuable Player.(\\"Matt Patanelli of Elkhart, Ind., end and captain of the Michigan football team, was named the squad's most valuable player today.\\") At the time of his selection as the 1936 Most Valuable Player, Michigan head coach Harry Kipke said, \\"He's a grand person and a great leader. He had courage and this year had to play under a handicap -- a bad ankle. I'm sorry for one thing and it is that Matt never had the privilege of playing on a winning football team. Had he had this chance he certainly would have been picked on some all star eleven.\\" Kipke's belief that Patanelli would have been selected as an All- American if he played for a better team was shared by Associated Press sports correspondent \\"Pap\\", who wrote: > \\"Capt. Matt Patanelli of Michigan, in the opinion of numerous Big Ten > officials and coaches, would rate an end job on any mythical eleven if he > were playing with a winner this season. Michigan's grid fortunes have been > at a low ebb, but this hasn't prevented Matt from turning in great games, > especially on the defense, each Saturday afternoon. Against Minnesota, when > the Wolverines were routed 26-0, Patanelli broke into the Minnesota > backfleld twice to throw runners for losses and his pass interception on the > Michigan 7-yard line prevented another Gopher score.\\" Michigan's ends coach (and future College Football Hall of Fame inductee) Bennie Oosterbaan called Patanelli \\"the best blocking end he has coached.\\" Patanelli was voted by fans as a member of the Chicago Tribune College Football All-American team that defeated the Green Bay Packers 6-0 in the College All-Star Game in August 1937. He was also selected as a third-team All-American by the Associated Press. Patanelli was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 9th round (85th overall pick) of the 1937 NFL Draft, making him the first University of Michigan football player selected in the NFL Draft. However, he announced in late January 1937 that he would not play professional football under any circumstances. Coaching career Patanelli later served as an athletic coach at Western Michigan University. Among other coaching responsibilities, he was the ends coach and chief scout for the Western Michigan football team in 1944 and from 1948 to 1951. In July 1952, he returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant coach, assisting with the baseball, basketball and football teams.(\\"Matt Patanelli, assistant basketball coach, was named defensive end coach and scout during the grid season, in addition to his basketball duties.\\") He was an assistant football coach at Michigan under head coach Bennie Oosterbaan from 1953 to 1958. Patanelli was in charge of the defensive ends in 1953 and was the lead ends coach from 1954 to 1958.(\\"Matthew L. (Matt) Patanelli, defensive ends coach last fall, was elevated to top end coach. ... Patanelli captained the 1936 Michigan eleven. He was an assistant in football and baseball at Western Michigan college before returning to Michigan as coach.\\") In that capacity, he helped develop All-Americans Ron Kramer and Tom Maentz.(\\"For three years Matt Patanelli was just about the most envied end coach in the nation. He had Ron Kramer and Tom Maentz playing for him at Michigan.\\") Honors Patanelli has been inducted into the Elkhart County Sports Hall of Fame and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.

The Spanish colonial city of St. Augustine, along with the entire Florida Territory became de facto American possessions after the 1819 signing of the Adams-Onis Treaty. The actual physical occupation of the city and Florida territory occurred in 1821. Prior to American occupation the Spanish city of St. Augustine was predominately Catholic and the only burial ground within the city, the Tolomato cemetery, was reserved for Catholics. Recognizing a need for a formal Protestant burial ground an area just outside the city gate was chosen by the new American administration in St. Augustine. The first burials occurred in 1821 just prior to a yellow fever epidemic which claimed the lives of a large numbers of the city's inhabitants. The cemetery until title to the cemetery property was acquired by the Rev. Thomas Alexander, who then turned over it to the Presbyterian Church in 1832, burials continued until 1884 when both Huguenot and Tolomato cemeteries were closed. The cemetery is believed to hold at least 436 burials according to city records. The cemetery although named \\"Huguenot Cemetery\\" isn't believed to contain any members of the Huguenots, a French Protestant sect started in the 16th century in France.St. Augustine and St. Johns County: A Historical Guide by William R.

Bothriechis thalassinus is a venomous pitviper species native to Guatemala and Honduras. Description This is a medium-sized pitviper with a slender body and strong prehensile tail. Adults are usually long, with a maximum recorded length of . It has 21-23 dorsal scale rows at mid-body. The head and body usually have a greenish dorsal color, shading to yellow-greenish along the sides. The belly is generally lighter in color: cream, yellow-green or pale green. The dorsal pattern may have irregular blotches, turquoise to black, or speckling that doesn't reach very far down the sides. The head has two black stripes and black speckling on top, which are less visible towards the tail. Like all other pitvipers, B. thalassinus has heat sensitive organs, or loreal pits, located on either side of the head between the eye and the nostril. Geographic range Its range extends from eastern Guatemala to western Honduras. In eastern Guatemala it is found in several mountain ranges, including Sierra de Caral in Izabal and the Sierra del Merend√≥n in Zacapa. Habitat Occurs in lower montane wet forest and lower montane moist forest at elevations of .  Behavior  Like other Bothriechis members, this species appears to be mainly nocturnal and arboreal. It preys mostly on frogs, lizards, and sometimes small mammals or birds. B. thalassinus is not known to be an aggressive species, but may strike quickly when surprised or disturbed. Reproduction Like most other pitvipers, B. thalassinus is ovoviviparous. Average litter size is probably less than 10‚Äì12 young per litter. Venom The characteristics of its venom are not yet well known. It is mainly hemotoxic, and possibly contains mild neurotoxic or myotoxic factors. Seldom encountered by humans, there are very few reported bites of humans. Typical envenomation symptoms include local pain, swelling, mild local tissue necrosis, nausea, \\"tingling\\" of a digit or limb, and nausea. No confirmed deaths of humans have been reported for this species.

The complex is located in the Cuauht√©moc borough of Mexico City. It was built in the 1960s by architect Mario Pani. Originally, the complex had 102 apartment buildings, with its own schools, hospitals, stores and more, to make it a city within a city. It was also created to be a kind of human habitat and includes artwork such as murals and green spaces such as the Santiago Tlatelolco Garden. Today, the complex is smaller than it was and in a state of deterioration, mostly due to the effects and after effects of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. This quake caused the immediate collapse of the Nuevo Le√≥n building with others being demolished in the months afterwards. Further earthquakes in 1993 caused the condemnation of more buildings. In addition to the lost buildings, many residents eventually undersold or abandoned their apartments, as repairs were either never made or made poorly. Today the complex consists of 90 apartment buildings, divided into three sections bordered by Avenida de los Insurgentes, Eje 1 Poniente Guerrero, Eje Central and Paseo de la Reforma. Originally, the complex was designed to house people from different economic social strata, but today almost all of low or very low income. Crime is a major problem as is the structural integrity of the remaining buildings. Construction Mural by Siqueiros in the Tecpan building The complex was ordered built by the administration of President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, between 1960 and 1965, with financing and condominium administration provided by the Banco Nacional Hipotecario, Urbano y de Obras Publicas, S.A. The area has been an urban center since the pre-Hispanic period, when it began as an independent city state on an island in Lake Texcoco. By the time Spaniards arrived, the island had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire centered in the nearby island city of Tenochtitlan. Tlatelolco was famous for its large market, which continued to exist after the Spanish conquest. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the area was a train yard for the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico. The modern apartment complex was built over the then-abandoned train yard. It surrounds the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, a place that symbolizes the synthesis of Mexico's pre-Hispanic and colonial pasts with the modern day. This plaza contains the archeological site of Tlatelolco with its ceremonial center, the parish church of Santiago Tlatelolco and the modern buildings that surround them, including a building associated with the Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores. The project involved a total of 130 buildings over an area of , with schools, hospitals, markets, businesses, church and police stations. Its signature building was the Torre Insignia or Torre Banobras. This was built in the form of a triangle or lance point (to resist earthquakes) 127 meters high with 24 floors. It was originally surrounded by gardens and had a large reflective pool. This tower contains the Carrillon Clasico, one of the world's few glockenspiels and the only one in Mexico City. It consists of 47 metallic bells, considered to be the optimal number for four octaves. They were cast in Belgium and weigh 26 tons. The main bells are dedicated to Hidalgo, Morelos, Cuauht√©moc, Madero and L√≥pez Mateos . A sixth bell is dedicated to relations between Mexico and Belgium. The complex was divided into three sections. Section one was created for family with limited resources. It aligns with the Torre de Baniobras. Section two was designed for the middle class with Section three, between Eje Central and Paseo de la Reforma, for the wealthy. The complex's main park, twice the size of the Alameda Central, was built in Romantic style. This is known as the Santiago Tlatelolco Garden. Access is through a number of arched entryways, on gray and red stone paths which join in the center. Off the paths are maintained green areas. The garden was built as an integral part of the complex to provide green space. Murals were commissioned for a number of the buildings. The first and most important is located on the Aguascalientes Building, near the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. It contains four panels, one on each side of the building, dealing with the history of Tlatelolco. This was painted by Nicandro Puente. This same artist also created other works here including Tlatelolco, ra√≠z y expresi√≥n de M√©xico (1998), Homenaje a la mujer (1999) and 1985: Sismo y resurrecci√≥n (2000) . The project was awarded to architect Mario Pani (along with Ricardo de Robina) at a time when Mexico and Mexico City was experiencing rapid economic expansion. Born in 1911, Mario Pani was a Mexican architect who mostly grew up in Europe and obtained his degree in architecture from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1934. After returning to Mexico, he became part of a movement to make Mexico, especially Mexico City, modern, post- Revolution and progressive. Pani's work focused on major residential centers such as large apartment buildings and condominiums. Works like Nonoalco are classified as ‚Äúsupermanzanas‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper (city) blocks.‚Äù His work changed the focus of urban housing from horizontal to vertical. His works are marked by being monumental, simple and recurring features. At their height, they were considered to be symbols of Mexican prosperity. Works prior to this included Hotel Reforma (1936), Hotel Plaza (1946), Conservatorio Nacional de Musica (1946), the Escuela Nacional de Maestros (1947), as well the apartment complexes Multifamiliar Alem√°n (1950) and Multifamiliar Ju√°rez. These were complexes for the working class, integrating parks, artwork (especially murals) and other features in order to create a ‚Äúhabitat.‚Äù However, the Unidad Habitacional Nonoalco-Tlatelolco would become his best known work. He created the area as a city within a city, to be autonomous with each block having all the services necessary for residents. The idea was to eliminate the need to leave the area, not even to work. Pani integrated the principles of functionalism as it was conceived and practiced at the end of the 1950s. Decline Monument to the Tlatelolco massacre in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas Quality of life in the area diminished after the Tlatelolco massacre on 2 October 1968, which occurred on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. The area's only fire station closed during that year and police presence began to diminish, leading to rising crime. The complex suffered damage from two small earthquakes in 1979. However, deterioration greatly accelerated with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Before 19 September 1985, the complex consisted of 102 apartment buildings, seven medical facilities, twenty two schools, and about 500 small businesses serving the 80,000 residents living there. It was still considered the most important complex of its kind in the country. The complex is located in the Cuauht√©moc borough, which is considered to be a high risk area for earthquake activity most of it lies on former lakebed, with its soft, waterlogged soils. These soils are crisscrossed with small fault lines of their own. These intensify shockwaves that pass through the area from quakes that occurs on Mexico's Pacific coast. Within the borough, Nonoalco-Tlatelolco is one of eleven colonias or neighborhoods considered to be at highest risk. The complex is in a ‚Äúdynamic amplification‚Äù zone, where the shockwaves of a quake over 7 on the Richter scale become strongly amplified. During the 90 seconds the ground shook on that day, two of the three sections of the Nuevo Le√≥n building fell with about 500 dead, more than 200 missing and 27 orphans. Other buildings, such as the Yucat√°n, threatened to collapse that day, but did not. All the buildings suffered damage but along with the collapsed Nuevo Le√≥n building, buildings such as those called Veracruz, Yucat√°n and Oaxaca suffered severe damage such as severely cracked foundations. Twelve buildings in the complex were so severely damaged that they were demolished in the next six months. 32 of the buildings were in need of major repairs. Twenty seven were demolished completely. Many remained standing but some of these were too dangerous to occupy at all. The severe damage to this and to the Mulifamiliar Ju√†rez made for a large percentage of the 3,000 housing units lost on that day. Nonoalco-Tlatelolco was declared a disaster area. What remained of the Nuevo Le√≥n building and the Campeche building were the first to be demolished. This area would become the Nuevo Le√≥n Plaza. The reconstruction contract the city government signed promised to return residents to their units in two years. The project lasted until late in the 1990s. Thirty buildings were partially destroyed, removing upper floors. Sixty buildings received minor repairs. Ten were reinforced. The initially budgeted money ran out in six years. Repairs made were shoddy, replacing door, floors and more with inferior materials. Even baths and integrated kitchens which were not damaged were taken out and replaced with inferior ones. Many, who could not afford to wait further, sold their units at bargain prices, often to those politically connected, or just abandoned them altogether, allowing squatters to move in. Another quake in 1993, caused the demolition of the Atizap√°n and 20 de Noviembre buildings as well as the two Tecpan towers. The Torre Insignia was abandoned in the same year. Despite repair work being officially declared finished in 1995, buildings were left with large cracks in the wall, loose wiring, half done projects, unhinged door, inoperable elevators and more. This is in spite of the 600 million pesos spent on the effort. In that year, the complex was left with approximately 40,000 inhabitants in 90 buildings and 10,560 apartments. A number of buildings in the complex were damaged once again by a 6.3 Guerrero-centered quake that passed through Mexico City in 2007. The complex today Three of the buildings in the complex The complex is bounded by Avenida Manuel Gonz√°lez, Paseo de la Reforma, Calzada Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n and Avenida de los Insurgentes Norte. It occupies approximately 946,000 m2 and remains as the largest vertical apartments complex in Mexico. Currently 55,000 people live there with 40% being senior citizens and retired. Twenty eight percent of the space is dedicated to green spaces, sidewalks and roadway. Its main road extends from east to west, measuring 2.5 km. There are 22 schools, three health clinics, a hospital, three social clubs, a union office, four movie theaters, a Metro stop, a cultural building of UNAM (which used to be the SRE building) as well as 90 apartment buildings. Since 1985, a number of preventative measures have been taken in the surviving buildings including inspections and the removal of accessory or decorative features that may be in danger of falling off. However, the deterioration of the area continues. Today, the socioeconomic level of the complex is low or very low income. Many residents blame the government for failing to halt the deterioration. Others also blame residents‚Äô failure to identify themselves as part of a community and as owners of or responsible for the complex's common spaces. This is especially true in the parks and other spaces between the buildings. The two major issues for the complex are crime and the structural risk and maintenance of the area. The complex and surrounding neighborhoods such as Colonia Morelos, Atlampla, Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera, Colonia Guerrero, Tepito, Colonia Buenavista, and San Simon Tolonahuac and Colonia Peralvillo are all high crime areas, which makes the security a great problem to resolve. The most common infractions are petty robbery, urination in public areas, drugs distribution and public drinking. About three arrests per day are made for these offenses. However, there is not enough police coverage for the complex. The area should have, as a minimum, 30 police assigned to each section, for a total of 90. The 17th Group of Auxiliary Police is assigned to the area, but there are only six security modules with only six police each. Of the six mini police stations there, three are abandoned or used as storage, and the remaining three do not have telephone lines to allow residents to call directly. It is rare to find police on patrol there at night, and police from outside refuse to enter there. This has allowed eleven known gangs to establish a presence, with members from age 12 to 20. These gangs are dedicated to the sale of drugs, muggings and car theft. An area of 200,000 m2 suffers an average of six serious crimes per day and the theft of fourteen cars per month. Some of the worst activity occurs in the Chihuahua building. Crime against residents is worst in the common areas, with about half having witnessed or been victim of a crime, usually robbery, both in the streets and in their homes and businesses. Homicide is also common. Structural problems include the relatively fragile state of the remaining buildings and their susceptibility to further damage. The weight of the complex is causing the subsoil to sink. In addition to the problems remaining from inadequate earthquake repairs, many of the buildings are leaning as well. This has prompted monitoring from both the city government and several universities over the 2000s. Because of fears of further damage, residents of the complex have opposed construction projects such as a vehicular overpass on Flores Magnon street, and more recently, the construction and operation of Line 3 of the city's Metrobus, which is being constructed in 2010. In addition to the soundness of the structures, there are problems with homeless and squatters, graffiti, flooding due to lack of pumps, the lack of garbage collection leading to rat infestations and the destruction of parks and other common areas.

It has been held since 1980.  Structure  The conference is attended by: * the Governor of California, Governor of Arizona, Governor of New Mexico, and Governor of Texas, and * the Governor of Baja California, Governor of Sonora, Governor of Chihuahua, Governor of Coahuila, Governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, and Governor of Tamaulipas. The conferences typically last from two to three days. The conference's location changes among the member states each year, and often alternates between the U.S. and Mexico. The conference provides a forum for state- and regional-level concerns, issues, and opportunities to be discussed by those in executive charge of the border regions. Results of the policy coordination efforts of the body are often announced via joint declarations at the close of conferences. No permanent office or staff belongs to the conference itself. The conference was attended by as many as 1,200 people until 1994, but was scaled back in size in subsequent years to somewhat over 100 people, in order to permit the governors better opportunities for personal interaction and substantive discussions. Its importance is still uncertain, however, as it is sometimes seen as more about publicity and conversation than accomplishing tangible results.  History  The first conference was held in Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, in 1980. The conference in 2009 was the 27th such meeting; the conference planned for 1985 failed to instantiate, no conferences were held in 1986 and 1988, and in 1995 the Mexican governors held their own conference due to a lack of U.S. representation. From the beginning, the Border Governors Conference has discussed the hottest issues affecting the border, such as immigration and trade. The 1981 conference in El Paso, Texas, reached an impasse over whether to support U.S. President Ronald Reagan's proposed immigration reforms, which would grant amnesty to illegal aliens but require a 90 percent reduction in the number of undocumented Mexican workers entering the U.S. each year. The conference unanimously endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, but not before some 200 demonstrators protested outside the Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, for better living conditions. In favor of comprehensive immigration reform the conference was in their joint communique after the 2007 meeting. A flurry of activity related to the conference took place in 2010, due to the passage of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law. It was scheduled to be held in Phoenix, Arizona, in September 2010 and be hosted by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. The governors of the six Mexican states belonging to the conference vowed to boycott it in protest of the law, saying SB 1070 is \\"based on ethnic and cultural prejudice contrary to fundamental rights,\\" and Brewer said in response that she was canceling the gathering. Governors Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, both U.S. border governors who oppose the law, will co-host an \\"interim meeting\\" of the conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico, instead. In the following year of 2011, three of the four U.S. governors failed to appear in Ensenada, Baja California, for the conference, claiming scheduling conflicts, risking of a diminishment of the conference's importance.

Portrait by Boris Kustodiyev (Portrait of Chaliapin (Kustodiev painting)), 1921. In sewing and tailoring, a lining is an inner layer of fabric, fur, or other material inserted into clothing, hats, luggage, curtains, handbags and similar items. Linings provide a neat inside finish and conceal interfacing, padding, the raw edges of seams, and other construction details. A lining reduces the wearing strain on clothing, extending the useful life of the lined garment. A smooth lining allows a coat or jacket to slip on over other clothing easily, and linings add warmth to cold-weather wear.Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), pp. 24, 106Shaeffer (2007), p. 176 Linings are typically made of solid colors to coordinate with the garment fabric, but patterned and contrasting-colored linings are also used. Designer Madeleine Vionnet introduced the ensemble in which the coat was lined in the fabric used for the dress worn with it,Brockman (1965), p. 40 and this notion remains a characteristic of the Chanel suit, which often features a lining and blouse of the same fabric.Shaeffer (2007), p. 182 In tailoring, home sewing, and ready-to-wear clothing construction, linings are usually completed as a unit before being fitted into the garment shell. In haute couture, the sleeves and body are usually lined separately before assembly.Shaeffer (2007), p. 176 Some specialized types of lining include the following: Interlining This is an additional layer of fabric between the lining and the outer garment shell. Insulating interlinings for winter garments are usually sewn to the individual lining pieces before the lining is assembled.Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), p. 111 Partial or half lining This type lines only the upper back and front of the garment, concealing the shoulder pads and interfacings,Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), p. 58 with or without sleeves. Zip-in, zip-out, snap-out or button-in lining (sometimes called a \\"liner\\") This is a warm removable lining for a jacket, coat, or raincoat that is held in place with a zipper, snap fasteners, or buttons. Garments with removable linings are usually lined with a lightweight fabric as well, to provide a neat finish when the warm lining is not worn.

George Nissen purchased the first franchise in the fledgling league on March 21, 1978 for $50,000. Nissen, who had been a star gymnast at the University of Iowa in the 1930s, pioneered the manufacture and sale of the modern trampoline at his Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Co. in Cedar Rapids. The team made it to the league's championship series both seasons, falling to the Houston Angels in 1978-79 and to the New York Stars in 1979‚Äì80. The team played their games at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa and at the Five Seasons Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. History The league began with a player draft held in Manhattan's Essex House in July 1978, with eight teams participating. By the time of the draft, Iowa was one of only three teams that had a nickname selected and the only team that had already engaged a coach. With its last pick in the draft, the Cornets selected Uljana Semjonova, a 7-foot-4-inch player for the Soviet Union's national women's basketball team who would be inducted as an inaugural member of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in the class of 1999, but would never play a game in the WBL. Molly Bolin, who grew up in Moravia, Iowa, became the first player signed by any team in the WBL when she was signed by the Cornets. The team finished the 1978‚Äì79 season with a record of 21 wins and 13 losses, tied for the Midwest Division lead with the Chicago Hustle. In the first round of the playoffs, Chicago took the first game in overtime, but Iowa won the last two games to advance to the championship series against the Houston Angels. Houston won the first two games of the series by scores of 89-85 and 112-98\\\\. Iowa won the next two games by scores of 110-101 and 89-79 to tie the series at two games apiece and setting up a fifth and final game for the title. Behind 36 points by Paula Mayo, the Houston Angels defeated the Cornets on May 2, 1979, to take the league's first championship, 111‚Äì104 in the fifth and final game of a best-three-out-of-five competition. In the 1979‚Äì80 season, Iowa finished atop the Midwestern Division with a record of 24 wins and 12 losses, and as one of the two teams with the league's best record earned a bye in the first round. In the semifinals, Iowa played defeated the Minnesota Fillies, losing the first game 108-87, but winning the next two games by scores of 128-111 and 95-92 to advance to the league championship for their second consecutive season. On April 9, 1980, despite Iowa's league- leading scorer Molly Bolin's 36 point, the New York Stars held on to win game four of the finals 125-114, behind 27 points by Pearl Moore and 22 by Janice Thomas. Molly Bolin of the Cornets and Ann Meyers of the New Jersey Gems were co-winners of the Most Valuable Player title for the 1979‚Äì80 season. The team was disbanded after the 1979‚Äì80 season.

LAST AUTUMN'S DREAM is a new melodic rock super-group featuring famed Swedish singer Mikael Erlandsson together with former FAIR WARNING guitarist Andy Malecek plus the three EUROPE cohorts Mic Michaeli (on keyboards), John Leven (on bass) and Ian Haugland (on drums). The idea of this band came about when Mikael's record company in Japan proposed him to join forces with the fantastic guitar player Andy Malecek who enjoyed great success in the German hard rock band Fair Warning. Mikael and Andy were both hooked by the idea and a plan for the album began to grow. Mikael's production companies in Sweden: XTC Productions/Studio in Stockholm and Sunday Music in Gothenburg also supported the idea and they turned to Ian Haugland, Mic Michaeli and John Lev√©n from Europe and asked if they were interested. After listening to Mikael and Andy‚Äôs new, strong material, they all decided to join in and the band Last Autumn‚Äôs Dream was born.

Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was giving the song to him. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity.

Description The house is a two-story gable roofed structure that also has a one-story wing that contains an entrance and porch. The house is an upright and wing structure that is a mix between Italianate and Late Victorian architecture. The upright has a front porch that spans the section, which contains a front door surrounded by side and transom lights, along with two four-over-four window. On the second floor are four- over-four-light, double-hung sash windows. Above these, at the top of the gable, is a rectangular window with a decorative grille. The one-story wing has a gable roof, and the front facade contains a second, recessed porch, within which are a door with two windows. A third porch is located on one side of the house. All three porches are supported by turned posts on square bases. A bay window formerly located in the wing section has been removed some time in the 20th century. History The house was built around 1866 by local lumber merchant Samuel W. Temple, who was a leading businessman in Tecumseh. Temple arrived in Tecumseh in 1859 from Vermont, and established a series of wood-product factories. He operated his lumberyard and furniture-making business right next door to his house. The house was currently unoccupied and in disrepair until it was purchased by new owners in 2013, who are fully renovating it and expect to be finished in 2014.

The party was the first of the proletarian parties that emerged in the country after the enactment of the Universal Manhood Suffrage Act of 1925. The party was banned by the Japanese government just a few hours after its foundation.  Preparations  The process to found such a proletarian party had been initiated by the Japan Peasant Union. It sought to gather all parts of the labour movement in the country behind one political party. The preparatory process lasted for several months. In June 1925, the Japan Peasant Union sent out invitations to form the Proletarian Party Preparatory Council. Soon, around 1,000 persons had enlisted in the Preparatory Council. On August 16, 1925, sixteen left-wing groups met, and agreed to form a unified proletarian political party which would include every labour organization with a membership exceeding 100. The Preparatory Council included the rival trade union centres Sodomei and Hy≈çgikai. The Platform and Bylaws Research Committee of the Proletarian Party Preparatory Council held its first meeting in September 1925. At the meeting, three draft proposals for party platform were discussed. Two drafts had been authored by rightwing moderates whilst the third (presented by Sano Fumio) represented the communist line. Sano's draft, which emphasized that the party should be built on class struggle and not reformism, was adopted by the Committee. Hy≈çgikai also submitted their draft for party platform, which listed various political and economical demands. Sodomei protested against both the Sano and the Hy≈çgikai proposals. On November 29, 1925, Sodomei withdrew from the Preparatory Council, citing that the party-to-be would be in the hands of the far left. The following day Hy≈çgikai declared their withdrawal from the Preparatory Council.  Founding  The founding conference of the party was held on December 1, 1925, at the YMCA Hall in Tokyo.International Labour Office. Industrial Labour in Japan. Japanese economic history, 1930‚Äì1960, v. 5. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 113 Thirty-three labour organizations took part in the founding of the party. Sugiyama Motojiro was elected party chairman, and Asanuma Inejir≈ç general secretary. In the party platform the party adopted at its founding meeting demands such as tenants' rights protection, recognition of trade unions, social insurance, and downsizing of the armed forces were included.  Ban  However, just two hours after the founding meeting had concluded the leadership elected at the party conference were summoned at the Metropolitan Police Board. The Police claimed that the newly founded party had a secret communist platform in addition to the official party platform.Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo.

The song was also often used as the first song of Cheap Trick concerts, and as a result was the first song on the band's seminal live album Cheap Trick at Budokan. \\"Hello There\\" is a frantic, energetic, raucous hard rock song. As performed on In Color, the song starts with Nielsen playing a frenzied, fuzzy guitar part for two and a half bars, then Bun E. Carlos' strong drum beat appears, and finally Tom Petersson's bass and Robin Zander's vocal join in. The entire song lasts 1 minute and 41 seconds. Annie Zaleski of Ultimate Classic Rock described it as having \\"razor- edge riffs, a frenzied drum solo and ragged exhortations of 'Would you like to do a number with me?'\\" Cheap Trick also released the song on its compilation albums Sex, America, Cheap Trick and The Essential Cheap Trick. A live video of Cheap Trick performing \\"Hello There\\" at the Budokan concert was shown on the DVD included with the 30th anniversary collector's edition release of Cheap Trick at Budokan album. Critic Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone detected echoes in the song of the \\"manic verve\\" of The Beatles' song \\"Birthday\\". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic described \\"Hello There\\" as \\"Cheap Trick's 'Helter Skelter.'\\" Denise Sullivan of Allmusic describes the song as being \\"all about the good-time/partying spirit, asking the proverbial question, 'Are you ready to rock? John M. Borack listed the song one of 20 Cheap Trick songs to die for and said of the song that \\"it's quick, it's kick ass and it's a perfect set opener.\\" Zaleski rated it as the #8 all-time Cheap Trick song and described the live version from Cheap Trick at Budokan as \\"the sound of a band exploding into its own\\" and \\"that it \\"perfectly captures the band‚Äôs transformation from a cult act into rock superstars.\\" Nielsen has stated that he wrote the song because in its early days the band did not always get a soundcheck before it played live. Rather than use one of their more melodic songs to experiment with the sound coming out of the PA system, they could use this song, which Nielsen called a \\"perfect welcome to the show intro piece.\\" Nielsen said he got the idea for such an intro song from an earlier band, Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera. \\"Hello There\\" replaced \\"ELO Kiddies\\" as Cheap Trick's live opening song. It was the band's typical live opener from 1977 through the mid-1980s. Music critic Bryan Wawzenek described it as \\"the best concert opener in rock and roll.\\" \\"Hello There\\" was covered by Foetus on their 1996 album Boil. It was also covered by Phil Lewis in 2000. Cheap Trick's version was also included on the soundtrack to the Matt Dillon film Over the Edge, along with the Cheap Trick songs \\"Surrender\\", \\"Downed\\" and \\"Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace.\\" A version of \\"Hello There\\" that was recorded by the band in 1997 is also included in the music video game Rock Band 2 as a playable track. \\"Goodnight Now\\" Nielsen wrote a companion song to \\"Hello There\\" called \\"Goodnight Now.\\" \\"Goodnight Now\\" basically reworks \\"Hello There\\" and was used by the band to end their main set, or the entire show, for many years. Critic John Serba rates \\"Goodnight Now\\" as being one of his favorite Cheap Trick songs for being such a \\"blatantly obvious set closer\\" that makes you want to stay for more even as it closes the show. The song appears on Cheap Trick at Budokan as the next to last song, before the encore \\"Clock Strikes Ten\\". At the actual concert from which the album was recorded, \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" was played as part of the encore, after \\"Goodnight Now\\" and before \\"Clock Strikes Ten\\", but the original album release of Live at Budokan moved \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" out of sequence to open side 2. In the Netherlands, \\"Goodnight Now\\" was released as the B-side of the top 10 single \\"Surrender\\".

It assesses various lifecycle environmental aspects of a device and ranks products as Gold, Silver or Bronze based on a set of environmental performance criteria.  Background  EPEAT is managed by the Green Electronics Council, a non-profit organization founded in 2005 to inspire and catalyze environmental leadership throughout the lifecycle of electronic technologies.' In the system, device manufacturers self-declare which environmental criteria their products meet, with those declarations overseen by a network of Conformity Assurance Bodies that help manufacturers demonstrate that their products meet the IEEE 1680 family of ‚Äògreen electronics‚Äô standards. Products are rated Bronze, Silver or Gold depending upon the number of criteria the devices meet. Bronze-rated products meet all the required criteria in each EPEAT product category. Silver-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 50% of the optional criteria. Gold-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 75% of the optional criteria.  History  The system launched in 2006 with 60 products from three different PC and Display (monitor) manufacturers. The PC category includes 51 different environmental criteria - 23 required and 28 optional ‚Äî that measure a product's efficiency and environmental attributes. In 2013, two additional categories made their EPEAT debut: Imaging Equipment in February and Televisions in April. On January 24, 2007, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13423, which required all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems. This commitment was renewed on October 5, 2009 by President Obama's Executive Order 13514. The U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) were subsequently adjusted to require all federal agencies to purchase 'at least 95 percent' of their electronics based on EPEAT status if an appropriate EPEAT category exists for those devices. The FAR was updated in 2015 to reflect EPEAT's addition of the Imaging Equipment and Television categories. In January 2010, Amazon.com began using EPEAT to identify greener electronic products on its website.Amazon.com is using EPEAT labelling  The Green IT Review Multiple international organizations provide EPEAT-registration services for manufacturers in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. These organizations, called Conformity Assurance Bodies, include Green Electronics Council's Conformity Assurance Body, Dekra, UL Environment, Intertek, TuV Rheinland, CQC, CESI and VDE. Each company has Auditors qualified to evaluate the conformance claims of electronics manufacturers and suppliers.http://www.epeat.net/participants/conformity- assurance-bodies/[http://www.dekra.de/en/green-electronics Sustainable Products ‚Äì Green Electronics], Dekra, DEKRA and EPEAT: Working together for green electronic products In July 2014, the EPEAT system expanded to support product registrations in India. With the addition of India, EPEAT was available in 43 countries.  Apple's Retina MacBook Pro controversy  In 2012, Apple's Retina MacBook Pro debuted on EPEAT with a Gold rating after briefly deciding to remove all of its products from EPEAT. The laptop was accepted following a number of \\"clarifications\\" of the standard, for example specifying that the presence of USB ports was now considered sufficient to meet the upgradability requirement, and that tools to disassemble the laptop need only be available for purchase by the public.

Atlantic puffins from Newfoundland and terns were reintroduced to the island. Puffins had not been spotted on the island since 1885. Biologists from other countries joined the society to help coax the birds back to Maine's islands and control the population of predators.

With the help of fish delivered to Eastern Egg Rock, 69 percent of Maine's roseate terns were nesting there by 2004. Now the island is the southern limit of puffin habitat in North America.

A shareholder primacy approach often gives shareholders power to intercede directly and frequently in corporate decision- making, through such means as unilateral shareholder power to amend corporate charters, shareholder referenda on business decisions and regular corporate board election contests. The shareholder primacy norm was first used by courts to resolve disputes among majority and minority shareholders, and, over time, this use of the shareholder primacy norm evolved into the modern doctrine of minority shareholder oppression. James Kee writes, \\"If private property were truly respected, shareholder interest would be the primary, or even better, the sole purpose, of the corporation.\\" The doctrine of shareholder's primacy is criticized for being at odds with corporate social responsibility and other legal obligations because it focuses solely on maximizing shareholder profits.

Tolomato Cemetery () is a Catholic cemetery located on Cordova Street in St. Augustine, Florida. The cemetery was the former site of \\"Tolomato\\", a village of Guale Indian converts to Christianity and the Franciscan friars who ministered to them. The site of the village and Franciscan mission is noted on a 1737 map of St. Augustine. A cemetery for the inhabitants of the village was also located on the grounds, with a portion of this cemetery set aside for former American black slaves, who had converted to Catholicism after escaping bondage in the Carolinas.Black society in Spanish Florida by Jane Landers - P. 130 The location of Tolomato was just outside the city across from the Rosario Line, a defensive line constructed in the First Spanish Period, which consisted of an earthen embankment planted with cactus and Yucca gloriosa, also known as Spanish daggers.  History  = Tolomato mission = When Britain gained control of St. Augustine in 1763 most of the Spanish population of 3,100 left for Cuba along with many of the Native American converts to Christianity, including the friars and inhabitants of Tolomato. The British occupants being primarily Protestant had no need of the wooden Catholic church on the site and tore it down for firewood, leaving the coquina bell tower intact. When, in 1777 the residents of Andrew Turnbull's colony of New Smyrna decided to flee the dismal conditions en masse, they walked 70 miles north on the King's Road to St. Augustine. These refugees, indentured servants from the Mediterranean, a majority from the island of Menorca, were granted refuge by the British governor Patrick Tonyn. The spiritual leader of these refugees collectively known as the Menorcans, Father Pedro Camps, petitioned the governor for permission to use the old mission and village of Tolomato for his constituents who were mostly Catholic. The petition was granted and the grounds became the prime burial ground for the Menorcan colonists.A Guide to Historic St. Augustine, Florida by Steve Rajtar, Kelly Goodman -P. 87 = Tolomato Cemetery = The cemetery continued to be used as a Catholic cemetery by the Menorcans' descendants as well as other Catholics throughout the various changes of regime in St. Augustine from British back to Spanish in 1783, to American control in 1821. The cemetery was officially closed in 1884 along with the nearby Huguenot Cemetery, but received two more, unauthorized, burials: those of Catalina Usina Llambias, who died in 1886, and Robert Sabate, who died in 1892. In both cases, the family of the deceased were fined $25.00 for violating the law. The first Bishop of St. Augustine, Augustin Verot, who died in 1876, is interred in the mortuary chapel at the back of the cemetery. Father Camps, who died in 1790, was originally buried at Tolomato, then re-interred 10 years later at the newly built cathedral. F√©lix Varela, a Cuban priest and social reformer, was buried at Tolomato for 60 years until his remains were disinterred and taken back to Cuba. An historically significant early burial is that of America's first black general, Jorge Biassou. A leader of the Haitian Revolution of 1791, Biassou became, in the twists and turns of international politics, a Spanish general. He was sent to St. Augustine in 1796, as the second highest- paid official of the colony, and stayed until his death in 1801. His funeral was held at Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, and he was buried in Tolomato in a grave that is now unmarked. In recent years the cemetery has become a place of pilgrimage for members of the Haitian-American Historical Society and many Haitian diplomats, including Ambassador Raymond Joseph (donor of a bench in front of the chapel in Biassou's memory), who have worked to gain public recognition for our first black general. On June 27, 2011, a historic marker was finally unveiled, a couple of blocks away at 42 St. George Street, on the home site of General Biassou. Also buried within the cemetery are a number of Confederate soldiers, including some members of the Saint Augustine Blues, the local militia unit which took possession of the St. Francis Barracks and the Castillo de San Marcos for the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War. Gumercindo Antonio Pacetti (1825-1877),a Menorcan, was Mayor of St. Augustine and surrendered the city to the Federals in March 1862. He went to the family home in Cuba where he hosted escaped Confederate Secretary of War and former U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge. Pacetti returned to the city and is buried in Tolomato Cemetery.

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, an apex graph is a graph that can be made planar by the removal of a single vertex. The deleted vertex is called an apex of the graph. It is an apex, not the apex because an apex graph may have more than one apex; for example, in the minimal nonplanar graphs K5 or K3,3, every vertex is an apex. The apex graphs include graphs that are themselves planar, in which case again every vertex is an apex. The null graph is also counted as an apex graph even though it has no vertex to remove. Apex graphs are closed under the operation of taking minors and play a role in several other aspects of graph minor theory: linkless embedding, Hadwiger's conjecture,. YŒîY-reducible graphs, and relations between treewidth and graph diameter. Characterization and recognition Apex graphs are closed under the operation of taking minors: contracting any edge, or removing any edge or vertex, leads to another apex graph. For, if G is an apex graph with apex v, then any contraction or removal that does not involve v preserves the planarity of the remaining graph, as does any edge removal of an edge incident to v. If an edge incident to v is contracted, the effect on the remaining graph is equivalent to the removal of the other endpoint of the edge. And if v itself is removed, any other vertex may be chosen as the apex. By the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem, because they form a minor-closed family of graphs, the apex graphs have a forbidden graph characterization. There are only finitely many graphs that are neither apex graphs nor have another non-apex graph as a minor. These graphs are forbidden minors for the property of being an apex graph. Any other graph G is an apex graph if and only if none of the forbidden minors is a minor of G. These forbidden minors include the seven graphs of the Petersen family, three disconnected graphs formed from the disjoint unions of two of K5 and K3,3, and many other graphs. However, a complete description of them remains unknown.. Despite the complete set of forbidden minors remaining unknown, it is possible to test whether a given graph is an apex graph, and if so, to find an apex for the graph, in linear time. More generally, for any fixed constant k, it is possible to recognize in linear time the k-apex graphs, the graphs in which the removal of some carefully chosen set of at most k vertices leads to a planar graph.. If k is variable, however, the problem is NP-complete.. Chromatic number Every apex graph has chromatic number at most five: the underlying planar graph requires at most four colors by the four color theorem, and the remaining vertex needs at most one additional color. used this fact in their proof of the case k = 6 of the Hadwiger conjecture, the statement that every 6-chromatic graph has the complete graph K6 as a minor: they showed that any minimal counterexample to the conjecture would have to be an apex graph, but since there are no 6-chromatic apex graphs such a counterexample cannot exist. conjectured that every 6-vertex-connected graph that does not have as a minor must be an apex graph. If this were proved, the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour‚ÄìThomas result on the Hadwiger conjecture would be an immediate consequence. J√∏rgensen's conjecture remains unproven.. However, if false, it has only finitely many counterexamples. Local treewidth A graph family F has bounded local treewidth if the graphs in F obey a functional relationship between diameter and treewidth: there exists a function ∆í such that the treewidth of a diameter-d graph in F is at most ∆í(d). The apex graphs do not have bounded local treewidth: the apex graphs formed by connecting an apex vertex to every vertex of an n √ó n grid graph have treewidth n and diameter 2, so the treewidth is not bounded by a function of diameter for these graphs. However, apex graphs are intimately connected to bounded local treewidth: the minor-closed graph families F that have bounded local treewidth are exactly the families that have an apex graph as one of their forbidden minors.; . A minor-closed family of graphs that has an apex graph as one of its forbidden minors is known as apex-minor-free. With this terminology, the connection between apex graphs and local treewidth can be restated as the fact that apex-minor-free graph families are the same as minor-closed graph families with bounded local treewidth. The concept of bounded local treewidth forms the basis of the theory of bidimensionality, and allows for many algorithmic problems on apex-minor-free graphs to be solved exactly by a polynomial-time algorithm or a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, or approximated using a polynomial-time approximation scheme.; ; . Apex-minor- free graph families obey a strengthened version of the graph structure theorem, leading to additional approximation algorithms for graph coloring and the travelling salesman problem.. However, some of these results can also be extended to arbitrary minor-closed graph families via structure theorems relating them to apex-minor-free graphs.. Embeddings If G is an apex graph with apex v, and œÑ is the minimum number of faces needed to cover all the neighbors of v in a planar embedding of G\\\\\\\\{v}, then G may be embedded onto a two-dimensional surface of genus œÑ ‚àí 1: simply add that number of bridges to the planar embedding, connecting together all the faces into which v must be connected. For instance, adding a single vertex to an outerplanar graph (a graph with œÑ = 1) produces a planar graph. When G\\\\\\\\{v} is 3-connected, his bound is within a constant factor of optimal: every surface embedding of G requires genus at least œÑ/160. However, it is NP-hard to determine the optimal genus of a surface embedding of an apex graph.. By using SPQR trees to encode the possible embeddings of the planar part of an apex graph, it is possible to compute a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the only crossings involve the apex vertex, minimizing the total number of crossings, in polynomial time.. However, if arbitrary crossings are allowed, it becomes NP- hard to minimize the number of crossings, even in the special case of apex graphs formed by adding a single edge to a planar graph.. Apex graphs are also linklessly embeddable in three-dimensional space: they can be embedded in such a way that each cycle in the graph is the boundary of a disk that is not crossed by any other feature of the graph.. A drawing of this type may be obtained by drawing the planar part of the graph in a plane, placing the apex above the plane, and connecting the apex by straight-line edges to each of its neighbors. Linklessly embeddable graphs form a minor-closed family with the seven graphs in the Petersen family as their minimal forbidden minors;. therefore, these graphs are also forbidden as minors for the apex graphs. However, there exist linklessly embeddable graphs that are not apex graphs. YŒîY-reducibility Robertson's example of a non-YŒîY-reducible apex graph. A connected graph is YŒîY-reducible if it can be reduced to a single vertex by a sequence of steps, each of which is a Œî-Y or Y-Œî transform, the removal of a self-loop or multiple adjacency, the removal of a vertex with one neighbor, and the replacement of a vertex of degree two and its two neighboring edges by a single edge.. Like the apex graphs and the linkless embeddable graphs, the YŒîY-reducible graphs are closed under graph minors. And, like the linkless embeddable graphs, the YŒîY-reducible graphs have the seven graphs in the Petersen family as forbidden minors, prompting the question of whether these are the only forbidden minors and whether the YŒîY-reducible graphs are the same as the linkless embeddable graphs. However, Neil Robertson provided an example of an apex graph that is not YŒîY-reducible. Since every apex graph is linkless embeddable, this shows that there are graphs that are linkless embeddable but not YŒîY-reducible and therefore that there are additional forbidden minors for the YŒîY-reducible graphs. Robertson's apex graph is shown in the figure. It can be obtained by connecting an apex vertex to each of the degree-three vertices of a rhombic dodecahedron, or by merging two diametrally opposed vertices of a four-dimensional hypercube graph. Because the rhombic dodecahedron's graph is planar, Robertson's graph is an apex graph. It is a triangle-free graph with minimum degree four, so it cannot be changed by any YŒîY-reduction. Nearly planar graphs The 16-vertex M√∂bius ladder, an example of a nearly planar graph. If a graph is an apex graph, it is not necessarily the case that it has a unique apex. For instance, in the minor- minimal nonplanar graphs K5 and K3,3, any of the vertices can be chosen as the apex. defined a nearly planar graph to be a nonplanar apex graph with the property that all vertices can be the apex of the graph; thus, K5 and K3,3 are nearly planar. He provided a classification of these graphs into four subsets, one of which consists of the graphs that (like the M√∂bius ladders) can be embedded onto the M√∂bius strip in such a way that the single edge of the strip coincides with a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph. Prior to the proof of the four color theorem, he proved that every nearly planar graph can be colored with at most four colors, except for the graphs formed from a wheel graph with an odd outer cycle by replacing the hub vertex with two adjacent vertices, which require five colors. Additionally, he proved that, with a single exception (the eight-vertex complement graph of the cube) every nearly planar graph has an embedding onto the projective plane. However, the phrase \\"nearly planar graph\\" is highly ambiguous: it has also been used to refer to apex graphs,; . graphs formed by adding one edge to a planar graph,. and graphs formed from a planar embedded graph by replacing a bounded number of faces by \\"vortexes\\" of bounded pathwidth,. as well as for other less precisely-defined sets of graphs. Related graph classes An abstract graph is said to be n-apex if it can be made planar by deleting n or fewer vertices. A 1-apex graph is also said to be apex. According to , a graph is edge-apex if there is some edge in the graph that can be deleted to make the graph planar. A graph is contraction-apex if there is some edge in the graph that can be contracted to make the graph planar.

Equally, it escapes the regulatory supervision and checks and balances to which corporations are subject. Large firms structured as partnerships are sometimes regarded as uncorporations. The rise of uncorporations resulted partly from costly corporate monitoring devices such as independent directors, owner voting, and fiduciary duties being often ineffective. Publicly traded partnerships, real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and venture capital funds are other types of uncorporations. A business trust is another type of uncorporation that has long been a competition of corporation as a form of business organization.

He is also the author of several non- fiction books including two New York Times best-sellers, The Age of the Unthinkable and The Seventh Sense. Early life and education R–∞mo was r–∞ised in Los Ranchos, New Mexico, on the Rio Grande.http://www.–∞bqjournal.c–æm/news/st–∞te/271029418157newsstate03-27-09.htm He began flying in his late teens and later wrote the book No Visible Horizon about his experiences as a competitive aerobatic pilot. Ramo holds a bachelor's degree in Latin American Studies from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in economics from New York University. Journalism career Ramo began his career as a journalist at Newsweek in 1993. He joined Time magazine in 1996 when he was hired by Walter Isaacson. Ramo oversaw the magazine‚Äôs digital operations and ran Times digital magazine while also covering technology. In 1998, he became foreign editor of Time, overseeing the magazine's international coverage. He was the youngest senior editor and foreign editor in the history of Time Magazine. During his tenure at the magazine, he wrote more than 20 domestic and international cover stories. Business career Prompted by an interest in business and global affairs, Ramo moved to Beijing in 2002. He worked with John L. Thornton, a former president of Goldman Sachs, in China from 2003-2005, when he joined Kissinger Associates as managing director. In 2011, he became vice chairman of Kissinger Associates. In 2015, he became co-chief executive officer. Fluent in Mandarin, Ramo currently divides his time between Beijing and New York, and serves as advisor to large corporations and investors with a particular focus on large- scale cross-border transactions. He additionally serves on the Board of Directors of Starbucks and Federal Express.\` Television career  In 2008, Ramo served as China analyst for NBC Sports during its coverage of the Beijing Olympic Games. For his work with Bob Costas and Matt Lauer during the Opening Ceremony of the Games he shared in a Peabody and an Emmy award. In 2018, Ramo rejoined NBC Sports as a contributor and analyst for its coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. However, Ramo was criticized for the insensitive comment he made about Japan‚ÄìKorea relations and sentiments on Japan among Koreans during NBC's coverage of the game's opening ceremony. Affiliations Ramo has been a member of the Leaders 21 project, a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a ‚ÄúYoung Global Leader‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlobal Leader of Tomorrow‚Äù of the World Economic Forum, a Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute, and a co-founder of the US-China Young Leaders Forum. Key concepts The World Economic Forum called Ramo ‚ÄúOne of China‚Äôs leading foreign-born scholars.‚Äù = The Beijing Consensus = In 2004 he published \\"The Beijing Consensus,\\" which contrasted the Chinese model of economics and politics with western, \\"Washington Consensus\\" models. In 2007 he published \\"Brand China,\\" an analysis of China's international image. = Co-Evolution = In 2011, Ramo proposed a new model of US-China relations based on complexity theory known as ‚Äúco-evolution.‚Äù Works =No Visible Horizon= In 2003, Ramo published No Visible Horizon: Surviving the World's Most Dangerous Sport, which tackled his training as an aerobatic flyer and the \\"violent, difficult maneuvers\\" of the sport. =The Age of the Unthinkable= In 2009, Ramo published The Age of the Unthinkable: Why the New World Disorder Constantly Surprises Us and What We Can Do About It, which was a New York Times bestseller that was translated into 15 languages. The book applies ideas of chaos theory and complex adaptive systems to problems of foreign policy. =The Seventh Sense= In 2016, Little, Brown & Co. released Ramo's third book, The Seventh Sense: Power, Fortune, and Survival in the Age of Networks, which purports to identify a \\"new instinct\\" for networks that characterized new groups in politics, economics and security. Drawing on ideas from technology, history and economics, The Seventh Sense claims that the emergence of constant, widespread connection represents a shift in power that will be as significant as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, leading to a widespread collapse of existing institutions and the emergence of new sources of power. In the book, Ramo proposed a new idea for American grand strategy known as ‚ÄúHard Gatekeeping‚Äù in which the country would develop and use platforms for the control of network topology, but would carefully limit access to those platforms. On June 6, 2016, The Seventh Sense debuted on the New York Times bestseller list at #7, and on May 29, 2016, The Seventh Sense was named to the Washington Post's nonfiction bestseller list for the week of May 26, 2016. Controversy =Comment on Japan‚ÄìKorea relations= During NBC's coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, Ramo noted that Japan occupied Korea from 1910‚Äì45, and then added, \\"But every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\\" NBC issued an on-air apology the next morning. NBC later shared that Ramo was hired only for the Opening Ceremony and would have \\"no further role during the PyeongChang Games.\\" Ramo later issued an apology, stating \\"I did not intend to minimize or disrespect a part of Korean history that must never be forgotten.\\" The Korea Times called the comment \\"incorrect and insensitive.\\" While Norman Pearlstine, former Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief, stated his opinion that Ramo's comments contained elements of truth, but that he also engaged in needless hyperbole, American media outlets were overwhelmingly critical of Ramo's statements, denouncing them as \\"clueless\\", \\"false\\", and containing \\"endless generalities\\".

If convicted, he would have faced up to 16 years imprisonment, after having his home searched and property seized. Graber (born c. 1985) was a staff sergeant for the Maryland Air National Guard, with two young children at the time of his arrest. Incident In March, 2010, Graber was speeding on his motorcycle, swerving across traffic lanes, and did at least one wheelie on Interstate 95 while recording with a video camera on his helmet. He was cut off by an unmarked gray sedan. A man in jeans and a sweatshirt exited the vehicle and with gun drawn commanded Graber to get off his motorcycle. The man, Maryland State Trooper Joseph D. Uhler, dressed in plain clothes, then identified himself as \\"State Police\\", and cited Graber with a moving violation for 80 mph in a 65 mph zone. Uhler's badge, which was located on his belt, was not immediately visible in the video until Uhler holstered his firearm. On March 10, Graber posted the video of the encounter on YouTube. Prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment charging Graber with violation of Maryland wiretap laws for audio recording of the officer without his consent. On April 8, police searched Graber's residence and seized the camera, thumb drives, external hard drives, and four computers. Graber was not arrested at that time because he had just had gall bladder surgery. When he turned himself in a week later he was arrested and spent 26 hours in jail. On June 1, he was arraigned in Harford County Circuit Court in Bel Air. He was charged with four felonies and faced a maximum of 16 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Outcome On July 7, 2010, the Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler released an opinion advising a state legislator that, contrary to the claims of Harford County State's Attorney Joseph Cassilly, a traffic stop is not an instance where a police officer can claim a reasonable expectation of privacy. Retrieved 2014-01-25. On September 27, 2010, criminal charges against Graber were dropped.Opinion granting motion to dismiss , Maryland v. Graber (1.29 MB PDF). Retrieved 2011-04-05. The court threw out the charge of \\"recording illegal activity\\" on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional, noting that \\"the video taping of public events is protected under the First Amendment.\\" The judge ruled that Maryland's wire tap law does not prohibit recording of voice or sound in areas where privacy cannot be expected and that a police officer on a traffic stop has no legal expectation of privacy. Overall, Harford County Circuit Court Judge Emory A Plitt Jr. dismissed four of the seven charges filed against Anthony Graber, leaving only traffic code violations. See also *Glik v.

But within twenty years that kingdom soon controlled most of Burma, the capital was moved to Pegu, and Taungoo became a district again. By the mid-19th century, Taungoo was governed by a local governor appointed by the Konbaung kings. The Taungoo District consisted of 52 wards, including today's Pyinmana and Naypyidaw regions. The Taungoo District was cut in half after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British annexed the southern half, including the city of Taungoo while the northern portion, including Pyinmana and Ela, remained Burmese.

Contents  According to Einstein, the profit motive of a capitalist society, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, leads to unnecessary cycles of booms and depressions, and ultimately encourages selfishness instead of cooperation. In addition, the educational system of such a society would be severely undermined because people will educate themselves only to advance their careers. This results in the \\"crippling of individuals\\" and the erosion of human creativity. Unrestrained competition in a capitalist society leads to a huge waste of labor and causes economic anarchy, which Einstein denounces as the real source of capitalism's evil: Einstein predicted that under such a capitalist society, political parties and politicians would be corrupted by financial contributions made by owners of large capital amounts, and the system \\"cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society\\". The essay concludes with Einstein's analysis on how to solve these problems through a planned economy: Einstein asserts that a planned economy that adjusts to production would guarantee a livelihood to every member of society: In his final words, Einstein cautioned that \\"a planned economy is not yet socialism\\", since it may also be accompanied by an \\"all-powerful\\" bureaucracy that leads to the \\"complete enslavement of the individual\\".

He was best known for his work on The Amos 'n' Andy Show, Meet Mr. McNutley, Leave It to Beaver, Ichabod and Me, Bringing Up Buddy, and The Munsters, along with his co-writer Bob Mosher, who was from Auburn, New York. Connelly had a stint in the merchant marines before landing a job at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York City, where he met Mosher, a fellow copywriter. Mosher left the agency in 1942 and moved to Hollywood to write for the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy radio show. Connelly soon followed him. In the mid-1940s, after writing for the Frank Morgan and Phil Harris radio shows, they began a 12-year run writing for The Amos 'n' Andy Show including the early 1950s TV version of the popular radio show. Their first solo effort in television was developing a short-lived anthology series for actor Ray Milland, an experience that taught them, Connelly said, to focus their writing instead on \\"things we know\\". Connelly and Bob Mosher were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story for The Private War of Major Benson, a 1955 comedy that starred Charlton Heston as a hard-nosed Army major who takes command of the ROTC program at a children's academy. It was inspired by an incident Connelly witnessed while driving one of his sons to parochial school. Leave It to Beaver took their dictum of writing about \\"things we know\\" to a new level. Connelly, the father of seven children, and Mosher, the father of two, had to look no further than their own homes for inspiration. Connelly's 14-year-old son, Jay, served as the model for Beaver's older brother, Wally; and Connelly's 8-year-old son, Ricky, was the inspiration for Beaver, the nickname of one of Connelly's merchant marine shipmates. Connelly reportedly followed his children around with a pad of paper writing down funny situations and lines that were later used in the show. Connelly is buried in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery. He died of a stroke while in the Motion Picture Country Home nursing home in Newport Beach, California after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for years. Connelly outlived both of his wives, Kathryn and Ann and was survived by his 7 children, 12 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.

The Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires was a series of epidemics that took place in 1852, 1858, 1870 and 1871, the latter being a disaster that killed about 8% of Porte√±os: in a city where the daily death rate was less than 20, there were days that killed more than 500 people. The Yellow Fever would have come from Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, brought by Argentine soldiers returning from the war just fought in that country, having previously spread in the city of Corrientes. As its worst, Buenos Aires population was reduced to a third because of the exodus of those escaping the scourge. Some of the main causes of the spread of this disease were the insufficient supply of drinking water, pollution of ground water by human waste, the warm and humid climate in summer, the overcrowding suffered by the black people and, since 1871, the overcrowding of the European immigrants who entered the country incessantly and without sanitary measures. Also, the saladeros (manufacturing establishments for producing salted and dried meat) polluted the Matanza River (south of the city limits), and the infected ditches full of debris which ran through the city encouraged the spread of the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which was responsible of transmitting Yellow Fever. A witness to the epidemic of 1871, named Mardoqueo Navarro, wrote on April 13 the following description in his diary:  Outbreaks of Yellow Fever before 1871  Since 1881, thanks to Cuban physician Carlos Finlay, it was known that the transmitting agent of Yellow Fever was mosquito Aedes aegypti. Before that discovery, doctors attributed the cause of many epidemics to what they called \\"miasmas\\" floating in the air. Yellow Fever (or \\"black vomit\\", as it was called due to bleeding that occurs in the gastrointestinal) caused an epidemic in Buenos Aires in 1852. However, by a note addressed to practitioner Soler is known that outbreaks occurred even before that year.Cited in: Howlin, Diego (2004). \\"V√≥mito Negro, Historia de la fiebre amarilla, en Buenos Aires de 1871\\", Revista Persona. As for the 1870 epidemic, it would come from Brazil from merchant ship and caused 100 deaths.Cant√≥n, Eliseo. Historia de la Universidad de Buenos Aires The great epidemic of 1871 =Background= Map of the City of Buenos Aires in 1870 At the end of 1870 there were large numbers of invalids registered in Asunci√≥n, whose populace lived in deplorable poverty. The Paraguayan War had just finished there and the Argentinian intervention began in early 1871, causing the Buenos Aires epidemic by the arrival of the first Argentinian veterans. Also, in the city of Corrientes, with a population of 11,000 and the centre of communication and provision for the allied troops between December 1870 and June of the following year, 2000 people died of yellow fever. Most of the population fled. Other towns in the Corrientes Province suffered the punishment of the disease, such as San Luis del Palmar, Bella Vista and San Roque. In 1871 the National Government convened in Buenos Aires, presided over by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, with Buenos Aires Province represented by Emilio Castro, and Narciso Mart√≠nez de Hoz presided over the municipal government. The city, situated in a plain, had no drainage system nor running water. Hygiene was very precarious and there were many focuses of infection, such as the slums which lacked basic hygiene standards and were crammed with poor black or European immigrants, and the creeks, south of the city limits, which had become a sink for sewage and waste dumped by salting and slaughterhouses along their coasts. As it had no sewerage system, human waste collected in cesspools, which contaminated the ground water and hence the wells, one of the two major sources of the vital element for the majority of the populace. The other source was the R√≠o de la Plata, from which they extracted water by carts, with no process of sanitisation. The filth and waste were used for levelling the terrain and streets in a city growing rapidly, mainly due to the influx of migrants. The streets were very narrow and there were no avenues (the first to be constructed was the Avenida de Mayo, which opened in 1894). There were few plazas and almost no vegetation. The first census of Argentina in 1869 registered 177,787 inhabitants in the City of Buenos Aires, of which 88,126 were foreigners, and of those 44,233 were Italian and 14,609 were Spanish. In addition there were over 19,000 urban dwellings, of which 2300 were made of wood or clay and straw. In addition to the epidemic of yellow fever that we have mentioned, there were outbreaks of cholera in 1867 and 1868, which killed hundreds of people. = The events = The house where the first case was registered (Caras y Caretas 1899) On 27 January 1871, three cases of yellow fever were diagnosed in Buenos Aires. They were all in the San Telmo neighbourhood, which is full of tenements. From this date on, many more cases were registered, mostly in that neighbourhood. The doctors Tamini, Salvador Larrosa and Montes de Oca warned the City Commission of the outbreak of an epidemic. But the Commission, under the leadership of Narciso Mart√≠nez de Hoz, disregarded their warnings and failed to publicise the cases. The controversy grew and was reported by the newspapers. Meanwhile, the Municipality intensified preparations for the official carnival festivities. At the end of February, the doctor Eduardo Wilde said there was an outbreak of the fever (with 10 cases registered on 22 February) and he left some apples, but the people were too entertained by the carnival festivities to listen to his warning. By the end of February at total of 300 cases had been registered, and March began with over 40 deaths a day, rising to 100 by day 6. All were caused by the fever. By now, the plague was hitting the aristocratic neighbourhoods too. Dances were prohibited. A third of the inhabitants decided to abandon the city. On 4 March, the Tribune newspaper commented that by night the streets were so dark \\"it truly appeared as if the terrible scourge had swept away all the residents\\".Citado en Cr√≥nica Hist√≥rica Argentina, Tomo IV, Ed. CODEX (ver detalle en bibliograf√≠a) Yet the worst by far was to come. The General Men's Hospital, the General Women's Hospital, the Hospital Italiano and the orphanage were all overwhelmed. So they created other emergency centres such as the Lazareto de San Roque (the Hospital Ramos Mej√≠a today) and others were rented privately. The port was quarantined and the provinces closed their borders to people or goods coming from Buenos Aires. The municipality was unable to endure the situation, so on 13 March, thanks to a newspaper campaign started by one Evaristo Carriego (although not Evaristo Carriego, the journalist and poet, as he was not born until 12 years later), thousands of neighbours congregated in the Plaza de la Victoria (Plaza de Mayo today) to design a People's Commission of public health. On the following day, it was decided that the lawyer Jos√© Roque P√©rez should be its president, with the journalist H√©ctor F. Varela as his deputy. Other members included the national Vice President Adolfo Alsina, Adolfo Argerich, the poet Carlos Guido y Spano, Bartolom√© Mitre, the canon Domingo C√©sar and the Irish-born priest Patricio Dillon who died in the epidemic and was named Carriego, who affirmed that \\"Even when so many are fleeing, that there are even some who stay in this place of danger to help those who cannot get regular assistance.\\" Among other things, the commission's function was to take charge of the streets and those who lived in places affected by the plague, and in some cases was sent to burn their belongings. The situation was more tragic when those evicted were humble immigrants unable to speak much Spanish, and were therefore unable to understand why such measures were being taken. The Italians, who were the majority of the foreigners, were in parts unjustly accused by the rest of the population of having brought the plague from Europe. Around 5,000 of them applied to the Italian consul to return, but the quotas were very small, and many of those who embarked died offshore.citado en Historia de las Organizaciones de Socorro, La epidemia en Buenos Aires de √Ångel Jankilevich. As for the black population, they lived in miserable conditions which resulted in them being hit harder by the plague. Also, it is said that the army surrounded the zones where they lived and did not permit any movement into Barrio Norte, where the whites were trying to escape the epidemic. They died in huge numbers and were buried in mass graves.Argenpress: El genocidio negro en la Argentina, por Lucas Fern√°ndez By the middle of the month there were more than 150 deaths per day, rising to 200 by 20 March. Among the dead were Luis J. de la Pe√±a, teacher and former minister of Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, the former Deputy Juan Agust√≠n Garc√≠a, the doctor Ventura Bosch, and the painter Franklin Rawson. Others who died were the doctors Francisco Javier Mu√±iz, Carlos Keen, Adolfo Argerich and, on 24 March, the aforementioned president of the People's Commission Jos√© Roque P√©rez, who had written his will upon taking office because of the certainty of catching the plague and dying. The president Sarmiento and his deputy, Adolfo Alsina, abandoned the city. As the national and provincial authorities fled the city, the secular and regular clergy remained in their posts and conformed to their evangelical mandate, to help the sick and dying in their homes, and the Sisters of Charity stopped their teaching in order to work in the hospitals instead, although this was hushed up by the anticlerical writers of the time. However the fact is highlighted by Mardoqueo Navarro in his diary, that it was as the Sephardic Mosaic cult had taught. Of the 292 city priests, 22% died, compared to the 12 doctors, 2 practitioners, 4 members of the People's Commission and 22 members of the Council for Public Hygiene, as given by Jorge Ignacio Garc√≠a Cuerva in his writing.La Iglesia en Buenos Aires durante la epidemia de fiebre amarilla de 1871 seg√∫n el Diario de la epidemia de Mardoqueo Navarro, de Jorge Ignacio Garc√≠a Cuerva. The monument erected in 1873 to the victims of the yellow fever epidemic of 1871, in the centre of Parque Ameghino, in the neighbourhood of Parque Patricios, Buenos Aires (By Manuel Ferrari) There is only one plaque on the Parque Florentina Ameghino Monument which records the victims buried there, listing 21 with the title priest and 2 titled Sister of Charity. The Order of Sisters of Charity added reinforcements from France to help with the emergency, and also others from their congregations. The fever took 7 of these nuns. Their parishioners were the doctors, the sufferers and the workers of the People's Parish Commission. Municipal regulations obliged the priests to issue grave licences and medical certificates in addition to their evangelical work. As Ruiz Moreno points out in The historical plague of 1871, the priests weren't let off. The city only had 40 funeral carriages so coffins were piled up in corners waiting for the carriages to pick them up as they travelled along their fixed routes. Due to the huge demand, they added the Plaza carriages, who charged excessively. There was the same problem with daily prices of medicines, which in reality weren't much help for relieving the symptoms. Each day there were more deaths, including the carpenters, so they stopped making coffins from wood and started wrapping the corpses in drapes instead. For the rest, the garbage carts were called into funeral service and they began using mass graves. Looting and assaults on citizens increased. There were even cases where thieves disguised themselves as invalids, to gain entrance to hospitals. They formed Commission No. 14, under Comisario Lisandro Su√°rez, to combat the incessant criminal activity. They patrolled the streets day and night, padlocking the street doors of the San Telmo houses abandoned in a rush by their owners, and the keys were delivered to the Chief of Police. In the South Cemetery, situated at the entrance to what is now Parque Ameghino in the Avenida Caseros, the capacity of 2,300 was overwhelmed. So the municipal government acquired seven hectares in the Chacarita de los Colegiales where the Parque Los Andes is today, which has been La Chacarita Cemetery since 1886. On 4 April 400 invalids died, and the administrator of that cemetery informed the members of the People's Commission that they had 630 corpses without graves, with others being found by the wayside, and 12 of their gravediggers had died. Then the knights Hector Varela, Carlos Guido Spano, and Manuel Bilbao among others took the decision to officiate at burials and rescued anyone from the mass graves who still showed signs of life, including a richly-dressed French lady. On 9‚Äì11 April over 500 deaths were registered daily, reaching the peak of the epidemic on 10 April with 583 deaths, compared to the normal rate before the epidemic of around 20 deaths per day. The Buenos Aires Western Railway extended a line from the Avenida Corrientes down to the cemetery and started running a train for the dead, with two journeys a day solely for transporting the dead. The track started at the station Bermejo, located in the southwest corner of the street of the same name (Jean Jaur√©s today) where it joined the avenue. There were two other corpse pick-up points in addition to the one at Bermejo. These were at the southwest corner of Corrintes with Medrano, and the southeast corner of Corrientes with Scalabrini Ortiz (now called Camino Minisro Ingl√©s). The authorities who had not abandoned the city provided railway wagons as emergency living quarters in what is now Greater Buenos Aires and offered people free tickets to get out there. The People's Commission recommended that people should leave as soon as possible. On the aforementioned date of peak death, 10 April, the National and Provincial government decreed a holiday until the end of the month, which in reality was no more than official recognition of what was actually happening. Then the count began to descend, perhaps helped by the first frosts of winter, falling to 89, but at the end of the month there was a new peak of 161, probably caused by the return of some people from the earlier evacuation. This in turn led to a new flight. The month ended with a total of 8,000 deaths. The deaths reduced during May, and by the middle of that month the city had returned to normal activity, and by the 20th the Commission ended their activity. On 2 June, there wasn't a single case registered. The scourge of black vomit never returned to the city. = The consequences = In total, 60 priests, 12 doctors (including some with a distinguished career such as Manuel Argerich and Francisco Javier Mu√±iz), 22 members of the Commission of Hygiene and 4 of the People's Commission gave their lives for their citizens. It's difficult to establish the precise number of deaths caused by the fever, but it's fairly certain to be between 13,500 and 26,200. The count considered as official is the one given by the Revista M√©dico Quir√∫rgica by the Bonaerense Medical Association who said there had been 13,641 deaths. They in turn had taken the figure from Mardoqueo Navarro, a witness to the tragedy who wrote it in his personal diary. His account was used by the historian Miguel √Ångel Scenna. Mardoqueo also counted the nationalities of the dead: 3,397 Argentinians, 6,201 Italians, 1,608 Spanish, 1,384 French, 220 English, 233 Germans, 571 unidentified. According to Dr Penna, who collated the registers of the cemeteries (including those from Parque Ameghino, where there were graves of 11,000 people), the correct figure is 14,467. The English newspaper The Standard published a count of 26,000 dead, which is considered an exaggeration and provoked indignation.cifras extra√≠das de Buenos Aires: Sencilla Historia, La Trinidad, p√°g 184, de J.A.Luqui Lagleyze, (ver detalle en bibliograf√≠a) Many historians consider that this epidemic was one of the main causes of the reduction of the negro race population in Buenos Aires, as it raged through the coloured people, because they mostly lived in the miserable conditions in the south of the city. Many lawsuits began, related to wills suspected of being forged by criminals looking to make their fortune at the expense of the true heirs. Other cases involved the abandoned houses that thieves had broken into. The flight of the population caused the failure of most public and private establishments. On 21 June the first Order of Argentinian Knights was founded, called the Iron Cross of the Knights of the Order of Martyrs, and was awarded to those who had helped the victims of the plague. Awareness grew of the urgency of establishing a solution to the problem of obtaining and distributing water clean enough to drink. In 1869, the English engineer John F. La Trobe Bateman had presented a project of running water, sewers and drains, which enhanced a previous proposal of the engineer John Coghlan. These were put into practice and in 1874 Batement started construction of the network, which by 1880 provided water to a quarter of the city. In 1873 he started construction of the sewage works. In 1875, the collection of waste was centralised with the creation of rubbish dumps. Until then, most people had just thrown all their waste into ditches and streams. Juan Manuel Blanes, the Uruguayan painter who lived in Buenos Aires, painted an oil on canvas (currently in Montevideo) called The Episode of the Yellow Fever, reproduced in this article, inspired by one done during the tragedy, probably on 17 March 1871 in Balcarce Street. In it we see a woman (Ana Bristani), dead of the fever, lying across the floor of a tenement. Her son, a baby of a few months, searches for his mother's breast. His father's corpse lies on a bed on the right. The door is open and through it you can see the doctors Roque P√©rez (centre) and Manuel Argerich (on the right) entering the room. They were members of the People's Commission who themselves died of the fever. The famous picture became an emotional tribute to those who gave their own lives trying to save those of their citizens. Guillermo Enrique Hudson, the naturalist and writer born in Argentina, wrote a story in 1888 called \\"Ralph Herne\\", which goes through the epidemic of 1871. In it he relates the following description: In 1884, fearing the appearance of a new outbreak, the doctors Jos√© Mar√≠a Ramos Mej√≠a, director of public assistance, and Jos√© Penna, director of the Casa de Aislamiento (now the Hospital Mu√±iz), decided to cremate the body of a Pedro Doime, who had been affected by the yellow fever. That was the first cremation to take place in Buenos Aires. Only one monument, erected in 1899, exists today in the city to commemorate the victims of the worst tragedy, in terms of number of victims, to hit Buenos Aires. It is situated in what was the South Cemetery, which as we have said is now Ameghino Park, in the place where the cemetery administration took place. One of the inscriptions there reads: Notable people Notable people who died during the epidemic were: * Sinforoso Amoedo, MD * Manuel Argerich, MD * Lucio Norberto Mansilla, general and governor * Francisco Javier Mu√±iz, MD * Franklin Rawson, painter * Ernesto Tornquist, entrepreneur References Bibliography * Navarro, Mardoqueo. \\"Diario de la Epidemia\\".

They released a single for China, \\"Don't Say You're Sorry\\", and then went to Fort Apache Studios in Boston, Massachusetts to record their debut album, The Signs Are All There. Jared Daley later said, \\"When China said we were going to Boston, we thought they meant Boston, Lincolnshire.\\" The album was produced by Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, and was released in October 1995 on China Records/Atlantic Records. The Signs Are All There failed to chart and did not meet sales expectations. In 1996 the band had a minor hit with the non-album single \\"Breathe (a Little Deeper)\\", and re-issued their LP, but sales were disappointing and the band ultimately disbanded. \\"Town Clowns\\" was a Top 10 indie hit in the UK and was the band's first U.S. single.

Following the Local Government Act 1888, the county of Suffolk outside of Ipswich was split into East Suffolk and West Suffolk for administrative purposes and the term administrative county was introduced.

He was one of more than 800 children who died between 1995 and 1998 after their cases were brought to the attention of the Georgia Department of Human Services' (DHS) Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS). Some of the deaths were due to accident and illness, while others, like Terrell's, were due to murder. When Terrell died he weighed only 29 pounds and was covered with cuts, bruises and cigarette burns.Did 5-year-old Terrell have to die? (1-17-99) By Jane O. Hansen Atlanta Journal-Constitution Various individuals within the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services engaged in gross misconduct and violation of state-mandated protocols for handling child abuse cases. After the murder, officials within the department engaged in a willful cover-up of the facts in the case. Terrell's case was considered to have been one of the worst cases of child abuse in history.60 Minutes:State Of Neglect Lawyer Don Keenan, who sued the state of Georgia on Terrell's behalf, was quoted as saying: The victim's grandmother, Pharina Peterson and Terri Lynn Peterson (his aunt) were both convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Abuse The Fulton County Department of Family and Children Services received seven calls between 1992 and 1995 in reference to neglect of Terrell or his siblings: *The mother is taking drugs while pregnant, using food stamps and welfare checks to buy crack cocaine (May 1992). *The parents are locking the children in the bedroom on weekends, denying them food and water (August 1993). *Mother is on drugs, children are unsupervised (February 1994). *Children are begging neighbors for food, mother is using cocaine daily (January 1995). *Mother is addicted to crack, leaves children with their sick maternal grandmother (November 1995). The complaints were handled by 11 different caseworkers, overseen by 10 supervisors at The Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, yet nothing was done until June 1996 when the department took custody of Terrell from his mother. According to protocol children taken into custody by child services should ideally be placed with blood relatives, receive at least one in-person visit with an agency caseworker per month and under no circumstances is corporal punishment to be administered by foster carers. Terrell was placed in the care of Pharina Peterson, the grandmother of Terrell's half brother Tommy and half sister Tasha who were not directly related to him. While in her custody agency caseworkers had little to no contact with Terrell and there were no monthly visits. The case came to light when Terrell was brought to the emergency room of Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital in Atlanta in cardiac arrest, where he subsequently died. During the course of the homicide investigation police discovered that Terrell had been physically restrained with pantyhose tied to a banister in the apartment. According to another child living in the home, Tasha Peterson tied Terrell up \\"a lot.\\" The police also found a set of written instructions for Terrell's care, allegedly authored by Peterson: \\"He gets a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, lunch he gets grits, and dinner he gets grits. His hands are always tied.\\" Terrell's Head Start teacher, Joanne Bryant, found him rummaging in a trash can at school looking for food. This occurred prior to a Thanksgiving Day beating in 1996, which necessitated a trip to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with Battered child syndrome. Pharina Peterson was arrested and indicted on misdemeanor charges. Terrell, who had previously implicated Peterson on record as the one who assaulted him, was scheduled to testify in person at the trial. However, his caseworker, Cheryl Elmore, who was responsible for bringing Terrell to court, never showed up. Terrell's and her absence were never questioned and the charges were dismissed by municipal court judge Catherine E. Malicki because \\"the victim was not in court\\".The Condemnation of Little B. By Elaine Brown p. 91 To cover her already egregious transgression, Elmore concocted a fraudulent backdated internal memo which was placed in Terrell's file; that the trial did indeed occur, no evidence of child abuse was found and the charges were dismissed as a result. The memo stated, \\"The judge believed Ms. Peterson (and) did not feel she was guilty of child abuse.\\" This alleged finding despite the medical evidence and the results of the police investigation, along with the lack of substantiating court documents, was never questioned by her supervisors. As a result, Terrell was deemed to be \\"safe,\\" and his file was closed and he was returned to the custody of Peterson. Peggy Peters, director of the department, had this to say, \\"Again, I can't speak for Miss Elmore\\" and \\"I certainly would not have made that decision.\\" When Terrell went back to the same Head Start class he was in prior to the assault, Bryant, his teacher, noticed he was not walking normally. When she took off his sneakers she noticed that the flesh on the soles of both his feet had been burned off. This was again alleged, posthumously, to have been inflicted by Peterson as retribution for telling authorities about her previous assaults. The burns were severe enough to necessitate skin grafts, the skin was taken from his hips and transplanted onto the soles of his feet. Despite the severity of these injuries, no investigation was done, no charges were brought and Terrell was never visited by anyone from child services from the time of these injuries until his murder a year later. The coroner listed Terrell's cause of death as; \\"blunt impact injuries to the head, trunk and extremities.\\" This resulted in Fran Peterson being charged with capital murder.  Cover-up  After two internal investigations into Terrell‚Äôs case, Georgia DCFS reported ‚Äúfailure to make contacts,\\" \\"failure to conduct mandatory monthly meetings,\\" \\"a serious lack of judgment,\\" and \\"numerous violations throughout the history of the case.\\" The public was never made aware of these findings and, upon completion of the investigation, department officials engaged in a cover-up. The department made only one public statement which was written by Ralph Mitchell, the administrator of the Atlanta area office. He claimed members of the agency expressed \\"outrage at the loss of precious life\\" but that they had responded \\"immediately and comprehensively\\" to allegations of Terrell's abuse. The statement further claimed the department had followed protocol, saying \\"all of (its) steps were followed in the case of Terrell.\\" Soon after, Mitchell wrote a private memo to the department head at state headquarters stating the press release was \\"untrue.\\" He also commented it was fortunate no one in the media had called to follow up after the public statement. Due to state privacy laws, Terrell's records were sealed and inaccessible to the media, rendering the cover up undetectable. The tampering began to come to light one year later when Don Keenan received Terrell's case file by an anonymous individual within the department. Despite the murder of Terrell, the complicity in his murder through willful neglect of workers at the Georgia Department of Family and Children's Services, and the exposed cover-up by high department officials, another case worker determined that Terrell's half sister and half brother ‚Äî who were both present at his murder ‚Äî would be safe with Fran Peterson. This unidentified case worker said as follows: \\"Ms. Peterson will cooperate with the agency and continue to show interest in the support of the child while they are at home. ... I think, again you'd have to look at the individual situation. And if she had not harmed those other children, then it might be acceptable.\\" Neither Elmore nor Mitchell were fired for their actions. 60 Minutes II The CBS news program 60 Minutes II, noted for investigative journalism, conducted an in-depth investigation into all aspects of the case and aired the results in January 1999. In the wake of this program, then- Georgia governor Roy Barnes decided to set up a Child Advocate Office with the authority to bypass the state's confidentiality laws and independently investigate and review child abuse cases handled by the Department of Family and Children's Services. Terrell's half brother and sister were placed with another foster family and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation conducted raids on several offices of the Department of Family and Children Services. The Georgia legislature passed the Terrell Peterson Act, which gives doctors the authority to take temporary custody of battered children at the hospital without department approval.SB 315 - Terrell Peterson Act - child protective custody Aftermath *Pharina Peterson received a life sentence for Terrell's murder.Terrell's aunt denies role in death, blames her niece by Steve Visser Saturday, December 14, 2002 Atlanta Journal Constitution *In December 2002 Terri Lynn Peterson, the victims' aunt, was found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.http://accesswdun.com/print/2002/12/186500http://accesswdun.com/article/2003/1/184357 *Ralph Mitchell, the official who engaged in a cover-up of the case and wrote the phony press release, retired with a state pension.The Crisis Of Foster Care - TIME *Catherine E.

History It was incorporated in 1866 as the J. Manz Engraving Company by Jacob Manz, who was the company president, and was built in 1867 in Chicago to act as a wood engraving business. The company moved to premises at 4001-43 Ravenswood av. in Chicago in 1908, just after it merged with The Hollister Press. It had purchased the property from Mrs. Harriet L. Sulzer and others for USD16,000. By 1922 it was known as the Manz Engraving Co. and employed 500‚Äì600 people. The company president was now Alfred Bersbach, who had joined the company in 1880. On January 1, 1925, the company changed its name to the Manz Corporation. In 1947 the corporation purchased and moved to a one-story factory from which to run the business. In the same year, the corporation and its president at the time, Virgil Lynch, were charged with \\"performing paper cutting operations\\" at late hours of night that disturbed the peace of the entire neighborhood. This, however, would not seem to change over the years, as, in 1962, the corporation was ranked as being \\"noisier than 97 per cent of all industry in Chicago\\" by the city zoning board. The corporation was purchased in April 1961 by Process Lithographers. Due to this, the name of the corporation was changed to Process Manz Press Inc. On November 21, 1962, the buildings and equipment of Process Manz Press Inc. were seized by New York financial institution A.J. Armstrong Inc., and on November 23, 1962, Process Manz Press Inc. was declared involuntarily bankrupt.

He was appointed the supreme leader of the Caucasus Emirate on 1 August 2010, though this was later retracted. Early life Aslambek Vadalov was born in 1972 and is a native of Ishkoy-Yurt, a village in the eastern portion of Chechnya's Gudermes. Vadalov also seems to have spent much of his youth in the Gudermes region, though some reports have suggested that he studied for a short period of time in Moscow in the late 1980s, perhaps at a technical institute. Chechen War and rebel army Following the outbreak of the First Chechen War in 1994, Vadalov joined the separatist fighters from Gudermes; he may have served in the unit of Sheik Fathi, a Chechen who had lived in Jordan and engaged in Islamist conflicts in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It has been postulated that if Vadalov did indeed serve alongside Fathi, it would indicate a very early exposure to the Islamist interpretation of the war in Chechnya. Though Vadalov played no role in the 1999 Dagestan incursion led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, following Russia's re-invasion of Chechnya that autumn he joined Khattab's Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya. After engaging in the battles for Argun and Gudermes, Vadalov's unit withdrew to the mountainous districts of Vedeno and Nozhay-Yurt in order to launch guerrilla attacks on Russian security forces. In 2000, Vadalov returned to Ishkoy-Yurt for unknown reasons and joined a small, local guerrilla force; the unit operated both independently and in cooperation with other rebel formations, including taking part in the 17 September 2001 attack on Gudermes. The next few years saw the separatist movement incur significant losses, but Vadalov was able to distinguish himself mainly due to his survival skills. As such, he was named Deputy Commander of the Gudermes Region of the Chechen Armed Forces under Emir Askhab. Although this unit that he commanded lacked manpower, his team and him were able to launch numerous small but significant attacks against the Russian security forces, especially around Ishkoy-Yurt. Following Emir Askhab's death in early 2005, Vadalov was named Commander of the Gudermes region. However, while a capable small-unit commander, Vadalov struggled when in control of a larger fighting force that required a broader strategic perspective. His unit was eventually driven out of Gudermes proper and forced back into the highlands of Vedeno and Nozhay-Yurt. Despite these setbacks, he still maintained a reputation for \\"commitment to the cause and hard-fought guerrilla operations.\\" He has been fighting with the Caucasus Emirate rebels against Russian forces since 1994 and was apparently one of the first to swear allegiance to Doku Umarov in 2007. Caucasus Emirate was formed 2007.Caucasus Emirate He was fighting for independent Chechnya until 2007. His relationship with Amir Khattab is of significance. Previously he was the commander of the Eastern Front of the Armed Forces of the Caucasus Emirate, although in practice he was commanding a force of perhaps about 30-50 militants on the Ingushetian border.globaljihad.net/view_news.asp?id=1589 Ideology Akhmed Zakayev said Vadalov had been announced as the new Emir of the Caucasus Emirate because of a \\"loss of confidence among his (Umarov's) subordinates. [The] Methods of Dokku Umarov, including attacks against civilians, were not supported by militants.\\" He also said that Vadalov \\"is a supporter of other views and is not affected by ideologists of Wahhabism.\\" The Russian paper Kommersant had reported that Zakayev, sentenced to death by the Sharia Court of the Caucasus Emirate, had plans to establish contacts with Vadalov.  Appointment as \\"Emir of the Caucasus Emirate\\"  On 1 August 2010 the \\"state web site\\" of the Caucasus Emirate, Kavkaz Center reported that Doku Umarov had stepped down from his position as Emir of the Caucasus Emirate and appointed Vadalov to become his successor. On the video containing the announcement Umarov states that \\"jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders.\\" However, when the Kavkaz Center site was restored on-line after a \\"service break\\" on 3 August 2010, the original announcement had been replaced by one which stated, that Umarov only \\"proposed to appoint\\" Vadalov his successor. A few days later Umarov said he had no intention of stepping down and called the video announcing his resignation a fabrication. On August 13, 2010 Kavkaz Center announced that Aslambek Vadalov had resigned from his post of Deputy Military Emir of the Caucasus Emirate. = Rift with Umarov = Days after Umarov rescinded his resignation, Vadalov was said to have renounced adherence of an oath given to Umarov; however it was said that while he ceases subordination to Umarov, he would remain loyal to the larger Caucasus Emirate. In July 2011, a sharia court ruled in favour of Umarov to close the rift caused by Umarov's reorganisation of the armed forces of Chechnya, the disbanding the so-called \\"eastern and south-western fronts\\" and dividing Chechnya into \\"military sectors.\\" The court asked the rebels to re-swear allegiance to Umarov. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs or the organisation's suicide battalion who has been named the commander of the western sector. Hussein Gakayev, who had been named to lead the eastern sector, Aslambek Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Later events In November 2016, Vadalov was reportedly arrested in Turkey.

According to this oral tradition -\\"Nnamike Onuoma\\", the founder of the Ekwe community had two sons -Ekwe and Okwudor. Okwudor later separated from his brother and settled at the other side of the Njaba River and founded the Okwudor community. Ekwe stayed put in the area, which is now known as Ekwe.[1] Ekwe and Okwudor conjointly worshipped the common ancestral god of their fore- fathers (Eziekwo) and commonly performed Ozo title ceremonies together until recently. An accident on the bridge crossing the Njaba River led to the death of Nze and Ozo title holders. This led to the separation in performance of the Ozo title, between Ekwe and Okwudor. Today, people still pay homage and perform sacrificial rituals at Eziakwo shrine, their common ancestral deity. Ekwe had two sons named Ekwe-Nwe-Orie and Ekwe-Nwe-Nkwo, along with fourteen grandsons. No definite information is known about the number of wives, daughters and granddaughters he had, however it is assumed that Ekwe had two wives. Ekwe-Nwe-Orie is the Diokwara (first son) of Ekwe from his first wife and Ekwe-Nwe-Nkwo is the second son of Ekwe and the first son of the second wife of Ekwe. Ekwe-Nwe-Orie had SIX sons that later gave rise to SIX villages. The villages are Umudibi, Ibeama, Umuduru, Eluama, Obara, and Ebenano. Ekwe- Nwe-Nkwo had SIX sons that also gave rise to seven villages. The villages are (in order of seniority) Umuduruewuru, Eziekwe, Eluama, Umuduruehie, Odicheku, Umukorokoro and Umuokwara Eluama, Umuduruewuru, Umukorokoro later crossed the Iyi Abalaka stream to discover a land mass later called Okwuotiri. The three villages founded the Eke market. Today they are collectively known as Ebenator-Ekwe. Eziekwe, Umuduruehie, Odicheku and Umuokwara are now known as Uburu Ekwe. Location and Geography Ekwe is located in the southern part of Isu local government area of Imo state. The town lies on an undulated plain, with a natural boundary caused by the flow of the Njaba River. The Njaba River separates the town from Amucha, Okwudor and some parts of Umuaka. There exists a stream - (Iyi -Eziakwo)(Isi iyi )(iyi Oba) which started as a spring from the thick Eziakwo forest rocks. It separates Ekwe-Nwe-Kwo (Uburu Ekwe) from Okwudor and finally gives rise to Iyi Agu, Iyi Abala and Njaba River. Ekwe is bounded on the north by Nkume and Amucha, on the south by Amurie, on the west by Okwudor and Umuaka and on the east by Isu Njaba and Amandugba.[2] Ekwe covers an area of 6.4 square kilometres. Government and Politics Ekwe used to be one politically monolithic autonomous community with the headquarters at Umudibi. Ekwe was split into three autonomous communities by Achike Udenwa administration during the creation of autonomous community by the administration. Ekwe has three politically autonomous communities ‚Äì Ekwe-Nwe- Orie, Uburu -Ekwe and Ebenator. Ekwe-Nwe-Orie autonomous community is made of Umudibi, Ibeoma, Umuduru, Eluama, Obara, Umudiwoha and Ebanano and the headquarters is at Umudibi. Eze Charles Chukwuemeka Anyakudo who was enthroned in May 2014 is the current traditional ruler of Ekwe-Nwe-Orie. Uburu Ekwe is made up of Eziekwe, Umuduruehie, Odicheku and Umuokwara and its headquarters is at Eziekwe. Ibekwe is the traditional ruler of Uburu Ekwe. Ebenator Ekwe is made up of Eluama, Umuduruewuru and Umukorokoro. Eze Remigius Nwokeforo- Ejirijiegbu III of Ebenator Ekwe is the traditional ruler of Ebenator. He was secretary of Nigeria Disabled Federation. Demography The population of Ekwe community is a predominantly rural settlement. It has a high population density and the estimated census population is put at about 56,000. This high population density has led to intensified pressure on land, forests and other natural resources, leading to increasing rural poverty which is characteristic of densely populated rural areas. Fallow period rarely exceeds one year and in some areas continuous cropping is the rule. Low crop yield and loss of land to erosion have combined to induce people to migrate in search of jobs and even farmland in other parts of the state or country in search of greener pastures. Occupation The people of Ekwe are mostly subsistence farmers and traders but on the increase, as development takes place - there is a higher number of civil servants, teachers, and professionals such as lawyers, engineers etc. Agricultural activities in the town include crop farming, economic tree planting and animal rearing. The principal crops include yams, cocoyam, cassava, three-leaved yams, maize, melon-fluted pumpkin and a variety of vegetables. The economic plants include ‚Äì oil palm trees, coconut palms, pears, banana, breadfruit, plantains, pineapples, ukpo, etc. Animal rearing is mostly free-range system and farm animals such as poultry, goat, sheep and ram are usually kept. The agricultural produce and by-products such as palm oil, palm kernels, coconuts fruits and various animals, e.g., goats, sheep, fowls, eggs, etc. are taken to the Orie Ekwe Market on Orie Market Day or neighboring communities markets e.g. Afor Umuaka and Nkwo Ihitte to be sold. Religion There is freedom of worship in the community and religion occupies a central place in the lives of the people. Before the advent of Christianity, the people practiced traditional religions. With the advent of Christianity, the people are now predominantly Christians of different denominations but mostly Catholics and Anglican. Catholics and Anglican churches are still being considered as the official church in most villages in the town. Recently other Christian denominations have been gaining ground in the town. Some people in the town still practice African Traditional religions. Tourism and Hospitality Ekwe tourist attractions include a number of natural springs located in Ekwe community. Uburu Ekwe and Ebenator springs are some of the notable spring sites. These springs are noted for their natural flowing Spring (water) . About 30 years ago, the people of Ekwe community constructed a big slab at the Ishiyi with pipes to draw their drinking water. The evidence collected from here throws more lights on the past and ancient culture.

Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 4. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. p. 540. Name Laporje was first attested in written sources in 1251 as Lapriach (and as Lapriak in 1273 and Labriach in 1480). The name is derived from the Slovene common noun lapor 'marl', referring to the characteristics of the local soil. The place name is now a singular neuter form but, based on the locative plurals reflected in the medieval transcriptions, it was probably originally the plural demonym (literally, 'people living on marly soil'). History The area was already settled in antiquity, as testified by the discovery of four carved stones during renovation of the church in 1907. (Two of the stones have been lost, and one is now built into the south wall of the church.) Schooling was established in Laporje in 1828, with classes held in the rectory. School buildings were built in the village in 1848, 1881, and 1926. Church The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saints Phillip and James and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It was built in 1907 on the site of a 14th- century church.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 3090 The first structure at the site dated to 1374, and the parish was established in 1395.

A revision of the genus Plasmodium by Levine in 1985 considered this subgenus to be a synonym of Plasmodium. The description of a new species Plasmodium siamense by Telford in 1986 lead to a resurrection of this as a subgenus. Further revision of its taxonomic status has led to its elevation to genus status. Species in this genus infect birds and lizards.  Diagnostic features  Species in this genus have the following characteristics: The schizonts and gametocytes are found in the circulating leukocytes and thromobcytes. Pigment is absent.  Subgenera  There are two recognised subgena - Fallisia Telford 1998 and Plasmodiodes Gabaldon, Ulloa & Zerpa 1985. Species in Fallisia infect lizards and those in Plasmodiodes infect birds.

In the 1950s, he invented the Netlon process, in which plastics are extruded into a net-like process in one stage, winning the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement. With his inspiration, leadership and drive, he founded Netlon Ltd in 1959 to manufacture the products but most importantly to commercialise the concept. Throughout Brian Mercer's career, he strongly believed in the importance of cooperative research and development through instigating discussion and debate through international commercial and technical conferences. In 1978 he became a Fellow of the Institute of Materials and the second person to receive their Prince Philip Award. He was elected a Fellow of the Textile Institute in 1973 and in 1988 it bestowed on him an Honorary Fellowship. In 1981 he received the OBE and in 1984 was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He made a bequest to the Royal Society to establish the Brian Mercer Award for Feasibility, which is given to allow researchers to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of commercialising an aspect of their scientific research. Modern Tensar geogrids were invented by Dr. Mercer in the late 1970s and early 1980s for the construction industry to provide stabilisation and reinforcement with the underlying concept of simplicity, flexibility and strength.

Huang founded Sportscorp China in 2004. In 2009, Huang began investing in Chinese sports leagues and teams. Early life and education Born in Guangzhou, China into a family with close business and government ties, he graduated in 1984 from Sun Yat-sen University. Huang then pursued under graduate studies at Columbia University, and then obtained his Masters from St. John's University, before undertaking his MBA in financial management at New York University. Career =Wall Street= In 1988, Huang became the first mainland educated Chinese person to work on Wall Street, as a public relations executive. =Sportscorp China= Huang and Chicago-based sports consultant Marc Ganis, founded Sportscorp China in 2004, a company that helps bridge sports and sponsorship deals between the United States and China. This enabled Chinese sponsorship and rights distribution deals with both the Houston Rockets and the New York Yankees. Huang introduced the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009 to Tsingtao Brewery, which resulted in an agreement between the two. In 2009, Huang and his partner Adrian Cheng, whose family controls the Hong Kong conglomerate New World Development, invested in Chinese sports leagues and teams. It was reported in early 2010 that Huang had acquired a 15% shareholding in the Cleveland Cavaliers, considered at the time the first significant investment in a large US sports franchise by Chinese investors. However, in April 2010 it was made clear by the Cavaliers that Huang's role with the Cavaliers was to have acted as a middleman to secure the team's sponsorship with Tsingtao. Adrien Cheng left his partnership with Huang soon after for unspecified reasons. After buying into and hence becoming co-chair of both the National Basketball League of China and the Chinese Baseball League, Huang also bought the Jilin Northeast Tigers. =Liverpool deal and article= During an interview in April 2010 with the UK's The Mirror newspaper, Huang claimed to be at a \\"crucial stage\\" in negotiations to acquire the Liverpool F.C. team for ‚Ç§500 million. Four months later, Huang instead offered to pay off Liverpool's USD 374 million in debts it owed to the Royal Bank of Scotland in return for control of the team. At the time, Huang claimed that the massive Chinese sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, could become a silent investor in the deal. China Investment Corp, however, soon after denied this, saying it had \\"never heard of a plan to buy Liverpool or of Kenneth Huang\\". Huang eventually dropped out of the deal a few weeks later. An August 2010 investigation by Sporting Intelligence claimed that, among other issues, Huang's claim to sit on the board of directors at the Bank of Communication's asset management division was false. The report also claimed that it had failed to verify any of Huang's educational qualifications - including his assertion that he completed an MBA at New York University and a Masters in Japanese at St. John's University - and added that he had only completed four months of his degree at Columbia University. The investigation was also unable to verify Huang's claims to have been voted the \\"No 1 philanthropist\\" in 2009 by the popular Chinese website Sina.com and BQ Magazine. =Recent developments= On 1 August 2012, Inter Milan announced that, club owner Massimo Moratti agreed to sell a minority interests of the club to a Chinese consortium led by Kenneth Huang. On the same day Inter announced an agreement was formed with China Railway Construction Corporation Limited for a new stadium project. However, the deal collapsed. The club was takeover by International Sports Capital, a company co-owned by Erick Thohir in 2013, with Moratti, Pirelli and many small investors as the minority shareholders.

At the time of its closing in 1995, there were four locations in El Paso at Downtown, Bassett Center, Northpark Mall and Sunland Park Mall. For much of its existence, The Popular was El Paso's largest locally owned department store.  History  The Popular Dry Goods Company was founded in 1902 by Adolf Schwartz, a Hungarian immigrant who had previously opened two other retail stores in the area, Tres B (Buena, Bonita, Barata/Good, Pretty, Cheap) and The Fair which he had founded in 1900. Schwartz closed The Fair in 1902 and it was succeeded by The Popular, which he opened with his nephew Maurice Schwartz and other relatives. In 1907, the Popular moved from the northeast corner of El Paso and Overland Streets to Mesa and San Antonio and consisted of three floors by 1914. In 1917 Schwartz transformed The Popular from a general store to a modern department store with a six-story building on Mesa and San Antonio Streets. Schwartz‚Äôs granddaughter Ann Goodman Schaechner, tells a story about Pancho Villa and Francisco Madero, opposing military leaders in the Mexican Revolution, visiting The Popular at the same time, \\"One was on the basement and the first floor and the other was on the second or third floor. A clerk recognized the foes and ran back and forth between floors attending the two men so that they would not bump into each other. Thanks to the observant employee, the two men never saw each other, and the store kept both good customers.\\" Adolph Schwartz died from a heart attack at the age of 74 on March 3, 1941. After the retirement of Schwartz' nephew Maurice, Maurice's sons Herbert M. Schwartz and Albert J. Schwartz, continued to run the company.\\"The Popular Grew With City Of El Paso\\", El Paso Times, El Paso, Texas, October 26, 1967. The Popular's expansion began in 1962 with the opening of a second location at Bassett Center. This was followed by a third location at Northgate (later Northpark Mall) in 1966, and then a location at Sunland Park Mall in 1988. In 1995, the devalued peso and Mexico‚Äôs recession along with the newly enacted North American Free Trade Agreement posed an economic strain to the region. All Popular stores were closed on November 6, 1995. Dillard's purchased The Popular's credit accounts and Bassett Center store. Sears purchased the Sunland Park location. The remaining two locations were dissolved.\\"El Paso's The Popular closes after 93 years\\", The Victoria Advocate, Victoria, Texas, Aug 27, 1995.

History  In March 2008, announced the construction of a new submarine cable to connect the Southeast African islands. The project was financed by a consortium made up of Orange Madagascar, Mauritius Telecom and France Telecom S.A.. Overall, the LION project cost an estimated 37 million dollars. The Mauritius Telecom group has reportedly invested 10.8 million in the project. The LION I network was inaugurated in March 2010. This cable digitized the region, and paved the way for the development of an outsourcing economy (call centers). LION II, linking Madagascar, Mayotte and Kenya, was launched in April 2012. In July 2017, Orange announced the construction of FLY-LION III, a 400km extension of LION I and II. The capacity of this new cable should be 4 terabits/s. In July 2018, the website Cable.com ranked Madagascar 22nd in the list of countries with the fastest connections. On 5-6 October 2018, the LION II cable broke, leading to a severe decrease of digital access in Mayotte the following days. While Emtel had to play the diplomacy with its users, Mauritius Telecom, thanks to its global participation in the LION consortium, was able to re-route on other LION cables for balance-loading.  Description  The LION is 1,000 kilometres long and delivers up to 1.28 terabits per second. To reach Europe and other destinations, the LION cable is linked to the SAFE cable and will be connected to the EASSy and the East African Marine System (TEAMs) cable when they are operational. It has cable landing points at:LION Greg's Cable Map * Toamasina, Toamasina Province, Atsinanana Region, Madagascar * Sainte Marie, Saint-Denis Arrondissement, R√©union * Terre Rouge, Pamplemousses District, Mauritius The LION II submarine cable network (2700 km), which required a 57 million euro investment, connects the LION I network to Mayotte and Mombasa, Kenya. The LION II network enables a shorter cable distance to the Middle East and Europe, thus lowering latency between servers.

A Sony Bravia Smart TV showing the home screen A Smart TV, also known as a connected TV (CTV), is a traditional television set with integrated Internet and interactive Web 2.0 features, which allows users to stream music and videos, browse the internet, and view photos. Smart TV is a technological convergence of computers, television sets, and set-top boxes. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content (OTT) as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. Smart TV should not be confused with Internet TV, IPTV, or Web television. Internet TV refers to receiving television content over the Internet instead of traditional systems such as terrestrial, cable, and satellite, regardless of how the Internet is delivered. IPTV is one of the Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV. In Smart TVs, the operating system is preloaded or is available through the set-top box. The software applications, or \\"apps\\", can be preloaded into the device or updated or installed on demand via an app store or marketplace, in a similar manner to how apps are integrated into modern smartphones. The technology that enables Smart TVs is also incorporated in external devices such as set-top boxes and some Blu-ray players, game consoles, digital media players, hotel television systems, smartphones, and other network-connected interactive devices that utilize television-type display outputs.Intel and Smart TV. intel.com. Retrieved on November 11, 2010. These devices allow viewers to find and play videos, movies, TV shows, photos, and other content from the Web, cable or satellite TV channels, or a local storage device. Definition Smart TVs on display A Smart TV device is either a television set with integrated Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set. Smart TVs may be thought of as an information appliance or the computer system from a mobile device integrated within a television set unit. As such, a Smart TV often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or plugins/addons based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete operating system or mobile operating system software providing a platform for application developers. Smart TV platforms or middleware have a public software development kit (SDK) and/or native development kit (NDK) for apps so that third-party developers can develop applications for it, and an app store so that the end-users can install and uninstall apps themselves. The public SDK enables third-party companies and other interactive application developers to \\"write\\" applications once and see them run successfully on any device that supports the Smart TV platform or middleware architecture it was written for, regardless of the hardware manufacturer. Smart TVs deliver content (such as photos, movies and music) from other computers or network attached storage devices on a network using either a Digital Living Network Alliance / Universal Plug and Play media server or similar service program like Windows Media Player or Network- attached storage (NAS), or via iTunes. It also provides access to Internet- based services including traditional broadcast TV channels, catch-up services, video-on-demand (VOD), electronic program guide, interactive advertising, personalisation, voting, games, social networking, and other multimedia applications. Smart TV enables access to movies, shows, video games, apps and more. Some of those apps include Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, YouTube, and Amazon. History In the early 1980s, \\"intelligent\\" television receivers were introduced in Japan. The addition of an LSI chip with memory and a character generator to a television receiver enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal.Gene Gregory (1985), Japanese Electronics Technology, Enterprise and Innovation, page 351, Japan Times A patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \\"intelligent\\" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. The mass acceptance of digital television in the late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved Smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of Smart TVs only, for their middle- end to high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. At the beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 a year had a Smart TV. Typical features LG Smart TV using the Web browser Smart TV devices also provide access to user-generated content (either stored on an external hard drive or in cloud storage) and to interactive services and Internet applications, such as YouTube, many using HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS) adaptive streaming. Smart TV devices facilitate the curation of traditional content by combining information from the Internet with content from TV providers. Services offer users a means to track and receive reminders about shows or sporting events, as well as the ability to change channels for immediate viewing. Some devices feature additional interactive organic user interface / natural user interface technologies for navigation controls and other human interaction with a Smart TV, with such as second screen companion devices,https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/04/microsoft-introduces-second-screen- feature-xbox-smartglass/ Microsoft Introduces Second-Screen Feature, Xbox SmartGlasshttp://mashable.com/2012/06/04/xbox-smartglass/ Xbox SmartGlass Brings the Second Screen to Games and Videos spatial gestures input like with Xbox Kinect, and even for speech recognition for natural language user interface.https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/01/10/2013-smart-tvs-dismissed- as-not-that-smart-leaving-opportunity-for-apple 2013 smart TVs dismissed as 'not that smart,' leaving opportunity for Apple Smart TV develops new features to satisfy consumers and companies, such as new payment processes. LG and PaymentWall have collaborated to allow consumers to access purchased apps, movies, games, and more using a remote control, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. This is intended for an easier and more convenient way for checkout. Platforms Smart TV technology and software is still evolving, with both proprietary and open source software frameworks already available. These can run applications (sometimes available via an 'app store' digital distribution platform), play over-the-top media services and interactive on-demand media, personalized communications, and have social networking features.BBC News ‚Äì Google launches smart TV service. bbc.co.uk (May 20, 2010).

Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, LG, and Roku TV are some platforms ranked under the best Smart TV platforms. Sales According to a report from research group NPD In-Stat, in 2012 only about 12 million U.S. households had their Web-capable TVs connected to the Internet, although an estimated 25 million households owned a set with the built-in network capability. In-Stat predicted that by 2016, 100 million homes in North America and western Europe would be using television sets blending traditional programming with internet content.. By the end of 2019, the number of installed Connect TVs reached 1.26 billion worldwide. The number of households using over-the-top television services has rapidly increased over the years. In 2015, 52% of U.S. households subscribed to Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu Plus; 43% of pay-TV subscribers also used Netflix, and 43% of adults used some streaming video on demand service at least monthly. Additionally, 19% of Netflix subscribers shared their subscription with people outside of their households. Ten percent of adults at the time showed interest in HBO Now. Use =Social networking= Some Smart TV platforms come prepackaged or can be optionally extended, with social networking technology capabilities. The addition of social networking synchronization to Smart TV and HTPC platforms may provide an interaction with both on-screen content and other viewers than is currently available to most televisions while simultaneously providing a much more cinematic experience of the content than is currently available with most computers. =Advertising= Some Smart TV platforms also support interactive advertising, addressable advertising with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising, and other advanced advertising features such as ad telescoping using VOD and DVR, enhanced TV for consumer call-to-action, and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness. The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means that Smart TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV. 2019 research, \\"Watching You Watch: The Tracking Ecosystem of Over-the-Top TV Streaming Devices\\", conducted at Princeton and University of Chicago, demonstrated that a majority of streaming devices will covertly collect and transmit personal user data, including captured screen images, to a wide network of advertising and analytics companies, raising privacy concerns. Digital marketing research firm eMarketer reported a 38 percent surge‚Äîto close to $7 billion, a 10 percent television advertising market share‚Äîin advertising on connected TV like Hulu and Roku, to be underway in 2019, with market indicators that the figure would surpass $10 billion in 2021. =Security= There is evidence that a Smart TV is vulnerable to attacks. Some serious security bugs have been discovered, and some successful attempts to run malicious code to get unauthorized access were documented on video. There is evidence that it is possible to gain root access to the device, install malicious software, access and modify configuration information for a remote control, remotely access and modify files on TV and attached USB drives, access camera and microphone.. There have also been concerns that hackers may be able to remotely turn on the microphone or webcam on a smart TV, being able to eavesdrop on private conversations. A common loop antenna may be set for a bidirectional transmission channel, capable of uploading data rather than only receiving. Since 2012, security researchers discovered a similar vulnerability present in more series of Smart Tvs, which allows hackers to get an external root access on the device. Anticipating growing demand for an antivirus for a Smart TV, some security software companies are already working with partners in the digital TV field on the solution. It seems like there is only one antivirus for Smart TVs available: 'Neptune', a cloud-based antimalware system developed by Ocean Blue Software in partnership with Sophos. However, antivirus company Avira has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise to work on software to protect against potential attacks. The privacy policy for Samsung's Smart TVs has been called Orwellian (a reference to George Orwell and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in 1984), and compared to Telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns.Not in front of the telly: Warning over 'listening' TV BBC News, 2015 Hackers have misused Smart TV's abilities such as operating source codes for applications and its unsecured connection to the Internet. Passwords, IP address data, and credit card information can be accessed by hackers and even companies for advertisement. A company caught in the act is Vizio. The confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7 and dated from 2013‚Äì2016, include details on CIA's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise Smart TVs. =Restriction of access= Internet websites can block Smart TV access to content at will or tailor the content that will be received by each platform. Google TV-enabled devices were blocked by NBC, ABC, CBS, and Hulu from accessing their Web content since the launch of Google TV in October 2010. Google TV devices were also blocked from accessing any programs offered by Viacom‚Äôs subsidiaries. =Reliability= In 2017, high-end Samsung Smart TVs stopped working for at least seven days after a software update. Application providers are rarely upgrading Smart TV apps to the latest version; for example, Netflix does not support older TV versions with new Netflix upgrades.

After being admitted to the California State Bar in 1938, Richardson entered private practice in Oroville sharing office space with retired Butte County Judge Hirman Gregory. Military service During World War II, Richardson entered the U.S. Army, serving from 1942 to 1945 in Europe. In 1944, Richardson, a second lieutenant in Army Intelligence, was assigned to the top secret Ultra Project at Bletchley Park (north of London), where he learned that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was scheduled to address the British Parliament on the status of the war effort in the Balkans. Wearing his US Army uniform and using identification papers from the U.S. Embassy, Richardson talked his way through multiple layers of security and was escorted to a seat in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery next to the Archbishop of Canterbury. By the end of the war, he was a First Lieutenant and had been awarded two service stars. Judicial career Upon returning to California, Richardson resumed the private practice of law but moved to Sacramento, where he also taught at the McGeorge School of Law from 1946 to 1952. In 1962, he was president of the Sacramento County Bar Association. In 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed Richardson as Sacramento County Superior Court's presiding judge. In October 1971, Governor Reagan appointed Richardson Presiding Justice of the California Third District Court of Appeal. Richardson vacated that post when Reagan appointed him as an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court in 1974. Reagan had wanted to name Richardson Chief Justice of California that year, but Chief Justice Donald Wright refused to retire because he was \\"frightened\\" of the prospect of Richardson as Chief Justice. In November 1978, Richardson stood for reelection and was retained. While on the Court, Richardson wrote 212 dissenting opinions and 182 majority opinions. Among his 182 majority opinions, Richardson wrote the Court's opinions in Daly v. General Motors Corp. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 725, applying comparative fault principles to actions brought in strict product liability; Amador Valley Joint Union High School District v. State Board of Equalization (1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, upholding Proposition 13, the initiative that changed California's property taxation system; Agins v. City of Tiburon (1979) 24 Cal.3d 266, denying the constitutional remedy of just compensations to Property owners alleging uncompensated regulatory takings of their land (overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in First English etc. Church v. County of Los Angeles (1987) 482 U.S. 304), People v. Scott (1978) 21 Cal.3d 284, outlining the outer limits of searches and seizures of physical evidence from criminal defendants; and Brosnahan v. Eu (1982) 31 Cal.3d 1, upholding Proposition 8, the Victims' Bill of Rights initiative. In 1979 and 1980, he wrote two bellwether opinions reaffirming the constitutionality of California's death penalty law: People v. Frierson and People v. Jackson (1980); Richardson's opinions helped guide the liberal court toward a judicial acceptance of the death penalty. Of Richardson's dissenting opinions, many served as models for majority decisions in later years of both the United States Supreme Court and the California Supreme Court. One example of how Richardson was belatedly vindicated is his dissenting opinion in Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 23 Cal. 3d 880 (1979), in which he articulated a conservative, strict constructionist theory of statutory interpretation with regard to the question of when a court could find an implied cause of action to enforce a statute. Richardson reasoned that the courts should not imply a private right to sue simply because the Legislature had declared certain acts by insurers to constitute unfair claims handling; in his view, the more rational approach was that the Legislature's silence on the issue meant it had no intent to create such a right, and in turn, the courts must defer to that decision. He attacked the majority opinion (signed by Stanley Mosk) for judicial activism in making it much easier to sue insurance companies. In 1987, the Court suddenly shifted from a liberal to a conservative majority when the electorate voted to eject Chief Justice Rose Bird and two Associate Justices. In 1988, newly elevated Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas wrote a majority opinion in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies, 46 Cal. 3d 287 (1988) that overruled Royal Globe, restored the status quo ante (thereby making it much harder again to sue insurance companies), and adopted the rule articulated by Justice Richardson in his Royal Globe dissent. Justice Mosk filed a dissenting opinion attacking the majority for \\"exalt[ing] principal over principle.\\" Finally, in 2010, Associate Justice Ming Chin held for a unanimous court that Justice Richardson's theory, as initially adopted in the context of insurance in Moradi-Shalal, was to retroactively apply to all California statutes, including California Labor Code section 351 (which merely declares that tips are the property of employees but does not create an express right to sue employers for seizing them): Richardson unsuccessfully attempted to convince his fellow justices to move the Supreme Court from its traditional headquarters in San Francisco to Sacramento, the state's capital city. In March 1983, Richardson and his wife attended a dinner given in honor of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to San Francisco. Post-judicial career Richardson retired from the Court on December 2, 1983. Upon leaving the court, he served as a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Pepperdine University School of Law in the Spring 1984 semester. Then, President Reagan appointed Richardson as Solicitor to the U.S. Department of the Interior, which was headed at the time by fellow former California Supreme Court Justice William Clark. Richardson left the post in 1985 and became a Nixon Fellow at the Whittier Law School that year. Richardson died at his Sacramento home of complications from Parkinson's disease on October 5, 1999. Personal life While working as an usher at the local Methodist church, Richardson met Betty Kingdon, whom he would marry on January 23, 1943. Their marriage would produce four sons and last for 56 years until Frank Richardson's death in 1999. References External links * Frank K. Ricardson.

The technique was invented by Professor Elsayed Elsayed Wagih in collaboration with Professor Jacqueline Fletcher of the Department of Plant Pathology, Noble Research Centre, Oklahoma State University, USA in 1993.Wagih, E. E. and Fletcher, J. (1993). Zymoblot, a new microtechnique used to detect enzyme activity in spiroplasmas and bacteria. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 39: 543- 547. Background Physiological phenomena whether at the cellular or molecular level in living organisms are driven either directly or indirectly by enzyme reactions. The assay of enzyme activities in living organisms is therefore one of the most commonly performed activities in modern physiology laboratories. Numerous methods of enzyme assays are available to quantitatively follow enzyme reactions. These methods which have been grouped in six categories, namely, spectrophotometric, fluorescence, nanometric, electrode, polarimetric,Dixon, M. and Webb, E.C. (1979). Enzymes. 3rd ed. Longman Group Ltd. 1116pp. radiobiochemicalWiseman, A. [ed.] (1983). Topics in enzyme and fermentation Biotechnology 7. Ellis Horwood Ltd. 314pp. are with no drawbacks. Recently, a new qualitative or rather semi quantitative micro-technique, first described by Wagih and Fletcher (1993), and termed 'zymoblot' has been introduced to detect enzyme activities in spiroplasmas and bacteria and many other biological systems.Wagih, E.E. and Wagih, M.E. (1996). The Zymoblot Technique: Potential in Plant Physiology. Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Plant Physiology, Shah Alam, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 20‚Äì22 August 1996.Wagih, M. E., Onwueme, I.

New Delhi, India, 17‚Äì24 November 1996. Later, the technique was made quantitative by densitometry and successfully used to monitor peroxidase activity in virus infected plants.Wagih, E. E. and Wagih, M. E. (1997). Quantitative Zymoblot and Proteinblot Techniques and their Use in Monitoring Total Enzyme and Soluble Protein Alterations in Plant Virus Infections Proc. 1st All Africa Crop Science Conference, Pretoria, The Republic of South Africa, 13‚Äì17 January 1997. Procedure As little as 1¬µl, or less, of a sample is enough to detect enzyme activity by the zymoblot technique as the coloured product being insoluble, accumulates at a confined area over the spotting site. The other techniques, based on colorimetry, may require larger aliquots of a sample so that the amount of the coloured soluble products produced is large enough to colour the content of the assay cuvette to a colorimetrically readable level. The technique has advantages not shared by any other technique. Samples to be analysed by zymoblot require no dialysis (a process that may take days) as washing blots in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) before marinating them in the reaction mixture does remove inhibitors. In contrast to the other techniques where samples are assayed individually, samples to be analysed by zymoblot are spotted on the same blot and enzyme activity is assayed with the same reaction mixture at the same time minimising experimental errors and allowing quick qualitative comparisons. Additionally, several enzymes can be assayed in a sequential order on the same blot. That is to say, if a blot proves negative for a certain enzyme, it can be washed in TBS and reused for another enzyme and so on until a positive reaction for an enzyme is obtained. Unlike wet assays (e.g. colorimetry), results obtained by the zymoblot are always in a recorded from. This allows zymoblots to be carried out in one place, where a densitometer may not be available, and taken or sent to another place to be quantitatively assayed by densitometry. Taking a zymoblot in a researcher's wallet to a meeting facilitates discussions and exchange of ideas with other scientists. While immunologically-based enzyme assays which uses enzyme specific antibodies to directly detect enzymes suffers from the major disadvantage of measuring the \\"total enzyme content\\" and not the total enzyme activity, zymoblot, being not a serological technique, uses no antibodies and measures enzyme activity as it detects only the active (functional) portion of the total enzyme content in a sample. Zymoblot is an end-point type of assay where an enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed for a fixed period of time before being stopped by rapid elimination of its specific substrate. However, the technique could be adapted for the continuous enzyme assay when colour intensity is monitored over time by incubating sister blots for progressively increasing periods of time. When different samples are compared on the same blot, the reaction should be stopped sometime during the linear part of the course of the reaction. This could be judged upon visually and the reaction is stopped when differences in colour intensity among spots are evident, taking into consideration that the duration of linearity in some enzyme reactions may be very short indeed. Applications The Zymoblot technique is simpler, cheaper, more reliable and less time-consuming than all known procedures for enzyme assays. It is probably the quickest available technique to detect enzyme activity in any biological or even non-biological specimen. The technique is highly competitive in price with all commercially available kits. Such advantages should qualify the Zymoblot technique for wide potential uses in medicine, agriculture and industrial biotechnology and, more broadly, in general biotechnology application. It is useful in studies including physiology of humans, animals, plants and microorganisms, differential diagnosis of diseases and identification of pathogens, biotaxonomy of organisms, stress and pathogenesis physiology, physiological basis for disease resistance, developmental physiology and screening for commercially important enzymes and many other applications. The technique is particularly useful when initial testing for enzyme activity is required. It can be used in investigations involving screening a living organism for large numbers of enzymes. It can also be very handy in studying enzyme distribution or tissue- specific gene expression in terms of enzyme activity throughout the body or across an organ. Samples taken from different parts of an organism or an organ can simultaneously be analysed and compared, on the same blot, giving a clear picture of the distribution of enzyme activity. With the same simplicity, corresponding tissues taken from normally and biotically- or abiotically- stressed individuals can be compared for enzyme stimulation or induction. Furthermore, zymoblots can be very helpful in cytochemodissection studies aiming at localising enzymes within cells. Cell fractions representing different parts of the cell (nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, Golgi bodies, cytosol,... etc.) can be tested for a host of enzymes in a relatively short time. Qualitative zymoblot is of great potential use in diagnosis of human, animal and plant diseases. If a pathogen demonstrates a specific enzyme that is not shared by its host, the technique can be a definitive diagnostic tool. The detection of an enzyme not known to be normally present in a sample of body fluid (e.g. blood serum, CSF, synovial fluid, milk, tears...etc.) using qualitative zymoblot is an indication of a physiological disorder, inflammatory reaction or pathogenic infection. In all these situations, quantitative zymoblot can be used to determine the severity of the problem. Similarly, replacing biological fluids with non-biological fluids taken from water bodies (or prepared from similar environmental sources) at different locations or depths at different times will allow zymoblot, through detecting enzyme activities, to reveal or monitor microbial load and consequently determine the level of contamination in these sources.

Previously known as Boletus rhodoxanthus, it was transferred in 2014 to the newly erected genus Rubroboletus, based on DNA data. It produces large, colourful fruit bodies with pink patches on the cap, red pores in the hymenial surface and has a robust stem decorated in a dense, red- coloured network pattern. When longitudinally sliced, its flesh is distinctly bright yellow in the stem and discolours blue only in the cap, an excellent diagnostic feature distinguishing it from similar species. The fungus is more widespread in warm broad-leaved forests of southern Europe, where it grows in mycorrhizal symbiosis with trees of the family Fagaceae, particularly oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus). However, it is rare in northern regions and regarded as critically endangered or extinct in some countries. Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus is generally regarded as inedible and may cause adverse gastrointestinal symptoms if consumed. Taxonomy and phylogeny The fungus was first described in 1836 by Czech mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz, who considered it to be a variety of Boletus sanguineus.Krombholz JV von. (1836). Naturgetreue Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der Schw√§mme. 5: 1-17 In 1925, it was recombined as a distinct species by German mycologist Franz Joseph Kallenbach,Kallenbach FJ. (1925). Z. Pilzk. 5(1): 24 and the fungus remained in genus Boletus until 2014. The species epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words œÅœåŒ¥Œø (rh√≥do, \\"rose\\" or \\"pink\\") and ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ∏œåœÇ (xanth√≥s, \\"blonde\\" or \\"fair\\"). The first extensive phylogenetic studies on Boletaceae in 2006 and 2013, indicated that Boletus was not monophyletic and hence an artificial arrangement. A 2014 study by Wu and colleagues recognised 22 generic clades within Boletaceae, concluding that Boletus dupainii and some closely related red-pored species belong to a distinct clade, distant from the core clade of Boletus (comprising Boletus edulis and allied taxa). The new genus Rubroboletus was therefore described to accommodate species in this clade and B. rhodoxanthus was transferred to this genus. The placement of the species in genus Suillellus, following an online recombination by Blanco- Dios,Blanco-Dios JB. (2015). Nomenclatural novelties. Index Fungorum. 211: 1-2 was not supported by molecular data and has been subsequently rejected by later authors.Wu G, Li YC, Zhu XT, Zhao K, Han LH, Cui YY, Li F, Xu J, Yang ZL. (2016). One hundred noteworthy boletes from China. Fungal Diversity 81(1): 25‚Äì188. Description The cap is at first hemispherical, gradually becoming convex to almost flat as the fungus expands, with a diameter of , but can sometimes grow up to . It is at first slightly velvety and coloured mostly whitish-grey, but soon becomes smooth, pinkish-grey, pinkish-beige or pinkish- red, especially towards the margin or when handled. The tubes are adnate to emarginate, long and initially yellow, becoming somewhat olivaceous-yellow in very mature fruit bodies and staining blue when cut. The pores (tube mouths) are orange to deep red and instantly bluing when handled. The stem is long by wide, bulbous or clavate when young, becoming more elongated and cylindrical at maturity. It is orange or orange-yellow at the top (apex), gradually becoming orange-red to carmine-red in the lower part and bears a dense, orange-red to carmine-red reticulation (network pattern). The flesh is distinctly bright yellow and unchanging in the stem, but paler and turning blue when cut only in the cap. It has a mild taste. The spores are olive-brown in mass. When viewed under the microscope they are ellipsoid to fusiform (spindle-shaped), measuring 10‚Äì15.5 by 4‚Äì5.5 Œºm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium of septate cylindrical hyphae, sometimes finely incrusted. =Similar species= *Rubroboletus legaliae is very similar, but has a distinctive smell of chicory or hay and whitish flesh that stains blue in the cap, as well as the stem when cut. *Rubroboletus satanas has a whitish cap without flushes of pink and whitish flesh that usually stains pale blue also in the stem when cut. *Rubroboletus rubrosanguineus is mycorrhizal with spruce (Picea) or fir (Abies) and has pale yellow flesh that stains blue throughout. *Rubroboletus demonensis, so far known only from southern Italy (Calabria and Sicily), has usually brighter colours on the cap ranging from pale grey to blood-red or purple, has yellow flesh that stains weakly to moderately blue throughout and microscopically has smaller spores, measuring 12.5‚Äì14 √ó 4.5‚Äì5 Œºm. *Imperator rhodopurpureus differs by its pinkish-red to crimson-red cap that has a roughened or \\"hammered\\" appearance and stains blue when handled, but also by its flesh that stains intensely dark blue throughout. Distribution and habitat Regarded as a rare species in northern Europe, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus is more frequently encountered in warm, southern regions. It forms ectomycorrhizal associations with members of the Fagaceae, particularly oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus), but sometimes also with chestnut (Castanea). Molecular phylogenetic testing has confirmed its presence in France, Italy, Portugal and the islands of Cyprus and Sardinia, but it is probably widespread throughout most of the Mediterranean region. It has been reported as locally frequent on the island of Cyprus, where it appears in seasons with early rainfall, growing on serpentine soil under the endemic golden oak (Quercus alnifolia). In contrast, it is considered critically endangered in the Czech Republic and reported as extinct in England. In the British Islands it known only from Northern Ireland. Toxicity Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus is generally regarded as inedible or even poisonous, and can cause an adverse gastrointestinal reaction if eaten. In the Colour Atlas of Poisonous Fungi, Bresinsky and Besl claim that the fungus might be edible if thoroughly cooked, but warn against collecting it because of its rarity and possibility of confusion with R. satanas.

Once integral to the power and economy of the chiefly village, the villages of Lasakau (traditional fishermen) and Soso (traditional carpenters) are also located on the twenty- two acre island which became the centre of traditional power throughout the Fiji Islands in the nineteenth century. Because of its historic significance, in 1968 the Leader of the Opposition, A. D. Patel proposed setting aside funds to preserve the island. The main historic buildings in the village are the Ratu Seru Cakobau Church, the Vatanitawake temple and the Ulu ni Vuaka meeting house situated around the village green or rara. These buildings were all upgraded for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 1982, where she opened the Great Council of Chiefs meeting in Bau village. During her visit, Queen Elizabeth conferred on the Vunivalu and Governor General Ratu Sir George Cakobau a rare and exclusive honour of the Royal Victorian Chain displaying her affection for the high chief of Bau and for the people of Fiji.Daryl Tarte, Turaga, Fiji Times Ltd,1993,p.149. The village is the traditional home of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba - the paramount chief of the traditional Kubuna Confederacy and the Roko Tui Bau of the Vusaratu clan. Other clans of Bau village are the Vusaradave (traditional warriors), Tunitoga (Vunivalu's heralds) and Masau( Roko Tui Bau's heralds). Many Bauan villagers since Seru Epenisa Cakobau - the leading Fijian chief who ceded Fiji to the United Kingdom - have played significant roles in Fiji's history. They include Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, Ratu Timoci Tavanavanua, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, Ratu Penaia Kadavulevu, Ratu Popi Seniloli, Ratu Edward Cakobau, Ratu Deve Toganivalu (Snr), Ratu Tiale Vuiyasawa, Ratu Dr. Jione Atonio Rabici Doviverata and Ratu Sir George Cakobau and Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi I. Among white residents, the Swedish beachcomber Charlie Savage, who lived there 1808‚Äì13, is the most important. The Vunivalu's residence named Mataiweilagi is situated on the south east shore front of the village. Other chiefly residences that remain in the village are Naicobocobo, Naisogolaca, Muaidule, Nadamele, and'Qaranikula'. The district school, the Methodist Division missionary's residence and the chiefly mausoleum is situated on the knoll. The tiny islet of Nailusi sits approximately fifty meters from the north eastern end of Bau off Muaidule. Today, because of the villages growing population and the restrictive dwelling space on the island, many Bauan families live as a community at Taro settlement opposite the island on the Viti Levu coast, next to the main Nausori-Bau road.
