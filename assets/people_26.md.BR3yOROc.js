He was also Director of the English Football League Championship, a position he took up following 17 years in the brewing industry with both John Smith's Brewery (Courage Ltd) and Bass Brewery. Regan was Strategic Planning Director for Bass and part of the senior team involved in the sale of the company's brewing arm to the American brewer, Coors. In 2003/04, the leading clubs in the EFL appointed Regan as their Managing Director with a brief to establish the second tier of English football as a strong, commercially viable league for aspiring clubs hoping to access the Premiership. Regan quickly brought Wickes into the fold as an Official Partner of EFL Championship and developed the profile of the league through the Everything to Play For campaign which highlighted the excitement of the end of season play-offs, specifically the play-off final, the 'richest game on earth'. In 2006, he was recruited by Yorkshire County Cricket Club as their CEO with a specific brief to develop the club following the acquisition of the famous Headingley Cricket Ground from Leeds Rugby Limited. This purchase was concluded by Colin Graves, currently Chairman of the England & Wales Cricket Board who at the time was Chairman of the club and successful owner/founder of Costcutter, a convenience store chain in the UK. Regan led the development of the cricket ground culminating in the design and build of the Will Alsop inspired Carnegie Pavilion, a dual use facility built at a cost of ¬£25m and opened in 2009 as part of an exciting partnership with Leeds Metropolitan University (now Leeds Beckett) and Leeds City Council. The university partnership, which included sponsorship of the club's Twenty20 team, Yorkshire Carnegie, staff and student personal development opportunities, research assignments and player performance initiatives has subsequently been replicated by many professional sports clubs across the country. As a result of improvements made to the cricket ground at Headingley, Yorkshire County Cricket Club were able to retain their staging agreement with the England & Wales Cricket Board to host international cricket. Stewart Regan took up the position as Chief Executive of the Scottish Football Association on 5 October 2010, replacing Gordon Smith. Within the first months of his appointment at the SFA, Regan had to manage the Scottish football referee strike, drafting in foreign officials as replacements to ensure the organisation was not in breach of contract with its broadcasting partners. In June 2011 Regan gained unanimous support from all 93 members of the association to modernise the game in Scotland and his strategic plan, Scotland United: A 2020 vision was rolled out across the country. In 2012, the Scottish Government appointed Stewart Regan to chair the steering group responsible for developing Scotland's first National Performance Centre. After a competitive bidding process, Heriot Watt University were awarded the contract to design and build the centre. Oriam was opened at a cost of ¬£33m in August 2016, on time and within budget. Oriam has subsequently become the home for the SFA's Performance Department and all of Scotland's national football teams. During his time as CEO at the SFA, the Scotland men's national A squad did not qualify for a major tournament and Regan parted company with both Craig Levein and Gordon Strachan, both of whom had two campaigns as national coach. On the plus side, Regan who was a passionate supporter for the development of women's football saw Anna Signeul's squad qualify for the first time ever for the UEFA Women's Euro Championships held in Holland in 2017. Stewart Regan was also Chairman of Hampden Park Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the SFA from 2015 to 2018 and led the winning Glasgow bid to host the UEFA European Championships which will take place in the city in 2020. He was appointed by UEFA as a director of UEFA Club Competitions S.A, a joint venture with the ECA responsible for the business affairs of the organisation's club competitions. In addition, he was Vice Chairman of UEFA's Marketing Advisory Committee during the period 2012 to 2018. Regan resigned his position at the SFA in February 2018, in the wake of negative publicity surrounding the Northern Ireland national coach, Michael O'Neill's, decision to stay in Belfast having been offered the Scotland job. In April 2018, he founded Ascend Global Consulting Ltd and is currently advising a number of sports organisations around the world.

Ramsey is perhaps best known for his book, The Annals of Tennessee to the End of the Eighteenth Century, a seminal work documenting the state's frontier and early statehood periods. Ramsey was also a major advocate for development in East Tennessee, leading efforts to bring railroad access to the region, and helping to organize the region's first medical society.Lisa Oakley, James Gettys McGready Ramsey. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 29 July 2010. As the son of a prominent Tennessee statesman, Ramsey encountered as a child many of the state's important early political figures, giving him a unique historical perspective on the state's early years.William Masterson, \\"J. G. M. Ramsey: Historian of Early Tennessee.\\" Introduction in Ramsey's The Annals of Tennessee to the End of the Eighteenth Century (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1999), pp. xiii-xxix. After his father's death, Ramsey began compiling a vast collection of historical documents related to the state's Watauga, Franklin, and Southwest Territory periods. After years of exchanging advice and notes with fellow historian Lyman Draper, Ramsey published the 700-plus page Annals in 1853. While the book has been praised for its attention to accuracy and factual detail, modern historians have criticized it for its lack of historical inquiry and its overemphasis on biography and warfare. A lifelong states' rights Democrat, Ramsey supported the Confederacy during the Civil War, and as a Confederate treasury agent, he was forced to flee Knoxville under an armed guard ahead of the city's Federal occupation in 1863. While the war left his family and finances in ruins, Ramsey nevertheless returned to Knoxville in the early 1870s, and gradually rebuilt his fortune. His funeral procession in 1884 was the largest ever witnessed in Knoxville until that time. Biography =Early life= DAR marker at the Ramsey House, recalling the site as J.G.M. Ramsey's birthplace Ramsey was born in a temporary cabin at what is now the Ramsey House (the house was still under construction) in 1797, the fourth son of Francis Alexander Ramsey and Peggy Alexander, both of Scots-Irish descent.William B. Hesseltine, Preface to J. G. M. Ramsey's Autobiography and Letters (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1954), p. vii. Francis Alexander had left Pennsylvania possessing only his horse, and both a surveying compass and chain during 1783 at age 19 after having been invited by his material uncle John Alexander to live with him on Big Limestone Creek at what was then Washington County, North Carolina (now Greene County, Tennessee) and within approximately one mile of the Martin Academy founded by the Rev. Samuel Doak. Also during 1783, Ramsey's father helped James White explore what is now the Knoxville area, and later served in various capacities in the State of Franklin and Southwest Territory governments.Stanley Folmsbee and Lucile Deaderick, \\"The Founding of Knoxville,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 13 (1941), p. 3-20. Guests who frequented the Ramsey House during Ramsey's formative years included John Sevier and Willie Blount, and Knoxville founders James White and Charles McClung. Francis Alexander married Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Alexander from Mecklenburg, North Carolina on April 7, 1789 and moved his 23 year old bride to his Limestone residence where they lived until 1792 or 1793, when they moved away to Swan Pond. Swan Pond is located within the Lebanon In The Fork area east of Knoxville where the Holston River meets at a confluence with the French Broad River, these rivers together forming the beginning of the Tennessee River. J.G.M. Ramsey studied with private tutors as a child before attending the Ebenezer Academy, located in what is now West Knoxville. He graduated from Washington College (previously, Martin Academy) during March 1816, and later studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He married Margaret Crozier in 1821, and began practicing medicine in Knoxville.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 97, 470-471. =Business interests= After his father's death in 1820, Ramsey succeeded him as president of the Knoxville Branch of the Bank of Tennessee. During the same period, he began building a large plantation at the confluence of the French Broad and Holston rivers, named \\"Mecklenburg\\" after his mother's native Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Along with a large mansion, Mecklenburg included a 4,000-volume library that contained many important documents pertaining to Tennessee's early history, as well as a ferry at the head of the Tennessee River. According to an account of a visit to Mecklenberg by \\"Ora,\\" a correspondent of the Mobile Advertiser, (and later republished within the April 6, 1862 edition of the Knoxville Register), the Ramsey's Mecklenburg residence was located about 100 yards from \\"...the ruins of the old Presbyterian Church of Lebanon\\".http://knoxcotn.org/old_site/history/mecklenburg.html \\"A Visit to Mecklenburg by \\"Ora\\". As early as 1825, Ramsey had proposed connecting Knoxville with the Atlantic Coast via railroad, which would have given the region's farmers better access to markets in Charleston. Over the years, Ramsey negotiated several hundred thousand dollars worth of bonds, which funded the first railroads built in the region. Ramsey also championed improvements to the Tennessee River that would give Knoxville's river merchants year-round access to the Mississippi River. In 1828, the first steamboat to reach Knoxville, the Atlas, docked at Mecklenburg, prompting Ramsey to give a speech on the meaning of patriotism. During the 1850s, Ramsey served as a director of the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad, which finally brought railroad access to Knoxville in 1855. In 1858, the Bank of East Tennessee, of which Ramsey was also a director, collapsed due to overspeculation. The bank chose to pay off its largest depositers instead of its smaller (and less affluent) depositers, causing outrage throughout the region.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 25, 78, 107, 211. Knoxville Whig newspaper editor and Methodist minister William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, who had been at odds with Ramsey since the 1840s,Jonesborough Whig, 26 June 1844, e.g. sued on behalf of these depositers and won a civil judgement against Ramsey.William Gannaway Brownlow, Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession (Philadelphia: G.W. Childs, 1862), pp. 289-290. =The Annals of Tennessee= Ramsey began accumulating historical documents pertaining to the state's history during the 1830s. He began writing The Annals of Tennessee in 1840, but the project stalled as Ramsey struggled with a lack of information regarding certain periods, and attempted to address certain contradictions in his source documents. A major catalyst for Ramsey during this period was his friendship with historian Lyman Draper, who first visited Ramsey in October 1844. Draper, who was compiling documents for a history of the Trans-Allegheny region, helped Ramsey fill in a number of gaps, and provided him with technical advice. The Annals of Tennessee, which covers the state's history to 1800, was finally published in 1853. Contemporary historians such as Draper, George Bancroft, and Benson John Lossing, praised the Annals, while others, such as William B. Campbell and A. W. Putnam, derided it. The book sold moderately well, and a second edition was published within a few years. The 1860 edition of Ramsey's The Annals of Tennessee also features approximately 36 pages of display advertising for Lippincott & Grambo & Co.s Publications at the back section of the book, predominately selling religious books, sermons, and illustrations. The book is an invaluable account of many of the state's early historical events, especially considering that many of the documents on which it was based were destroyed during the Civil War. Modern historians, however, criticize Ramsey for focusing almost solely on battles and biographies of key figures, while ignoring economic and social factors that contributed significantly to the state's early settlement. The book has also been criticized for its unbalanced organization, providing a torrent of details on some events and scant details on other, equally important events. =Secession crisis= Ramsey had long sought to bring a Deep South-style economy to East Tennessee. He believed the South was morally superior to the North, and detested the idea that Knoxville would become industrialized along the lines of northern manufacturing centers. This brought him into conflict with Brownlow and business leaders such as Perez Dickinson, who believed the region's abundant coal and iron resources made industrialization Knoxville's most lucrative option. Ramsey was also radically pro-slavery, going so far as to call for the reopening of the Atlantic slave trade.J. G. M. Ramsey, William B. Hesseltine (ed.), Autobiography and Letters (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1954), pp. 87-95, 173. During the secession crisis that followed Lincoln's election in November 1860, Ramsey grew increasingly frustrated with East Tennessee's refusal to align itself with the South. Ramsey suggested that most East Tennesseans were too \\"ignorant\\" to understand the secession issue, and accused Brownlow (who was pro-Union) of using the Whig to brainwash them. After the fall of Fort Sumter, Ramsey wrote to Governor Isham Harris, and suggested he bypass a voters' referendum on Tennessee's Union ties and simply dissolve them by proclamation. Ramsey owned eight slaves in 1860 prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. =The Civil War= During the war, Ramsey served as a Confederate treasury agent, and two of his sons served in the Confederate Army. His eldest son, John Crozier Ramsey, was appointed Confederate States District Attorney of Knox County. In this capacity, the younger Ramsey issued indictments against the city's pro-Unionists, and in December 1861, had Brownlow arrested for treason. As rumors spread that the Confederate Army was planning to release Brownlow, the elder Ramsey wrote to Jefferson Davis, calling Brownlow the \\"prime mover and instigator\\" of Union sentiment in the region, and demanded he be court-martialed. As the war raged on, Ramsey's fortunes collapsed. His son, Arthur, was killed in battle, his daughters Charlotte and Henrietta died, and two other sons were captured. When the Union Army occupied Knoxville in 1863, Ramsey and his family were forced to flee. His home, Mecklenburg, with its 4,000-volume library, was burned by a Union soldier (Ramsey claimed the arsonist had been hired by Brownlow). Brownlow seized Ramsey's townhouse in Knoxville, and had Ramsey's youngest daughter, Susan, expelled from the city. Ramsey's son was forced to sell the family's ancestral home in East Knoxville.Elizabeth Bowman Scaggs, \\"Swan Pond: Francis Alexander Ramsey's Stone House, a Tennessee State Shrine.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 27 (1955), pp. 9-18. Ramsey himself spent the latter half of the war in various cities around the region, continuously fleeing the Union Army's advance. =Later life= Ramsey family graves at Lebanon-in-the-Fork; J.G.M's is the tall obelisk in the middle At the end of the war, the Ramseys wound up in a house in Charlotte, North Carolina, which they called \\"Exile's Retreat.\\" Brownlow, now governor of Tennessee, refused to pardon Ramsey, and ordered his arrest. Ramsey's friends, however, managed to obtain for him a presidential pardon from Andrew Johnson, issued in November 1865. Ramsey returned to Knoxville 1872. He began practicing medicine again, and managed to regain some of his property through a series of complicated lawsuits. When Ramsey died in 1884, the flag at the Tennessee State Capitol was lowered to half-mast. The Knoxville Chronicle reported that Ramsey's funeral procession was the largest in the history of Knoxville. Ramsey was buried nearby his father at the Lebanon in the Forks Cemetery, near the confluence of the French Broad and Holston rivers at the beginning of the Tennessee River. https://books.google.com/books?id=e31FpfI1CVMC&lpg;=PA349&ots;=HnNKRe- BRM&dq;=J.G.M%20Ramsey%2C%20%22Lebanon%20Presbyterian%20Church%22&pg;=PA349#v=onepage&q;=J.G.M%20Ramsey,%20%22Lebanon%20Presbyterian%20Church%22&f;=false \\"Tennessee: A Guide to the State\\". By Federal Writers' Project, p. 349. The Viking Press, New York. 1939. Legacy During his lifetime, Ramsey helped establish the East Tennessee Medical Society, serving as its first president, as well as the East Tennessee Historical Society, serving as its first recording secretary. After the war, he served as president of the Tennessee Historical Society. The stone house of Ramsey's father, completed the year of Ramsey's birth, still stands on Thorngrove Pike in East Knoxville, and is currently a museum. Ramsey was the inspiration for the George Washington Harris short story, \\"The Doctor's Bill,\\" which describes a doctor's comical attempt to obtain payment from the county for the treatment of a local pauper. Ramsey, called \\"Doctor Blank\\" in the story, probably told the story to Harris at some point. The story also mentions Ramsey's old mentor, Joseph Strong (\\"Dr. S\\").M. Thomas Inge, High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), p. 92n. While criticized by modern historians, the Annals of Tennessee remains an important source of factual information regarding the state's early settlement, and has been republished several times. In 1918, the East Tennessee Historical Society published a short pamphlet written by Ramsey that details the history of the Lebanon-in-the-Fork Presbyterian Church. In 1954, the Tennessee Historical Commission published an autobiography Ramsey had written to venerate his family's actions during the Civil War, along with some of his personal correspondence.

There were 27 participating countries, and an estimated attendance of 7.8 million people. The main venues of the fair were the Cinquantenaire Parks, as well as a colonial section at Tervuren, showcasing King Leopold II of Belgium's personal property, the Congo Free State. The two exposition sites were linked by a purpose-built tramway. Colonial exhibit The Tervuren section was hosted in the Palace of the Colonies (although there was only one colony), designed by Alfred-Philibert Aldrophe. In the main hall, Georges Hob√© designed a distinctive wooden Art Nouveau structure to evoke the forest, using Bilinga wood, an African tree. The interior exhibition displayed ethnographic objects, stuffed animals and in the \\"Hall of the Great Cultures\\" Congo's most important export products were displayed: coffee, cacao and tobacco. In the park, an example Congolese village was built, where 267 Africans lived through the period of the fair. This exhibition's success led to the permanent establishment of the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1898. Art Nouveau The primary designers of the fair were among of the Belgian masters of Art Nouveau architecture at the height of the style: Henry van de Velde, Paul Hankar, G√©d√©on Bordiau, and Gustave Serrurier-Bovy. Henri Privat-Livemont produced posters for the exposition. There seems to be few physical remnants. The small neoclassical pavilion called the Temple of Human Passions that Victor Horta designed to house a sculptural relief by Jef Lambeaux was completed in time for the fair, but its opening was delayed by disputes until 1899. Vieux-Bruxelles A public favorite at the World‚Äôs fair was Vieux- Bruxelles (also called Bruxelles-Kermesse), a miniature city and theme park evoking Brussels around 1830. Conceived by George Garnir, and designed by Jules Barbier (not to be confused with the Parisian author), Gombeaux and Ghyssels, with dioramas painted by Albert Dubosq, Pierre Devis and Armand Lynen, the section occupied of the Cinquantenaire park.

It was first performed at the Finnish National Theatre and directed by Jalmari Lahdensuo, who was also the overall theatre director. However there exists concrete doubt over whether J√§rviluoma actually fully wrote the play. J√§rviluoma's other literary works are modest in comparison. Anton Kangas (1867‚Äì1904) worked as J√§rviluoma's teacher and wrote the unfinished play H√§rm√§l√§isi√§. Although the original script has been destroyed, J√§rviluoma's notes on it have survived and Pohjalaisia may have largely been derived from it. 1924 opera Leevi Madetoja made a popular opera in 1924 based on the play with the same name, commonly known by its English name as The Ostrobothnians. 1925 filmatization The 1925 film version also titled Pohjalaisia is a silent film.

It is located near Grand Army Plaza, across Central Park South from the Plaza Hotel, and slightly west of Fifth Avenue. The Pond is one of seven bodies of water in Central Park.Central Park Conservancy: The Pond; the other six are the Lake, Conservatory Water, the Turtle Pond, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the Pool, and Harlem Meer.  Hallett Sanctuary  The Hallett Nature Sanctuary is the smallest of Central Park's wooded area at . Originally known as the Promontory, it is the only permanently fenced-off section of Central Park aside from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, occupies of the wooded promontory to the west of the Pond, jutting into the water body. The area was closed in 1934 when NYC Parks commissioner Robert Moses set the site apart as a bird sanctuary. In the 1980s, after decades of neglect, invasive alien plants like ailanthus and Far Eastern wisterias were extirpated, and the equally invasive though native black cherry was thinned, the woodland was enriched with native shrubs.Central Park: Multimedia: Hallet Nature Sanctuary The reserve was renamed in 1986, in honor of George Hervey Hallett Jr. (1895‚Äì1985), an ardent birdwatcher and naturalist and executive secretary of the Citizens Union.Henry Stern, \\"The Seven-Year Itch\\" The New York Sun, 23 March 2006 (on coyote tourists); a Profile of Hallett by William Schieffelin was printed in The New Yorker, August 22, 1953. The Hallett Sanctuary was reopened to the public in 2016, when the Central Park Conservancy started allowing visitors to enter the sanctuary during middays.Water trickles down an artificial cascade into the pond. The Central Park Conservancy routinely offers half-hour tours; they avoid nesting season and the height of migratory season, because Central Park is a stopover on the Atlantic Flyway. The perimeter affords one of the prime bird watching areas of the Park.Central Park Birding: by Location Formerly, deadfalls remained where they lay, to provide for insects that feed birds. However, the experiment ended after an Asian longhorn beetle was discovered in 2002.Animal Tourism: Central Park Opens Secret Sanctuary for 30 Minutes Another unexpected visitor was Hal the Central Park Coyote, who received his nickname from the Hallett Sanctuary and passed through briefly in March 2006.  The Pond  As originally laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the Pond was considerably larger. A large piece of its upper reaches, which once spanned a narrow neck of water, was paved over to form Wollman Rink, which opened in 1950. Nearby, on stone plinths, bronze busts commemorate the poet Thomas Moore and the composer Victor Herbert (by Edmond Thomas Quinn). The Central Park Conservancy started a reconstruction of the Pond in 2000, and completed it the next year. The reconstruction included new shoreline and perimeter plantings, an island habitat for birds and turtles, and beyond Gapstow Bridge, a series of small pools and cascades. A male mandarin duck resident of the Pond, nicknamed Mandarin Patinkin, received international media attention in late 2018 and early 2019; the duck's colorful appearance and the species' appearance outside its native range in East Asia contributed to its popularity. The Pond is spanned by Gapstow Bridge, a schist structure built in 1896 by Howard & Caudwell. It replaced an 1871 bridge by Jacob Wrey Mould. The first bridge was a wooden bridge supported by segmental arches on either side of the deck, the tops of which rose above the deck, similar to the design of a through arch bridge.

Plot synopsis Morbius charges fellow A.R.M.O.R. agents, Machine Man and Howard the Duck, with retrieving different samples of zombies from each reality so that he can find a cure for his infected friend, Jacob Russell. Through their travel they are joined by Jacali Kane, the daughter of supervillain Harry Kane, also known as Hurricane whom before his death, transferred his powers to her. The team travels through 5 realities. Each reality has its own version of the virus, mimicking a popular horror movie (Romero, Raimi, Boyle, etc.), featuring guest appearances from various Marvel figures from the Wild West, Killraven, Ultron, Thor, Jocasta and Arno Stark (future Iron Man, deceased). Hurricane, his daughter, and Machine Man killed some zombies, but a group of revived zombies killed Hurricane. Howard the Duck assembled Dum Dum Dugan and other uninfected people to perform Ducky's Dozen. They got Killraven and Old Skull to join in with them. When Old Skull was bitten on the arm, his friends had no choice but to amputate his infected arm to prevent him to overpower his own friends as a new zombie, which is successful.

According to a journalist, he was abducted and killed by the Provisional IRA, a victim of enforced disappearance. No reason, in this case, has ever been publicly given. Armstrong and his wife Kathleen had five children. Armstrong's body was retrieved in 2010 and his funeral took place on 18 September 2010. Disappearance On the day Armstrong disappeared, his wife walked with their daughters to Mass, where they had planned to meet him after he drove a friend to it. He did not appear and it was only when they got home that they discovered that he had not met their friend. Initially, it was thought that he had had an accident, so his family and friends searched the area, but there was no sign of him. The next day, a friend phoned the family to tell them that his car had been found outside a cinema in Dundalk. His name did not appear on a list of nine people whose disappearances the Provisional IRA admitted responsibility for in 1999. Gerry Adams, president of Sinn F√©in, denied that the IRA was responsible, but journalist Suzanne Breen said that she had been contacted by a member of the IRA who said that it was. Searches In 2001 a search for his body produced no results. In July 2010, a group searching for Armstrong announced that they had found human remains in County Monaghan. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains said that it had found the remains early on the afternoon of 29 July 2010 in the townland of Aughrim More, on the County Monaghan side of Cullaville. This search was carried out after the Commission had received anonymously a map indicating an area which had not been searched before for Armstrong's body. In September 2010, the Independent Commission confirmed that the remains found were those of Charles Armstrong.

Wiley served in the New Jersey State Senate from 1973 to 1978, where he represented Morris County. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of New Jersey in the 1985 Democratic primary election. Early life, education, and military service Wiley was born on June 21, 1929 in Morristown, New Jersey to Katharine (n√©e Pellett) and J. Burton Wiley. Wiley attended Morristown High School, graduating in 1947. His father had been the district's superintendent of schools.Coughlin, Kevin. \\"No clich√©s here: May 10 gala will salute living legend Steve Wiley. . . ‚ÄòMr. Morristown‚Äô\\", MorristownGreen.com, May 4, 2012. Accessed October 12, 2015. \\"'By the time the court-ordered hearings were held, bitterness was all that most can remember. Wiley bore the brunt of many of the attacks because as a graduate of MHS in 1947 and the son of J. Burton Wiley, the former longtime superintendent of schools for the district, his friends and neighbors felt he should have been protecting their interests rather than the minorities he represented,' Marge said.\\" Wiley earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 1951, graduating cum laude with a major in Politics. In 1953, Wiley married Judith Alexander. Wiley was awarded a law degree from Columbia Law School in 1954. He served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956. Legal career and civic involvement Wiley worked as legal counsel to New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner. He and Gov. Meyner formed the law firm of Meyner and Wiley. In the early 1970s, Wiley led a legal battle to stop Morris Township from building its own high school. Wiley was concerned that separate high schools in Morris Township and Morristown would create a system of de facto segregation, \\"[hastening] white flight from Morristown [and] dooming it to the same turmoil afflicting New Jersey‚Äôs urban centers.\\" Wiley believed that \\"having 'a minority center and a white ring around it is nothing but a guarantee of an explosion...'\\" The court battle went all the way to the New Jersey Supreme Court, and resulted in the formation of a regional school district serving Morristown, Morris Township and (for high school) Morris Plains. In 1973, Wiley founded the law firm of Wiley, Malehorn and Sirota (later renamed Wiley, Malehorn, Sirota, and Raynes) in Morris Township. Wiley also founded Morris Cablevision, the county's first cable television company, the First Morris Bank and Trust, and the Morris County United Way. \\"Wiley spearheaded multi- million-dollar fund drives to secure and enhance public institutions that are bedrocks of the [greater Morristown, New Jersey] community: The Community Theatre (now the Mayo Performing Arts Center), the Morristown & Township Library and the historic Morristown Green.\\" Political career In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal in 1973, Wiley ran for the New Jersey State Senate in two separate but concurrent elections. One election was a special election in the 10th Legislative District (consisting of the entirety of Morris County) to fill the remaining term of Joseph J. Maraziti, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives in the previous year. The other election was for a four-year term in the newly formed 23rd Legislative District (consisting of central Morris County municipalities). In both elections, he faced Republican Assemblywoman Josephine Margetts. Wiley defeated Margetts in both elections (by two points in the special election and by six in the regular election), becoming the first Democrat to win a State Senate seat from Morris County in sixty years. Wiley was sworn into the Senate on November 12, 1973, serving two months of Maraziti's unexpired term from the at-large Morris County district. Later, in his full Senate term, Wiley served as Chair of the Senate Education Committee, the Joint Committee on the Public Schools and the Senate Rules Committee. Wiley was responsible for drafting legislation which became the Public School Education Act of 1975, which established a state income tax in New Jersey that was specified as a source for school funding in addition to locally assessed property taxes. He was named a top legislator by New Jersey Monthly magazine. Governor Brendan Byrne nominated Wiley to the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 following the retirement of Justice Frederick W. Hall. His nomination was approved by the Senate, but was challenged by former Assemblyman David Friedland on the grounds that the State Legislature had voted to raise the salary of justices of the Supreme Court during Wiley's Senate tenure. On February 11, 1977, after two years of appeals, the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected Wiley's nomination because of the pay raise, ruling that Wiley could not be appointed to serve on the Court until after his term of office expired. According to The New York Times, the Constitution of the State of New Jersey provides that \\"no legislator may be appointed to a state job until after his term expires if the salary for the job was raised during the term.\\"Waldron, Martin. \\"SUPREME COURT BARS WILEY APPOINTMENT; Cites His Membership in Legislature When It Raised Justices' Salaries Byrne to Nominate an Aide\\", The New York Times, February 12, 1977. Accessed March 8, 2018. Alan B. Handler was later appointed and confirmed to fill the vacancy on the Court. Wiley was defeated by Assemblyman John H. Dorsey, 54%-46%, in his 1977 re-election bid. Wiley ran for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1985, focusing on the state's toxic waste problem as a campaign issue as he targeted incumbent Republican Governor Tom Kean.Perlez, Jane. \\"WILEY FOCUSING RACE ON TOXIC WASTE ISSUE\\", The New York Times, May 31, 1985.

Russo received 26.6%, and Newark mayor Kenneth A. Gibson received 26.1%. Later life At the age of 70, Wiley began writing poetry. He published three books of poetry: Hero Island (published in 2005), Mockingbird Come Home (published in 2007), and Latitudes (published in 2009). In 2012, he and his wife Judy sold their Morris County home and moved full-time to South Hero, Vermont on Lake Champlain; they later moved to nearby Shelburne, Vermont.

The semi-biographical book is based on two articles that appeared in both the online and print editions of the New York newspaper El Nuevo Cojo Ilustrado in 2004. The novel recounts the adventures of a young Venezuelan student in Paris, and his travels through the city's most distressed neighborhoods, Barb√®s and Ch√¢teau-Rouge. This work revealed a new facet in the author's writing: his ability to entertain and make the reader laugh. The text also takes the reader through the doubts and uncertainties experienced by a young man who wants to become a writer but do not have the faintest idea how. Furthermore, it documents, albeit non-intentionally, the experiments with moving images that eventually lead to the writing and production of short film called \\"Permanence\\". The edition published by Ediciones Idea had the support and contribution of Spanish photographer Tarek Ode, who gave one of his works for the cover and who presented the book in the Elder House of Tenerife in the company of the author.

Ifigenia marked a change in Venezuelan literature. The novel is a portrait of Caracan society in the early twentieth century. Strict moral rules are represented by the grandmother in this novel, and the character of Uncle Pancho represents the ambitious personality which was common at the time due to political corruption. Besides being a harsh criticism of society, Ifigenia is a fast- paced work with detailed descriptions. The novel caused serious problems for the author because the Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente Gomez denied her a grant to publish the book. De la Parra decided to move to Paris. A veiled criticism of the regime of Gomez can be seen in Ifigenia.

It is considered one of the most pessimistic novels written in Venezuela. It presents the social, political, and cultural life of people in Caracas with a defeatist attitude, where all hope of salvation has been abandoned. The central theme of the novel is the character Alberto Soria's failure in his effort to assert his ideals as an artist in Venezuela against a backdrop of the country's total decadence. In the novel, different social problems are identified through the actions of well-defined characters: Alberto Soria, the misunderstood artist; Teresa Faria, the adulterous woman; General Galindo, the opportunist politician; and Emaz√°bel, the social activist.  Structure  The novel is divided into four parts and fifteen chapters. The first part begins with the arrival of Alberto Soria who has been away in Paris for the past five years. His urgent return is motivated by the sudden illness of his father Don Pancho Soria. From the beginning of the novel, Alberto Soria is portrayed as being hypersensitive and behaving in an unhealthy and volatile manner. He has been uprooted from his country and out of touch with its problems. He had gone to Europe to study engineering, but once in Paris he abandoned his studies to become a sculptor. In his first contact with Caracas he is shocked by the environment. He feels maladjusted and out of place. He is bothered by the dirty streets and the poor architectural taste that predominates in the city. From his siblings Rosa and Pedro, he begins to realize the prevailing mediocrity and unhappiness that envelopes his ancestral home. In the second part of the novel Alberto Soria's maladjustment to the Venezuelan environment increases. The process begins in his family when his father confesses his unhappiness at not having achieved his ambitions through his children. Next he finds out about the drama surrounding his sister Rosa who is married to Uribe, a man of low social status who is fond of games and deceit. He also notices the weak personality of his brother Pedro who acts according to the vagaries of politics. The climax of the crisis occurs when Alberto discovers that in Venezuela his status as an artist is questioned, which incites him to transform himself into a true creator, but he hesitates, assailed by fears and doubts. Little by little he isolates himself from others until he begins to associate only with nonconformists and intellectuals who think like himself and with whom he forms a reactionary bubble against the atmosphere of the times. In the third part, the character shows an apparent change of conduct motivated by his love for Mar√≠a Almeida. Alberto intensifies his activity as a sculptor and finishes a Creole Venus that doesn't completely satisfy him. Despite that he stages an unsuccessful exhibition in a coffee shop near to the Plaza Bol√≠var in Caracas. Alberto Soria soon suffers an inexplicable change regarding the love that he feels for Mar√≠a Almeida and begins to experience strange mood swings due to unfounded jealousy, a product of his own mind. The third part of the novel ends with the death of his father. The fourth part of the novel narrates the start and the evolution of the love between Alberto Soria and Teresa Far√≠as, a strange and adulterous woman. Alberto begins to make a sculpture of his lover, but is soon discovered by his girlfriend and his sister. Soon a new civil war plunges the country in anarchy. After the triumph of the revolution the country falls in the hands of the populace and the military. Alberto goes to the School of Fine Arts, which has been turned into a barracks, and finds that his works have been mutilated and desecrated by the soldiers. At this point he gives up everything and decides to emigrate to safeguard his aesthetic ideals.

It was written by Eduardo Blanco and published in 1881, with an expanded second edition in 1883. It is Blanco's main work, and presents a classic romantic view of history as an epic. Venezuela heroica is structured in five vignettes that depict the main battles and heroes of the Venezuelan War of Independence. It was from General Jos√© Antonio P√°ez himself that Blanco heard the stories of the Battle of Carabobo, during an encounter with Marshal Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n to end the Federal War (1859‚Äì1863) near the site of the battle. P√°ez was so moved from his memories of youth, the anecdote goes, that he could not stop telling his aide (Blanco) the details of the battle. It was Falc√≥n who then told Blanco \\"you are listening to the Iliad from the very lips of Achilles\\". Structure The first edition is structured in five vignettes that depict the most memorable battles, those of La Victoria, San Mateo, Las Queseras del Medio, Boyac√° and Carabobo. It was from General Jos√© Antonio P√°ez himself that Blanco heard the stories of the Battle of Carabobo, during an encounter with Marshal Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n to end the Federal War (1859‚Äì1863) near the site of the battle. P√°ez was so moved from his memories of youth, the anecdote goes, that he could not stop telling his aide (Blanco) the details of the battle. It was Falc√≥n who then told Blanco \\"you are listening to the Iliad from the very lips of Achilles\\". In the second edition, six further battles have been added: Sitio de Valencia de Venezuela, Matur√≠n, La invasi√≥n de los Seiscientos, La Casa Fuerte, San F√©lix and Matasiete. Venezuela Heroica is written in prose. It is a story about the country‚Äôs emancipation in which the author uses his skill to portray the bloody war while paying tribute for the deeds of those who successfully and unrelentingly fought for Venezuelan freedom. Genre =Romanticism= All the critics and historians of Venezuelan literature agree that Venezuela Heroica is a work with clear romantic characteristics. The style is subjective and Blanco bases the narrative events in the world of historic Venezuelan facts. By using a revealing and exciting tone and also expressive devices, his intention is to influence the reader and amongst other things, to justify the work being considered a statement of literary Venezuelan romance. =The epic= The epic tone of Venezuela Heroica succeeds through the use of wide coverage of space and time and lyrically with its basis of comparisons, epiphanies, hyperboles and other devices. The wideness in space succeeds by highlighting the heroes in relation to the people around them. Each hero is portrayed in relation to their own environment with interactions between them and other heroes. As regards the development of time, the events are often magnified through comparison with specific facts from the past, from antiquity or the Middle Ages, and this contributes to give a greater dimension.Crema, Edoardo.

He was Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin (1831-1843) and much later Provost (1867‚Äì1881). Lloyd is known for experimentally verifying conical refraction, a theoretical prediction made by William Rowan Hamilton about the way light is bent when travelling through a biaxial crystal. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and President of both the British Association and the Royal Irish Academy. Early life The eldest son of the Rev. Bartholomew Lloyd, and his wife, Eleanor McLaughlin, he was born in Dublin on 16 April 1800. His father had also served as Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Provost of TCD. After early education at Mr. White's school in Dublin, he entered Trinity College Dublin in 1815, first out of 63 competitors in the entrance examination. He was elected a Scholar in 1818, and graduated B.A. in 1819, taking first place and the gold medal for science, and proceeding M.A. in 1827, and D.D. in 1840. He became a junior fellow in 1824, and a senior fellow in 1843. Scientific career Lloyd in 1831 succeeded his father as Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. At the meeting of the British Association in 1833 he spoke on his establishment by experiment of the existence of conical refraction in biaxial crystals, in conformity with the theory of William Rowan Hamilton. He also succeeded in establishing experimentally the law by which the polarisation of the rays composing the luminous cone is governed. Shortly after, by means of an experiment on the interference of light proceeding directly from a luminous source, with light coming from the same source but reflected at a very high angle of incidence from a plane surface, he contributed to the theory of reflected light. A letter from Sir David Brewster led him to turn his attention to the phenomena of light incident on thin plates. In 1841 he submitted a communication on the subject to the British Association, and in 1859 he described his investigation of the phenomena to the Royal Irish Academy (see Transactions, vol. xxiv.) When the magnetic observatory of Trinity College Dublin, was established under the auspices of his father, it was placed in Lloyd's charge, and the instruments for it were devised by him and constructed under his superintendence. He was a member of the committee of the British Association lobbying government to improve knowledge of terrestrial magnetism by establishing observing stations. He prepared the instructions for the observatories, and the officers appointed to take charge of them were trained by him in Dublin. Later life From 1846 to 1851 Lloyd was president of the Royal Irish Academy, who in 1862 awarded him their Cunningham gold medal. He resigned his chair of natural philosophy in 1843, on his accession to a senior fellowship in Trinity College. In 1862 he became vice-provost, and in 1867 was appointed provost, in succession to Richard MacDonnell. He was president of the British Association in 1857, when it met in Dublin, and delivered an inaugural address, which was published, in which he gave a sketch of the recent progress made in astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, and other branches of science. Lloyd was a leading member of the general synod of the Irish church which came into existence on Irish disestablishment, and took part in its committee for the revision of the prayer-book. He died in the provost's house, Dublin, 17 January 1881. Awards and honours Lloyd was a fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and an honorary member of many other learned societies of Europe and America. In 1855 the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L., and in 1874 the emperor of Germany the order Pour le M√©rite. A bust of him, by Albert Bruce Joy, was placed in the library of Trinity College in 1892. Works In 1834 Lloyd furnished the British Association, at its request, with a report on The Progress and Present State of Physical Optics (see Report for 1834). Papers which he wrote on terrestrial magnetism and other subjects are in the Reports of the British Association and in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Willow however was more timid and fiercely scared of monsters. They both soon become Buffy's most loyal sidekicks. There is some romantic tension between them as Xander has a crush on Buffy and is oblivious of Willow's affections for him. The Scoobies distrust Angel but warm up to him as the season progresses. Buffy and her friends often clash with Cordelia Chase, who attempted to befriend Buffy on her first day, but Buffy didn't like the way she treated Willow. Throughout the season, Cordelia is often at odds with Buffy and her friends but near the end of the season, she becomes aware of the supernatural world around her and helps Buffy. In the earlier episodes, Buffy and Angel encounter The Master's minor minion Darla, who was the vampire who sired Angel. Darla is soon seemingly killed much to The Master's anger, but The Master gains a new prot√©g√© in the form of the Anointed One, a child like minion who has a major role in opening the Hellmouth. In the season finale, Buffy learns of a prophecy involving her death at the hands of The Master. Just as The Master begins his plot, Buffy finally confronts him. The Master bites Buffy and leaves her to drown in a shallow pool. Buffy recovers via CPR by Xander and confronts The Master again on the school roof. After a final stand off, The Master is impaled and killed on a piece of wood after falling through the Sunnydale High skylight. After saving the world, Buffy and her new friends go to a party.  Origins  Writer Joss Whedon says that \\"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress was really the first incarnation of the Buffy concept, just the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary.\\" This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \\"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\\"Billson, Anne, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics). British Film Institute (December 5, 2005), pp. 24‚Äì25. Whedon wanted \\"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero.\\" He explained, \\"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\\"Gottlieb, Allie, \\"Buffy's Angels\\", Metroactive.com (September 26, 2002). The idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role. The director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, saw it as a \\"pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires.\\"Havens, Candace, Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p. 51. Fran Kuzui also discussed Buffy in Golden, Christopher, & Holder, Nancy, Watcher's Guide Vol. 1. Simon & Schuster (October 1, 1998), pp. 247‚Äì248. Whedon disagreed: \\"I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing.\\"Havens, Candace, Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p. 23. The script was praised within the industry,Brundage, James, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" film review . Filmcritic.com (1999). An example of the praise given to the script and dialogue behind the Buffy movie. but the movie was not. Several years later, Gail Berman, a Fox executive, approached Whedon to develop his Buffy concept into a television series.Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, Watcher's Guide Vol. 1. Simon & Schuster (October 1, 1998), pp. 249‚Äì250 Whedon explained that \\"They said, 'Do you want to do a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie.' And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy, and that's how I sold it.\\"'Said, SF', \\"Interview with Joss Whedon by SF Said \\", Shebytches.com (2005). The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood. Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute non-broadcast pilotTopping, Keith \\"Slayer\\". Virgin Publishing, (December 1, 2004), p. 7 that was shown to networks and eventually sold to The WB Television Network. The latter promoted the premiere with a series of History of the Slayer clips,\\"Television Obscurities - Buffy, The Vampire Slayer: Forgotten Premiere Trailer\\" Tvobscurities.com (July 16, 2003). and the first episode aired on March 10, 1997. Whedon declared in June 2003 that the non-broadcast pilot would not be included with DVDs of the series, stating that it \\"sucks on ass.\\"  Cast and characters  = Main cast = * Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers * Nicholas Brendon as Xander Harris * Alyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg * Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase * Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles = Recurring cast = = Guest cast = * Elizabeth Anne Allen as Amy Madison * Dean Butler as Hank Summers  Crew  Series creator Joss Whedon served as executive producer and showrunner. David Greenwalt joined the series as co-executive producer as 20th Century Fox wanted an experienced television producer as Whedon had never run a television series before. Whedon wrote the most episodes, writing three and the original pilot, as well as writing the story for a further two. Greenwalt wrote three episodes, devising two of the stories himself and working his third script for the season from a story by Whedon. Story editors Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali wrote two episodes and the other pair of story editors, Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer wrote one episode. Staff writers Ashley Gable and Thomas A. Swyden wrote one episode and wrote the teleplay for another from a story by Whedon. Dana Reston also wrote a freelance script. Bruce Seth Green directed the largest number of episodes in the first season, directing three episodes, followed by Whedon, who directed two, the original unaired pilot and his broadcast directional debut with the season finale \\"Prophecy Girl\\".  Episodes   Reception  On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 80 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Rotten Tomatoes gave season one a score of 92% with an average rating of 8 out of 10 based on 26 reviews with a critics' consensus stating, \\"Buffy slays her way into the pop- culture lexicon in a debut season that lays the groundwork for one of TV's greatest supernatural teen dramas.\\" The pilot episode, \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Makeup for a Series.

Goals  The goal of the ACE network is to provide knowledge to people working in the field elections, with the intention of supporting credible and transparent electoral processes with emphasis on sustainability, professionalism and trust.  The ACE Website  Most activities of the ACE network are carried out through the ACE website. The website is divided into a number of sections: * Elections today contains information on current affairs in elections, such as news articles, upcoming events and an election calendar. * Encyclopaedia presents texts and articles on a number of electoral topics (for example Electoral Systems or Elections and Technology). * Comparative Data provides statistics (graphs, pie charts etc.) and data on election- related topics. * Electoral Materials is a virtual library with sample materials (ballot papers, electoral laws, publications etc.) from different countries. * Support and Advice holds information on areas of electoral support (election observation and assistance) and links to the ACE expert network. * Regions and Countries is a portal page for region- or country- specific information. * About ACE has more information about the ACE network and its structure. The full website is fully available in English while much content is also available in Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian.  The ACE Experts  Part of ACE is the Practitioners' Networkhttp://aceproject.org/about-en/practitioners2019-network ‚Äì an online community of experts in the field of elections. The members of the Practitioners‚Äô Network share a private online platform where they discuss electoral issues, exchange experiences and connect to fellow experts.

History  The ACE network was created in 1998 as the ACE (Administration and Cost of Elections) Project by International IDEA, IFES and UNDESA. At this time, the project focused solely on election administration with the aim to create an encyclopaedia with texts on how to administer electoral processes. However, the project developed further into a more interactive network with a focus wider than just electoral administration. In 2006, to reflect the new identity of the project, the name was changed to the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network (with the letters ACE no longer standing for Administration and Cost of Elections).  Organisation  ACE is a collaboration between nine Partner Organisations: The Carter Center, International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa (EISA), Elections Canada, the Federal Electoral Institute of Mexico (IFE), International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) and the UN agencies UNDESA, UNDP and UNEAD. The European Commission is an ex officio member. The highest decision-making body of ACE is the Steering Board, consisting of representatives from the Partner Organisations. The day-to-day management of the project is carried out by the ACE Secretariat, currently hosted by International IDEA. The Secretariat is assisted in its tasks by the Programme Advisory Board with representatives from the ACE Partner Organisations.

The first 13 episodes aired on Mondays at 9:00 pm ET, beginning with episode 14 the series moved to Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET, a timeslot the series would occupy for the rest of its run. The emotional stakes are raised in season two. New vampires Spike and Drusilla come to town along with the new slayer, Kendra Young, who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the season one finale. Xander becomes involved with Cordelia, while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and Daniel \\"Oz\\" Osbourne, who becomes a werewolf after being bitten by a young cousin who just happens to be a werewolf. Buffy and the vampire Angel develop a relationship over the course of the season, but Angel's dark past as the evil and sadistic Angelus threatens to destroy Buffy and the world.  Plot  The emotional stakes are raised in season two as Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) returns from a summer in Los Angeles after her death at the end of the first season. After distancing herself from her friends and loved ones with her new, self-centered attitude that almost gets them killed, Buffy comes to terms with the traumatic events that transpired and crushes the bones of The Master (Mark Metcalf) once and for all, much to the annoyance of The Anointed One (Andrew J. Ferchland). A few weeks later two new vampires come to town‚ÄîSpike (James Marsters) and a weakened Drusilla (Juliet Landau)‚Äîwho intend to use the blood of Drusilla's sire, Buffy's new boyfriend and ensouled vampire Angel (David Boreanaz), to restore her to full health when the time is right. Impatient with the ritualistic attitude of the Order of Aurelius, Spike kills the Anointed One and becomes the more informal leader of Sunnydale's vampire society. Meanwhile, love is in the air for the members of the Scooby Gang as Buffy and Angel fall deeply in love, Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) and Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) begin an unlikely relationship, Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) finds romance in the form of guitarist Daniel \\"Oz\\" Osbourne (Seth Green) and even Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) begins to further his relationship with computer science teacher turned techno-pagan Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte). Although after a visit by Giles' long lost friend Ethan Rayne (Robin Sachs) and the return of a powerful demon they used to worship in their youth, Jenny distances herself from Giles because she fears the dangerous life he leads. In \\"What's My Line\\" the time has come for Drusilla's ritual. Angel is captured by Spike after he summons a horde of bounty hunters called the Order of Taraka to attempt to eliminate Buffy. Meanwhile, a new Slayer shows up in town, Kendra (Bianca Lawson), who appears to be of Caribbean origin, sent to Sunnydale by her Watcher under the pretense of a very dark power rising up at the Hellmouth. Buffy and Kendra are forced to work together in order to rescue Angel and stop Spike's plan. Although they do save Angel's life and stop the Order, Drusilla is still returned to full strength while Spike is crippled by Buffy's assault. Kendra returns to her home as Buffy reaches a new appreciation for her destiny as a slayer. During Buffy's 17th birthday, Drusilla and Spike resurrect a powerful demon called \\"The Judge\\" (Brian Thompson) who can burn the humanity out of people and who claims to be invincible. After Buffy and Angel escape from his attack, the two finally consummate their relationship which brings Angel \\"a moment of perfect happiness\\" and ends up costing him his soul. Buffy wakes up in Angel's bed the following morning alone and frets about his disappearance. Later she returns to his apartment where he torments her about giving up her virginity to him. Buffy is left emotionally devastated and suffers further betrayal after she learns that Jenny Calendar is of Romani origin and was sent to Sunnydale in order to prevent Angel from losing his soul, a mission in which she failed. Angel, now Angelus, joins forces with Spike and Drusilla as they intend to use the judge to wipe humanity off the Earth. The Scooby Gang show up to stop them and Buffy uses a rocket launcher to kill the judge and halt the vampire's plan. She then fights one on one with Angel for the first time but cannot kill him. Instead she forcibly kicks him in the testicles and leaves. Meanwhile, Willow finds out about Xander and Cordelia's relationship and falls out with Xander as a result, while Giles' relationship with Jenny is shattered due to her betrayal. Over the next few months, Buffy readies herself for the day when she will finally have to slay Angelus and is given further incentive after Angelus murders Jenny Calendar soon after she figures out the incantation needed to restore Angel's soul. Giles is left emotionally shattered having just mended the relationship between him and Jenny and is traumatized when he finds her lifeless body in his bed, a gift left by Angelus. He attempts to take his revenge on Angelus but is saved by Buffy who claims she can't fight her mission on her own. Meanwhile, Xander and Cordelia, and Willow and Oz, now a werewolf after being bitten by his young cousin, officially begin dating and both Cordy and Oz become genuine members of the Scooby Gang. Willow also begins teaching Ms. Calendar's computer science class due to her extremely high aptitude and subsequently becomes interested in Jenny's notes and websites devoted to magic while Spike becomes increasingly jealous over Angelus and Drusilla's apparently sexual relationship while he is left crippled in his wheelchair. In \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\" it turns out that Spike is in fact ambulatory and that he is hatching a plan of his own to take his revenge on Angelus and win Drusilla back. During the season finale, Buffy and Willow come across the spell Jenny was working on just prior to her death. While they deliberate on what is to be done, Kendra returns to Sunnydale by word of her watcher who claims that a dark power is once again rising at the Hellmouth. This power turns out to be the stone statue of the powerful demon Acathla who, once upon a time, attempted to swallow the world into Hell. Angelus hatches a plan to awaken Acathla once again and destroy the world. After he fails to awaken the demon however, Angelus sends a team led by Drusilla to kidnap Giles while he calls Buffy out to distract her. As Giles is taken away, Willow is left comatose, Xander's arm is broken and Drusilla kills Kendra. Buffy returns to the library to find the police waiting for her. She flees their attack and makes it to the hospital to find her friends. When no one can find Giles, she goes to his house where she finds a demon named Whistler (Max Perlich). He tells her that what happened with Acathla wasn't meant to go the way it did ‚Äî Angel is in fact the key that will re-open Acathla but the Powers that Be thought that Angel's destiny was to stop him. Drusilla uses her psychic powers to trick Giles into giving Angelus this information after Angelus sadistically tortured the watcher. Meanwhile, Willow awakens from her coma after a proclamation of love from best friend Xander and adamantly decides to try to perform the ritual of restoration to return Angel's soul. Spike joins forces with Buffy to help take down Angelus while Buffy's mom, Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland), finally figures out the truth about her destined daughter. As Buffy leaves to retrieve a mystical sword brought to Sunnydale by Kendra, Joyce tells Buffy never to come back. Sunnydale High School Principal Snyder (Armin Shimerman) expels Buffy from Sunnydale High. With nothing left, Buffy storms Angelus' mansion while Xander aids a weakened Giles. Buffy is too late, even with Spike's help (who takes Drusilla out of the fray). Angelus uses his blood to reawaken Acathla. As Buffy and Angelus compete in an epic sword fight, Acathla begins to swallow the earth. Meanwhile, Willow successfully performs the powerful spell after she is overcome by an unknown mystical energy. As Angel's soul is returned, Buffy has one chance to save the world and, after kissing him and proclaiming that she loves him, runs the magical sword through Angel's chest, who is then swallowed by the portal, closing it for good. Left utterly devastated, Buffy flees Sunnydale.

Early history Ground-breaking ceremonies for the synagogue took place on February 27, 1956. EMJC began with 115 founding members. Harry W. Goldin was a co-founder, President, and Chairman of the synagogue's board of trustees, and Sidney Feld was a founder and President as well.Miami Herald, November 23, 2004, retrieved July 29, 2010 Dr. Israel Nobel was Rabbi of the synagogue in its early days (and subsequently Rabbi Emeritus), and Rabbi Irvin Beigel served at EMJC for four years in the 1980s. Paul Carus was a cantor at the synagogue in its early years, as was David Tauber. In the early 1960s, Melvin May was its Assistant Executive Director. In the late 1980s, synagogue members protested against Soviet human rights violations. Recent history Ronald L. Androphy has been the rabbi of the synagogue since September 1983. After an alleged racial assault in East Meadow in 1989 in which a white East Meadow man was charged with beating two black teenagers with a golf club, the rabbi joined other local clerics, who said they were motivated by their conscience and felt an obligation to lead the community, in speaking out against the violence. Androphy focused on promoting greater understanding among religious groups. The synagogue's rabbi stressed the significance of the positive relationship the synagogue had with the local Methodist community. After David Levinton, a 12-year-old Jewish boy who had been a member of the EMJC, died, the local Methodist church's congregation honored the child. It voted to replace a tree that had fallen down on the church property, and dedicate the new tree to Levinton and to another non- Methodist boy in the community who had also died. In doing so, it voted down proposals to dedicate the tree to Theodore Roosevelt, Jack Kennedy, or Harry Truman. In 2001, Charles O'Shea, a Nassau County assessor, began to enforce an 1896 New York State law requiring that special tax assessments be paid on homes bought by synagogues and churches for their rabbis and ministers. At the same time, New York State law provided houses of worship with a tax exemption on property used for religious purposes. Androphy observed: > There is a long history in this country of a separation of church and state, > and the exemption of religious property from taxes. I think it's a dangerous > precedent to set, because if the government can assess taxes for one > purpose, what is to prevent it from assessing taxes on church and synagogue > property in general? My great fear is that down the line governments might > assume that the right to tax gives them the right to regulate. That would be > an extremely dangerous breakdown of the separation of church and state. Activities and membership In addition to providing prayer services, the synagogue has a nursery school, a Hebrew school, a men's club, a sisterhood, and a youth group. As of 2009, the synagogue had nine torahs. As of 2010, Ken Martin was EMJC's President, Scott Goodman was its Chairman of the Board, Shira Ornstein was the Principal of its Hebrew school, and Silvia Kogan was the Director of its nursery school. Judge Fred J. Hirsh, of the Nassau County District Court, was the EMJC Men's Club Man of the Year in 1997. Rabbi In 2000, EMJC's Androphy became President of the Long Island Board of Rabbis. He is also President of the East Meadow Clergy Association, a member of the Board of Governors of the New York Board of Rabbis, past Chairman of the Rabbinic Advisory Committee of the UJA Federation of Long Island, and past President of the Rabbinical Assembly of Nassau-Suffolk (a group of Conservative rabbis; he is also Chief Judge of its conversion court).

Location The museum is located alongside the Killhope Burn, about 4 km upstream from Cowshill, and is accessible via the A689 road between Stanhope, County Durham and Alston, Cumbria. It is situated in the heart of the North Pennines, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, an area that, in 2003, was designated the first Geopark in Great Britain. The museum is open every day between 1 April and 31 October, but is closed (except to pre-booked groups) during the winter months, when weather conditions in the area can be severe. A bus service operates through Weardale; services usually terminate at Cowshill, but some summer services will continue to Killhope on request.

Until the mid-19th century, exploitation of these ore bodies was mostly confined to surface excavations and vertical shafts. From 1818, mining in the area was controlled by W B Lead Co, a mining company established by the Blacketts, a prominent Newcastle family which had leased mining rights in Weardale from the Bishop of Durham. In 1853, W B Lead began driving the Park Level Mine, which eventually intersected 11 mineral veins. As the mine developed, so did the surface workings. In 1858, a \\"mineshop\\" was built to accommodate the miners; the population density in such a remote area was very low and, until then, miners had been faced with a long daily walk to and from the mine. In 1862, storage bays (\\"bouse teams\\") were constructed, to store the raw lead ore (the \\"bouse\\"), and washing rakes were installed, in which water was used to separate the lead ore in the bouse from the waste material. In 1878, soon after the mine struck the richest of the veins, the Park Level Mill was brought into operation, to speed up the process of washing the ore. The main feature of the mill was a large waterwheel, the \\"Killhope Wheel\\". Not long after the Park Level Mill came into use, the price of lead plummeted, rendering lead-mining in Weardale uneconomic and, in 1883, W B Lead closed all of its operations in the district. The Park Level Mine was taken over by another company, Weardale Lead, which continued to operate it until 1910, when production ceased. The mine was re-opened briefly in 1916, during the First World War, after which it lay derelict for over 60 years, during which time the buildings crumbled and any equipment that could be removed was salvaged for scrap. Between 1818 and 1883, records show that W B Lead extracted over 31,200 tonnes of lead concentrates from the Killhope operations; between 1884 and 1916, Weardale Lead extracted a further 9,000 tonnes. Taking in the period before 1818, for which there are no records, it is thought that total output from Killhope may have exceeded 60,000 tonnes. In addition, 180 tonnes of zinc concentrates were recovered in the 1950s by treatment of some of the waste material. Reconstruction The mine as it appeared in 1988 By 1980, the Killhope Wheel was facing demolition, the washing floor had become a marshy field, and the rest of the site was decaying. In that year, the Durham County Council took over the site and began a programme of restoration. First to be restored was the \\"mineshop\\", which was opened to the public in May 1984. The Killhope Wheel was restored to working order in 1991 and the mine itself was opened in 1996. It had been hoped that the existing mine could be restored to allow access by the public, but though the Park Level was found to be generally in sound condition, and the first 100 metres has been used as an access route, the area in the vicinity of the first vein workings was badly collapsed and unsafe. Reconstruction therefore consisted of constructing a new 'artificial' mine within a chamber that was excavated from the surface. Within this artificial mine, the rock surfaces are actually fibreglass casts, taken not just from Killhope but also from mines in the Nenthead district in nearby Cumbria. Despite their artificial nature, the casts faithfully represent the appearance and texture of the real rock. Killhope Wheel The Killhope Wheel One of the main features of the reconstructed mine is the Killhope Wheel, a 10-metre-diameter metal waterwheel. This was constructed by the Tyneside firm of William Armstrong. Although other waterwheels were used in and around the mine, this was the largest, and the only one to survive the decades of neglect. It has now been restored to full working order. Awards The museum has won several awards: it was the North East's Small Visitor Attraction of the Year in 2008, and was the inaugural winner of the Guardian's Family- Friendly Museum award in 2004. Other lead mining remains in the area Other interpretive sites in the area are the Heritage Centre at Allenheads, in Northumberland, and the Nenthead Mines Heritage Centre, a short distance away in Cumbria. Numerous traces of Weardale's lead mining industry can still be seen and the Durham Dales Centre in Stanhope produces guides to a Lead Mining Trail that covers many of the more accessible sites.

However, episode 18 \\"Earshot\\" did not air until September 21, 1999, shortly before the season 4 premiere. The show maintained its previous time slot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. \\"Earshot\\" and \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\", were delayed in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre because of their content. Plot After attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) returns to Sunnydale in season three, and is reunited with her friends and her mother. She is no longer a criminal suspect, but Principal Snyder, who took vindictive pleasure in expelling Buffy, refuses to reinstate her until he is told down by Giles. Angel (David Boreanaz) is resurrected mysteriously by the unseen Powers That Be.Ruditis, Paul and Gallagher, Diana G. Angel: The Casefiles Vol. 2. p. 4. While Buffy is happy to have Angel back, he seems to have lost much of his sanity in Hell. Buffy helps Angel recover but, having seen Angel's demonic side, Buffy's friends distrust him until he saves them from a monster. Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) is fired from the Watchers' Council because he has developed a \\"father's love\\" for Buffy, and towards the end of the season Buffy announces that she will also no longer work for the Council. Early in the season she is confronted with an unstable Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku), who was activated after Kendra's death near the end of season two. Angel, after getting his soul back, is once again tormented by his guilt and personally by an entity called the First Evil, who takes credits of bringing Angel back for wicked intents and goads him into attempting suicide. Though Buffy is unable to prevent Angel from killing himself, the Powers That Be intervene and convince Angel that he has a greater purpose. Although the First is still out there, the antagonist of the season is shown to be the affable Mayor Richard Wilkins (Harry Groener), who is near completion of his plan to \\"ascend\\" to become a giant snake-like demon ‚Äì having already gained immortality through a Faustian bargain with demons when he founded Sunnydale a century ago. The final step is to be a massacre of students on Sunnydale High's graduation day. Although Faith works with Buffy at first, after accidentally killing a human, Faith becomes irrational and sides with Mayor Wilkins, whose charismatic behavior influences Faith's dark side. She helps Wilkins in his plan, and eventually she poisons Angel. The only antidote for the poison is the blood of a Slayer, so Buffy tries to grab Faith to feed her to Angel. Faith, though severely wounded, jumps from her roof onto a passing truck, out of Buffy's reach. Buffy is forced to let Angel drink from her, putting her in a brief coma. Wilkins, who had a fatherly affection for Faith, gets angry and attempts to suffocate her, but is stopped by Angel. During her time in a coma, Buffy shares a dream with Faith where they make peace. At the climax of the season, Wilkins speaks at the graduation ceremony, as the time for his transformation has come and he finally morphs into the demon Olvikan. He eats Principal Snyder and kills several others; but Buffy and her friends have organized the graduating students to fight back against Wilkins and his vampires. (A solar eclipse allows Angel and other vampires to be out in daytime.) Buffy confronts the demon, taunting him about Faith. She lures the provoked Mayor into the library which has many explosives. The explosion destroys Wilkins in his Olvikan form, as well as the school. Meanwhile, Angel becomes convinced that Buffy's love for him will be bad for her in the long run. After the battle with the Mayor, he leaves Sunnydale, leading to the spin-off series in Los Angeles. Cordelia also leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season in order to attempt an acting career in L.A., though later becomes a major character on the spin-off.

It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. Beginning with this season, the character of Angel was given his own series, which aired on The WB following Buffy. Various Buffy characters made appearances in Angel, including Buffy herself; Cordelia Chase, formerly a regular in Buffy, and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who appeared in Buffy season three.  Plot  Season four sees Buffy and Willow enroll at UC Sunnydale while Xander joins the workforce. The vampire Spike, having been left by Drusilla, returns to Sunnydale and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus, led by Maggie Walsh. They implant a microchip in his head which prevents him from harming humans. He reluctantly helps the Scooby Gang throughout the season and eventually begins to fight on their side after learning that he can harm other demons. But Buffy and her friends don't trust him except Willow who opts to give him a chance to redeem himself, which they eventually do. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf and after a horrific encounter with The Initiative. Willow falls in love with Tara Maclay, another witch. They begin a relationship. Another focus of the season is Xander's relationship with a former vengeance demon named Anya Jenkins, who becomes infatuated with him due to him making her feel human and Xander returns these feelings as she makes him feel like a man. Anya tries to get Xander off her mind but their feelings are developed and they begin a relationship. Buffy begins dating Riley Finn, a grad student who she later discovers is a member of The Initiative. He tries to get her recruited but she becomes an object of negative attention from Maggie Walsh. Walsh believes Buffy to be a bad influence to Riley, threatening his ties with The Initiative. After Buffy and Riley's first sexual encounter, Walsh tries to get Buffy killed, which causes Riley to cut ties with Walsh and The Initiative. The Initiative's more sinister secret purpose is revealed when its composite demonic cyborg, Adam, kills Walsh, escapes and rampages through the town. After getting Spike to temporarily work for him, Adam plots to create others like him to overthrow humanity, though Adam sees Riley as a \\"brother\\". Buffy and her allies unite to defeat Adam and destroy The Initiative. The demons and other supernatural creatures fight back against their former captors, while the Scoobies temporarily transfer all their skills into Buffy to fight the physically superior Adam. Magically enhanced, she kills Adam by ripping out his uranium core. Soon The Initiative is defeated and the Scoobies recover. The government recognizes that Maggie Walsh's plan is a failure, and orders her project to be terminated. The Scoobies later encounter the spirit of The First Slayer, who gives Buffy a cryptic message.

Episodes  = Crossovers with Angel = Beginning with this season, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-off Angel both aired on The WB Television Network. Both shows aired on Tuesdays, Buffy at 8:00 PM ET, and Angel at 9:00 PM ET. The fourth season of Buffy aired along with the first season of Angel. Both shows featured crossover episodes, in which characters of one series appeared in the other. Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), who had been introduced in Buffy, became main characters in the spinoff series. The first crossover appeared in the premiere episodes, where Angel calls Buffy but doesn't say anything; on Buffy, she is seen answering the phone. After the events of \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\", Oz (Seth Green) visits Los Angeles in the Angel episode \\"In the Dark\\" to give Angel the Gem of Amara (a ring that makes vampires unkillable), and Spike (James Marsters) follows him. In the Angel episode \\"Bachelor Party\\", Doyle (Glenn Quinn) has a vision of Buffy in danger. This causes Angel to secretly visit Sunnydale in the episode \\"Pangs\\", to protect her. After learning that he was in town, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) visits L.A. in the Angel episode \\"I Will Remember You\\" to express her displeasure in his not telling her that he was there. Buffy season three recurring character Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) makes his first appearance on Angel in \\"Parting Gifts\\" and would become a series regular in the next episode for the remainder of the series. After the events of the two-part episode \\"This Year's Girl\\" and \\"Who Are You\\", Faith (Eliza Dushku) leaves Sunnydale and goes to L.A. in the Angel two-part episode \\"Five by Five\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" and is hired by Wolfram & Hart to kill Angel. Buffy makes her second and final appearance on Angel in \\"Sanctuary\\". Angel visits Sunnydale again in \\"The Yoko Factor\\" to apologize to Buffy after the way he treated her in \\"Sanctuary\\". Angel meets Buffy's new boyfriend, Riley Finn (Marc Blucas). The vampire Darla (Julie Benz), who was killed in Buffy episode \\"Angel\\", is resurrected by Wolfram & Hart in the Angel season one finale, \\"To Shanshu in L.A.\\", and subsequently becomes a recurring character there.  Reception  The fourth season averaged 5.1 million viewers. The season received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series for \\"Beer Bad\\", Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series (Michael Gershman) for \\"Hush\\", and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Joss Whedon) for \\"Hush\\". The season was nominated for two Television Critics Association Awards, for Outstanding Achievement in Drama and Program of the Year. In particular, the episode \\"Hush\\" was highly praised when it aired. Robert Bianco from USA Today comments, \\"(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues to find new ways to make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure.\\" Alan Sepinwall in The Star-Ledger calls it a \\"magnificently daring episode\\", explaining \\"(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when Buffy has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members‚Äîparticularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow‚Äîproving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians.\\" In the New York Daily News, David Bianculli states that the episode is \\"a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series.\\" Robert Hanks from The Independent in the UK writes that \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights\\" with \\"Hush\\". Noel Murray in The A.V. Club calls it an \\"episode unlike any other, with a lusher score and some of the most genuinely disturbing imagery I‚Äôve yet seen on Buffy.\\" The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it \\"scans just like one of those listless dreams in which you try to scream, and can't. Everybody's had 'em‚Äîand yet the way the eerie quiet of 'Hush' sucks you in, you feel as if the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own.\\" Following the series finale in 2003, \\"Hush\\" continued to receive praise. Lisa Rosen in the Los Angeles Times states that the episode is \\"one of TV's most terrifying hours\\". Smashing Magazine counted \\"Hush\\" as one of the top ten television episodes that inspire creativity. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad named it the best Buffy episode in the series, writing \\"(i)f someone who had never seen Buffy (blasphemy!) asked me to show them just one episode of the show to get them hooked, this would be it\\". TV.com named it as the fourth most frightening episode in television history. The Futon Critic named \\"Restless\\" the best episode of 2000. Rotten Tomatoes gave season four a score of 67% with an average rating of 7 out of 10 based on 15 reviews. The site's critics consensus states, \\"Buffy enters its fourth season on shaky ground but finishes with a surprisingly satisfying season finale.\\"  DVD release  Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Fourth Season was released on DVD in region 1 on June 10, 2003 and in region 2 on May 13, 2002.

On modern Macs the startup chime is disabled by default, with the exception of the 2017 MacBook Air.About Mac startup tones Apple. November 8, 2018. Retrieved February 23, 2020  Startup chime  The Macintosh startup chime is played on power-up, before trying to boot an operating system. The sound indicates that diagnostic tests run immediately at startup have found no hardware or fundamental software problems. The specific sound differs depending on the ROM, which greatly varies depending on Macintosh model. The first sound version in the first three Macintosh models is a simple square-wave \\"beep\\", and all subsequent sounds are various chords. Mark Lentczner created the software that plays the arpeggiated chord in the Macintosh II. Variations of this sound were deployed until Jim Reekes created the startup chime in the Quadra 700 through the Quadra 800.Whitwell, Tom (May 26, 2005) \\"Tiny Music Makers: Pt 4: The Mac Startup Sound\\", Music Thing Reekes said, \\"The startup sound was done in my home studio on a Korg Wavestation EX. It's a C major chord, played with both hands stretched out as wide as possible (with 3rd at the top, if I recall).\\" He created the sound as he was annoyed with the tri- tone startup chimes because they were too associated with the death chimes and the computer crashes. He recalls that Apple did not give him permission to change the sound but that he secretly snuck the sound into the computers with the help of engineers who were in charge of the ROM chips. When Apple discovered this, he refused to change it, using various claims in order to keep the new sound intact. He is also the creator of the iconic (or \\"earconic\\", as he calls it) \\"bong\\" startup chime in most Macintoshes since the Quadra 840AV. A slightly lower-pitched version of this chime is in all PCI- based Power Macs until the iMac G3. The Macintosh LC, LC II, and Macintosh Classic II do not use the Reekes chime, instead using an F major chord that just produces a \\"ding\\" sound. The first generation of Power Macintosh computers also do not use the Reekes chime, instead using a chord strummed on a Yamaha 12-string acoustic guitar by jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan. Further, the Power Macintosh 5200‚Äì6300 computers (excluding the 5400 and 5500, which have the \\"bong\\" chime like the one in the PCI-based Power Macs) use a unique chime, which is also in the television commercials for the Power Macintosh and PowerBook series from 1995 until 1998, and the 20th Anniversary Macintosh uses another unique sound. For models built prior to the introduction of the Power Macintosh in 1994, the failure of initial self-diagnostic tests results in a Sad Mac icon, an error code, and distinctive Chimes of Death sounds. The chime for all Mac computers from 1998-2016 is the same chime used first in the iMac G3. The chord is a F-sharp major chord, and was produced by pitch-shifting the 840AV's sound. The Mac startup chime is now a registered trademark in the United States, and is featured in the 2008 Pixar film WALL-E when the titular robot character is fully recharged by solar panels as well as in the 2007 Brad Paisley song \\"Online\\".Apple Sound Designer on Iconic Startup Sound.

The startup chime is disabled on newer Macs, but a new, lower-pitched chime is hidden on 2018 and newer model Macs that possess a T2 Security Chip, again requiring the terminal command to enable. The startup chime is officially restored in macOS Big Sur, which allows it to be enabled or disabled in System Preferences.  Happy Mac  A small, rectangular icon depicting a gray computer emblazoned with a colourful apple logo, and a floppy-disk slot. On its small square screen is a smiley-face emoticon against a lilac background. The icon indicates that the machine has successfully begun booting, in contrast to a \\"Sad Mac\\" icon, which displays a \\"sad\\" emoticon. The splash screen under Mac OS 8. The \\"Welcome to Macintosh\\" screen seen in System 7.5 and earlier. A Happy Mac is the normal bootup (startup) icon of an Apple Macintosh computer running older versions of the Mac operating system. It was designed by Susan Kare in the 1980s, drawing inspiration from the design of the Compact Macintosh series and from the Batman character Two-Face. The icon remained unchanged until the introduction of New World ROM Macs, when it was updated to 8-bit color. The Happy Mac indicates that booting has successfully begun, whereas a Sad Mac (along with the \\"Chimes of Death\\" melody or one or more beeps) indicates a hardware problem. When a Macintosh boots into the classic Mac OS (Mac OS 9 or lower), the system will play its startup chime, the screen will turn gray, and the Happy Mac icon will appear, followed by the Mac OS splash screen (or the small \\"Welcome to Macintosh\\" screen in System 7.5 and earlier), which underwent several stylistic changes. Mac OS versions 8.6 and later also includes the version number in this splash screen (for example, \\"Welcome to Mac OS 8.6\\"). On early Macs that had no internal hard drive, the computer boots up to a point where it needs to load the operating system from a floppy disk. Until the user inserts the correct disk, the Mac displays a floppy icon with a blinking question mark. In later Macs, a folder icon with a question mark that repeatedly changes to the Finder icon is shown if a System Folder or boot loader file cannot be found on the startup disk. With the introduction of Mac OS X, in addition to the blinking system folder icon, a prohibition icon was added to show an incorrect OS version is found. The bomb screen in the classic Mac OS was replaced with a kernel panic, which was originally colored white but was changed to black in version 10.3. With Mac OS X 10.1, a new Happy Mac was included. This is also the last version that had a Happy Mac icon; in version 10.2, the Happy Mac symbol was replaced with the Apple logo. In OS X Lion 10.7, the Apple logo was slightly shrunk and modified. In OS X Yosemite 10.10, the white screen with a gray Apple logo was replaced with a black screen with a white Apple logo and the spinning wheel was replaced with a loading bar. However, this only applies to Macs from 2013 and later, including the 2012 Retina MacBook Pros, and requires a firmware update to be applied. All earlier Macs still use the old screen. The shadow on the Apple logo was removed in OS X El Capitan 10.11. In 2016+ Macs, the Apple logo appears immediately when the screen turns on. The Face ID logo for the iPhone X was based on the Happy Mac.  Sad Mac  One version of the Sad Mac icon, this one indicating that an illegal instruction occurred. A Sad Mac is a symbol in older-generation Apple Macintosh computers (hardware using the Old World ROM and not Open Firmware, which are those predating onboard USB), starting with the original 128K Macintosh and ending with the last NuBus-based Power Macintosh models (including the first-generation 6100, 7100, 8100, as well as the PowerBook 5300 and 1400), to indicate a severe hardware or software problem that prevented startup from occurring successfully. The Sad Mac icon is displayed, along with a set of hexadecimal codes that indicate the type of problem at startup. Different codes are for different errors. This is in place of the normal Happy Mac icon, which indicates that the startup-time hardware tests were successful. In 68k models made after the Macintosh II, the Chimes of Death are played. Models prior to the Macintosh II crash silently and display the Sad Mac, without playing any tone. PowerPC Macs play a sound effect of a car crash, and computers equipped with the PowerPC upgrade card use the three note brass fanfare death chime (A, E-natural, and E-flat), followed by the sound of a drum, same as the Macintosh Performa 6200 and Macintosh Performa 6300. A Sad Mac may be deliberately generated at startup by pressing the interrupt switch on Macintosh computers that had one installed, or by pressing Command and Power keys shortly after the startup chime. On some Macintoshes such as PowerBook 540c, if the user presses the command and power keys before the boot screen displays, it will play the \\"chimes of death\\". The chimes are a fraction of normal speed and there is no Sad Mac displayed. Old World ROM Power Macintosh and PowerBook models based on the PCI architecture do not use a Sad Mac icon and will instead only play the error/car-crash sound on a hardware failure (such as missing or bad memory, unusable CPU, or similar). Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar and later instead use the Universal \\"no\\" symbol to denote a hardware or software error that renders the computer non-bootable. = Sad iPod = A small greyscale sketch of a portable music player in icon form, with a \\"sad\\" emoticon on its screen, signifying that some kind of an error has occurred. To the left of the device is a black-and-white \\"warning triangle\\" with an exclamation mark. On the iPod, if damage or an error occurs in the hardware or the firmware, for example, if its files are deleted, a Sad iPod appears. This is similar to the Sad Mac, but instead of a Macintosh, there is an iPod, and there are no chimes of death. The icon also lacks a nose, and the frown is flipped horizontally. It also does not show hexadecimal codes indicating what problem occurred in the iPod. This error screen will not show up when a problem occurs in the newer iPods.  Chimes of Death  The Chimes of Death are the Macintosh equivalent of a beep code on IBM PC compatibles. On all Macintosh models predating the adoption of PCI and Open Firmware, the Chimes of Death are often accompanied by a Sad Mac icon in the middle of the screen. Different Macintosh series have different death chimes. The Macintosh II is the first to use the death chimes, a loud and eerie upward major arpeggio, with different chimes on many models. The Macintosh Quadra, Centris, Performa, LC, and the Macintosh Classic play a generally softer and lower pitched version of the upward major arpeggio, followed by three or four notes, with slight variation depending on the model of the Macintosh. The PowerBook 5300, 190, and 1400 use the second half of the 8-note arpeggio as found on the Quadra and Centris models, or the entire death chime if the error occurs before the screen lights up. The Macintosh Quadra 660AV and Centris 660AV use a sound of a single pass of Roland D-50's \\"Digital Native Dance\\" sample loop, and the NuBus based Power Macintosh models (including 6100, 7100, and 8100) series use a car crash sound. The Power Macintosh and Performa 6200 and 6300 series, along with the Power Macintosh upgrade card, use an eerily dramatic 3-note brass fanfare with a rhythm of drums and cymbals. The pre-G3 PCI Power Macs, the beige G3 Power Macs, the G3 All-In-One, and the PowerBook 2400, 3400, and G3 all use a sound of glass shattering; these models do not display a Sad Mac icon. Since the introduction of the iMac in 1998, the Chimes of Death are no longer used in favor of a series of tones to indicate hardware errors.

Palamuse is best known for being depicted in the Oskar Luts' 1912‚Äì1913 novel Spring (Kevade) as the settlement called \\"Paunvere\\". The 1969 film adaptation Spring was also filmed in Palamuse. His brother, filmmaker Theodor Luts (1896-1980) was born in Palamuse. Palamuse was first mentioned in a letter by Pope Gregory IX on 20 November 1234. The settlement evolved around the Palamuse St. Bartholomew's Church which was built in 1234 by the monks of the K√§rkna Abbey. The church was reconstructed in Gothic style in the 15th century. Tower was added in the 19th century. In 1929 the church gained its today's interior.

It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. This was the final season to air on The WB before it moved to UPN; The WB billed the season five finale as \\"The WB series finale\\".  Plot  In the season premiere, the famous vampire Count Dracula makes an appearance in Sunnydale in search of Buffy. He then bites Buffy in the same place where she was bitten by The Master and Angel (\\"Prophecy Girl\\" and \\"Graduation Day\\"). Buffy breaks free from his will and Dracula is defeated and staked. Season five introduces Buffy's younger \\"sister\\", Dawn, who suddenly appears in Buffy's life. Although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Meanwhile, Glorificus, or Glory, a hell-goddess who was exiled from her dimension after a war, has come to Earth. She can only remain there by being connected to her human form; a medical intern called Ben. Glory takes the form of a beautiful young woman, with some of her powers still intact as long as she maintains her strength through draining people of their sanity. She begins searching for a \\"Key\\" that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension by blurring the lines between dimensions, and in the process unleashing Hell on Earth. At the beginning of the season Glory and Ben are vying for control, alternating who possesses the body they share; later the line between them begins to blur and they experience each other's emotions and memories. It is discovered that the Key's protectors had turned the Key into a human biologically related to the Summers‚ÄîBuffy's new sister Dawn. At the same time, they implanted in her family and friends lifelong memories of her. The Watchers' Council, with which Buffy had previously cut ties, aids in Buffy's research of Glory, and the Council reinstates both her and Giles. Due to problems with her mother, Buffy suspects Dawn may be harming Joyce, but they discover that they were caused by a brain tumor. As a result, Buffy, and especially Joyce, begin to accept Dawn as a true part of the family. Upon learning of Joyce's tumor, Buffy leaves her dorm to take care of her mother. Riley leaves early in the season after concluding that Buffy does not love him, joining a military demon-hunting operation, while Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and begins fighting alongside the Scoobies. Buffy continually refuses his advances and alienates him. Xander's girlfriend Anya Jenkins begins to experience deeper human emotions, both negative and positive, such as a love for money. Anya is hired by Giles and works alongside him at The Magic Box. Glory attacks Willow's girlfriend Tara Maclay, draining her of her sanity. In a rage, Willow turns to dark magic in order to gain powers to match Glory's. She vengefully attacks the hell goddess futilely and is nearly killed, but Buffy intervenes. Despite the defeat, this event results in Willow becoming significantly more powerful, but her dependency on magic increases and her personality starts to change in a sinister way. Spike commissions Warren Mears to build a robot version of Buffy, later known as the Buffybot. This greatly angers Buffy, but she soon softens after Spike is tortured by Glory yet refuses to reveal that Dawn is the Key. After this ordeal, Buffy warms up to Spike, promising she will not forget what he has done for her and inviting him back into her life. Near the end of the season, Joyce dies of an aneurysm, devastating Dawn and Buffy. Glory discovers that Dawn is the Key and kidnaps her. In a moment alone, Xander proposes to Anya. Buffy and her friends track Glory and Dawn to a tower built by Glory's minions. At the time of the ritual, Glory uses Dawn's blood to open the portal between dimensions, but she is distracted by the Scoobies' intervention. Willow takes Tara's sanity from Glory and gives it back, severely weakening Glory. After overpowering Glory, Buffy tells her to leave Sunnydale or die. When Glory reverts to Ben, Giles kills Ben to prevent her return. Dawn wants to sacrifice herself to save the world, but Buffy realizes that because she is related to Dawn, her blood can also close the portal. She realizes the meaning of the First Slayer's message‚Äî\\"Death is your gift\\"‚Äîand sacrifices her own life to save Dawn's and close the portal. Buffy's friends mourn her death and praise her with the inscription \\"She saved the world a lot\\".

Both shows retained their timeslots on The WB Television Network, airing on Tuesdays at 8:00 PM ET and 9:00 PM ET respectively. The Buffy episode \\"Fool for Love\\" is a companion to the Angel episode \\"Darla\\". Both episodes feature multiple flashbacks to the history of Spike (James Marsters) and Darla (Julie Benz), shown from their respective viewpoints. Angel (David Boreanaz) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau) also appear in both episodes. Both episodes feature a same scene ‚Äì one from the point of view of Spike and the other from Angelus, Darla, and Drusilla. Buffy recurring character Drusilla makes her first present-tense appearance on Angel in the episode \\"The Trial\\". She returns to Sunnydale in her final present-tense appearance in the episode \\"Crush\\". Angel visits Buffy in the episode \\"Forever\\" to comfort her after he learns that her mother died. Buffy recurring character Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab) visits L.A. in the Angel episode \\"Disharmony\\". Harmony would later appear in the fifth season of Angel and become a main character.

Willow comes to L.A. in the Angel season two finale, \\"There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb\\" to deliver the news to Angel that Buffy had died.  Reception  The series was included in the American Film Institute's list for the best drama series of the year. Sarah Michelle Gellar was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama. Joss Whedon was nominated for a Nebula Award for Best Script for \\"The Body\\". The series was nominated for three Television Critics Association Awards, for Individual Achievement in Drama (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Outstanding Achievement in Drama, and Program of the Year. The episode \\"The Body\\" was particularly highly acclaimed by critics. David Bianculli in the New York Daily News commends the acting abilities of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Michelle Trachtenberg, Alyson Hannigan, and Amber Benson. \\"The Body\\", according to Bianculli is \\"Emmy-worthy ... It also will haunt you‚Äîbut not in the normal way associated with this still- evolving, still-achieving series.\\" Television critic Alesia Redding and editor Joe Vince of the South Bend Tribune write, \\"I was riveted by this show ... This isn't just one of the best Buffy episodes of all time. It's one of the best episodes of TV of all time.\\" Redding adds, \\"If you watch this incredible episode and don't recognize it as great TV, you're hopeless ... A 'fantasy' show delivers the most stark and realistic take on death I've ever seen, deftly depicting how a loved one who dies suddenly becomes 'the body'.\\" Gareth McLean in The Guardian rejected the notion that Buffy is similar to other \\"schmaltzy American teen show(s)\\" like Dawson's Creek: \\"This episode was a brave, honest and wrenching portrayal of death and loss. The way this was handled by Joss Whedon ... was ingenious. Time slowed down and the feeling of numbness was palpable as Buffy and her gang tried to come to terms with Joyce's death.\\" McLean especially appreciated the small details of Buffy protecting Joyce's dignity and the confusion shown by the characters. He concludes, \\"Joyce may be dead but long live Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\" At Salon.com, Joyce Millman wrote, \\"there hasn't been a finer hour of drama on TV this year than ... 'The Body' ... You have to hand it to the writers; Joyce's demise came as a complete surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember the last time I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss.\\" Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it \\"possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none ... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one.\\" The Futon Critic named \\"The Body\\" the best episode of 2001. Entertainment Weekly named \\"The Gift\\" one of TV's best season finales ever. The fifth season averaged 4.5 million viewers. Rotten Tomatoes gave season five a score of 82% with an average rating of 7.5 out of 10 based on 11 reviews with a critics consensus stating, \\"Brilliant, risky and beautiful, Buffy reaches past the missteps of season four to deliver a fresh, unpredictable season that ends with a bang.\\"  DVD release  Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Fifth Season was released on DVD in region 1 on December 9, 2003 and in region 2 on October 28, 2002.

Plot  Matthew Ryan (Harry Treadaway) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital following a breakdown resulting from the disappearance of his younger brother, Tom. Feeling guilty and responsible for Tom's disappearance, he begins to hear Tom's voice and to see him around. He seeks advice from his friend Simon (Tom Felton), the parish priest Adrian Ballan (Alex Jennings), and his new neighbour, Amy Tyler (Ros Leeming). Amy gives him a newspaper clipping about a psychic medium, Shelley Cartwright (Nikki Amuka-Bird), who lives nearby, and suggests that he visit her for help, which he does. Shelley suggests that Tom's ghost is trying to warn Matthew about something, and Shelley's daughter Rebecca (Tyler Anthony) gives him a drawing of a girl. Matthew learns that Simon's younger sister Sophie (Georgia Groome) has also gone missing. He goes to Simon and tells him about Shelley, showing him Rebecca's drawing. They realise that the drawing is of Sophie, but Simon points out that Shelley died in a fire several years previously. Matthew returns to Shelley's flat and finds it burnt out; he realises that it was her ghost that helped him and Rebecca's ghost that gave him the drawing. After spending the night out of the flat, Matthew returns home to find that his father has arranged for him to be re-committed to the psychiatric hospital. He runs away and hides in Shelley's burnt-out flat. While there, he has a vision showing him that it was Tom and Sophie's abductor who burned the flat down with Shelley and Rebecca inside, and he sees the name Ballan scratched on the floor. He realises that the priest is the killer. He runs to the church to search for Tom and Sophie, telling Simon along the way that Ballan is the killer but that he doesn't expect Simon to believe him. He enters the crypt beneath the church and finds Sophie alive but very frightened. He starts to help her but is knocked out by Ballan. Meanwhile, Simon and Matthew's father have come to the church looking for Matthew. Ballan comes out and tells them he hasn't seen Matthew. Matthew's father is satisfied with this answer and leaves, but Simon is suspicious and enters the crypt. Ballan discovers and kills him. When Matthew comes to, he discovers Simon's body and flees, only to encounter Adrian (whose eyes flash red) who mockingly states Tom cried out for his brother, prompting an enraged Matthew to beat him with a rock. Once outside, he collapses and is taken to hospital. When Matthew awakens in hospital, his father is there and tells him that Sophie is safe and sound, and that the bodies of both Tom and the real Adrian Ballan were found in the crypt‚Äîthe killer was an impostor and has escaped, but the police are looking for him. Matthew looks again at the newspaper clipping Amy gave him, which is already several years old as it antedates the fire in Shelley's flat. Below the story about Shelley he sees another story reporting the suicide of a teenager‚Äîhis friend Amy. He realises that it was Amy's ghost who was helping him all along. Tom is buried properly in the churchyard, and Matthew and his father visit his grave; Matthew also visits Amy's grave, which is located not far away in the same cemetery.

It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. This season marked the series' network change from The WB to UPN.  Plot  At the beginning of season six Willow resurrects Buffy with a powerful spell. Although her friends believe that they have taken her out of Hell, Buffy had actually been in Heaven since her death (a fact that is revealed to her friends later in the season). She is therefore traumatized by her resurrection and this causes her to fall into a deep depression for most of the season. Giles returns to England after realizing that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job for money and develops a sexually passionate, but eventually dysfunctional, relationship with Spike. For different reasons, Buffy and Spike are both emotionally tormented by the relationship, and Buffy hides it from her friends. Dawn is happy to have her sister back, but Buffy's depression causes Dawn's feelings of alienation to lead to kleptomania. When a demon briefly traps everyone in the Summers' house, Dawn's feelings are revealed and Buffy promises to help mend their relationship and spend more time together. On the wedding day of Xander and Anya, a magician, seeking his own vengeance against Anya, tricks Xander into calling off the wedding by showing him a false future where they are both miserable. Anya reverts to a vengeance demon once more. When Anya can't find anyone who wishes vengeance on Xander, and after Buffy has broken up with Spike, Anya and Spike seek solace in a one night stand. Willow becomes addicted to magic. Tara becomes concerned and challenges Willow to go a week without magic, but Willow gives in to her addiction, causing Tara to leave her. Despite their separation, Tara is still devoted to helping Willow with her addiction, leading to their reconciliation. They also begin to deal with The Trio, a group of nerds led by Warren Mears who use their technological and magical proficiency to attempt to kill or neutralize Buffy and take over Sunnydale, a goal they had in mind since the beginning of the season. The Trio would often use monsters such as vampires and demons to assist them. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group, and his capacity for evil is demonstrated by the attempted rape of his ex-girlfriend, which leads to her death. After Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, Warren then attacks Buffy with a gun but accidentally kills Tara with a stray bullet. Willow tries to resurrect Tara but fails. Tara's death causes Willow to descend into darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers. Willow hunts down and kills Warren in vengeance. Driven by grief, Willow fights and overpowers Buffy, who is forced to fight when she is unable to condone Willow's actions. Giles returns to help face Willow in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This initially backfires when Willow feels the pain in everyone around the world and decides to destroy the world in order to end everyone's suffering. At the climax of the season, Xander prevents Willow from destroying the world by reminding her of their friendship and telling her that he loves her no matter what, the same way Tara did. She eventually breaks down, and the dark magic drains from her. Meanwhile, Buffy comes to terms with being alive again, and promises to be there for her sister and friends. At the end of the season, after attacking and attempting to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to Africa to see a demon and asks him to \\"make him to what he used to be\\" so that he can \\"give Buffy what she deserves.\\" The audience is led to believe that he was referring to the freedom to be evil (unrestrained by his punishment chip) and thus able to kill Buffy; however, after passing a series of tests, Spike is rewarded with the restoration of his soul.

Whedon only ended up writing and directing one episode, the musical; this is also the only season where he didn't write and direct the season finale. Marti Noxon was promoted to executive producer and took over the duties of the showrunner and wrote three episodes. David Fury was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote four episodes, directing one of them, as well as writing the season finale. Jane Espenson was promoted to supervising producer and wrote or co-wrote four episodes. Douglas Petrie was promoted to producer, later to supervising producer midseason and wrote or co- wrote three episodes, including directing two of them. Steven S. DeKnight was promoted to story editor and wrote three episodes. Rebecca Rand Kirshner was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. New additions in the sixth season included Drew Z. Greenberg who wrote three episodes and Diego Gutierrez, who wrote a freelance episode after previously being an assistant to Whedon. David Solomon (also producer) directed the highest number of episodes in the sixth season, directing five episodes. James A. Contner (also co-producer) and David Grossman each directed three.  Episodes  = Crossovers with Angel = The sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer coincided with the third season of Angel. With this season, Buffy switched networks from The WB to UPN, while Angel still remained on The WB. Because they were on competing networks, there were no official crossovers. At the time, WB Entertainment President Jordan Levin stated \\"There will be no crossovers between Angel and Buffy. I think it's more important, in the long term, that Angel really establishes itself as a world that obviously comes from the same mythology, but operates with its own set of principles, guidelines and characters, and really establishes itself independently from Buffy.\\" Although there are no distinct crossovers where characters appear on the other shows, there are moments where characters are mentioned or interactions between the two series' characters occur off screen. At the end of the Angel episode \\"Carpe Noctem\\", Angel (David Boreanaz) receives a telephone call in which Willow tells him Buffy is alive. Buffy then receives a call from Angel at the end of \\"Flooded\\", and immediately leaves to meet with him. Although the phone call scenes happen on screen, neither Willow's side on Angel nor Angel's side on Buffy is shown. The scene between Buffy and Angel also happens off screen, but is described by them in the following episodes. Due to the crossover embargo, this is the only season of Buffy in which Angel does not appear.  Reception  The series received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations, for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series, Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Non-Prosthetic), and Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Prosthetic) for \\"Hell's Bells\\"; and Outstanding Music Direction for \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, James Marsters, and Emma Caulfield were nominated for Satellite Awards for their performances. The cast won a Special Achievement Award for Outstanding Television Ensemble at the Satellite Awards. The Futon Critic named \\"Life Serial\\" the 15th best episode of 2001, \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" the 3rd best episode of 2001 and \\"Normal Again\\" the 35th best episode of 2002. The sixth season averaged 4.6 million viewers, slightly higher than the third season of Angel. Rotten Tomatoes gave season six a score of 63% with an average rating of 8.33 out of 12 based on 19 reviews indicating the season received generally favorable reviews from critics, with a critics consensus stating, \\"Buffy gets an A for effort, but a bleaker tone and some jarring plot twists make this penultimate season a series low.\\" =\\"Once More, with Feeling\\"= \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and for a Nebula Award for Best Script. \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" received positive praise from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences of the best episodes of Buffy after the series ended. Although Salon.com writer Stephanie Zacharek states \\"(t)he songs were only half- memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great\\", she also asserts that it works \\"beautifully\\", paces itself gracefully, and is \\"clever and affecting\\". Tony Johnston in the Herald Sun writes that Gellar \\"struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency [...] The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers.\\" Johnston counts \\"I'll Never Tell\\" as one of the episode's \\"standout moments\\". Connie Ogle in The Miami Herald calls the songs \\"better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days\\". Writers agree that the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British newspaper The Observer writes \\"What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level [...] It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated for the past six seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practiced by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression.\\" Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as \\"scary in a brand-new way\\", saying \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" is \\"as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is \\"often hilarious\\", according to Murray, and acts as \\"(b)oth spoof and homage, [parodying] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires\\". Scott Feschuk in Canada's National Post states that the episode \\"conveyed the same sense of rampant, runaway genius‚Äîthe rare fusion of artful storytelling and ardent entertainment, a production capable of moving viewers to tears or to an awestruck rapture\\". Writing in the Toronto Star, Vinay Menon calls \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" \\"dazzling\\" and writes of \\"Joss Whedon's inimitable genius\\"; he goes on to say \\"(f)or a show that already violates conventions and morphs between genres, its allegorical narrative zigging and zagging seamlessly across chatty comedy, drama and over-the-top horror, 'Once More, with Feeling' is a towering achievement [...] The show may be anchored by existential weightiness, it may be painted with broad, supernatural brushstrokes, but in the end, this coming-of-age story, filled with angst and alienation, is more real than any other so-called teen drama [...] So let's add another line of gushing praise: 'Once More, with Feeling' is rhapsodic, original, deeply affecting, and ultimately, transcendental. Quite simply, television at its best.\\" =Criticism= Season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the most controversial amongst its ardent fandom because it was dramatically darker in tone than previous seasons; it has been called the show's \\"most hated season\\". Syfy Wire stated that the show's sixth season \\"has always been a thorn in its fandom's side. It was a little darker, a little meaner, and a little too different from what came before for the entrenched base to accept.\\" Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair wrote on the 20th anniversary of the show's premiere that season 6, \\"a dark, unpopular chapter in the show's seven-year run...once its most hated - has become its most important.\\" Robinson praised the introduction of the Evil Trio, the much-maligned \\"Big Bad\\" villains for season 6, as presaging the later trend of \\"entitled, misogynistic rhetoric that rose to the surface during the Gamergate culture wars of 2014, and has seemingly infiltrated everything since‚Äîthe 2016 presidential election included.\\" She concluded, positively, that \\"It may lack some of the trademark zip of the show in its prime, and critics of the Dark Willow story line in particular are not wrong in their concerns. But with the luxury of historical context, Season 6 of Buffy carries more powerful resonance than any other moment in the show's history.\\" About the season's criticism, Joss Whedon says: \\"I love season 6. It‚Äôs really important. But it was a very stark thing to do. It wasn‚Äôt just putting Buffy in a very bad, abusive, weird relationship, it was some sort of an end to magic. For me because childhood is so rich with metaphor, a lot of it had to do with leaving that behind. Instead of a bigger than life villain, we had the nerd troika. Instead of drinking blood and doing spells as sexual metaphor, we had sex. Things became very literal and they lost some of their loveliness. I still think that a lot of the best episodes we ever did were in season 6. I don‚Äôt agree with the detractors, but I understand it.\\" Acting as showrunner for season 6, Marti Noxon received the brunt of fan criticism, eventually stating in 2018 that she felt parts of season 6 \\"went too far.\\" She elaborated that \\"We pushed into some categories that almost felt sadistic and that Buffy was volunteering for things that were beyond just ‚Äúbad choices‚Äù and were almost irresponsible for the character. That may have to do with my own history...And I think that killing Tara was ‚Äî in retrospect, of all the people, did she have to die?\\" She explained her rationale for taking Buffy in a darker direction, stating that \\"...I was really vocal about wanting Buffy to make some bad mistakes. My argument was that, when we become young women, especially if we're troubled or haunted by something, that can lead us to make some bad choices, especially in the area of romance.\\"  DVD release  Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Sixth Season was released on DVD in region 1 on May 25, 2004 on in region 2 on May 12, 2003.

It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET.  Plot  Season seven deals with the Potential Slayers, normal girls around the world who are candidates to succeed the Slayer upon her death. It is revealed that Buffy's resurrection caused an instability which allows The First Evil, a spiritual entity that Buffy encountered in the third season, to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It has inactive Potential Slayers hunted and killed by Caleb, a sinister and misogynistic preacher turned serial killer, who heads a cult called Bringers, who worship The First as a god. Inside the Hellmouth it raises an army of Turok-Han, an ancient and powerful sub species of vampire. Caleb later destroys the Watchers' Council's headquarters in London, killing many Watchers, including Quentin Travers. Dawn begins her sophomore year at high school. Buffy gets a job at the rebuilt Sunnydale High, where she meets the new principal, Robin Wood, a vampire hunter and the son of deceased Slayer, Nikki Wood, who was killed by Spike in New York City many years ago. Buffy also reunites with Willow, who still is working through her emotional rampage in the previous season, and Spike, who earned his soul back but is temporarily driven mad by regret. Willow begins to heal emotionally from Tara's death and finds solace with a Potential Slayer named Kennedy. They immediately start dating before Kennedy can fully understand Willow. Their relationship is strained when Willow drains a significant portion of her life force to reopen a portal for Buffy, but they soon reconcile. Andrew Wells and Jonathan Levinson leave Mexico and return to Sunnydale after The First convinces Andrew to help open the Seal of Danzalthar, which results in the death of Jonathan. Andrew is captured by the Scoobies, who show resentment toward him, but he becomes a committed ally after The First takes Jonathan's form and tries to convince him to kill all the Potentials in the house. Andrew refuses, insisting he's good now, later admitting his guilt about how cruel his betrayal of Jonathan was and disclosing that he does not believe he will survive the forthcoming battle. Anya and Xander break up for good after a demon named Halfrek gets her to kill a group of frat boys. Buffy and Anya fight while Willow summons D'Hoffryn, who questions Anya. Anya requests that her latest vengeance be reversed. Halfrek is killed and Anya is turned human once more. Spike is driven mad by The First, and soon it also gains control of him for a time. The First also reveals that Spike killed Robin Wood's mother, sparking a vendetta. Robin makes an attempt on Spike's life. Ironically, this attack frees Spike from his insanity and, regaining his clarity, Spike beats Robin. Buffy finds the injured Robin in his garage and angrily shuns him for attacking Spike. Buffy finds out that Giles was part of the scheme, and becomes angry at him, but they soon make peace. Willow helps track the Potentials in Sunnydale and a number of them, brought by Giles, take refuge in Buffy's house. Dawn at first believes herself to be a Potential, but becomes disappointed when she finds that is not the case. Xander cheers her up saying she's anything but ordinary. The now human Anya also returns to the Scooby Gang, and while she and Xander still love each other, they don't get back together. Later, a fully reformed Faith, having been broken out of prison by Wesley to save Angel, returns to Sunnydale to help fight The First. During Faith's return, the Scoobies and the Potentials begin to question Buffy's leadership skills. Everything goes seemingly well, but when Buffy leads the Potentials to attack Caleb and the Bringers, several girls are killed and Xander loses an eye during the fight. The Scoobies and the Potentials eventually mutiny against her, electing a reluctant Faith as their new leader. Spike, however, stays loyal to Buffy and informs her that he has learned of an ancient weapon, known as the Scythe, that was designed only for the Slayer. While Buffy fights Caleb and finds the Scythe, Faith leads the Potentials on a mission in the sewers, only to find they've been tricked as a time bomb explodes. Following the explosion, several Turok-Han attack the survivors. Buffy saves the lives of the remaining Potentials, reconciles with her friends and finally makes peace with Faith. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all humans and supernatural creatures flee Sunnydale, turning the town into a ghost town. Buffy and her friends stay behind in an effort to defeat The First. Meanwhile, Xander, at Buffy's request, takes Dawn out of Sunnydale to safety. Also, Principal Wood returns to join the cause and finally accepts Spike. In the series finale, Dawn adamantly returns to help fight against the First. As she does so, Angel leaves Los Angeles and returns to Sunnydale with an amulet (given to him by Wolfram & Hart), which Buffy gives to Spike. Buffy finally kills Caleb by cutting him in half with the scythe. While Caleb is dead, they make their move to thwart The First's plans once and for all. The Potentials descend into the Hellmouth to fight an army of Turok-Han, while the other Scoobies hold off the few Turok-Han that escape into the halls of Sunnydale High. Willow uses a spell that activates all the Potential Slayers, granting them some Slayer powers. Anya is killed in the fight, along with some of the new Slayers. Fearing she is done for, The First returns to taunt Buffy, saying her fight is in vain. Refusing to let the world be destroyed, Buffy and her allies dig deep and begin to gain the upper hand. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun and kills all of the Turok-Han in the Hellmouth, but Spike himself is also consumed and he sacrifices himself to defeat the enemy. Buffy tells Spike she loves him; he tells her to run. The Hellmouth collapses, and the resulting crater swallows all of Sunnydale. The survivors of the battle escape on a school bus, which Buffy catches up to after saying goodbye to Spike. In the last scene of the series, the survivors gather on the rim of Sunnydale's crater. The Scoobies and new Slayers tend to the wounded. Xander mourns Anya's death and is consoled by Andrew. Dawn asks what their next move is and Buffy smiles.

Marti Noxon also served as executive producer and was the showrunner, but only co-wrote one episode. Noxon was originally due to write the penultimate episode of the series, but she was already busy writing a new pilot for Fox. Jane Espenson was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote or co-wrote six episodes. Co-executive producer David Fury wrote three episodes, including directing one of them. Supervising producer Douglas Petrie was promoted to co- executive producer midseason and wrote or co-wrote four episodes, including directing one of them. Rebecca Rand Kirshner was promoted to executive story editor and wrote three episodes. Drew Z. Greenberg was promoted to story editor and wrote three episodes.

David Solomon directed the most episodes in the seventh season, directing five episodes and was promoted to co-executive producer. James A. Contner (also co-producer) directed three.  Episodes  = Crossovers with Angel = The seventh and final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer coincided with the fourth season of Angel. This was the final year in which both shows were on television together. In \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\", Willow (Alyson Hannigan) receives a call from Fred. She leaves immediately and goes to L.A. without telling why. Willow appears in the Angel episode \\"Orpheus\\" to re-ensoul Angel (David Boreanaz) as she previously did before in \\"Becoming\\". After successfully re-ensouling Angel, she brings Faith (Eliza Dushku) back with her to Sunnydale to help in the fight against The First Evil. In the Angel season four finale, \\"Home\\", Angel receives an amulet from Wolfram & Hart which is important to the final battle in Sunnydale. Angel goes to Sunnydale in the penultimate episode \\"End of Days\\" and also appears in the series finale \\"Chosen\\". Angel gives Buffy the amulet (which is later worn by Spike in the final battle) and offers his help, but Buffy declines as she needs him to be the second front if they fail. Buffy and Angel share one final moment in a graveyard where they discuss a possible future. In the fifth and final season of Angel, Spike is resurrected (after his death in \\"Chosen\\") by the magical amulet. Spike becomes a main character in the final season. Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab) also becomes a main character in the final season. Buffy recurring character Andrew Wells (Tom Lenk) appears in two episodes (\\"Damage\\" and \\"The Girl in Question\\") in the final season of Angel, revealed to be a Watcher-in-training. Andrew states in \\"Damage\\" that Xander is in Africa, Willow and Kennedy are in Brazil, Buffy and Dawn are in Rome, and everyone else is in England.  Reception  The series received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series for \\"Chosen\\". While, \\"Chosen\\" won for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Television Series at the Visual Effects Society Awards. \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ‚Äì Short Form, while \\"Chosen\\" was nominated in the same category. The series received the Television Critics Association Heritage Award. The Futon Critic named \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" the 42nd best episode of 2002 and \\"Chosen\\" the 50th best episode of 2003. The seventh season averaged 4.1 million viewers. Rotten Tomatoes gave season seven a score of 80% with an average rating of 8.33 out of 10 based on 20 reviews with a critics consensus stating, \\"Seldom subtle, always subversive, Buffy ends the way it began: a funny, weird show that packs a punch and a whole lot of feeling.\\"  Canonical comic book continuation  In late 2006, series creator Joss Whedon announced that a canonical comic book continuation of the series would be written. The comic book, titled Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, is published by Dark Horse Comics; and the first issue (written by Whedon), titled \\"The Long Way Home\\" was released on March 14, 2007.

It was commissioned by the 1953 Edinburgh Festival to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the birth of the Italian composer Arcangelo Corelli, and given its first performance on 29 August 1953, in the Usher Hall, by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tippett. Integrating 17th century influences, especially those outside of the orchestral tradition, can be traced back to his days at the Royal College of Music, and to the period immediately after when he took a position conducting amateur choirs in Oxted, while his interest in 18th century counterpoint, specifically the fugal process, which would figure prominently and climactically in the latter part of the Fantasia was the result of his supplementary studies with R. O. Morris, also date from that period.Thomas Schuttenhelm, The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 117. The Fantasia represents, stylistically and conceptually, Tippett‚Äôs most ambitious attempt to create a synthetic composition that anticipates the creative developments that eventually led to the formation of his notional archetype.Thomas Schuttenhelm, The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 118. Composition The theme on which the work is based is an Adagio in F minor from Corelli's Concerto Grosso in F, Op. 6, No. 2. There are two distinct ideas: a slow, dragging melody for full strings with much use of suspension in F minor, and a brisk Vivace flourish for two solo violins in C major. In the tradition of the Baroque Concerto Grosso Tippett contrasts a solo group, consisting of two violins and a cello, with the main body of strings. Although he does not use a harpsichord continuo, the writing for lower strings is dense and richly textured, achieving a comparable effect of harmonic fullness. The musical style is characteristic of the composer in the 1950s, combining rigorous, complex polyphony with lyrical radiance and simplicity. After the opening sequence of seven variations there is a fugue (incorporating part of Bach's organ fugue in B minor on a theme of Corelli) which in turn leads to 'a long slow ascent from darkness into light',Matthews, David (1980) Michael Tippett: An introductory study. Faber and Faber. p.60 in which cascading, swirling violins reach a highly charged, 'overtly erotic'.Bowen, Meiron (1988) CD Liner notes, VC 7 90701-2 climax before calming down in a Pastorale section reminiscent of Tippett's opera The Midsummer Marriage. Popularity In January 1975 the Corelli Fantasia reached an audience of some 14 million television viewers when it was featured prominently in the film Akenfield, directed by Peter Hall. The ensuing popularity of the work, and of the recording by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields directed by Neville Marriner stemmed directly from this national exposure of a piece thought before then to be complex, over-intellectual and 'difficult'.The Independent It is now firmly established as one of Tippett's most popular and frequently performed works, joining other well-loved works for strings by English composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar.

Father Pedroza controversially was the one who ordered the execution of the Cristero General Victoriano Ramirez (nicknamed \\"El Catorce\\"), a ranchhand-turned-general admired among the Cristeros. In order to avoid dissent among the Cristeros, Pedroza resolved to execute the sentence immediately, but before the sentence could be carried out, General Ramirez tried to escape and was killed in the process.

Plot In 19th century Lithuania, Pastor and folklorist Wittembach is invited to stay at the home of a young nobleman named Count Micha≈Ç Szemiot. Arriving at the mansion, he is told that Szemiot's mother has been driven mad after an apparent bear attack in her youth, and is now sequestered at the estate. Doctor Froeber, who treats the ailing Countess with old-fashioned remedies, reveals that the villagers of the estate claim that Micha≈Ç is possibly the son of the bear that attacked his mother all those years ago. Micha≈Ç soon begins to display animal-like behavior that grows worse as time goes on.

The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece. Later in World War II, Germany and Russia developed flame throwing mines that worked on a somewhat different principle. After World War II, flame fougasses similar to the original British design have been used in several conflicts including the Korean and Vietnam Wars where it was improvised from easily available parts.FM 20-33. Combat Flame Operations. The flame fougasse remains in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient to the present day.  Development history  Following the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, Britain faced a shortage of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of which had to be left behind in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Maurice Hankey, then a cabinet minister without portfolio, joined the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence (CDC) chaired by Sir John Anderson, the Secretary of State for the Home Office and Home Security. Among many ideas, Hankey \\"brought out of his stable a hobby horse which he had ridden very hard in the 1914‚Äì18 war ‚Äì namely the use of burning oil for defensive purposes.\\" Hankey believed that oil should not just be denied to an invader, but used to impede him. Towards the end of June, Hankey brought his scheme up at a meeting of the Oil Control Board and produced for Commander-in-Chief Home Forces Edmund Ironside extracts of his paper on experiments with oil in the First World War. On 5 June, Churchill authorised Geoffrey Lloyd, the Secretary for Petroleum to press ahead with experiments with Hankey taking the matter under his general supervision. To this end, the Petroleum Warfare Department (PWD) was created and it was made responsible for developing weapons and tactics. Sir Donald Banks was put in charge of the department. The PWD soon received the assistance of William Howard Livens.Livens WH Captain - WO 339/19021. The Catalogue, The National Archives Livens was well known for his First World War invention: the \\"Livens Gas And Oil Bomb Projector\\", known more simply as the Livens Projector. The Livens Projector was a large, simple mortar that could throw a projectile containing about of explosives, incendiary oil or, most commonly, poisonous phosgene gas. The great advantage of the Livens Projector was that it was cheap; this allowed hundreds, and on occasions thousands, to be set up and then fired simultaneously catching the enemy by surprise.Gas and Chemical Supplies - MUN 5/385 pp. 9‚Äì12. The Catalogue, The National Archives One of Livens' PWD demonstrations, probably first seen about mid-July at Dumpton Gap, was particularly promising. A barrel of oil was blown up on the beach; Lloyd was said to have been particularly impressed when he observed a party of high- ranking officers witnessing a test from the top of a cliff making \\"an instantaneous and precipitate movement to the rear\\". The work was dangerous; Livens and Banks were experimenting with five-gallon drums in the shingle at Hythe when a short circuit triggered several weapons. By good fortune, the battery of drums where the party was standing failed to go off. The experiments led to a particularly promising arrangement: a forty-gallon steel drum buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed. At the back of the drum was an explosive which, when triggered, ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about wide and long. The design was reminiscent of a weapon dating from late medieval times called a fougasse: a hollow in which was placed a barrel of gunpowder covered by rocks, the explosives to be detonated by a fuse at an opportune moment. Livens' new weapon was duly dubbed the flame fougasse. The flame fougasse was demonstrated to Clement Attlee, Maurice Hankey and General Liardet on 20 July 1940. Experiments with the flame fougasse continued and it rapidly evolved. The fuel mixture was at first 40% petrol and 60% gas-oil, a mixture calculated to be useless as a vehicle fuel. A concoction of tar, lime, and petrol gel known as 5B was also developed. \\"5B was dark coloured, sticky, smooth paste which burned fiercely for many minutes, stuck easily to anything with which it came in contact and did not flow on burning.\\" Early flame fougasse designs had a complex arrangement of explosive charges: a small one at the front to ignite the fuel and a main charge at the back to throw the fuel forward.Flame Fougasses - WO 199/1433. The Catalogue, The National Archives An important discovery was that including magnesium alloy turnings (the waste product of machining magnesium pieces in a lathe) with the main charge at the rear of the barrel would give reliable ignition. This eliminated the need for a separate ignition charge and its associated wiring. The alloy of about 90% magnesium and 10% aluminium was, at the time, known under the trade name Elektron.  Design variations  Of the original British flame fougasse designs, there were three main variants: the safety fougasse, the demigasse and the hedge hopper. They all used metal barrels and similar pre-prepared explosive charges, although they varied in the details of construction and the amount of ammonal used for the propelling charge. =Safety fougasse= Safety fougasse installation diagram. The most common form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the propelling charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a \\"safety\\" fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge. Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe. Fougasse charge diagram. The propelling charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape to three or four cartridges of ammonal explosive. This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The propelling charges were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about away. Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery. Private Harold Wimshurst later recalled: A non-safety fougasse could be built by simply burying the propelling charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads would have to be left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge over an extended period of time.Imperial War Museum. Film WOY35: Flame Fougasse & Barrel Flame Traps. The safety fougasse design had the advantage that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe that it did not require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, it would not have been a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation. Flame fougasses were camouflaged with a covering of light material such as netting ‚Äì anything heavier would significantly affect the range. They could easily be merged into hedgerows or the banks of a sunken lane within view of a well- hidden firing point. They were placed where a vehicle would be obliged to stop, or at least slow down. The flame fougasse would offer instant and horrific wounds to any unprotected men caught in its fiery maw and would cause a vehicle engine to stop within seven seconds simply because it was deprived of oxygen (although it would easily start again once the fireball subsided, provided nothing was damaged). British soldier Fred Lord Hilton MM later recalled: =Demigasse= Demigasse installation diagram. The demigasse was a simpler variant of the flame fougasse. It was a barrel of petroleum mixture laid on its side with a cocoa tin charge in a shallow pit just below one of the barrel's ridges. On detonation, the barrel would rupture and flip over spilling its contents over an area of about . Left on its own at a roadside, in the open and with no attempt at disguise other than to hide the firing wires, it was indistinguishable from the barrels of tar commonly used in road repair. It was hoped that in addition to the damage done by the weapon itself, experience would cause the enemy to treat every innocent roadside barrel with the greatest caution. =Hedge hopper= Another variant of the flame fougasse was the \\"hedge hopper\\". This was a barrel of petroleum mixture placed upright with a cocoa tin charge containing two primers and just one ammonal cartridge buried in an deep pit placed underneath and slightly off centre, but carefully aligned with the seam of the barrel. On firing, the barrel would be projected into the air and forwards, bounding over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. It was difficult to get the hedge hopper's propelling charge right, but it had the great advantage of being quick to install and easy to conceal. Home Guard member William Leslie Frost later recalled seeing a hedge hopper in action. Placing the hedge hopper so that it worked properly proved difficult to get right and the War Office discouraged its use in favour of the more conventional flame fougasse installation. A further variant of the hedge hopper idea was devised for St Margaret's Bay where the barrels would be sent rolling over the cliff edge.  Deployment  Remains of a flame fougasse barrel at Danskine Brae, near Gifford, East Lothian, Scotland. In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were distributed of which the great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum to as many as fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture. A battery would be placed at a location such as a corner, steep incline or roadblock where vehicles would be obliged to slow.  Later development  Diagram of a flame fougasse made with a 55-gallon drum as a battlefield expedient, 1967. Although the flame fougasse was never used in Britain, the idea was exported to Greece by a couple of PWD officers when, in 1941, German invasion threatened. They were reported to have a powerful effect on enemy units. By 1942, there were proposals for completely buried flame fougasses to be used as oil minesOil Mines - SUPP 15/33. The Catalogue, The National Archives but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed before the end of the war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex. Both the Russians and the Germans later used weapons described as fougasse flame throwers or flame thrower mines. They worked on a different principle to the flame fougasse. Fougasse flame throwers comprised a cylinder containing a few gallons of gasoline and oil; this would be hidden, typically by being buried. On being triggered electrically, either by an operator or by a booby trap mechanism, a gas generator is ignited. The pressure ruptures a thin metal seal and the liquid is forced up a central pipe and out through one or more nozzles. A squib is automatically fired to ignite the fuel. The range of the flame varied considerably, generally just a few tens of yards and lasted only one to two seconds. The German weapons, the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, had an fuel tank and were wired back to a control point from where they could be fired individually or together. The flame fougasse has remained in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient to the present day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw and the other to ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.

One of the Pavlovsk Station buildings. Many of the varieties at Pavlovsk are stored not as seeds in a vault but as plants in a field. History It was started in 1926 by agricultural scientist Nikolai Vavilov and contains an extensive collection of more than 5,000 varieties of fruits and berries. The Pavlovsk station's collection contains more than 100 varieties each of gooseberries, raspberries, and cherries. It also contains more than 1,000 varieties of strawberries. More than 90% of the collection is found in no other research collection or genebank. The collection is a field genebank, meaning that the varieties are stored as plants in the ground. Most of the species concerned do not breed true from seeds, and so the varieties cannot be stored as seeds. The Pavlovsk station itself fell into German hands during the Siege of Leningrad in 1941‚Äì1944, but prior to the arrival of German troops, scientists from the Institute of Plant Industry were able to move much of the station's tuber collection to a location within the city. Twelve of these scientists died of starvation while protecting the Institute's edible collection of tubers and seeds. In 2010 the experimental station faced an uncertain future, because the land it sits on is being sold to a developer who plans to build private homes on the site. If this planned development had gone forward, much of the collection would have been lost. Due to technical issues and quarantine regulations, it would not have been feasible to move the collection before demolition of the station was slated to have begun. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev recently announced via Twitter that the issue will be \\"scrutinised\\". Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had not yet responded to public calls to save the experimental station and its collection as of the end of 2010. However, in April 2012 the Russian government took formal action to preserve this important genetic repository and stop the land from being conveyed to private interests for development. http://www.vir.nw.ru/news/14.05.2012_en.html In popular culture The novel Hunger,Hunger, by Elise Blackwell (Amazon.com) by American writer Elise Blackwell, is a fictionalized retelling of the plight of the scientists who starved to death while protecting the gene bank's edible seed and tuber collection during the Siege of Leningrad. The song \\"When the War Came,\\" by the band The Decemberists, also tells the story of these scientists, with one verse saying \\"We made our oath to Vavilov / We'd not betray the Solanum / The acres of asteraceae / To our own pangs of starvation.\\" References Category:Research institutes in Russia Category:Gene banks Category:Research institutes in the Soviet Union Category:Education in Saint Petersburg Category:Agricultural organizations based in the Soviet Union ","title":"Pavlovsk Experimental Station"},{"id":"28196466","text":"Crown of Boles≈Çaw I (replica made in 2001-2003 after originals were lost after 1036 and 1794) King Boles≈Çaw I wearing the crown (painting by Jan Bogumi≈Ç Jacobi, 1828) Stanis≈Çaw II August wearing the crown Detailed drawing by Krzysztof J√≥zef Werner of a part of the crown before 1794. The drawing was used for the reconstruction in 2001-2003 The Crown of Boles≈Çaw I the Brave (in Polish korona Chrobrego, also known in Latin as the corona privilegiata) was the coronation crown of the Polish monarchs.  History  The exact origins of the Polish crown are unknown. According to legend, the story dates back to the Congress of Gniezno in the year 1000 AD, when Boles≈Çaw I the Brave, Duke of Poland, received from Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor a replica of the Holy Lance and a crown, both symbolising royal power. The destination the crown was lost over the course of time, Possibly taken to Germany in 1036 by Queen Richeza. It was only in 1320 that a new set of regalia was prepared for the coronation of King Ladislaus the Short and survived until the 18th century. The crown along with the crown jewels was kept in the cathedral treasury at Wawel Castle. During the reign of the Jagiellon dynasty it was moved to the Crown Treasury of the castle. The crown was often removed from the Wawel, for example in 1370, when Louis I of Hungary took it away, returning in 1412. In the 17th century the crown was moved to Warsaw for the coronations of the queens. During the Deluge in the years 1655-1661, the crown was hidden away in Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa Castle in today's Slovakia. In the 18th century it moved around again, particularly to Silesia and Moravia. Although returned to Wawel Castle in 1730, only three years later it was taken again to Warsaw. In 1734 the crown was left at the Pauline Jasna G√≥ra Monastery, where it remained until 1736. On the occasion of the coronation of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski on November 25, 1764 in St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw, the crown was transported from Krak√≥w to Warsaw for the last time. It returned to Wawel Castle where it remained until its theft. The seizure of Krak√≥w by the Prussian army in 1794 had dramatic consequences. The crown treasury was plundered and the royal insignia robbed and later melted down on the order of the Prussian king. Out of the gold, a number of coins were minted. Of all the Polish crown regalia, only the sword Szczerbiec would survive. Based on historical drawings, paintings, descriptions and using a number of Prussian coins believed to have been minted from the gold of the crown in 1811, a team led by Adam Orzechowski of Nowy SƒÖcz produced a recreation in 2001-2003 . The crown was 10 inches high, with 7.8 in. external diameter and 7.3 in. internal diameter, weighing around 2.82 pounds . The replica crown is made out of 21 oz . gold, 21 oz . silver, 11 synthetic rubies, 88 emeralds, sapphires and garnets 0.5 to 1 in. in diameter, 184 gems 0.15 to 0.2 in. in diameter, 80 pearls, and of royal purple silk velvet, which is probably very similar to the dimensions of the original crown.

Early life Walton studied at Bablake School in Coundon, Coventry, then took a BTEC National Diploma in Performing Arts at Stratford-upon-Avon College, which she passed with three distinctions. As an amateur actress, Walton appeared in pantomime at Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, was a member of the Coventry youth group YOG and attended Three Spires Dance School. While at college, she appeared in the BBC drama Filth alongside actress Julie Walters. Walton completed her diploma in June 2008, and was cast in Hollyoaks that August. Walton initially appeared in the spin-off series Hollyoaks Later on a three-episode basis. Career In 2009, it was announced that Hollyoaks new producer, Lucy Allen, had decided to introduce Walton into the main show. Allan said Walton had impressed her with her performance in Hollyoaks Later. To prepare for the role, Walton took pole- dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club, she carried out routines in her underwear. She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: \\"I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put up in my living room.\\" Walton had initially signed on for a three-month stint. In 2009 Allan decided to renew her contract and keep her with the series until 2010. In early 2010, it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their character would be axed. One month later, Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Loretta at the end of Walton's contract. Walton departed alongside co-star Kevin Sacre, who played her on-screen love interest Jake Dean. On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes with the serial along with two fellow cast members, Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her because he didn't feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after her main storyline, in which her character was supposed to be revealed as a child killer, was axed following complaints from Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered child James Bulger. However, she also felt like she did deserve another chance to prove herself.

Personal life and education  Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (); she has two younger siblings: David and Kathryn. The family later moved to Michigan, where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954. She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College where her mother was a student; she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958. She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor. She had other inspirations including her father (a philosopher and poet), and her grandfather (a school headmaster and Quaker minister). She says these men inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies. While at Earlham, Hamilton met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton, a senior majoring in chemistry. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana, while her husband completed his undergraduate degree at Earlham. The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where James would later earn his master's degree in chemistry from Brandeis University; they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959. James later graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963; he founded a law firm in Boston and also later served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. The couple divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.  Career  In Boston, she initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis. However, in the summer of 1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT. She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC. Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory. At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience. She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement. = SAGE Project = From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft. She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet attacks during the Cold War. Hamilton said: It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software. = Draper Laboratory = Hamilton in 1969, standing next to listings of the software she and her MIT team produced for the Apollo project Hamilton during her time as lead Apollo flight software designer Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which worked on the Apollo space mission. Hamilton was initially hired as a programmer for this process but moved on into system designs. Eventually, she was in charge of all Command Module software, which was all the software for navigation and lunar landing guidance. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab. Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander and the subsequent Skylab. Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software. This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed. She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist. Hamilton also served as Director of the Software Engineering Division. Her areas of expertise include: systems design and software development, enterprise and process modeling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open- architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, man-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques. These made her code incredibly reliable because they helped programmers identify and fix anomalies before they became major problems.\\"The NASA Heritage of Creativity.\\" 2003 Annual Report of the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board, 2003. = Apollo program = In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The on- board flight software captured these alarms with the \\"never supposed to happen displays\\" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays. Hamilton had prepared for just this situation years before: The astronauts had inadvertently left the rendezvous radar switch on, causing these alarms to be triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly phased power supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. Chapter 11.4. The asynchronous executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning was used by Hamilton's team to develop asynchronous flight software: Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency \\"giving the astronauts a go/no go decision (to land or not to land)\\". Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, \\"Go, go!\\" and they continued. Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work \\"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design\\". Hamilton later wrote of the incident: = Businesses = In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program. They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT.M. Hamilton, S. Zeldin (1976) \\"Higher order software‚ÄîA methodology for defining software\\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol. SE-2, no. 1, Mar. 1976.Thompson, Arthur A.; Strickland, A. J., (1996), \\"Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases\\", McGraw-Hill Companies, It was successfully used in numerous government programs including a project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project. In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers, and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems. Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984 and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of Development Before The Fact for systems design and software development.  Legacy  Official photo for NASA, 1989 Anthony Oettinger, Barry Boehm, and Hamilton have been credited with naming the discipline of \\"software engineering\\". Hamilton details how she came to make up the term \\"software engineering\\": When Hamilton started using the term \\"software engineering\\" during the early Apollo missions, software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering, nor was it regarded as a science. Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline. Over time the term \\"software engineering\\" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline. The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering. Hamilton talks about \\"Errors\\" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of \\"Errors\\" in a system. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: \\"At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer\\". Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the moon. According to Wireds Karen Tegan Padir: \\"She, along with that other early programming pioneer, inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software.\\" In 2019, to celebrate 50 years to the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah plant were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.

History On 23 May 1941, Carlos Martin, Gildo Marcati and Arnoldo Pienovi, founded the defense company \\"F√°brica de Armas Halc√≥n\\". This company began to work in the city of Avellaneda, province of Buenos Aires. The facilities consisted of a building with two bodies. In one of them, the copying winches of fluted, winches for the preparation of butts, the matrices and the soldering mounted irons. The building also owned an ample cellar with tunnel for the test of submachine guns. In the other body, were the sections of polished, drop hammers, finished butts, bronzed, armed, packaging, deposits, plus stands for the test of .22LR calibre rifles. The factory consisted, also, of an office of projects and plans, where the plans of the different arms with the specifications from materials and tolerances were made. There the studies of manufacturing costs, process to manufacture, product control, etc. were done. Another important office was the destined one for quality control. The same consisted of elements of high accuracy (durometers, calibers, micrometers, comparators, etc.), with which the control of all the pieces was realised that were elaborated. It is possible to emphasize, that in his almost totality, the systems and mechanisms that used the arms of this company/signature was of its own design, credited with international patents. The company constructed the majority of its machineries in agreement with the needs that were arising in production. In fact, everything was elaborated in the factory: butts, guns, means, etc. For 15 years, their managers maintained the patent exclusive of fluted by compression. This technique, originally as Halcon, served to execute the bordered ones of the guns of its arms. For such action four operations were required. The advantage consisted of granting major hardness to the steel and obtaining one more polished surface, avoiding therefore the heating of the guns, considering the smaller friction produced by the passage of the projectiles, mainly in the automatic weapons. The pieces that composed its rifles and machine guns were schemed or executed by winches or drop hammers, except for the marks of the pistols gas release devices, that were of smelting. For the preparation of the butts, walnut, original of the provinces of San Luis and Mendoza were used. This wood remained in the same plant for four or five years before they were utilized. The factory produced for its arms, the complementary accessories: magazines for machine guns (opened or closed), canvas covers and leather slings for firearms such as rifles and submachine guns, cleaning rods and ejector rods made of iron and bronze, brushes of several classes for cleaning of guns, anticorrosives. Inclusively, it got to make a shelf wood gunsmith. Within the war material that the factory made specific in its facilities, Gun carriages for the Madsen light machine gun, .50 BMG caliber belt linking devices, for heavy machine guns, guns and shippers for .45 ACP caliber pistols, muzzle compensators for Thompson submachine guns used by the Argentine Federal Police and guns and spare components, reinforcement plates and hand guards made from shock-impact fibreglass, for FN FALs of the Argentine Air Force. Indeed, for this last distribution, it constructed different pumps of kilajes. The factory, that at the end of 1960 was renamed as the Metallurgical Centre S.C.A., was a supplier of the Argentine Armed Forces, and of some Police forces.

Still competing competitively into his 80s, Main was highly ranked within ITF Veterans, Seniors (Masters), and Super Seniors player during the 1990s and 2000s. Tennis career Main reached the round of 32 in singles five times in a major - at the 1951, '53, and '54 U.S. National, as well as the 1954 French Championships and Wimbledon. At Roland Garros, Main defeated his first two opponents, Frenchmen, handily to set up a third round encounter with No. 7 seed Mervyn Rose. Rose won the first and third sets with Main drawing level twice, taking the second and fourth sets, before Rose prevailed in the fifth, 6‚Äì3. Similarly at Wimbledon, Main breezed through his first round opposition and handily won his second match before falling in five sets to his third round foe, American Gilbert Shea.

The League had by June of its founding year about 36,000 members and chapters in almost every state of the country.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 147, Taylor & Francis, 2001 The organization arose after the anti-clerical provisions of the 1917 Mexican Constitution were strictly enforced by the fiercely anti-Catholic President Plutarco Calles and after he enacted further draconian provisions in the Calles Law.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 147, Taylor & Francis, 2001 The LNDLR, along with the Catholic hierarchy, initially advocated peaceful resistance to the Calles Laws including a boycott of tax payment and nonessential goods and a petition drive to rescind the offending constitutional provisions. When the Church failed to obtain a compromise from Calles, the Mexican hierarchy ordered the priests to go on strike beginning July 31, 1926, the day the Calles Law was to go into effect.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 147, Taylor & Francis, 2001 Soon after the clerical strike began on July 31, 1926, sporadic popular uprisings began and beginning in September 1926 the LNDLR began to discuss revolt, but they maintained the policy of boycott.Purnell, \\"Cristero Rebellion\\" p. 375 As the popular uprisings continued, especially in Jalisco and Colima, despite the lack of formal support from the bishops, the LNDLR advocated on January 1, 1927, open rebellion to overthrow the regime and institute a new constitution with guarantees of religious freedom.Purnell, \\"Cristero Rebellion\\", p. 375. While the LNDLR served the purpose of giving the rebelling peasants organizational structure and military guidance, the onset, development and character of the war were more rooted in grass roots circumstance and groups.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 148, Taylor & Francis, 2001 At first the rebellion was only able to sustain suppression in a half dozen western states where there was intense popular support and the organizational aid of local groups, the Popular Union (UP), initially spearheaded by Anacleto Gonz√°lez Flores and the covert U, with cells dispersed throughout Jalisco and Michoacan.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 148, Taylor & Francis, 2001 In 1927, the LNDLR reorganized the rebellion in the west and, in August 1928, gave the rebellion its first military leader, the well experienced soldier who had fought in the Federal Army under Huerta, but anticlerical and mercenary, General Enrique Gorostieta, who was a 33rd degree Mason.Tuck, Jim, The Anti-clerical Who Led a Catholic Rebellion, Latin American StudiesWerner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 148, Taylor & Francis, 2001 The Cristeros began to engage in large scale military assaults.Werner, Michael S., Concise encyclopedia of Mexico p. 148, Taylor & Francis, 2001 The LNDLR were excluded from any participation in the peace negotiations between the Mexican State and the Church. They rejected the argument of the Archbishop of Mexico, Pascual D√≠az, \\"that the Cristeros were doomed to failure because they lacked the two critical elements: adequate military resources and the diplomatic support of the United States government.Espinosa, Jesuit Student Groups, p. 47. Alberto Mar√≠a Carre√±o, who was close to the archbishop of Mexico, \\"questioned the morality of continuing a war that could not be won.\\"Espinosa, Jesuit Student Groups, pp. 154-55, n. 60. After intense and lengthy negotiations by the U.S. ambassador Dwight W. Morrow, an accord (Arreglos) acceptable to both Calles and the Catholic hierarchy was reached and the bishops ordered the LNDLR to cease military and political activities and the Cristeros to lay down their weapons.Purnell, \\"Cristero Rebellion\\", p. 377. A number of Cristeros continued fighting, in what some have called \\"La Segunda\\", that is the second Cristiada, but they did so without the support of the Church.Purnell, \\"Cristero Rebellion,\\" p. 377. The LNDLR's criticisms of the episcopal hierarchy's signing on to the Arreglos were blunted given the Vatican's support of the diplomatic accord, but also because Catholic Action, a new lay group firmly under the hierarchy's control, was used to rein in radicalized Catholic organizations following the Arreglos.Espinosa, Jesuit Student Groups, p. 56.

As Chairman of TAR, Choling was the \\"most senior ethnic Tibetan in the regional government\\", though he was subordinate to the TAR Communist Party Chief Zhang Qingli, and later his successor Chen Quanguo.  Biography  Padma Choling was born in 1952 in a farming family in D√™ngq√™n County, Chamdo Prefecture. He joined the People's Liberation Army in Qinghai Province at 17, and served in the army for seventeen years. In the army he played basketball and mastered the Chinese language. He joined the Communist Party of China in October 1970. He was an official in the Tibetan regional government since December 1969, working in Xigaze and then Lhasa, rising to the vice- chairmanship of the TAR in 2003. After his anodyne handling of an earthquake in Damxung County outside Lhasa, he was elected the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 2010.  Chairmanship  Personally, he has been described as \\"stern, but... amiable\\" in contrast to his \\"soft-spoken\\" predecessor Qiangba Puncog. In addition to stability and ethnic harmony, he has set a goal of 12 percent GDP growth and a ¬•4,000 per capita GDP for farmers and herders in the Tibet Autonomous Region. To bring this about, he has signed an agreement with the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government to allow it to promote trade with South Asia, including Nepal. Padma is of the opinion that there is no \\"issue of Tibet\\" that the Dalai Lama says, and questions the Lama's ability to judge the situation in Tibet since he has not been in Tibet since 1959. On the issue of religion, Padma has said that he and the Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje are \\"mates from the same hometown\\". At the 2010 National People's Congress, he announced that the choosing of the 15th Dalai Lama would abide by the \\"requirements of Tibetan Buddhist tradition\\", including approval by the government, instead of being the choice of the 14th Dalai Lama. Already, he has dismissed the Dalai Lama's choice for the 11th Panchen Lama as \\"invalid\\". He has included monks and nuns over the age of 60 into the Chinese state social security, and works with legislation delivering roads, electricity, and water to monasteries. Moreover, Pema Thinley, said at a Press Conference that Gedun Choki Nyima - the child recognized by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama - is an ordinary person, and that he and his parents wanted to stay away from public attention for their own safety.Official: Dalai-picked 'Panchen' lives normal life On March 17, 2018, Padma was elected as the Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The film was developed from a short story by Richard Hillary, an RAF pilot killed in action in January 1943. The basic and relatively slight storyline of For Those in Peril was an end to produce a film with a documentary feel and an element of wartime propaganda. The film stars Ralph Michael and David Farrar. Plot Aspiring RAF pilot Pilot Officer Rawlings (Ralph Michael) fails to make the grade in training and grudgingly accepts the alternative of joining the crew of Launch 183, an air-sea rescue craft skippered by Flight Lieutenant Murray (David Farrar). Rawlings is initially resentful and bored by the apparent mundane and un-exciting life, until the vessel is called on to rescue the crew of an RAF bomber shot down in mid-Channel. Having accomplished the rescue, the boat runs into an enemy minefield and is attacked by German air and sea forces. When Murray is killed, Rawlings has to take charge and bring the vessel back.

In common with a number of other war-related films made by Ealing at this time, the plot was subservient to the propaganda message; name actors were generally not used and genuine sailors featured in the action scenes. Location filming took place mainly in the area around the port of Newhaven in Sussex, with the English Channel sequences being shot off the Sussex coast. Crichton later recalled: \\"(My) first picture ... was a propaganda picture called For Those in Peril where we rushed around the Channel in high speed motorboats, boats which were used for picking up crashed airmen and so on. It's a horrifying thing to say, but it was very exciting\\".Cole, Sid. \\"Charles Crichton: BECTU interview.\\" BFI Screen Online, 1987. Retrieved: 23 September 2014.

A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach () is an 1869 Prosper M√©rim√©e horror fantasy novella. It was one of the last stories by M√©rim√©e, started in July 1868 and published in the Revue des deux Mondes in September 1869. The title is a misspelling of the Lithuanian word lokys for \\"bear\\". The plot revolves around a young man who is suspected to be half-human half-bear. As such, the plot may be classified into a werewolf theme with some elements of vampirism (the motif of drinking blood repeats through the work). The novella primarily deals with the dual nature of human‚Äìbeast. It also contrasts Western education and Christianity with pagan Lithuanian rituals and beliefs, on more broadly ‚Äì cultured civilization with primordial wilderness. Plot The story is told from the point of view of an observer ‚Äì professor Wittembach, a pastor and an amateur ethnographer, who comes to a Samogitian manor in rural Lithuania while on a mission to translate the Gospel of Matthew into Samogitian. The plot revolves around a young man, Count Michel Sz√©mioth, who is suspected to be half-human half-bear, since he was born after his mother was mauled (and, as believed by peasants, raped) by a bear. Through the novel, the protagonist, Michel/Lokis, manifests signs of animal-like behavior until he finally kills his bride by a bite to her throat and runs away into the forest on his wedding night. Some critics consider the tale to be an inversion of the Beauty and the Beast, whereby the Beauty transforms a man into a Beast, rather than vice versa. Inspiration M√©rim√©e conceived the novella in spring 1867 as a contrast to horror stories often read at the court of Empress Eugenie. Intrigued by the human‚Äìbeast duality, he quickly decided against a parody. It is believed that M√©rim√©e borrowed the plot from the 13th-century Gesta Danorum, published in Revue des deux Mondes. Gesta Danorum includes a story of a girl kidnapped and impregnated by a bear. The girl gives birth to a son who exhibits violent sexual tendencies as an adult. Epigraph and title \\"Miszka su Lokiu, Abu du tokiu\\" cited at the beginning of the novel as an epigraph to the manuscript is a slightly corrupted Lithuanian proverb \\"Me≈°ka su lokiu, abudu tokiu\\". The proverb was included in Lithuanian dictionaries by Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann, published in 1851, and by August Schleicher, published in 1857, but judging by M√©rim√©e's correspondence, he did not know about these publications and received the proverb from Ivan Turgenev. \\"Me≈°ka\\" and \\"lokys\\" are different names (synonyms) for the \\"bear\\" in Lithuanian, so the proverb almost literally means \\"A grizzly and a bear are one and the same.\\" According to an (incorrect) explanation given by professor Wittembach at the end of the novella, \\"miszka\\" is not a Lithuanian word but a rendering of \\"Mishka\\", a Russian-language hypocoristic form of \\"Michael\\", the protagonist's name. In the English translation the proverb is footnoted with the following comment: \\"The two together make a pair\\"; word for word, Michon (Michael) with Lokis, both are the same. Michaelium cum Lokide, ambo [duo] ipsissimi. Inaccuracies The novella draws elements, such as thunder god Perk≈´nas or cult of ≈æaltys (grass snakes), from the pagan Lithuanian rituals and beliefs, but is not historically or culturally accurate. For example, the plot takes place in 1866, but the work does not address social or political situation after the January Uprising of 1863‚Äì1864. The extinction of the Prussian language is dated a full century later than it actually happened. The protagonist is a Protestant, though that is very rare in Catholic Samogitia. Some cultural elements, like rusalka or card games Durak and Preferans, were taken from Slavic (Russian) culture rather than Lithuanian.

The house was built in about 1840 and some of the outbuildings were constructed even earlier. The house is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and the property is owned by the National Trust of Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002. History =Riversdale as a coaching inn= Advertisement placed in 1837 by Matthew Healy for the property which is now known as Riversdale. The land on which Riversdale was built was originally owned by Matthew Healey who ran a small hotel on the property called the Old Goulburn Inn. In 1837 Healey sold a large amount of his Goulburn assets so that he could retire to Appin. He placed an advertisement in The Sydney Herald in 1837 which gives a good description of the Inn (which was demolished) and surrounding buildings that were present at this time (see picture of advertisement on right). John Richards bought the property and built Riversdale as a coaching inn (then called the Victoria Inn) in about 1840. Unfortunately he died before it was opened and his wife Ann took control of all of his businesses. She placed the property in a trust for her sons. In 1840 she married Benjamin Gould. The first licensee of the inn was Louis Levy and Benjamin Gould held the licence from 1843 after him. Their names are still painted on the stonework entrance archway to Riversdale. A story in the Sydney Morning Herald of July 1842 recounts the concern that Benjamin Gould had about the safety of the nearby bridge which crossed the Wollondilly River. The newspaper article said that he had repeatedly tried to repair the bridge himself and when the river flooded he took travellers over on horseback. On one occasion a traveller had drowned and he and Mr Levy were trying to find the body. Later in the same year The Sydney Morning Herald published how Gould and other men from the inn had rescued passengers from the Sydney mail coach which was attempting to cross the river when both horses fell through the bridge. =Riversdale as Goulburn Grammar School= From about 1850 until 1856 Riversdale was rented by David Patterson as a boarding school for boys called Goulburn Grammar School. David Patterson was previously the Headmaster of Sydney College but in 1849 decided to go to Goulburn to establish his own school. He was remembered by one former pupil as ‚Äúa splendid man and a great scholar‚Äù who had the gift of imparting knowledge to others and although he was strict he was kind hearted. Shortly before David Patterson left Riversdale an advertisement appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald for the sale of the building. The ad gives a colourful description of the property as it was in 1855. :‚ÄúA substantial and extensive premises known as the Goulburn Grammar School and consisting of commodious dwelling-house containing 13 rooms and 2 extensive cellars and spacious flagged verandah, back and front; large kitchen and pantry adjoining, with loft and bedroom above; seven stall brick stable with two coach-houses and loft the whole length of the building capable of containing fifteen tons of hay. :Seven-stall stone stable with large store- room adjoining and loft the whole length of the building partitioned and capable of containing ten tons of hay and a thousand bushels of grain. Excellent garden of about an acre, well stocked with fruit trees. :The whole is securely fenced and there is the convenience of a bricked well of pure water on the premises.\\" The property was sold to Thomas Bowen who in the following year sold it to Henry Wilson and the place again became an inn called the Criterion Hotel. He sold it later to John Fulljames who used the house as a residence only. =The Fulljames family= Marriage notice in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1862 referring to the property as Riversdale. John Fulljames was born in 1818. (spelt Fuljames) He came to Sydney as chief steward on his uncle's ship and stayed in the colony. In 1840 he married Elizabeth Smyth and established a stock agency in Goulburn shortly afterwards. John also owned the property called Cogenburgh at Bungonia. The couple had a large family. Two of their daughters Emily and Rachel married into the Badgery family. (see photos below). It seems that the Fulljames family resided at Riversdale from the early 1860s. A mention is made in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1861 that John had grown a prize apple at his house in the Old Township of Goulburn. The first reference to the property being called Riversdale was in 1862 when a marriage notice (see picture on right) for the eldest daughter Emily was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by John Fulljames. It appears therefore that it was the Fulljames family that named Riversdale. File:Eliza Fulljames circa 1860.jpgEmily Fulljames circa 1860 daughter of John Fulljames. Later married John Badgery. File:Rebecca Fulljames.jpgRebecca Fulljames circa 1860 daughter of John Fulljames. Later married Andrew Badgery. =The Twynam family= The Twynam family bought Riversdale in 1875 after leasing it for several years. Edward Twynam was born in 1832 in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England and came to Australia when he was 23. He obtained employment as an assistant surveyor soon after he arrived in Sydney and during his career he carried out many important surveys into the interior of New South Wales. In 1888 he became the Surveyor-General of New South Wales and remained in this position until 1900. He came to live in Goulburn in 1864 and two years later in 1866 married Emily Rose Bolton. Emily Rose was born in 1845.New South Wales Births, Deaths and Marriages She was one of nine children of the Reverend Robert Thorley Bolton and Jane Martha Ball. Her elder sister was Lady Mary Windeyer who became famous as a suffragette and charity worker. Emily was interested in art and craft and many of her works still remain. She was very competent in woodcarving, embroidery and drawing. In 1893 she won a prize for her embroidery at the Chicago International Exhibition. More than 130 drawings of plants birds and lizards survive in her sketchbooks. She carved furniture and picture frames with botanical themes some of which are displayed at Riversdale.Jessie Street National Women‚Äôs Library, 2004 ‚ÄúEmily Rose Twynam, 1845-1910‚Äù, Australian Women Fact File. Emily died in 1910 and Edward died at the age of 91 in 1923. After his death their two unmarried daughters Edith (see photo below) and Alice Joan who was a nursing sister lived at Riversdale. In 1939 after the death of her husband Phoebe Wesche (see photo below), another daughter, joined them. All three sisters lived at Riversdale for the rest of their lives. When the youngest sister Alice Joan died in 1967 the property was sold to the National Trust of Australia and it is still owned and operated by them today.

This Committee's work was broader, including work on replanting the grounds of Experiment Farm cottage, Parramatta, Old Government House, Parramatta and Riversdale, Goulburn. In 1967 the garden was redesigned by Jean Friend in the style of Gertrude Jeckyll (English Arts & Crafts garden designer, artist, and author) popular after the second world war. The formation of a talented committee ensured the property went from strength to strength. A Victorian cottage garden was established full of greys and greens, lavender and silver, with highlights of pink, yellow, white and red, and heritage roses. Fruit trees were added to the surviving orchard. In the early 2000s the property was leased for a short while as the Trust attempted to resolve the perennial problem of attracting ongoing funding for maintenance of the highly significant heritage in its care. This proved unsuccessful and the experiment was terminated, but not before the committee had resigned. And then one of the worst droughts in living memory struck. Goulburn's water table dropped below the level of the Riversdale bore and the town was on level 5 water restrictions.(Loftus, 2013, 22). Since the Trust took over the property, local members and others have tried to maintain the integrity of its garden, but ten years of drought took a toll. Large trees and special plants died and its beauty faded. The toughest plants struggled on. The Trust employed Debbie Sibbick as new Property Manager and provided support and encouragement. The Friends of Riversdale group was formed as a committee of local volunteers who look after the house and garden. Working with other committee members, \\"work for the dole\\" crews, The Men's Shed, the \\"We Love Goulburn\\" group and the Southern Tablelands Vintage Farm Machinery club who manage the paddock area. An autumn 2011 appeal raised $25,000 which provided resources to protect the garden by installing an irrigation system. One hundred olive trees (Olea europaea var. europaea cv.) were planted to screen unsightly neighbouring buildings and a pergola was constructed. Soon the reestablishment of the important historic feature of heritage fruit trees and a substantial raised vegetable garden will take place. So in 2011 after years of drought and neglect, Riversdale's garden has been restored. In 2009 a new committee was formed and volunteers swung into action in 2010. Gravel paths were unearthed and new planting began, transplanting all and sundry from other parts of the garden. The garden now abounds with lamb's ear, catmint, larkspurs, peonies, delphiniums, poppies, sweet peas, lavenders, melianthus (honey flower), salvias, roses and flag iris, alliums and perfumed Lilium candidum. Since winning the Goulburn district Lilac City Garden Competition Judges' Special Award and Best Overall Garden in October 2012, it has attracted more attention. At the beginning of 2013 over 500 people gathered to hear a special Mass in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the Catholic Diocese of Goulburn. The gardens were the site of Goulburn's first Catholic Mass, held there in 1833.Loftus, 2013, 22 Volunteer Ray Shiel has made Riversdale's vegetable garden his responsibility and has transformed it, along with the viability and appeal of the property. It provides the kitchen and catering team with produce for soups, pie and sandwich fillings, chutneys and pickles that are bringing funds to the property, and re-establishing the property's long tradition of sustainable self-sufficiency. Ray has set up links with groups including the local TAFE School of Horticulture and Primary Production and Goulburn's Permaculture Group, giving demonstrations and workshops and supplying the Homestead Markets (on the third Sunday of each month.Loftus & Giles, 2014 Riversdale received a $2,000 grant from Open Gardens Australia allowing construction of a concrete compost bin to recycle green waste from the 10 acre property (including 4 acres of garden) and for demonstrations. The garden was opened through the Open Gardens Scheme for the first time in 2012 with a unique garden fair, for which it won an Australia Day Award.OGA, 2013, 13 Now into the fifth year of its annual Open Garden Australia day and Vintage Fair, monthly homestead markets were initiated in 2014. Riversdale has now become a regional highlight for its heritage gardens, its own produce and as an example of sustainable gardening. A community building partnership grant enabled construction of a ramp to give disabled access to the toilet block. In 2015 a Riversdale Growers' and Rare Plant Fair was held in November and Riversdale Victorian Christmas with the house decked in Victorian style. The property promotes sustainable gardening practices while volunteers are creating a local cuisine using garden produce.  Description  The site of Riversdale is situated at the northern edge of the Old Town of Goulburn. This plan was surveyed soon after Governor Darling had gazetted his 1829 Town Planning Regulations, which were introduced as a measure to standardise the establishment of towns in the Colony and facilitate the survey and scale of town allotments, each of which was to be of a standard size and shape. ;Garden and grounds The property comprises about 10 acres on the outskirts of the town. Riversdale has a partly intact early colonial garden, which has been restored and supplemented since 1967 by National Trust volunteers, mainly of shrubs, perennials, bulbs fruit and shelter trees (the latter, both coniferous and broadleaf). Significant tree plantings remaining are fruit trees planted in the 1840s including a medlar (Mespilus germanica) which are still in use, an early black locust/false acacia tree (Robinia pseudoacacia)(most likely from a former shelter belt), an 1850s line of elm trees behind (north of) the homestead (Ulmus procera), and early Aleppo (Pinus halepensis), Canary Island (Pinus canariensis) and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) trees, holm/holly/evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos)(also possibly from a former shelter belt), Irish yew (Taxus baccata 'Fastigiata') and funeral cypresses (Cupressus funebris). Three espaliered apple trees remain from 1918 and the garden reached its peak in the Twynam period of 1872-1969. The garden was restored by volunteers between 2010‚Äì12, winning \\"best overall\\" category in a local garden competition in October 2012. An old well remains, possibly from the 1840s. ;Barn: The stone barn is considerably earlier (1828) than the house and is the only surviving building of the \\"Old Township\\" of Goulburn as sited by Macquarie. It is probably one of the oldest buildings in Goulburn* .The National Trust, Listing Proposal: 1 ;House: Riversdale is a single storey, Colonial Georgian cottage with two wings forming a courtyard at the rear. It is built of brick with an iron roof, (originally shingle), timber floors and cedar joinery. The doors are 8-panelled, double molded cedar and the windows are the usual small panes of glass held in cedar glazing bars. The internal handling of space dates from about 1840. It was built on land granted to Mathew Healy in 1830. Architectural Style: Colonial Georgian. Building Material: Brick with iron roof, timber floors, cedar joinery, 8-panelled doors, double molded cedar.  Heritage listing  Riversdale is a colonial complex of State significance. Its location represents the early foundation of Goulburn town. Its form represents a typical example of the early Australian Colonial house complex with associated gardens, paddocks and outbuildings, together forming an autonomous suburban unit. Of the outbuildings, the stone barn is particularly important for being the only surviving building of the first settlement of Goulburn Plains, established in 1828 and later superseded by the new settlement of Goulburn. Further, the complex of house and outbuildings (including stable) reflects the way of life of the nineteenth century era. Riversdale, having functioned as inn and a school as well as a residence, has a notable connection with the area's social history over a lengthy period. Its major association is with the term of residence of the Twynam family. Edward Twynam made substantial contributions to the opening up of the south-western regions of the Colony. His family made an important cultural contribution to the life of the district. Riversdale was the second property acquired by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) with the specific purpose of conservation (1992). Riversdale is an excellent example of a building constructed in the Old Colonial Regency style. It also reflects very well the typical characteristics of wayside inns built during the 1830-1880 period. Riversdale is notable for its decorative qualities, its fine craftsmanship and its finished workmanship throughout. Riversdale also has historic and aesthetic significance for its partly intact early colonial garden, which has been restored and supplemented since 1967 by National Trust volunteers. Significant plantings remaining are fruit trees planted in the 1840s including a medlar (Mesiplus germanica) which are still in use, an early black locust/false acacia tree (Robinia pseudoacacia), an 1850s line of elm trees, and early Aleppo, Canary Island and Monterey pine trees, holm oaks, honey locust, Irish yew and funeral cypresses. Riversdale, Goulburn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Riversdale has association with the earliest plan of Goulburn (1829, Old Goulburn now North Goulburn), and with the early town uses. It also has an association with notable citizens. The Healy/ Richards/ Fulljames/ Twynam allotment was the only major private construction of the Old Town, with the added value of its public function as an Inn and rest house. The property is capable of demonstrating a past way of life, which has significance in the City of Goulburn, the southwest of New South Wales, and for the long period of stable occupation by one notable family. It has in the past been recognised as \\"cultural house\\", which made a positive contribution to the social life of the town and district. The Riversdale sight is further enhanced by its proximity to the Police Barracks, and later the Goulburn Goal, Riversdale also has associations with early figures in Goulburn's development i.e. Healy, Gould, Levy, Fulljames and Twynam, and the Mounted Police Establishment alongside.Richards, 1997: Vol. 1, p 41 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Riversdale has come to represent a typical example of the early Colonial suburban house. Its architectural form original materials are both typical and evocative of the mid- nineteenth century Colonial period. The surviving outbuildings associated with the house, particularly the stone barn which pre-date it, provide excellent examples of early service buildings attached to a gentlemen's residence. Riversdale setting on the edge of the Goulburn, slightly detached from the town and close to the Wollondilly River, enhances the autonomous quality that the property possessed throughout its history.Richards, 1997 1: 43 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site now embraces some of the land originally used by the Mounted Police stationed at Goulburn. The building formerly connected with this use have now disappeared, but their location is indicated by the early plans. There may have also been earlier buildings, now gone, associated with Riversdale. This endows the site with archaeological significance and potential for archaeological investigation.Freeman, 1997: Vol.1, p 44 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Riversdale's rarity is its historical, social and environment association with the construction of Goulburn as a Town. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Riversdale has come to represent a typical example of the early Colonial suburban house. Its architectural form original materials are both typical and evocative of the mid- nineteenth century Colonial period.

The initial request for the center came from the Department of Defense while the funding was provided by the Defense Nuclear Agency.Davis, P.K. & Winnefeld, J.A. The Rand Strategy Assessment Center : An Overview and Interim Conclusions about Utility and Development Options, RAND Corporation, 1983, The interactive, computer supported, war-gaming system uses Red (Soviets) and Blue (United States) force models (also known as Agents). These represent the two superpowers primarily being researched. There is also a Scenario Agent, which represents non-superpower countries, and a Force Agent, which simulates the results of military operations and combat.Shlapak, D., Allen, P., & Schwabe, W. Plan Synchronization in the RSAC Environment, RAND Corporation, 1986, The significance of this program was that humans were no longer needed to run these complex simulations. It was now possible for the computer to almost single-handedly run iteration after iteration. Humans could step in and change the scenario, variables, or even take over completely if they so desired, although it was not necessary. The goal was to capture the human-expert contribution and inject that knowledge into the artificial intelligence controlling the computer models. Mission The need for this arose during the late 1970s when current US strategic-nuclear analysis wasn‚Äôt in depth enough. The current thinking in the US at the time was heavily revolving around the idea of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). Many believed that it would be one all-or-nothing nuclear attack or retaliation that would determine the fate of the two superpowers. The idea was to expand on this thinking, more concurrent with the Soviet ideal that bringing nuclear weapons into a war, wouldn‚Äôt be the end. The U.S.S.R. had contingencies for a variety of scenarios, whereas the US really only had the one. The RSAC‚Äôs objective was to improve the United States‚Äô strategies in both nuclear and non-nuclear war. Each superpower was given an automated decision making model based on the best knowledge the US had at the time. The scientists also wanted to include a third Agent which would represent the non-superpower countries both militarily and politically. Previous simulations had been relatively shallow and had not taken into account how third parties could affect each scenario, whether it is the permission to use their airspace, or actual military forces. Now, the RSAC would be able to run ‚Äúefficient, rigorous, and analytical‚Äù war gaming from beginning to end. This could be repeated at will, in a timely fashion, and with all data being recorded for reference later. Below are some of the RSAC objectives put forth in the paper by Paul K. Davis and James A. Winnefeld titled ‚ÄúAn Overview and Interim Conclusions about Utility and Development Options.‚Äù * To create an Integrated Framework ‚Äì a means to analyze and discuss military strategy in all conflicts, including a prolonged nuclear war, anywhere in the world. * To develop the capability for Multiscenario Analysis ‚Äì an increased capability would ‚Äú‚Ä¶test sensitivities to key variables‚Ä¶‚Äù including superpower strategy, behavior patterns, operational art, battle outcomes, and non-superpower countries involvement. * To increase Analysis Realism ‚Äì including factors that are normally ignored. Examples include operational constraints, asymmetries in the USA and Soviet objectives, attitudes and military styles, and third country decisions and/or actions. * Provide tools to improve understanding of Strategic Dynamics- these include interrelationships, possible cascade effects and decision points. Program Forces The Program Forces or Agents, are rule-based models used within the RSAC system. When designing these, a few necessary requirements needed to be met. The agents needed to be able to make operational and strategy decisions including, but not limited to, designing a war plan, deciding where to allocate forces, and whether or not to enter a battle depending on the risk vs. payoff. They also must be able to base their decisions on future projections of the conflict, not only the immediate future. For example, Blue Agent must first assess the current situation between itself and Red Agent, then consider the Scenario Agent‚Äôs status, and then make a possible prediction of a future scenario involving all three. The Agents are also able to adjust and make course corrections based on conflict outcomes and the amount of intelligence available to them. Lastly, some ‚Äò‚Äôsoft factors‚Äô‚Äô are injected into the mix. An Agent should also attempt to determine the will and intentions of the opponent, morale of the troops and country, and also the strength of current alliances if applicable. Below are the Agents involved in the RSAC system. Red Agent ‚Äì This is the opposing superpower force in the simulation. Usually this is the Soviet Union or countries united under the Warsaw Pact. Blue Agent- This is the homeland superpower force in the simulation. Usually this is represented by the United States of America or the NATO countries. Scenario Agent- This is the force that represents all other non-superpower nations. Force Agent- This force keeps track of other Agent forces on the global scale, and also simulates the outcome of battles and military operations. It also acts as a time keeper for the simulation. However omniscient they may sound, one of the most important features of these automatons is their ability to make mistakes and develop false models. Blue may decide that a military battle would be their best option, although it might have delayed or incomplete intelligence of Red. Another scenario might involve the two sides computing a battle victory using different standards. Red may decide to battle Blue, even if it knows they will not ‚Äò‚Äôwin‚Äô‚Äô the battle. Its goal may just be to weaken Blue‚Äôs forces enough to set them back a few weeks or months. So Blue would calculate a victory, but so would Red.

The hyperbola is sometimes referred to as the \\"Markowitz bullet\\", and its upward sloped portion is the efficient frontier if no risk- free asset is available. With a risk-free asset, the straight line is the efficient frontier. In modern portfolio theory, the efficient frontier (or portfolio frontier) is an investment portfolio which occupies the \\"efficient\\" parts of the risk‚Äìreturn spectrum. Formally, it is the set of portfolios which satisfy the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same standard deviation of return (i.e., the risk). The efficient frontier was first formulated by Harry Markowitz in 1952; see Markowitz model. Overview A combination of assets, i.e. a portfolio, is referred to as \\"efficient\\" if it has the best possible expected level of return for its level of risk (which is represented by the standard deviation of the portfolio's return). Here, every possible combination of risky assets can be plotted in risk‚Äìexpected return space, and the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space. In the absence of the opportunity to hold a risk-free asset, this region is the opportunity set (the feasible set). The positively sloped (upward-sloped) top boundary of this region is a portion of a hyperbolaMerton, Robert. \\"An analytic derivation of the efficient portfolio frontier,\\" Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 7, September 1972, 1851-1872. and is called the \\"efficient frontier\\". If a risk-free asset is also available, the opportunity set is larger, and its upper boundary, the efficient frontier, is a straight line segment emanating from the vertical axis at the value of the risk-free asset's return and tangent to the risky-assets-only opportunity set. All portfolios between the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio are portfolios composed of risk- free assets and the tangency portfolio, while all portfolios on the linear frontier above and to the right of the tangency portfolio are generated by borrowing at the risk-free rate and investing the proceeds into the tangency portfolio.

With its prominent siting, unusual form, and striking Art Deco style, Coronet Flats is considered one of the most beautiful and recognisable private buildings of the 1930s in Brisbane. Coronet Flats in New Farm, Brisbane, 2019 History Coronet Flats was completed in November 1933 and was described at the time as having \\"the architectural dignity of a mansion\\". Max Strickland, Melbourne businessman and building developer, determined that Brisbane was lacking \\"up-to-date, well serviced\\" flats and contracted to have Coronet Flats built. Initially, Strickland planned an extension to be constructed adjacent (probably at 999 Brunswick Street) that would double the size of the building if the development proved successful. The two buildings would have formed a courtyard between them for a swimming pool, extra garages, and laundries. This is probably where the alternative name \\"Coronet Court\\" is derived. This was never realised with Strickland constructing a detached house on the site at a later date. The building was very popular at the time (with four of the nine flats let prior to completion) and remains so today. Strickland sold the building in 1939; since then it has stayed within the O'Connor family. Design The site overlooks New Farm Park across Brunswick Street enjoying an open, north- eastern aspect and Strickland was keen to capitalise on this through climate- appropriate design. The brick building is three-storeys with a central entrance foyer angled to face the intersection of Brunswick Street and Elystan Road with wings extending parallel to the roads. Described at the time as arresting and original, the accomplished and cohesive design of the building owes a great deal to the untrained Strickland's desire to \\"suit the climate and to meet the desires of flat-dwellers in the matter of a pleasing outlook\\". The walls of the flats are characterised by angled bays of windows designed to catch prevailing breezes from across the park and also to provide sweeping views of the landscape. The Art Deco features of this stunning apartment building include a grand galleried staircase, tall arched stained glass windows, unique ceiling plasterwork, and custom pendant lights.

It is listed at grade II. The present building, of Georgian appearance, incorporates an earlier timber-framed house, which probably dates in part from the 15th century. Local historian Jane Stevenson calls it \\"the most interesting house in Hospital Street\\", and considers it might be \\"the oldest surviving residence in Nantwich.\\"Stevenson, p. 16 Number 116 is one of a group of houses dating originally from the 15th and 16th centuries at the end of Hospital Street, which include Churche's Mansion, numbers 140‚Äì142 and The Rookery (number 125).Lake, pp. 13, 41‚Äì44 These buildings survived the fire of 1583, which destroyed the town end of Hospital Street together with much of the centre of Nantwich.Hall, p. 104 Number 116 is believed to stand near the site of the medieval Hospital of St Nicholas, which gives Hospital Street its name.Hall, pp. 5, 48‚Äì53 Description Number 116 is a large two-storey building with painted cement rendering under a tiled roof. The Hospital Street fa√ßade has two shallow projecting end wings with hip ends projecting from the main roof. The central entrance is flanked by wooden columns and has a semicircular fanlight with a pediment above. There are four casement windows to both ground and first floors, which date from the late 19th century. When the building was listed in 1974, there was an additional doorway in the left-hand (east) wing, which was blocked in the early 21st century. The fa√ßade is of Georgian appearance; English Heritage dates it as early 18th century although \\"much altered\\", while local historian Jeremy Lake considers it to be late Georgian. The existing building incorporates a much earlier timber-framed structure on a medieval plan, with a central hall and flanking wings. The parlour wing has been dated by Lake as probably late 15th century. This date would place it among the earliest remaining buildings in Nantwich, apart from the 14th-century parish church, and Stevenson considers it might be the oldest residential building in the town. The hall and service block, which date from the mid-to-late 17th century, probably replace earlier structures. The interior of the parlour wing contains old chimneys and sandstone fireplaces of 15th-century design. The fireplace in the south chamber of the parlour wing is particularly fine, according to Lake.Lake, pp. 42, 119 There is an intact roof truss, and the main roof timbers meet vertically underneath the roof purlin, which Lake considers characteristic of Cheshire timber framing of the 15th century.Lake, pp. 42, 103 Traces of internal decoration survive, with red ochre on the roof timbers contrasting with white limewash on the wattle and daub panels of the roof truss.Lake, p. 110 See also *Listed buildings in Nantwich References Sources *Hall J.

It was displayed at the Sensation exhibition of Young British Artists at the Royal Academy of Art in London from 8 September to 28 December 1997. Composition The work measures . At first sight, it resembles a greatly magnified version of a black and white photograph printed in a newspaper. It was made using casts of an infant's hand to build up a mosaic of black, grey and white handprints, creating a reproduction of the iconic police photograph of a hard-faced Myra Hindley with bouffant peroxide blonde hair taken after her arrest in 1965 (although often reported to have been taken around the time of the trial of the Moors murders in 1966). The photograph is widely recognised in Britain, having been published in British newspapers in the decades after Hindley's conviction. Harvey has said, \\"The whole point of the painting is the photograph. That photograph. The iconic power that has come to it as a result of years of obsessive media reproduction.\\" The painting consciously juxtaposes, as Jennifer Friedlander describes it, the tiny handprints of an \\"innocent child\\" and the \\"depraved world of adults\\", writ large on a gigantic canvas. Harvey has also commented: \\"I know enough to know that she probably didn't do any of the murders, that she was just in a relationship where she was probably too attached to the man who was doing it to extricate herself. That her life was probably too dull and boring to throw the relationship away ... I don't believe that's 30 years' worth of reputation as one of the most vile and notorious murderers in British criminal history.\\"White Cube: Marcus Harvey, The Hand That Rocked the Academy by Gordon Burn, The Guardian, 6 September 1997 Harvey's agent bought the work, and sold it to Charles Saatchi for ¬£11,000. Saatchi later sold it for an estimated ¬£100,000. It is now owned by US commodities trader Frank Gallipoli. Sensation exhibition The painting was included in the controversial Sensation exhibition of Young British Artists at the Royal Academy of Art in London in 1997. Norman Rosenthal, the Secretary of the Royal Academy, described it as the single most important painting in the show ‚Äì \\"a very, very cathartic picture ... It is an incredibly serious and sober work of art that needs to be seen.\\" However, it provoked angry press and public comment before the exhibition opened, including the ironic comment in an editorial in The Sun: \\"Myra Hindley is to be hung in the Royal Academy. Sadly it is only a painting of her\\".\\"Judging the image: art, value, law\\", Alison Young ,\\"Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law\\". Routledge, January, 2005. p. 34. Four members of the Royal Academy ‚Äì Craigie Aitchison, Gillian Ayres, Michael Sandle and John Ward ‚Äì resigned in protest at its inclusion in the exhibition.Young, p.34Stallabrass, p.313 The Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice Unit visited the exhibition before it opened, but could find insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution in respect of any of the exhibits under the Obscene Publications Act.Young, p.35 Winnie Johnson (mother of Keith Bennett, one of Hindley's victims, whose body remains missing) asked for the portrait to be excluded from the exhibition to protect her feelings. She joined a protest group, Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, that picketed the show's first day on 18 September. The charity Kidscape accused the Royal Academy of \\"sick exploitation of dead children\\" in an effort to attract paying visitors to address its financial deficit.Quoted in Friedlander, p.85 Windows at Burlington House, where the Academy is based, were smashed. The painting was vandalised twice, by two different artists, on the opening day of the exhibition, 18 September 1997. In the first attack, Peter Fisher smuggled blue and red Indian ink into the exhibition, concealed inside two camera film cases; he threw the ink over the painting and smeared it in. After witnessing the first attack, Jacques Rol√© left the exhibition to buy six eggs from Fortnum & Mason, on the other side of Piccadilly close to the Royal Academy, and threw three or four at the painting before being stopped by an off-duty police officer. The painting was removed to be restored, and was rehung after two weeks behind a protective perspex screen. Security guards stood nearby while the exhibition was open to the public.\\"Sensation sparks New York storm\\", BBC, 23 September 1999. Hindley wrote from prison to ask for her portrait to be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was \\"a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim.\\"Young, p.34. Despite all the protests, the painting continued to hang at the exhibition. The exhibition drew approximately 300,000 visitors, significantly more than usual, but less than the 813,000 visitors attracted to the Royal Academy's Monet exhibition in 1999.Stallabrass, p.201 The reaction to Harvey's painting in London has been compared to that received by Andy Warhol's 36-feet-square mural Thirteen Most Wanted Men, which comprised large copies of photographs from a \\"most wanted\\" booklet published by the New York Police Department, and was installed in the New York State Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair. After protests by sponsors, Warhol's work was quickly painted over.Andy Warhol Chronology: April 22, 1964: World's Fair opens with Warhol's Most Wanted Men mural painted silver The reaction to the potent mixture of the sacred and the profane parallels that to Andres Serrano's prize-winning 1987 photograph Piss Christ in Washington DC in 1989 and in Melbourne in 1997, and Chris Ofili's Turner Prize-winning painting The Holy Virgin Mary in New York in 1999. Later exhibition The work was shown when the Sensation show went on tour, at the Berlin Hamburger Bahnhof museum from 30 September 1998 to 30 January 1999, and at the Brooklyn Museum of Art from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000, and later at the Saatchi Gallery at County Hall in central London.

It was the final Security Council resolution adopted in 2002. The Security Council was convinced of the need for a temporary measure to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people until the Iraqi government fulfilled the provisions of Resolution 687 (1991) and 1284, and had distributed aid throughout the country equally. It reaffirmed the commitment of all states to Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its determination to improve the humanitarian situation and pledge to adjust the Goods Review List. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council adjusted the Goods Review List and procedures for its implementation. More than 50 items were added to the Goods Review List. It would conduct a review of the measures within 90 days and before the end of the current extension of the Oil-for-Food Programme, while the Committee established in Resolution 661 was also requested to conduct reviews. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was instructed to develop consumption rates and use levels for chemicals and medications specified in the annexes of the resolution within 60 days. Finally, the resolution appealed to all states to co-operate in the timely submission of technically complete applications and the issuing of export licences. Resolution 1454 was adopted by 13 votes to none against and two abstentions from Russia and Syria. Russia opposed the \\"restrictive\\" nature of the text while Syria noted that Iraq had begun complying with weapons inspections and regretted that the speed of negotiations resulting in the adoption of the current resolution did not allow enough time for examining the list.

He played at the defensive guard position as a walk-on for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. He was chosen as the co-captain and Most Valuable Player on the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team and a first-team All-American that same year. Early years A native of Detroit, Michigan, Hill is the youngest child in a family of five boys and two girls. He attended Detroit's Martin Luther King High School where he played football at the tight end position. University of Michigan =Walk-on status= Because of his size, Hill was not heavily recruited by major college teams.(\\"Hill, although he's no braggard, must think highly of himself then because he apparently believed he could play football for a school that made no effort to recruit him. As a 5-foot-10, 200-pound tight end at Detroit's Martin Luther King High School college scouts simply were not beating a path to his door.\\") Interviewed in 1970, Hill recalled, \\"I was a tight end in high school and I didn't get many scholarship offers because my size was marginal. You don't see too many 5-10 tight ends around.\\" Hill enrolled at the University of Michigan on a Michigan Opportunity Grant, a scholarship offered to under-privileged students with strong academic backgrounds.(\\"You probably know by now he is one of those rare 'walk-ons.' He was considered too small to be given a football scholarship, but he made it on a Michigan Opportunity Grant, financed by the state and university for poor people with a strong academic background.\\") Interviewed by a reporter from the UPI in 1969, Hill said, \\"It's an academic scholarship. One of those kind they give to ghetto kids. My family was too poor to send me to school.\\" Hill tried out for the Michigan football team at the invitation of George Mans, Michigan's offensive ends coach. He recalled that, during his try-out, they threw a ball to him, and the ball bounced off his head, resulting in his being converted into a lineman. He played briefly for Michigan's freshman football team in 1967 but quit midway through the season to concentrate on his studies. =1968 season= In the spring of 1968, Hill tried out for Michigan's varsity football team. He made the cut and was listed as a fourth-string defensive lineman at the conclusion of spring practice. Damer recalled, \\"I just stuck it out, figuring I'd get to play some.\\" By the time the 1968 football season began, Hill had been promoted to second-string status. The coaching staff was impressed by Hill's quickness, and he played in all 10 games for the 1968 team, including 7 games as the starting middle guard. His rise in 1968 from the fourth-string to starter was so rapid that his picture did not appear in the team's 1968 game program. The Toledo Blade in October 1968 ran a feature story on Hill and noted: \\"At 5-10, 200 pounds, Henry isn't big enough to play Big 10 football. Try telling that to Henry. ... Hill is a walk-on (non-scholarship) who made it big for the Wolverines. He's small, but he is tough, and he loves to play football.\\" Hill finished the 1968 season as one of Michigan's statistical leaders on defense with 72 tackles, including 50 solo tackles and 16 tackles for loss. =1969 season= In 1969, Hill started all 11 games for the Wolverines at the middle guard position on defense and also started three games as a guard on offense. He led the team with 90 tackles during the 1969 season. Hill was routinely double-teamed in 1969 and 1970. Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler said of Hill, \\"I don't think any team in the country can adequately contain Hill with one-on-one blocking.\\" Hill expressed frustration at being double-teamed, but recognized its value to the team: \\"Sometimes, I'm even getting triple-teamed on the pass rush. But that's got to help our defense so it's okay with me. If they do that, it leaves eight or nine men to play offense and we have ten men to play defense.\\" Hill was named United Press International's Midwest Lineman of the Week after recording nine solo tackles and two assists against Minnesota in 1969. Following the game, Hill explained to reporters \\"with a trace of incredulity\\" in his voice, \\"They didn't double team me.\\" In Michigan's rivalry game against Ohio State in 1969, he had 13 tackles, leading The Michigan Daily to note that Hill had demonstrated to his Ohio State counterpart, All-American Jim Stillwagon, \\"just who is the best middle guard in the conference.\\" =1970 season= Hill was selected as the defensive captain for the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team, serving as co-captain with quarterback Don Moorhead. He started all 10 games as the Wolverines middle guard on defense and accumulated 69 tackles, including 12 tackles for loss. At the end of the 1970 season, Hill was selected by his teammate as the team's Most Valuable Player along with Don Moorhead.(\\"Quarterback Don Moorhead and Middle Guard Henry Hill will share the University of Michigan's Most Valuable Football Player Award, it was announced today.\\") He was also selected by the Central Press Association in 1970 as a first-team All-American and by the Associated Press as a second-team All-American. =Reputation for quickness= Hill developed a reputation as one of the quickest players at his position, as reflected in the following comments from football reporters: *Prior to the 1970 Rose Bowl, a Southern California newspaper said of Hill: \\"Quickness is his biggest asset. He is as fast as any player on the team, has great upper arm and shoulder strength and is strong enough to keep from being knocked out of a play.\\" * In November 1970, the Associated Press ran a feature story referring to Hill as a \\"cat-quick\\" middle guard whose \\"forte is superquick lateral movement.\\" *The Christian Science Monitor referred to Hill as \\"the 'unblockable' middle guard Henry Hill.\\" *The Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Tho not physically imposing at 5-11 and 220 pounds, he uses great quickness to blow past a blocker.\\" When Bo Schembechler took over as Michigan's coach in 1969, Hill acknowledged being \\"a little overweight\\" at 223 pounds. When Hill told the new coach he could run 40 yards in 4.6 seconds, Schembechler said, \\"Aw come on, you're kidding me.\\" To Schembechler's surprise, Hill proceeded to run the 40 in 4.6 seconds. Hill was not selected in the 1971 NFL Draft, and the omission of the \\"cat-quick\\" middle guard was reported as one of the \\"conspicuous absences from the draft lists.\\" Hill noted that he didn't expect to get drafted, although he added he would like a chance to become pro.

In the Stith Thompson Motif Index it is F661.3, described as \\"Skillful marksman shoots apple from man's head\\" or \\"apple shot from man's head\\",Stith Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature: Index A-K : A Classification of Narrative Elements in Folktales, Ballads, Myths, Fables, Mediaeval Romances, Exempla, Fabliaux, Jest-Books, and Local Legends, repr.

It is best known as William Tell's feat.Stith Thompson, p. 783: \\"Tell shoots apple from son's head.\\" Examples =Palnatoki= The earliest known occurrence of the motif is from the 12th century, in Saxo Grammaticus' version of the story of Palnatoki, whom he calls Toko (Gesta Danorum Book 10, chapter 7). > Toko, who had been for some time in the service of the king [Harald > Bluetooth], had, by the deeds in which he surpassed his fellow-soldiers, > made several enemies of his virtues. One day, when he had drunk rather much, > he boasted to those who were at table with him, that his skill in archery > was such that he could hit, with the first shot of an arrow, ever so small > an apple set on the top of a wand at a considerable distance. His detractors > hearing these words, lost no time in conveying them to the ears of the king. > But the wickedness of the prince speedily conveyed the confidence of the > father to the peril of the son, ordering the sweetest pledge of his life to > stand instead of the wand, from whom, if the utterer of the boast did not > strike down the apple which was placed on him at the first shot of his > arrow, he should with his own head pay the penalty of his idle boast. . . . > When the youth was led forth, Toko carefully admonished him to receive the > whiz of the coming arrow as steadily as possible, with attentive ears, and > without moving his head, lest by a slight motion of his body he should > frustrate the experience of his well-tried skill. He made him also, as a > means of diminishing his apprehension, stand with his back to him, lest he > should be terrified at the sight of the arrow. He then drew three arrows > from his quiver, and the first he shot struck the proposed mark. Toko then > being asked by the king why he had taken so many arrows out of his quiver, > when he was to make but one trial with the bow, \\"That I might avenge on > thee,\\" said he, \\"the error of the first by the points of the others, lest my > innocence might hap to be afflicted and thy injustice to go > unpunished!\\"Translation from Thomas Keightley, Tales and Popular Fictions: > Their Resemblance and Transmission from Country to Country, London: > Whittaker, 1834, OCLC 457836365, pp. 293‚Äì94.

Palnatoki later kills the king. =√ûi√∞rekssaga= In the 13th-century √ûi√∞rekssaga,Called Vilkina saga by many scholars writing on the motif chapter 128, Egill, brother of V√∂lund, is commanded by King Nidung to shoot an apple off his three-year-old son's head: > Now the king wished to try whether Egill shot so well as was said or not, so > he let Egill's son, a boy of three years old, be taken, and made them put an > apple on his head, and bade Egill shoot so that the shaft struck neither > above the head nor to the left nor the right.Dasent, p. 404, note 5. Like Palnatoki, he keeps two more arrows to kill the king in case he fails, but the king does not punish him for saying so, but rather praises him: \\"The king took that well from him, and all thought it was boldly spoken.\\" =William Tell= The best-known version of the story is in the legend of William Tell, supposedly happening to start off the Swiss revolution, written first in the 15th-century White Book of Sarnen, then in Aegidius Tschudi's 16th-century Chronicon Helveticum, and later the basis for Friedrich Schiller's 1804 play. Tell is arrested for failing to bow in respect to the hat that the newly appointed Austrian Vogt, Albrecht Gessler, has placed on a pole, and Gessler commands him to shoot an apple off his son's head with a single bolt from his crossbow. After splitting the apple with the single shot (supposedly on November 18, 1307), Tell is asked why he took more than one bolt out; at first he responds that it was out of habit, but when assured he will not be killed for answering honestly, says the second bolt was meant for Gessler's heart should he fail. In Schiller's play, the demand to shoot the apple off the boy's head motivates Gessler's murder. =Malleus Maleficarum= In Heinrich Kramer's 1486 Malleus Maleficarum (Book 2, chapter 16), a related story occurs: Punker of Rohrbach (also spelled Puncker or Puncher) in the Upper Rhineland is said to have been ordered by \\"a very eminent person\\" in about 1430 to prove his extraordinary marksmanship (regarded by Kramer as a sign of consorting with the devil) by shooting a penny off the cap on his young son's head without disturbing the cap. He, too, kept a second arrow in reserve to kill the prince in case he failed.pp. 150‚Äì51.Dasent, p. 404, note 5. =Henning Wulf= Henning Wulf, or von Wulfen, of Wewelsfleth in Holstein sided with Count Gerhard in 1472 and was banished by King Christian I of Denmark. In a folk tale, the king had him shoot an apple off his son's head, and a window in the Wewelsfleth church depicted the boy with an apple on his head, pierced through by the arrow, while Henning's bow was undrawn but there was another arrow between his teeth. Between archer and boy there was a wolf.Karl M√ºllenhoff, Sagen, M√§rchen und Lieder der herzogt√ºmer Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg, revised ed.

Related stories =Hemingr √Åsl√°kson= In Hemings √æ√°ttr √Åsl√°kssonar in the Orkneyinga saga (about 1200), Harald Hardrada challenges the archer Hemingr to shoot a hazelnut off his younger brother Bj√∂rn's head, which he does.Saxo Grammaticus, Danorum regum heroumque historia books x‚Äìxvi: the text of the first edition with translation and commentary in three volumes, ed. Eric Christiansen, Oxford: B.A.R., 1980‚Äì81, , p. 172, note 43. There are two versions of this √æ√°ttr, one set in the Faroes, and in one Hemingr uses a spear to achieve the feat, rather than an arrow.Ebenezer Cobham Brewer and Marion Harland, Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama volume 7, p. 84. Hemingr later takes revenge by shooting the king dead at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.Orkneyinga saga and Magnus saga, with appendices, ed. Gudbrand Vigfusson and Sir George Dasent, The Rolls Series Icelandic Sagas vol. 1, 1887, p. xvi: \\"The Tale of Heming . . . is a mixture of the legend of Tell- Egill and the traditional account of the battle of Stamford Bridge, derived from the Kings' Lives. . . . The link binding the Archer story to the other is the arrow with which Heming slays the king, his foe, in revenge for his wrongs.\\" The √æ√°ttr is Appendix C, pp. 347‚Äì87, in this edition. There are also Norwegian and Faroese ballads on Hemingen unge. =Eindri√∞i Pansa= One related story turns the motif on its head: after matching him in swimming and in other shooting contests, King Olaf of Norway converted Eindri√∞i Pansa (the Splay-Footed) from heathenry by shooting at either a chess piece or a writing tablet on Eindri√∞i's son's head. The king's shot narrowly missed but the boy was unharmed; Eindri√∞i gave in to his mother's and sister's pleas and did not try the feat himself.Grimm, p. 381 ‚Äì writing tablet.\\"Editor's Easy Chair,\\" Harper's new monthly magazine, Volume 58, Issues 343‚Äì348, 1879, p. 461 ‚Äì chess piece.Brewer and Harland, pp. 83‚Äì84, say that this was also an apple, and that Eindri√∞i then shot himself, successfully hitting the apple without harming the boy. Scholarly study The motif was studied and written about as early as 1760 by Gottlieb Emmanuel von Haller and the pastor Simeon Uriel Freudenberger in a pamphlet in French and German with the title Der Wilhelm Tell, ein d√§nisches M√§hrgen (William Tell, a Danish Fable).Jean-Fran√ßois Bergier, Wilhelm Tell: Realit√§t und Mythos, Munich: List, 1990, pp. 80-81. During the 19th century, several scholars wrote about the internationalism of the motif. In 1834 Thomas Keightley noted the similarities between Palnatoki's and Tell's stories.Keightley, p. 295: \\"In the year 1307, among the mountains of Helvetia, an action similar to this of Toko is said to have been performed; and it has given immortality to the name of William Tell\\"; in note 1 he adds Vilkina Saga (√ûi√∞rekssaga), which he theorizes got the story from Saxo. There is a summary of the various versions in Jacob Grimm's Teutonic Mythology,Grimm, pp. 380‚Äì83. and another in John Fiske's Myths and Myth-Makers.Fiske, pp. 3‚Äì6. The most detailed precedes Child's edition of the ballad of \\"Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough, and William of Cloudesly.\\"Child, pp. 14‚Äì22. In an 1877 book on the historicity of the William Tell legend, Ernst Ludwig Rochholz connects the similarity of the Tell legend to the stories of Egil and Palnatoki with legends of a migration from Sweden to Switzerland during the Middle Ages.Ernst Ludwig Rochholz, Tell und Gessler in Sage und Geschichte.

Rochholz had published an article on the topic in 1869, \\"Tell als Zaubersch√ºtze\\"; see the list of publications in Joachim Meyer, Schillers Wilhelm Tell auf seine Quellen zur√ºckgef√ºhrt und sprachlich erl√§utert, Nuremberg: Barbeck, 1876, OCLC 614817741, p. 47. He also adduces parallels in folktales among the Finns and the Lapps (Sami), and also from Norse mythology compares Ullr, called the \\"bow-god\\", Heimdall, and also √ì√∞inn, who according to the Gesta Danorum Book 1, chapter 8.16, is said to have assisted Haddingus by shooting ten arrows from a crossbow in one shot, killing as many foes.Saxo Grammaticus, The History of the Danes: Books I-IX, ed. Hilda Ellis Davidson, tr. Peter Fisher, Cambridge: Brewer, 1979‚Äì80, repr. 1996, 1999, , p. 31.As early as 1845, Kuhn connected William Tell with Robin Hood and √ì√∞inn: Felix Adolph Korn Nork, Andeutungen eines System der Mythologie entwickelt aus der priesterlichen Mysteriosophie und Hierologie des alten Orients, Leipzig: Dyck, 1850, OCLC 26330879, p. 93 . Further comparing Indo-European and Oriental traditions, Rochholz concludes that the legend of the master marksman shooting an apple (or similar small target) was known outside the Germanic sphere and the adjacent regions (Finland and the Baltic) in India, Arabia, Persia and the Balkans (Serbia).Rochholz, pp. 35‚Äì41.

A small to medium-sized bushy tree endemic to the rainforests of tropical Queensland, Australia. It features large leaves with attractive yellow venation, 25 cm (10 in) long by 10 cm (4 in) wide. They are dark green above, and paler and somewhat hairy below. The leaf stalks are hairy. The small (0.7 cm diameter) greenish flowers are fragrant and occur from March to May. They are followed by fruits which mature from September to October, being a black drupe. Regeneration is from fresh seed, after removing the fleshy aril around the seed. The species was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller as Cylicodaphne bindoniana in 1865, before he reclassified and renamed it as Litsea bindoniana in 1882. It was named in honour of Victorian 19th century parliamentarian and agriculturist Samuel Henry Bindon. It is one of eleven species in the large Asian genus Litsea to reach Australia. Litsea bindoniana is found in central and northern Queensland in forests to altitudes of 1000 m (3500 ft). Its fruit are eaten by the superb fruit dove, along with many other lauraceae. It is also a food plant for the blue triangle (Graphium sarpedon) and bronze flat (Netrocoryne repanda). The leaves are used by the tooth-billed catbird (Scenopoeetes dentirostris) to decorate its display court. Litsea bindoniana is suited as a garden plant in tropical situations.

He received a philosophy degree from Cambridge University as well as a doctorate in London from University College. He is notable for smuggling more than 3,000 pieces of Egyptian antiquities out of Egypt by disguising them as reproductions. It has been reported that Tokeley- Parry changed his name to Jonathan Foreman.  Career  In the early 1990s, he smuggled hundreds of antiques out of Egypt by using his knowledge of restoration to camouflage them into look-a-likes. He would then ship them overseas to a duty-free port in order to avoid raising suspicion. He was successful in his endeavors for 4 years before he was caught and put on trial. He was caught when his assistant took 27 papyrus textbooks and took them to be checked for authenticity upon the buyers' request. The evaluator realized that the textbooks were stolen goods from Egypt and reported them right away. He was sentenced to six years for each of the artifact handling charges as well as charged with illegally obtaining a passport. These sentences were to be carried out concurrently. Before this case, he had been involved in another case. All cases were dropped when Tokeley-Parry tried to commit suicide by swallowing hemlock. Just days later he was sentenced to fifteen years hard labor in Egyptian courts. Although sentenced to fifteen years he only served time in a British prison from 1997 until 2000. Tokeley-Parry recruited Mark Parry to assist in his scheme, from the year 1992 - 1993 the two completed a number of trips to Egypt. The way in which they were successful in smuggling these artifacts was through deception. They would paint the artifacts in a translucent plastic material then dip it fully in either gold leaf or paint. They then would alter the hieroglyphics to make them look like fakes and pass them off as tourist junk. He even went as far into camouflaging as to wrap them in wrapping paper from gift shops. Since they began the process by covering the artifact in the clear plastic paint like material, it made it very easy to remove once smuggled into Britain. He sold the pieces to dealers in London and New York for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

A gas slug is a conglomerate of high pressure gas bubbles that forms within certain volcanoes, the agitation of which is a key driving factor in Strombolian eruptions. They start out as small bubbles of gas inside of volcanic magma. These accumulate into one large bubble, which starts to rise through the lava plume. Once this accumulated slug reaches the top of the column and comes in contact with air, it bursts with a loud pop because of the lower air pressure, throwing magma into the air in the typical lava arc of a Strombolian eruption. This type of eruption is episodic, non-damaging to its source vent, and one of the slowest forms of activity, with the ability to sustain itself for thousands of years. Although the effect of gas slugs in lava is well understood, how they form is not well understood, but recent research suggests that they can form as deep as under the surface.

Located along State Route 49 south of the city, both are unusually well-preserved remnants of the architecture of the middle third of the nineteenth century. A native of Pennsylvania, Abraham Studabaker settled in Scioto County, Ohio in 1795; after moving northwest to Warren County, he travelled north and built a cabin in modern-day Darke County in 1808,The History of Darke County, Ohio: Containing A History of the County; Its Cities, Towns, etc.; General and Local Statistics; Portraits of Early Settlers and Prominent Men; History of the Northwest Territory; History of Ohio; Map of Darke County; Constitution of the United States, Miscellaneous Matters, etc., etc. Chicago: Beers, 1880. becoming the first settler within the present boundaries of Adams Township. From the county's earliest years, Studabaker was a prominent member of local society; when Darke County was formed in 1816, he was elected to the county commission.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 308. Moving to Greenville Township in 1815, he built a larger homestead in 1835, but it was a simple structure like that of most period houses. Front of the Studabaker-Scott House In the 1850s, many former pioneers began to expand their homesteads: as prosperity increased, landowners renovated their old houses according to the prevailing architectural styles of the day. Studabaker followed this pattern; his old farmhouse took on a mix of the Early Victorian and Greek Revival architectural styles, and its location along one of the county's most important roads gave his house a prominence enjoyed by few other houses in the area. Located very close to Abraham Studabaker's house is the Beehive School. Built in 1846, it was one of the earliest permanent school buildings ‚Äî in contrast to the primitive log structures built by the first settlers ‚Äî in Darke County. Unlike the Studabaker House, this brick building features elements of the Federal style of architecture., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-07-29. In 1978, the house and school were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the two buildings both qualified for inclusion on the Register, they and a third contributing building were listed together as a single property. Key to their being listed on the Register was their well- preserved historic architecture and their connection to Abraham Studabaker, because of his place as one of the region's leading pioneers.

Plot The main focus of the episode is on Matt Saracen, who must deal with the death of his father, Henry Saracen, a soldier who was killed in combat in Iraq. At the start of the episode, Matt replays a video message on his computer of his father wishing him a Merry Christmas and apologizing for not being able to make it home. Landry and Julie force him to stop playing the video and watch a movie with them to get his mind off things. A wake is then held at the Saracen home. For most of the wake, Matt does not move from his chair, telling Julie that he really doesn't need to go anywhere considering everyone is coming to him. Later, Matt talks to an Army recruiter from the area, who speaks positively of Matt's father, saying that he was a very funny person. Matt becomes angry at this, telling the recruiter he has never seen his father smile before in his whole life. Landry gets Matt away from the recruiter before he is allowed to say anything else, telling Matt that the next night the two of them are going out with the Riggins brothers. At that point, Joe and J.D. McCoy show up at the house, but Matt, already angry and at a loss for words over the two of them showing up, shuts the door in their faces before walking away. The following day, Tami and Matt visit the funeral director to go over the arrangements for the funeral the next day. Matt is unable to pay attention to most of the details after learning that there will be a closed casket. Tami realizes that the closed casket makes many of the proposed details unnecessary, and sees that Matt is too emotionally distraught to handle the situation. She tells Matt that it will be okay for him to wait outside in the car, before telling the funeral director that the two of them need to start over. At home, Matt thanks Julie for her mother's help. Julie notices that Matt is upset and asks if he is alright. Matt says that stuff like this happens and right now it's happening to him, implying that it will eventually happen to Julie. That night, Matt, Landry, and the Riggins brothers go to the Panther football field to drink. Matt tells the three of them that he has to give a speech at the funeral and begins to give a speech on how his father was always miserable, had a wife who hated him, a mother who annoyed him, and reenlisted in the Army four times so that could escape his responsibilities without being called on it. He wonders if it is actually his father in the casket. Tim decides the four of them need to go and find out. They show up at the funeral home and Matt demands to see his father. The funeral director opens the casket, the camera only showing Matt's stunned face as he begins to cry. Later, a drunk Matt shows up at the Taylor house, late for the dinner that was planned for earlier that night. Unable to eat the food given to him, Matt finally breaks down. He confesses to the Taylors that he hates his father and that all he wants to do is say it to his father's face, but he doesn't even have one. Matt then runs out of the house in tears. Eric catches up to him outside and walks him home. At the funeral, Matt gives a speech about a time when his whole family was together shopping at the supermarket and how angry his dad got over the choice of toilet paper that he decided to grab every brand he could find, calling it one of the funniest moments of his childhood. He then goes on to say that even though his father missed many of his birthdays and most of his childhood, he is thankful that his father was a member of the Armed Forces so that he could have birthdays and a childhood. Everyone begins to leave after the funeral ends, but Matt stays behind, takes a shovel from a groundskeeper and begins to bury his father, while Julie looks on in tears. Other plots in this episode included Becky taking part in a local beauty pageant, Vince winning a football award and going to extreme measures to take care of his family, and Luke ending his friendship with J.D. after the events of the previous episode. Becky kisses Tim, but he rebuffs her advances. Luke and Becky also have a one-night-stand after a chance encounter at a convenience store. Reception \\"The Son\\" has received unanimous praise from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a perfect 10, stating \\"this episode was Friday Night Lights reminding us that yes indeed, this is still one of the best shows on television ‚Äì one that can pack a punch like few others can.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix.com stated the episode \\"was probably the season's best balance between moving lots of stories forward while still providing the show's trademark emotional wallop.\\" NY Magazine called the episode a \\"small masterpiece.\\" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode \\"had moments of the usual terrific FNL boisterousness, but for the most part was a solemn affair with beautifully crafted details.\\" While critics praised the episode as a whole, most of the praise went to Zach Gilford's performance in the episode, with NY Magazine stating that it \\"would be downright disrespectful\\" to talk about anything other than his performance. Awards and nominations Soon after the episode aired on NBC, Popeater.com launched a Facebook campaign to get Gilford nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance, with over 8,000 people joining and other media outlets picking up on the campaign before nominations were announced. While Gilford did not receive a nomination, the episode was nominated in the Writing for a Drama Series category, the first time the show was nominated in the category. Time awarded the episode #1 in its ranking of the ten best television episodes of the year. In The Futon Critic's annual \\"Top 50 Episodes of the Year,\\" \\"The Son\\" was named the #3 episode of 2009. On BuddyTV.com's own Top 50 list, the episode came in at #2. The episode was also nominated in the Drama Episode of the Year category for the 2009-2010 Gold Derby TV Awards.

Diogo Fernandes was the first known European captain to visit the island of Socotra in 1503 and the discoverer of the Mascarenes archipelago (R√©union, Mauritius, and Rodrigues) in 1507.Clara Pinto Correia (2003) Return of the crazy bird: the sad, strange tale of the Dodo. New York: Springer. He may also have been the first European to sail east of Madagascar island ('outer route' to the East Indies).  Background  Diogo Fernandes Pereira's name is usually given simply as 'Diogo Fernandes'. He is sometimes referred to as Diogo Fernandes de Set√∫bal (his hometown), to distinguish him from another Indian Ocean adventurer of that period with a similar name, known as Diogo Fernandes de Beja. In older chronicles, (e.g. Dami√£o de G√≥is) his name is also written as Diogo Fernandes 'Piteira' or 'Peteira'. Diogo Fernandes was a Portuguese seaman of obscure background. According to Jo√£o de Barros, he was \\"a native of Set√∫bal, a man much used at sea\\" (muito usado no mar). He served as master on several ships - that is, as third officer, below the pilot and captain, a position which required trained navigational expertise, and may have served as pilot on other occasions. Outer Route and Socotra (1503) In 1503, Diogo Fernandes Pereira was appointed master and captain (a very unusual combination) of a Set√∫bal ship bound for India. How a master was elevated to captain of an India nau (usually a position reserved for nobles or wealthy men who 'paid' for the privilege) is uncertain. One possible conjecture is that the ship was not a crown ship, but a privately outfitted ship. In some secondary accounts, it is said that Diogo Fernandes's ship was named Set√∫bal. That is almost certainly incorrect. Known lists for the armada and the chronicles do not actually give his ship a name, but just call it \\"the ship from/of Set√∫bal\\", a strong suggestion that it might have been privately outfitted by the merchant community of the city of Set√∫bal. If so, that might better explain how Diogo Fernandes got to be captain - the merchants of Set√∫bal just naturally chose to entrust their capital in their most knowledgeable and experienced native son. Diogo Fernandes's Set√∫bal ship was made part of the 5th Portuguese India Armada of Afonso de Albuquerque.Quintella (1839: p.273); chronicler Gaspar Correia suggests, at various points (e.g. p.312, 320), that Fernandes may also have been on one of the ships of the 1502 armada of Vasco da Gama, although this is clearly a mistake as that armada did not return to Lisbon before the 5th Armada left. Fernandes was originally assigned to the third squadron of that fleet, under the vice-admiral Ant√≥nio de Saldanha. But navigational errors (on Saldanha's part) led to the separation of the ships shortly after Cape Verde. Diogo Fernandes was forced to sail on alone. The chronicler Gaspar Correia (p. 418) claims that after doubling the Cape of Good Hope by himself, Fernandes did not turn into the Mozambique Channel, but rather pushed east, sailing under the island of Madagascar, and then turned north, sailing up east of Madagascar. This would make him the first known ship to sail the 'outer route' to the East Indies. (Although there remains the possibility that Diogo Dias also did precisely that in 1500.) Although Correia's account is not corroborated by other chroniclers, Diogo Fernandes Pereira seems to almost certainly have missed Mozambique Island, the usual collection point for Portuguese ships, and where one of his squadron, Rui Louren√ßo Ravasco, was known to be waiting. Instead, we next hear of Fernandes up near Cape Guardafui, which strongly suggests that he did take the outer route, as, sailing north by that route, he would not have sighted African coast before the horn. Around Cape Guardafui, Diogo Fernandes stumbled on the island of Socotra sometime in late 1503. Although the island was long known to eastern merchants (Socotra aloe was a highly valued balm in the markets of Arabia and India), it was unknown to the Portuguese. Diogo Fernandes was also surprised to encounter a strong (Syriac) Christian community on the island (after all, this was a predominantly Muslim region). Diogo Fernandes spent the winter in Socotra, before crossing the Indian Ocean (again by himself) in early 1504. Diogo Fernandes arrived in India just as the Zamorin of Calicut was launching an invasion of Portuguese- allied Cochin. During the ferocious Battle of Cochin (1504), the commander of the Portuguese garrison, Duarte Pacheco Pereira, is said to have placed a certain 'Diogo Pereira' (possibly Diogo Fernandes?) in charge of the nau Concep√ß√£o, protecting the city.Costa (1973) suggests Diogo Fernandes Pereira only discovered Socotra in April, 1504 and left for India only in May, which would suggest he did not make it to Cochin before the battle was largely over, and so this 'Diogo Pereira' must be a different person. But chronicles are very ambiguous on that. Nor do they explain satisfactorily what Fernandes was doing in East Africa up to such a late date, and how he could have missed his comrades Saldanha & Ravasco, who were making a nuisance of themselves all over the area. Late 1503 seems the likelier date for the discovery & 'wintering' in Socotra.  Mascarenes (1507)  Diogo Fernandes returned to Portugal in 1505. His report on Socotra generated much excitement in the Portuguese court. The strategic placement of the island at the mouth of the Red Sea made it an optimal location to station a Portuguese patrol. It could prey on Arab shipping and shut down the competing spice trade through that route. The existence of the isolated Christian community only made it even more appealing (the Portuguese had long hoped to find a Christian port of call in the Muslim- dominated Indian Ocean). Plans were immediately launched to outfit a squadron, under the command of Afonso de Albuquerque, to seize the island for Portugal. The Socotra squadron was adjoined to the 8th Armada of 1506 led by Trist√£o da Cunha. Diogo Fernandes himself sailed on it, albeit only as a master of Albuquerque's ship, the Cisne ('the Swan', usually transcribed as Cirn√©). In late 1506, when the 8th Armada made the usual stop in Mozambique Island, the admiral Trist√£o da Cunha ordered a pause in the expedition to explore the island of Madagascar (then known as the ilha de S√£o Louren√ßo). During this interlude, it is speculated that Albuquerque (uninterested in such exploratory ventures) elected to stay in Mozambique, and temporarily passed his ship, the Cirn√©, over to the command of the master Diogo Fernandes Pereira.Appendix in Le Guat (1891, v2.: 316) Detail of Mascarenes islands from a Dutch map of 1689, with some of the earlier names of the islands. Diogo Fernandes is said to have struck a wide arc east of Madagascar and stumbled upon the island of R√©union, which he promptly named ilha de Santa Apollonia (in honor of the St. Apollonia who's day it was, February 9, 1507). He proceeded east to discover the island of Mauritius, which he named ilha do Cirne (the name of his ship). From there Fernandes went further east and discovered the island now known as Rodrigues, but which at the time was named on maps as the ilha de Diogo Fernandes, Domigo Friz or Domingo Frias (the latter two probably just poor cartographic transcriptions or abbreviations of 'Diogo Fernandes'). He is said to have stopped for water at the first and third islands, before returning to Mozambique.Pinto-Correia (2003: 24) Diogo Fernandes island ('Domigo Friz') was visited by Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509 and the name 'Don Galopes' (another transcribed abbreviation) sometimes appears for that island in some maps.Appendix in Le Guat (1891, v.2: p.316) It went through its final name change, to Rodrigues island much later, after another Portuguese explorer Diogo Rodrigues visited the area in 1528. The entire archipelago was named the Mascarenes islands, after D. Pedro Mascarenhas, who visited the islands in 1512, following up on Sequeira's report.  Afterwards  After returning from his Mascarene jaunt, Diogo Fernandes Pereira went on to participate with Albuquerque in the conquest of Socotra that summer. We have no more records of him afterwards. If Diogo Fernandes remained aboard the Cirne after Socotra, he would have participated in the battle of Hormuz in the Fall of 1507, but we have no record of him there. More importantly, we have no record of his participation (or non-participation) in the mutiny against Albuquerque at Hormuz. We do know Albuquerque elevated a certain 'Dinis Fernandes' to replace one of the mutinous captains; and we also know a certain 'Diogo Pereira' was involved in presenting the mutinous captains' petition to the vice-roy in Cochin. But there is no evidence or suggestion that either of these men can be identified with Diogo Fernandes Pereira.

The school gained its current name in 1958 in honor of John Motley Morehead III, the grandson of John Motley Morehead, who donated to a number of projects for the school. Among these projects were Carillon Bells and a football stadium and fieldhouse.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/morehead-john-motley-iii Four building projects expanded the high school: a classroom and auditorium building in 1960, a library in 1968, a gymnasium in 1981, and the cafeteria and science building in 1991. Students from the former historically African American high school Douglass high school were integrated into Morehead's student body in the fall of 1966. The industrial education center was housed on the school's campus through 1966. It became a countywide setting for vocational training. Later, it was removed and re-established at Rockingham Community College located in Wentworth, North Carolina. Over the years, Morehead became the largest of the schools in the Rockingham County Schools school district and in the state of North Carolina. As of August 2016, 53% of students are White, 22% of students are African American, and 25% of students are of other ethnicities. Curriculum Morehead provides students a variety of subjects and courses to take for either a standard or advanced diploma such as Math, science, Social Studies, English, and also Foreign language classes, Theater Arts etc. Programs MHS also runs an Army Junior Reserve Officers%27 Training Corps (JROTC) program for students who may join the army instead of attending a College or four-year institution.

Bell Building is a historic building located at 2326 1st Avenue in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle Washington. The building was named for Austin Americus Bell, son of one of Seattle's earliest pioneers, but built under the supervision of his wife Eva following Bell's unexpected suicide in 1889 soon after proposing the building.Dorpat, Paul. Seattle Now & Then. 1st ed. Seattle, WA: Tartu Publications, 1984. 59. Print. It was designed with a mix of Richardsonian, Gothic and Italianate design elements by notable northwest architect, Elmer Fisher, who designed many of Seattle's commercial buildings following the Great Seattle fire. The Bell Building, along with the adjacent Barnes and Hull Buildings, form the nucleus of a development attempt in Belltown in the 1890s that never materialized. Early on, the building earned the moniker of Bell's Folly for being built so far away from the central business district in the then underdeveloped and economically depressed Belltown neighborhood, named for Bell's father, William Nathaniel Bell, once landowner of the entire north end of Seattle. The area today is considered the heart of Belltown and the Bell building remains one of Belltown's most historic landmarks. The building fell into disrepair throughout most of the 20th century, eventually losing its massive cornice to a fire in 1913. The building was first surveyed in June 1969 and included on the Municipal Art Commission List of Historic Buildings, at which time it was nominated for inclusion on the National Register. It was finally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1974.Corley, Margaret. \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination form.\\" Washington State Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation. National Park Service, 06-1969. Web. 29 Jul 2010. link It also became a Seattle City Landmark in 1978. The upper floors stayed vacant until the 1990s, sustaining much weather damage in the meantime and later being destroyed by fire. Most of the building was rebuilt behind the main facade in 1997‚Äì1998 and now houses condominiums with a Starbucks Coffee on the first level. Architecture The Austin A. Bell Building is a four-story structure of brick with Terra cotta ornamentation. Both brick and Terra cotta are of a distinct reddish-orange hue and the mortar joints are narrow. Its architect, Elmer H. Fisher would later design many of the buildings in the Pioneer Square district of Seattle. While Fisher's designs were predominantly Richardsonian, the Bell Building is less so, with several Gothic elements thrown into the mix. The ground floor served as a commercial space for two businesses and the windows are large for display purposes. Slender cast iron columns frame the recessed doorway. Wooden decorative panels appear above the transom of the double doors. A single door in an arched entry way at the south end of the storefront provides access to the upper floors. cast iron columns support the small arch and a decorative wooden panel also appears above the doorway. Rock faced stone columns on either side of the doorway and storefront continue for the first story only and then are extended by brick pilasters to the full height of the building. The brick pilasters above the doorway continue above the fourth story to form a small tower. The tower is flat-roofed now but was originally capped by a shallow-pitched roof.

Windows occur in sets of three above the commercial section of the ground floor in pairs on either side of bordering pilasters. Single windows are placed on each floor above the south doorway. All windows on the second floor are tall and rectangular and the central group of three windows are separated by cast iron columns. The same pattern is repeated on the third and fourth floors although flanking openings on the third floor have segmental pointing arches and the narrow fourth-floor windows are fully arched. Terra cotta decorations appear above window openings on the second and third floors. A high parapet extends above the fourth floor and it is composed of a more coarse brick than is the rest of the facade. This is the scar remaining from a large cornice, either made of pressed tin or Terra cotta, that was removed from the building after a 1913 fire, harming its architectural integrity greatly. The pilasters continue through the parapet and the central pilasters and recessed within a brick equilateral arch is a Terra cotta wheel window design flanked at the base by Terra cotta fillets filling out the base of the arch. The interior once featured a central courtyard that spanned the top three floors. It was lighted by a set of three large skylights. The interior finishing and moldings were typical for the time period and much of it was salvaged during the building's reconstruction in 1997. History =The Bell family and Belltown= Austin Americus Bell was the only son of William N. Bell, one of Seattle's founders and a member of the Denny Party that landed at Alki Point on November 13, 1851 on the schooner Exact. His land claim, adjacent to those of the Denny and Boren families, developed into the community of Belltown, which would later be absorbed by Seattle. Austin was born on January 9, 1854 in a log cabin across from the present site of the Bell Building, the second male white child born in the city. The cabin was destroyed in 1856 during The Battle of Seattle. Fed up with the instability of the area, the Bell family removed to California, where they remained for several years. Following the death of William Bell's wife in 1870, the family moved back to Seattle, now much more built up then when they had left. Austin however remained in San Francisco where he had built up a career in real estate. The value of Bell's property had skyrocketed in the previous years and he proceeded to make improvements to the land. In 1877, he constructed a two- story wooden building for the Odd Fellows on the site where his son's building would eventually stand. In late 1883, the senior Bell completed his last great project, the four story wooden Bell Hotel at the corner of First and Battery Streets, adjacent to the Odd Fellows Hall. Suffering from mental illness in his later years, William Bell died September 8, 1887 at the age of 70. He left to Austin a quarter his estate valued at $400,000, which continued to increase in value. Bell soon became one of Seattle's wealthiest citizens. =Austin Bell's plans and final years= During his father's illness and subsequent death, Austin began to see signs of similar mental illness in himself, now thought to be Alzheimer's disease. Austin was living and working in Seattle as a printer at the Puget Sound Dispatch when he was severely injured in a fireworks explosion on July 4, 1872. The explosion severely lacerated the lower part of his face, removing all the incisors from his lower jawbone. He had spent most of his life in San Francisco and many years traveling to seek medical treatment to restore his health, while retaining a real estate office in Seattle. Upon returning to Seattle in 1889, he made plans to erect a large brick building on the property he inherited just south of his father's hotel, since renamed the Bellevue House. On April 23, 1889, he took his nephew, William M. Coffman, on a buggy ride to share his plans. The next morning, his demeanor had changed and he was suffering from indigestion. He went to his realty office as usual, locked the door behind him and shot himself in the head. A neighboring merchant heard the shot and rushed across the street to tell a pharmacist that a murder must have occurred. After summoning a doctor, several men broke down Bell's door to find him dead by his own hand. He was 35. A suicide note to Eva was discovered stating that he did not consider life with poor health worth living and expressed sorrow that he must take this way out. =The Bell Building= Eva carried out her husband's plans, drawn by local architect Elmer Fisher, and dedicated the building in her husband's name. Completed in 1890, the building adorned in stone, pressed red brick shipped in from San Francisco and red Terra cotta cost $50,000 and was hailed as one of the showiest buildings in the city. The building contained two store rooms on the first floor and 63 apartments above, dubbed The Belle Apartments; the owners having parlayed Bell's name into the French word for fine or pretty.[Insurance Map]. 1:50.

Pool tables were manufactured in the building in the early 1900s. In the early morning of May 12, 1913, a fire from a nearby building destroyed the roof and upper floor of the Bell Building, leading to the loss of most of the architectural elements above the roof line. At the time of the fire the top floor held a fully occupied boarding lodge known as The Sioux, but no lives were lost in the fire.\\"Famous Old Bell Block Scene of Nasty Blaze\\" Seattle Times 12 May 1913. Pg. 1. In 1937, for $9,800, the building was added to bargain real estate tycoon (and later Samis Foundation founder) Sam Israel's stock of low-maintenance properties. Like most of Israel's property, he kept the roof fixed, rented the retail space for cheap, and left the upper floors vacant.Seven, Richard. \\"The Collector ‚Äì Decades Sam Israel Bought Cheap and Never Sold.

Pfannenstiel left PG&E; in 2000, becoming an energy consultant, providing advice to companies working in the field of wind power and to local housing authorities about energy use. On April 20, 2004, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Pfannenstiel to a four-year term as a member of the California Energy Commission, a board with responsibility for power plant licensing, building and appliance efficiency standards, and energy policy development. She became Chair of the Commission in June 2006. Her term on the Commission expired in January 2009. President of the United States Barack Obama nominated Pfannenstiel as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Installations and Environment). After Senate confirmation, she assumed the office on March 5, 2010. In 2013, Pfannenstiel co-founded Advanced Microgrid Systems (AMS) with Susan Kennedy, CEO AMS, former regulator on the California Public Utilities Commission, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's Chief of Staff. According to the company's website AMS uses energy storage, data analytics, and software control to operate a fleet of energy storage systems for large scale applications in electricity grid management. AMS is one of the early providers of utility scale energy storage, receiving a contract for 50 megawatt-hours of storage from utility Southern California Edison in July, 2015.  Death  Pfannenstiel died in Piedmont California on April 26, 2017 at the age of 69 from breast cancer.

Garrick Mallery (April 25, 1831 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania - October 24, 1894) was an American ethnologist specializing in Native American sign language and pictographs. Family His father was Judge Garrick Mallery, who was born April 17, 1784, and graduated at Yale College in 1808. He was a member of the Pennsylvania legislature from 1827 to 1830, and was distinguished for the zeal with which he promoted prison reform. In 1831 he was appointed judge of the third judicial district, composed of the counties of Berks, Northampton, and Lehigh. He resigned from the bench in 1836 and removed to Philadelphia, where he practiced as a lawyer for many years. He died in Philadelphia on the 6th of July, 1866. Garrick's mother, the judge's second wife, was descended from John Harris, Jr., the founder of Harrisburg, and from William Maclay, one of the first United States Senators from Pennsylvania. Education Mallery received an excellent early education and was prepared by a private tutor for his entrance into his father's alma mater, Yale College, where he matriculated in his fifteenth year. He graduated in 1850. Three years later, he received the degree of LL.B. from the University of Pennsylvania. In the same year he was admitted to the bar in Philadelphia and commenced practice there. He devoted some of his leisure time to editorial and literary work, and was steadily advancing in professional standing when the Civil War began in 1861. Military career Mallery was a volunteer and served as a first-lieutenant in the 71st Pennsylvania Infantry. On June 30, 1862, he was severely wounded at Peach Orchard (Allen's Farm) during the Seven Days Battles in Virginia. Having been left on the battlefield unable to move, he was captured and sent to Libby Prison, in Richmond. Upon being exchanged some time later, he was sent to his home in Philadelphia. When recovered, he returned to the field and, in February, 1863, was commissioned as lieutenant colonel of the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry. During the military occupation of Virginia, Mallery was appointed judge advocate of the First Military District. He was honorably mustered out of the volunteer service in November, 1866, and at the same time accepted a commission in the regular army as captain, with an assignment to the 43rd Infantry, where he received the brevet commissions of major, lieutenant-colonel, and colonel for \\"gallant and meritorious services during the war.\\" Beginning in 1870, he was on duty with the Signal Corps for almost ten years and served as executive officer, until he was posted to field duty in 1876. Due to his old wounds rendering him unfit for strenuous work, he was retired at his own request in 1879. Bureau of American Ethnology During Mallery's tenure with the Signal Corps, he was briefly stationed at Fort Rice in Dakota Territory, where the indigenous system of communication by signs and gestures attracted his attention. He began to make note of them, which led to a parallel investigation of the pictographs on rocks, skins, and bark, of which he made a large number of transcriptions. He foresaw that these customs would ultimately be lost and forgotten as the Indians were brought more and more under the control of the authorities. Before Mallery began his researches it was generally supposed that the pictographs, some of which were believed to be of pre-Columbian origin, were simply pictures and devoid of meaning. He was gradually convinced that gesture-speech and the cognate pictographs formed a complete system, involving mythology and history and having an important relation to the spoken language. In 1877, as a result of this work, he was ordered to report to Major John Wesley Powell, who was doing a survey of the Rocky Mountain region. Later, when Mallery retired from the Army, Powell arranged for his appointment as an ethnologist with the Bureau of American Ethnology, which had been established that year. The first result was the publication, in 1880, of a pamphlet of 72 pages, with 33 figures, entitled \\"Introduction to the Study of Sign-language among the North American Indians as Illustrating the Gesture-speech of Mankind\\". This was intended as a manual for students so, and in the same year, there followed a quarto volume of 329 pages, \\"A Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals of the North American Indians, with Some Comparisons.\\" The latter work was distributed to collaborators only. In 1881 Mallery's second important contribution was published in the First Annual Report of the Bureau, namely, \\"Sign-language among North American Indians Compared with that Among other People and Deaf- mutes.\\" This treatise comprised 290 pages and was illustrated with 13 plates, a map, and 285 figures. While intended by its author as a preliminary report only, it is now considered to be the first authoritative exposition upon an almost entirely new subject in the field of anthropology. Mallery's next publication appeared in the Fourth Annual Report of the Bureau, under the title, \\"Pictographs of the North American Indians; a Preliminary Paper.\\" It consisted of 256 pages, illustrated with 83 plates and 209 figures. Finally, the Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau was devoted to Mallery's completed work on one of his subjects of investigation. It was entitled, \\"Picture-writing of the American Indians,\\" filling 807 quarto pages, with 54 plates and 1,290 figures. At the time of his death, Mallery was preparing a treatise on the sign-language of the American Indians, intended to be a companion work to \\"Picture-writing\\". This, unfortunately, was left unfinished and had to be completed by his colleagues at the Bureau. Other activities In addition to the foregoing writings, Mallery was the author of many short critical essays. His \\"Israelite and Indian\\", which compared the two cultures, was notable for stirring up a brief controversy. He founded and later served as President of Washington's Anthropological Society . He was also involved with the Literary Society of Washington, where he was a member of the General Committee for many years and served as its President in 1888. His address on retiring from that office had for its subject \\"Philosophy and Specialties.\\" In it he insisted upon the importance of using a correct and elegant style of writing in scientific papers.

The company is noted for pushing public discussion on health incentive issues, and for launching programs that use various combinations of cash prizes, financial commitment, social motivation and positive peer pressure to achieve weight loss and fitness results at the corporate and consumer levels.  Services  HealthyWage develops programming based on academic and industry research on the impact of financial incentives and social networking on the effectiveness of wellness program outcomes. HealthyWage programs are available directly to consumers and also through many large employers, including Fortune 500 companies, school districts, state and local governments and other employers. The HealthyWager program allows participants to \\"bet\\" on their weight loss. Each participant uses the HealthyWager prize calculator to find out what cash prize HealthyWage will pay based on how much the participant is willing to \\"wager,\\" how much weight the participant wants to lose, and how much time the participant needs to reach that weight loss goal. Participants who achieve their goal in the agreed timeframe win the prize. The model provides a double incentivization in the form of loss aversion and the opportunity to gain. The $10,000 Team Challenge is a weight loss competition in which teams of five use teamwork and tools to lose weight over a period of time (usually 90 days). HealthyWage pays a large prize to the participants with the greatest percentage weight loss. The team wins as a group, so every team member has a stake in every other team member's success. HeatlhyWage Jackpot Challenges are weight loss competitions in which individuals and teams (generally 4 to 9 teammates) compete to lose a set percentage of their body weight by the end of the challenge. Each participant pays a fee into the \\"pot\\" at the beginning of the challenge. At the end of the challenge, all of the successful participants and/or teams win an equal share of the pot. HeatlhyWage Step Challenges use activity-tracking devices to allow individuals and teams to compete for cash prizes and to increase their physical activity. Participants each pay a fee into the \\"pot\\" at the beginning of the challenge. Participants that meet their activity goal by the end of the challenge (typically by increasing their average daily steps by a given percentage) win an equal share of the pot. Weight loss and fitness competitions reflect a broader trend in consumer and corporate fitness around using games and money to provide accountability and motivation for health- related activities ranging from weight loss to regular gym use, healthy eating and smoking cessation.Shellenbarger, Sue (2013-01-08). \\"Office Weight-Loss Contests Rise, Saboteurs and All\\".

Marquez, went to Diaz's hometown of Houston to face him at the Toyota Center in February 2009 in what turned out to be an all-action slugfest, one that Marquez won via ninth-round knockout.  Build up  Juan D√≠az was a 3-1 underdog for his rematch against Juan Manuel M√°rquez, but the Houston fighter employed unimpeachable logic to argue that he would be victorious before the battle. In the rematch, D√≠az, 26, intended to fine-tune rather than overhaul his game plan since he dictated the action and manhandled M√°rquez for much of the first fight before M√°rquez, 36, identified and exploited the chinks in his armour. Without revealing too much of his strategy, D√≠az said his key to victory involved a delicate balance between brain, brawn, offense and defense.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nb/bellaire/news/7120564.html M√°rquez, at 36 ten years older than his opponent, retained his WBO and WBA lightweight titles, and won this rematch by outpunching D√≠az 288 to 155 on blows which connected. M√°rquez broke D√≠az' lip to pieces with hard left jabs and hard overhand rights that scored, backing D√≠az up during this bout. M√°rquez had a swollen right eye, but it was not a factor. The fight was a clean one. D√≠az, a loser of four of his last six bouts, was studying for his law school entrance exam in preparation for a career change before the M√°rquez bout. 140 pound champion Amir Khan was in attendance and was mentioned as a possible future opponent for M√°rquez.

It represents a well-preserved cross-section of residential architecture dating coverint a 200-year period, from about 1740 to 1934. It includes the c. 1730 Bush-Holley House, a historic house museum which is a National Historic Landmark for it role in the Cos Cob art colony. There are 28 primary contributing buildings in the district. Most of the buildings are wood frame structures between one and three stories in height; the notable exceptions are two of the later houses, which are Tudor Revival in style and have brick and stucco exteriors. and The Cos Cob area was settled in the 17th century as a colonial maritime community, at first by Dutch settlers (as part of New Netherland) and later by English settlers. The Strickland Road area was known as the Lower Landing, and flourished in the 18th century, particularly through the efforts of David Bush, the Dutch builder of the Bush-Holley House. It was primarily a transportation center, with packet boats serving other area ports, and some of the finer houses on Strickland Road were built by sea captains. The area declined in importance after the packet boats were supplanted by the railroad in the mid-19th century, and became a residential enclave. Its last major industrial site, a tidal grist mill, burned in 1899. Most of the buildings in the district date to the early 20th century, in the Bungalow and Tudor Revival styles popular at that time.

She was not an employee of the United States Post Office Department, which did not hire or employ mail carriers for star routes, but rather awarded star route contracts to persons who proposed the lowest qualified bids, and who, in accordance with the department‚Äôs application process, posted bonds and sureties to substantiate their ability to finance the route. Once a contract was awarded, the contractor could then drive the route themselves, sublet the route, or hire an experienced driver. Some individuals obtained multiple star route contracts and conducted the operations as a business. Fields had the star route contract for the delivery of U.S. mail from Cascade, Montana, to Saint Peter's Mission in 1885. She drove the route for two four-year contracts, from 1895 to 1899 and from 1899 to 1903. Author Miantae Metcalf McConnell provided documentation discovered during her research about Mary Fields to the United States Postal Service Archives Historian in 2006. This enabled the USPS to establish Mary Fields' contribution as the first African- American female star route mail carrier in the United States.  Biography  = Early life and career = Born into slavery in Hickman County, Tennessee, around 1832, Fields was freed when slavery was outlawed in the United States in 1865. She then worked in the home of Judge Edmund Dunne. When Dunne's wife Josephine died in 1883, in San Antonio, Florida, Fields took the family's five children to their aunt, Mother Mary Amadeus, the mother superior of an Ursuline convent in Toledo, Ohio. In 1884, Mother Amadeus was sent to Montana Territory to establish a school for Native American girls at St. Peter's Mission, west of Cascade. Learning that Amadeus was stricken with pneumonia, Fields hurried to Montana to nurse her back to health. Amadeus recovered, and Fields stayed at St. Peter's, hauling freight, doing laundry, growing vegetables, tending chickens, and repairing buildings, and eventually became the forewoman. The Native Americans called Fields \\"White Crow\\", because \\"she acts like a white woman but has black skin\\". In 1894, after several complaints and an incident with a disgruntled male subordinate that involved gunplay, the bishop ordered her to leave the convent. Mother Amadeus helped her open a restaurant in nearby Cascade. Fields would serve food to anyone, whether they could pay or not, and the restaurant closed due to bankruptcy about 10 months later. = Postal service = When she was about 60 years old, Fields was hired as a mail carrier because she was the fastest applicant to hitch a team of six horses. This made her the first African-American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service. She drove the route with horses and a mule named Moses. She never missed a day, and her reliability earned her the nickname \\"Stagecoach\\". If the snow were too deep for her horses, Fields delivered the mail on snowshoes, carrying the sacks on her shoulders. = Later life = She was a respected public figure in Cascade, and the town closed its schools to celebrate her birthday each year.

Reception Chasing Mummies has been largely panned by critics, who write that Hawass is unlikeable and that the show is not an authentic documentary series. Summarizing the show, New York Times columnist Neil Genzlinger writes, \\"[O]ne hopes that this show will, like some of those ancient pharaohs, die young, or that Dr. Hawass will unearth some ancient Egyptian chill pills and swallow a generous helping.\\" He said that a segment showing an intern locked in a pyramid did not seem genuine, and that the show is \\"intent on forcing drama into the proceedings in a way that seems artificial.\\" According to Genzlinger, due to the comedic nature of many of the interactions depicted, it is not hard to speculate that Dr. Hawass, the producer, and cast are filming what turns out to be a running inside joke between themselves.Television Review: 'Chasing Mummies' - The Pharaoh of Egyptian Antiquities, Neil Genzlinger, The New York Times, 13 July 2010 (retrieved 29 July 2010) TVGA describes the show as \\"a reality series in the tradition of Bravo's Flipping Out.

For many years he was President of France's chapter of the International Society for Contemporary Music. He also served on the music council of UNESCO. In 1961 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of the L√©gion d'honneur. Life and career Born in Paris, Capdevielle studied at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1924 to 1926. While there he was a pupil of Armand Fert√© (piano), Andr√© Gedalge (counterpoint and fugue), Isidor Philipp (piano), and Paul Vidal (composition). After leaving the conservatoire he studied privately with Vincent d'Indy. During the 1930s, Capdevielle began working as an opera conductor with theatres in the French provinces. He also worked as a music critic for Monde musicale and Revue musicale. In 1942 he became a professor of chamber music at the Conservatoire de Paris and also served on the school's jury of examiners. In 1944 he was appointed the Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise's director of the chamber music. He formed a special chamber orchestra at the RTF in 1952 with whom he conducted concerts on tour throughout Europe up through 1964. He died in Bordeaux at the age of 63.

Early years Moisey Volfovich Vinnitsky was born into the family of a Jewish wagon-builder, Meyer-Volf Mordkovich Vinnitsky, according to some records in stanitsa Golta (today is part of Pervomaisk). Vinnitsky was around 4 years old when his family moved to Odessa (Moldavanka). Other records state that he was born into the family of a seaport serviceman (bindyuzhnik) at 23 Hospital Street (today Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street) in Odessa (Moldavanka). Vinnitsky's mother, Doba Zelmanovna, gave birth to five sons and a daughter. Upon his birth he received a double name, Moisey-Yakov (Moses-Jacob), similar to his father. Because such a double name was uncommon in Russian culture, Vinnitsky's second name was sometimes recorded as the paternal name‚ÄîMoisey Yakovlevich. Sometime in 1897 Mishka lost his father. At first he worked at a mattress factory as a trainee, while also attending the Jewish school (presumably heder).¬´–ü—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞¬ª (1912 ‚Äî –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—å 1917 –≥.) –∏ ¬´–°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª-–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç¬ª (1908‚Äî1917 –≥–≥.) –æ –ó–∞–∫–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—å–µ: —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ Later, as an electrician, he received a job at the \\"Anatra\\" factory. At the time of the Jewish pogroms in October 1905 Vinnitsky participated in the Jewish self-defense. Later he joined the organization of anarchists-communists Molodaya Volya (Young Will). It was probably during that time that he received his famous street name, \\"Mishka the Japanese\\", presumably for the shape of his eyes. Another version suggests that he began to be recognized by this name after he narrated a story that he heard from a Portuguese sailor to his Odessa friends about a Japanese gang from Nagasaki. The story was about Japanese gangsters who set up rules for their \\"business\\" and never trespassed them.

In 1907 Vinnitsky was sentenced to death by hanging for the assassination of the chief of the Mikhailov police precinct in Odessa V.Kozhukhar,. This sentence was later commuted to a term of 12 years' hard labor (katorga). According to legend, Vinnitsky made a special boot-shining box in which he placed explosives. Vinnitsky would sit on the corner of Dalnytska Street and Steep Street and ask passers-by if they wanted their boots cleaned. This activity was annoying the chief of the local precinct. One day, however, a slightly-inebriated precinct chief placed his boot on the cleaning box. After cleaning his boots, Vinnitsky lit the explosives and managed to run away, leaving his client to face his end. While serving time, Vinnitsky became acquainted with Grigoriy Kotovskiy.–ú–∏—à–∫–∞ ¬´–Ø–ø–æ–Ω—á–∏–∫¬ª: –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã Revolution During the amnesty issued by the Russian Provisional Government in 1917 Yaponchik returned to his hometown (Odessa) where he organized his gang to the extent of nearly taking control of the city. During the evacuation from the city of the last retreating Austrian and German forces on 12 December 1918 Yaponchik made a successful raid on the city jail freeing numerous detainees. During the occupation of Odessa by the Entente forces (French, Greeks, and British) in 1919 he cooperated with the Bolshevik underground (including Kotovskiy). Yaponchik was also well acquainted with Naftaly Frenkel and Lazar Veyssbeyn (Leonid Utyosov) who later became one of the most popular singers in the Soviet Union and vouched for Yaponchik as a humane gangster (avoided killings, sponsored local artists). Once, to prevent his banditism, he was arrested by the counter-intelligence service (chief ‚Äì General Shilling) of the Denikin's Volunteer Army. After about half an hour, his place of detention was visited by a cavalcade of phaetons and horse driven cabs (prolyotkas) with numerous gangsters holding grenades. Upon request to release Yaponchik the latter exited the building in less than 15 minutes. Yaponchik is known for his aphorisms such as \\"Don't shoot in the air‚Äîdon't leave witnesses\\", \\"The dead have the shortest tongues\\", \\"The dead won't sell out\\". After Odessa was taken by the Red Army, some evidence suggests him being in charge of an armored train to defeat the mutinied Otaman Grigoriev. =54th Soviet Regiment= In May 1919 he was allowed to form his own military unit for the Soviet forces that fell under the command of the 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army. The unit was later reformed into the 54th Lenin's Soviet Revolutionary Regiment. Yaponchik's assistant (adjutant) was Meyer Zayder, nicknamed Mayorchik (as diminutive of Major), who later killed Grigoriy Kotovskiy in 1925. The regiment consisted of the Odessa's former convicts, anarchist militia, and the newly mobilized students of the Novorossiya University. The Red-Army men of Yaponchik did not have a uniform, which was not uncommon in many military formations that were drafted by Bolsheviks. Many of them wore boaters and top hats; however, almost everyone considered to be honorary to wear what is known as telnyashka (a sailor's shirt).–°–∏–±–∏—Ä—Ü–µ–≤ –ê. –û–¥–µ—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –±–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–∏—è. // –°–ï–ì–û–î–ù–Ø.UA. ‚Äî 10 –ò—é–Ω—è 2008, 08:58. The regiment was reassigned to Kotovskiy's Brigade under the command of the 45th division led by a Bessarabian Jewish Iona Yakir. In July 1919 Yaponchik's forces were engaged in a fight against the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic that were often exclusively associated with Symon Petliura, the Ukrainian national leader who led Ukraine's struggle for independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Yaponchik's men rendezvoused with the Ukrainians near the town of Birzula (today's Kotovsk), where they successfully managed to take the town of Vapnyarka in Podolie (near Vinnytsia, dozens of miles away), securing several military prisoners and trophies. However, after a counter-attack, the regiment fled and many soldiers deserted. What happened afterward is covered in mystery. There are some suggestions that the regiment mutinied, and, after securing a couple of trains, tried to return to Odessa. Another version of the story tells that the higher command tried to isolate Yaponchik from the rest of his troops and ordered him to head towards Kyiv. Yaponchik, however (with a company-size security) did not go to Kyiv, but rather turned towards Odessa. He was ambushed by the Cheka about a mile away from the town of Voznesensk and was killed in a clay quarry during the arrest by uyezd military commissar Nikifor Ursulov on 29 July 1919 at eight o'clock in the morning.–í–æ–π–Ω–∞ –≤ —Ü–∏–ª–∏–Ω–¥—Ä–∞—ÖVoronkov, Vyacheslav. \\"Novyie Izvestiya\\". 30 July 1919.

He surpassed Dan Quisenberry and Jeff Montgomery who both had 45 save seasons. 2014-2016 Holland had his second straight All-Star year in 2014, converting 46 of 48 save opportunities while compiling a 1.44 ERA. He appeared in eight games in the postseason leading up to the Royals World Series appearance, posting a 1.13 ERA over 8 innings and earning 6 saves. He tied a playoff series record by saving 4 games in the ALCS (matching Dennis Eckersley's record in the 1988 ALCS), the first since John Wetteland in the 1996 World Series. On October 22, Holland won the inaugural Mariano Rivera Award for his outstanding performance as a closer. Two days later in Game 3 of the World Series he saved his record-tying seventh game of the postseason, sharing the record with Wetteland, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge and Koji Uehara. After serving the bulk of the 2015 season as the Royals' closer, compiling 32 saves with a 3.83 ERA, doctors discovered in late September that Holland had a \\"significant tear\\" in his right ulnar collateral ligament. On September 22, the Royals announced that Holland's season was over, and that he would likely require Tommy John surgery. On September 29, the team confirmed that Holland was scheduled to undergo the surgery on October 2, and that he would likely miss most, if not all, of the 2016 season. With the Royals finishing the season 95‚Äì67, the team won the 2015 World Series against the New York Mets, their first title in 30 years. After the 2015 season, Holland was granted free agency. Holland missed the entire 2016 season as he continued to recover from Tommy John surgery. =Colorado Rockies= On January 26, 2017, Holland signed a one-year contract with the Colorado Rockies. On April 3, he earned his first save since September 17, 2015, defeating the Milwaukee Brewers on his Rockies debut and Opening Day. Holland won the National League Reliever of the Month Award for April. On Mother's Day, Holland broke the Rockies franchise record of converting 16 consecutive saves to start a season, formerly held by Jos√© Jim√©nez, which he had set in 2002. Holland won his second consecutive NL Reliever of the Month Award for the month of May, going for 20-for-20 in save opportunities, a 1.31 ERA and 0.82 WHIP through May. He was selected to his third All-Star Game, played at Marlins Park in Miami. At that point, he saved an MLB-best 28 of 29 chances with a 1.62 ERA and opponents batted .162/.264/.259. He slumped in August, allowing 14 earned runs in innings. At the season's end, Holland had tied the Rockies franchise record for saves in one season while tying for the National League lead with Los Angeles Dodgers' Kenley Jansen. Holland's ERA was 3.61, and he qualified for enough incentives to increase his salary from the base $9 million to $15 million. Having a player option for 2018, he chose not to exercise it, making him a free agent. He won the NL Comeback Player of the Year Award. =St. Louis Cardinals= Holland signed a one-year, $14 million, contract with the St. Louis Cardinals on March 31, 2018. The Cardinals assigned him to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League to ensure his conditioning before promoting him to the major leagues. In his major league debut with the club versus the Milwaukee Brewers on April 10, he appeared in the tenth inning and walked four batters, including walking a run to Orlando Arcia, which led to a 5‚àí4 loss. On May 26, 2018, after putting up a 9.45 ERA for the 2018 season, the Cardinals put Holland on the 10-day disabled list with a hip impingement. After compiling a 7.92 ERA and a 2.24 WHIP in 25 relief innings pitched, Holland was designated for assignment on July 27. He was released on August 1, 2018. =Washington Nationals= On August 7, 2018, he signed a contract with the Washington Nationals. He greatly improved from his time in St. Louis, pitching 21 innings with 25 strikeouts, 10 walks, and a 0.84 ERA. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On January 31, 2019, Holland signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The deal also includes an additional $3.5 million in incentive bonuses. Initially, Holland performed well for the Diamondbacks as their closer, posting a 1.37 ERA in his first 20 games. His season soon unraveled; in his next 20 games, he posted an 8.44 ERA, and blew several save opportunities. Memorably, on July 2, Holland entered in the bottom of the ninth at Dodger Stadium with the Diamondbacks holding a 4‚Äì3 lead. He successfully recorded two outs, but then proceeded to walk four Dodgers in a row, tying the game. With the bases still loaded, Holland was replaced on the mound by T. J. McFarland, who promptly walked the first batter he faced to lose the game. On July 26, Holland entered to pitch the bottom of the ninth at Marlins Park with a 2‚Äì1 Diamondbacks lead. He allowed a leadoff double to Garrett Cooper, walked Neil Walker, and gave up a single to Starlin Castro which loaded the bases with nobody out. Jorge Alfaro hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game for the Marlins, and Holland was replaced with Yoshihisa Hirano, who allowed a walk-off sacrifice fly to Harold Ram√≠rez. Following the blown save, manager Torey Lovullo announced Holland would no longer serve as the Diamondbacks' closer. The Diamondbacks eventually designated Holland for assignment on August 7, 2019. He was released on August 10. =Washington Nationals (second stint)= On August 13, 2019, Holland signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and was assigned to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators. =Kansas City Royals (second stint)= Holland signed a minor league deal with the Royals on January 29, 2020. He made the Opening Day roster, and had his contract selected on July 23, 2020. With the 2020 Kansas City Royals, Holland appeared in 28 games, compiling a 3-0 record with 1.91 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 28.1 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/greg-holland-518813 Pitching report  With an overhand delivery, Holland throws a four-seam fastball that is regularly clocked at 95-96 mph, topping out at 100 mph.

Plot summary To redress an ancient wrong, the gods of Arcadia every year demand the sacrifice of a virgin. According to the oracle, this curse can only be lifted when a young man and a young woman, each of godly descent, are wed. In Arcadia there are now only two that can claim such lineage: the young Silvio (the son of the priest Montano, and a descendant of Hercules) and the nymph Amarilli (the daughter of Titiro, and a descendant of Pan). Thus the two have been promised to each other in marriage. The play unfolds a double plot. One storyline follows Silvio, who cares only for the hunt and gives no thought to love or to his impending marriage. Silvio is pursued by a nymph named Dorinda. She tries to win his love in several ways, but he scorns her affections. One day Dorinda, seeking to watch Silvio as he hunts, disguises herself as a shepherd wearing wolfskin clothes. After the hunt, she departs and lies down to rest. From a distance, Silvio mistakes her for a wolf and shoots her with an arrow. Having wounded Dorinda, Silvio is at last awakened to pity, and to love. In another storyline, Amarilli is loved by a foreign shepherd named Mirtillo. Amarilli loves Mirtillo in return, but keeps her feelings secret since she knows she must marry Silvio. Meanwhile, the faithless nymph Corisca is also in love with Mirtillo; Corisca is in turn loved by the shepherd Coridon, as well as a lustful satyr. Corisca plots to eliminate Amarilli. She sets up an elaborate ruse, hoping to trap Amarilli in a cave with Coridon. This will make it look as if Amarilli has broken her impending marriage vows to Silvio, for which the punishment is death. But the plan goes awry and it is Mirtillo who is trapped in the cave with Amarilli. The two are discovered by the priest Montano (Silvio's father), who condemns Amarilli to die as a sacrifice to the gods. Mirtillo (the faithful shepherd) demands that he be sacrificed instead, and so takes Amarilli's place. At the last minute, it is discovered that Mirtillo is really Montano's long-lost son, so that Amarilli and Mirtillo can be married and still fulfill the demands of the oracle. Corisca repents and is forgiven. Amarilli and Mirtillo are wed, as are Silvio and a healed Dorinda. Composition and publication Most likely Guarini wrote the play between 1580 and 1585. Prior to publication he sought the advice of Florentine scholar Lionardo Salviati, who also circulated the manuscript among other members of the private Accademia degli Alterati of Florence. Salviati's criticisms were varied, including characterisation, plot, length, decorum, and overall unsuitability for the stage; however these criticisms did not stop Guarini from publishing it at Venice in 1590, after some revisions. On 4 April 1584 Vincenzo Gonzaga sent a letter to Guarini requesting the manuscript, intending to mount a production for his marriage to Leonora de' Medici at Mantua at the end of April. Guarini responded that he was yet to write the final act and all of the choruses, so a performance would be premature. There was a failed attempt later in 1584 to put on a performance, this time at Ferrara.Fenlon, 92 The play had its first complete performance in Turin, in 1585, in honor of the nuptials of the Duke of Savoy and Catharine of Austria. In the next year a pamphlet war erupted between proponents and opponents of the play, which was to continue until 1593.Fenlon, 91 Guarini continued to revise the play after the first publication, the last revision being for the 20th edition of 1602 (Venice). It appeared in over a hundred editions following its first publication. Influence One of the most famous plays of the 17th century, it inspired numerous madrigal composers, including Giaches de Wert, Claudio Monteverdi, Sigismondo d'India, Alessandro Grandi, Tarquinio Merula, and Heinrich Sch√ºtz; Philippe de Monte named a volume after the play. The first operatic treatment was Handel's HWV 8 in 1712. The Il pastor fido sonatas for Musette de cour or flute published as Vivaldi's opus 13 are in fact by Nicolas Ch√©deville.

Luis Alberto Costales was viewed as especially important in respect of his vocation for bringing up youth with high human and civic values.Dr. Luis Alberto Costales Cazar, Radio Mundial (Riobamba)  Biography  = Early life = Luis was the son of Luis Arsecio Costales Cevallos and Esther Luc√≠a Cazar Ch√°vez. His childhood and youth were spent on farms owned by his parents: Maguazo, Lanl√°n, Ocpote and San Pablo. Here he came to know the indigenous people, spending much time with them doing farm work. He joined in with intimate family gatherings by candlelight, presided over by his father telling tales of the past as well as reading out classic novels and short stories. His childhood was marked by hard events such as the death of loved ones, beatings at school, and the forceful character of his father, who constantly told the boy how he had to make himself a \\"man\\", and left him alone on long horserides by night. These experiences helped to form his personality. Once, passing a nearby church on horseback, he first heard the tolling of a bell, and at his tender age he thought it was a divine manifestation, so he decided to write his first poem. In 1932 he began study at the Simon Bolivar School of Riobamba. The following year he entered the St Thomas the Apostle School (STAR) in Riobamba. His secondary education took place in the San Felipe Neri School of the same city, run by the Jesuits. In 1945 he entered the Central University of Ecuador, in the city of Quito, joining the faculty of International Studies (Diplomacy), in which he was appointed Vice President of the Student Association. In 1950 he was awarded the first Inter-University Declaration of Human Rights Prize. Together with other young rebels of the time, including Abraham Romero Cabrera, he founded the Ecuadorian Nationalist Revolutionary Action movement (ARNE). = In the city of Quito = Luis Alberto Costales His time in Quito was spent in professional education and the cultivation of letters. Thus in frequenting the \\"Caf√© Bohemia\\", a cafeteria located in the heart of the capital city, he had the opportunity to meet and make friends with renowned poets such as Benjam√≠n Carri√≥n and C√©sar D√°vila Andrade (who was called \\"The Fakir\\"), among others. This contact with literary personalities of the time inspired his approach and his passion for literature. At the age of 23, two years before finishing his university career, he married the distinguished Riobamba lady, A√≠da Violeta Ter√°n Moncayo. After this he obtained his doctorate in International Law; his thesis was acclaimed and rests in the archives of the Central University. While still in Quito he celebrated the arrival of his first son, Luis Eduardo, and on his return to his own beloved city, that of his daughters and second son: Mar√≠a del Pilar, Carlos Rodrigo, Luc√≠a Elena, Nancy Susana and Lourdes Jacqueline. = Political career = In the political field, about the year 1959, he entered the ranks of the Radical Liberal Party, and was the Provincial Director for a period of eight consecutive years. Around 1960 he served as presidential campaign manager for Don Galo Plaza Lasso. He was elected councillor of the Riobamba Canton in 1962, and in 1963 was appointed councillor of Chimborazo Province. In the same year he also served as Chairman of that body, a position that years later would be occupied by his first son Luis Eduardo Ter√°n. Later, around 1967, he served as presidential campaign manager for his close friend Dr Andrew F. C√≥rdova, who was fondly called \\"Lluro Cordova\\". When the Liberal Party was dissolved, following the signing of the \\"Pacto Morder√©\\", the Democratic Left party was born, at first as an independent movement. In the year 1970 the first convention of this movement was held in the city of Quito. Luis Alberto Costales became its first National President. By 1986 this party had become became the leading political power in Ecuador and raised Dr. Rodrigo Borja Cevallos to the Presidency of the Republic. In 1988 Costales was appointed Provincial Director of Region 5 of the Social Security Institute of Ecuador (IESS), a post which brought great responsibility, for a period of three years. In the same year he founded the cultural group Ateneo Jos√© Mar√≠a Rom√°n of Chimborazo, at the request of his close friend and National President Dr Guillermo Bossano. In 1991, he was elected alternate deputy for the Democratic Left Party in the Province of Chimborazo. However, his most important position was to chair the Chimborazo Patriotic Board, a group that examined the border disputes with Per√∫. Costales travelled to Tiwintza canton in order to encourage the troops stationed there. =Last days = Luis Alberto Costales Cazar's monument in Riobamba(Eddie Crespo), 2009. In the background mount Chimborazo. In 1993 he won first prize in poetry awarded by the Institute of Modern Arts, Quito. He spent the last years of his life in retirement at his small villa in the city of Guano, a few kilometres from Riobamba. This dwelling he called \\"Office of Hope\\". He devoted himself to literary work, to thought, to deep reading and to philosophical knowledge. In mid-2005, Luis Alberto Costales fell seriously ill, a victim of incurable lung cancer. In July of that year, the Benjamin Carri√≥n House of Ecuadorian Culture of Chimborazo published his book Sobre el Pomo de la Tierra, for which he received tributes from several institutions and cultural bodies in the city. He spent the last eight months of his life in this city, under the care of his family and friends. He died on February 1, 2006. After his death, his children salvaged a large part of his work from his old desk, and compiled many of his writings, which they published in the book Exiliado en el verso, volumes 1 and 2. In the Ecuadorian Library of Art and History in Quito there is a section with his name. The city of Riobamba today possesses an imposing monument financed by his children dedicated to Costales and his work.

The facility has 218 luxury apartments, with 2012 monthly rent reaching $5,500 in the top floors. The newly remodeled building, rechristened River Vue, opened for residents in May 2012. The building was cited by the Wall Street Journal as an example of the renewed livability of Pittsburgh. The building was originally the Pittsburgh State Office Building, a state-owned office building housing governmental offices. In March 2009, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold the office building to Millcraft Industries of Washington, Pennsylvania. The sale was criticized by Pennsylvania State Auditor General Jack Wagner, who noted that the $4.6 million sale price was half its appraised value. He said that the plan would cost the taxpayers nearly $55 million in leases to move state workers to other buildings. The replacement located include 11 Stanwix Street, 411 Seventh Avenue (the Chamber of Commerce Building), 301 Fifth Avenue (Piatt Place). James Creedon, the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of General Services, who managed the sale, said that the state saved $14 million by selling the building rather than renovating it.

He is also co-founder of Georgia-based blues-rock band Blue Blood, alongside Hunter Morris. Since 2009 Sullivant has produced albums for bands including Gift Horse, Wages, and Colour Revolt. Memphis & Accidental Mersh Sullivant was raised in Memphis and attended high school at Memphis University School. He is listed as ‚Äònotable alumni‚Äô of MUS alongside Big Star's Chris Bell and FedEx CEO Fred Smith.MUS Wiki Memphis University School Sullivant played in a band called Accidental Mersh with Andrew VanWyngarden, Nick Robbins, and Charlie Gerber. The band wrote funky pop songs that were inspired by elder Memphis rock band Big Ass Truck. The group packed Memphis clubs like the New Daisy Theater on Beale Street.Relix Magazine, Picks and Pans: Accidental MershMemphis Flyer: \\"Homecoming\\" The group dispersed to different colleges in 2001. Athens & The Whigs During his first year at The University of Georgia, Sullivant met Atlantans Parker Gispert and Julian Dorio with whom he formed The Whigs. Sullivant, a guitarist, picked up bass to round out the band. Sullivant and Gispert co-wrote the songs with additional creative input from Dorio. During their time at UGA, the band rose to popularity in Athens and Atlanta. After delays and a ‚Äúdemoralizing development deal with RCA,‚Äù The Whigs self-recorded their debut album Give ‚ÄòEm All a Big Fat Lip in an abandoned fraternity house with engineer Billy Bennett in the summer of 2005.The Fader: Kuroma web feature In addition to bass, Sullivant played organ, piano, slide guitar, and acoustic guitar on the album. ‚ÄúHalf The World Away‚Äù features a guitar solo by Sullivant. This solo was a noted climactic point in the Whigs‚Äô live set.Pop Matters: \\"Athens' Rich Pageant\\" 2004 feature on The Whigs Energized by the production of G‚ÄôEAaBFL, Sullivant experienced a period of creativity before the album‚Äôs release that resulted in most of the songs found on Kuroma‚Äôs 2007 debut, Paris.The Red and Black: \\"Sans The Whigs, musician succeeding\\" The Whigs self-released their album in November of 2005. Rolling Stone Magazine named them one of the ‚ÄòTen Bands To Watch In 2006.‚ÄôRolling Stone Magazine: Ten Artists To Watch 2006 The Whigs signed to ATO Records in July 2006 & toured through November. Sullivant then left the band to work solely on his own music. Paris The recording of Kuroma‚Äôs debut album Paris began shortly after Sullivant quit the Whigs. Sullivant asked childhood friend multi-instrumentalist James Richardson to collaborate on most of the sessions. In March 2007 Sullivant and Richardson, with Billy Bennett engineering and co-producing, tracked the bulk of Paris at Chase Park Transduction in Athens. The final product was mastered in April 2007. Sullivant came up with the name Kuroma during this time. Nick Robbins, Kyle Spence, and John Mills also appear on the album. MGMT Following the recording of Paris, Andrew VanWyngarden asked Sullivant to play guitar in MGMT‚Äôs live band. MGMT had signed to Columbia Records, and they were recording Oracular Spectacular when they contacted Sullivant. Sullivant moved to New York for rehearsals in May 2007 but planned to return to Kuroma.The Fader Kuroma Feature Sullivant stayed through the official release of Oracular Spectacular and returned to Athens after the South by Southwest festival in March 2008. Sullivant performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland with MGMT. He played on tours with Of Montreal, Fiery Furnaces, and Yeasayer, and played MGMT‚Äôs first overseas dates in the UK and Europe. He left the band in 2008 and was replaced by guitarist James Richardson and Will Berman who plays drums. Kuroma =Beginnings/Live= Upon returning to Kuroma in 2008, Sullivant originally opted to have no personalized web presence, (MySpace, Facebook, or band website) but managed to get Kuroma reviewed in print and Internet magazines. His initial reticence stemmed from a sense of revulsion at the marketing of music and bands.Flagpole Magazine: \\"Kuroma - Under The Radar\\" Sullivant says that Paris‚Äôs sound was primarily influenced by the Love, Peace, and Poetry compilation series of obscure international 60s psychedelic music.American Songwriter: \\"Psychopomp - A Q&A; with Kuroma's Hank Sullivant\\" Paris received good reviews, and the live band was praised early on by NME and Spin Magazine.NME Top Bands at CMJ 2008Spin: Kuroma - Band To Watch at Bonnaroo 2009; Band To Watch at Bamboozle 2010 In 2008/2009, the band opened for Jarvis Cocker, Primal Scream, MGMT, and The Walkmen, and performed at the 2009 Bonnaroo festival. =‚ÄúTransmutilation‚Äù and Performance Art= In February 2009 Sullivant and fellow UGA graduate Alejandro Crawford put on a performance art show at Athens Cine entitled ‚ÄúHomeopathic Grafting: This Awakening Dream of Communication.‚Äù The title is a direct quote from Jean Baudrillard‚Äôs Simulacra and Simulation.Simulacra & Simulation by Jean Baudrillard, page 80; link: Google Books Crawford, a poet and visual artist, identifies ‚ÄúTransmutilation‚Äù as the technique behind his long-form poem Morpheau.Jacket Magazine: Review of Alejandro Crawford's Morpheau In a video interview in 2009 Sullivant describes Kuroma‚Äôs music as ‚Äútransmutilation.‚ÄùYou Tell Concerts: video interview with Sullivant In November 2008 Kuroma put on a two-part performance at The Georgia Theatre. Part One featured a 15+ minute cover of Spacemen 3‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig City;‚Äù the intermission was a screening of the late 1960s psychedelic art film The Invasion of the Thunderbolt Pagoda; and Part Two was a set of Kuroma songs. Formal playbills were passed at the door.Live Reviews: Kuroma - Friday Nov. 7 @ Georgia Theatre =Single/Video Releases= Green Label Sound, a one-off video/single label funded by Pepsi/Mountain Dew, approached Kuroma in early 2009. Sullivant submitted ‚ÄúIn New York Everything Is Tropical,‚Äù a song he describes as ‚Äúsoulless.‚ÄùAmerican Songwriter interview Sullivant elaborates, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a celebratory part of the song, but also a cynicism, and when you combine both of them, you‚Äôre left with nothing.‚Äùquote from Green Label Sound's Kuroma webpage In contrast to the quiet release of Paris, GLS heavily promoted the single, and the video itself shows a barrage of graphics on top of rapid-fire shots of Sullivant walking overconfidently through famous sections of New York, including the Marcy Projects and the financial district. During the publicity run, Sullivant hosted MTV2‚Äôs Subterranean, and MTV2 routinely played the video for two months. Sullivant identifies Kuroma‚Äôs following video/single, ‚ÄúGet The Gunz,‚Äù as a companion to ‚ÄúIn New York Everything Is Tropical.‚ÄùAmerican Songwriter interview Directed collaboratively with Ash Sechler, the video features Sullivant dancing in rollerblades, stabbing water, suggestively being ‚Äúcurbed,‚Äù and killing his bandmates and himself with cartoon-like liquid after-effects as blood. =Psychopomp= Sullivant, Joaquin Cotler, Alfredo Lapuz, and Nick Robbins tracked songs for Kuroma‚Äôs second album Psychopomp at Chase Park Transduction in December 2009. Eric Gorman, a mixing engineer from New York, co-produced with Sullivant. The songs were mixed at Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, NC, in February 2010. Psychopomp was released on iTunes in October 2010 before Kuroma‚Äôs fall tours with MGMT and Tame Impala. The 8-minute track ‚ÄúGet Quick Got It‚Äù was licensed for a Cinemax upcoming movies advertisement in February 2011. The lineup was Sullivant on guitar, Lapuz on keyboards and synth bass, Robbins on drums, and Stan Walker on synths. =2013= As of 2013, Kuroma‚Äôs lineup was Sullivant, Simon O‚ÄôConnor, James Richardson and Will Berman. The band made its third album, Kuromarama, produced by Ben Goldwasser of MGMT, and opened for MGMT on its North America tour in the spring of 2013. Sullivant was scheduled to fill in on guitar at several summer festivals for MGMT‚Äôs Andrew VanWyngarden, who was recovering from shoulder surgery.

Its goal was the acquisition of a Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, the most advanced Soviet fighter plane at that time. The operation began in mid-1963 and ended on August 16, 1966, when an Iraqi Air Force MiG-21, flown by the Iraqi Assyrian defector Munir Redfa, landed at an air base in Israel. Israel and the United States were able to study the design of the plane. History MiG-21 production began in 1959, and Egypt, Syria and Iraq received numerous planes. =The first two attempts= The first attempt to acquire the aircraft was conducted in Egypt by Mossad agent Jean Thomas. Thomas and his group were ordered to find a pilot, who for $1,000,000 would agree to fly the plane to Israel. However, their first attempt was unsuccessful. The Egyptian pilot they contacted, Adib Hanna, informed the authorities about Thomas' interest in the MiG. Thomas, his father, and three other people were arrested and charged with espionage. Thomas and two others were hanged in December 1962. The other three members of the group received long prison terms. The second attempt also failed. Mossad agents ended up assaulting two Iraqi pilots who refused to cooperate with them, in order to keep them quiet for some time. =Success= Footage of the Iraqi plane In 1964 an Iraqi born Jew, Yusuf, contacted Israeli services in Tehran, at a time when Israel and Iran still had diplomatic relations, and Western Europe. Since he was 10 years old, Yusuf had worked as a servant for a Maronite Christian family. His girlfriend's friend was married to an Iraqi pilot named Munir Redfa. Redfa was annoyed that his Christian roots prevented his promotion in the military. He was also upset that he had been ordered to attack Iraqi Kurds. Yusuf understood that Redfa was ready to leave Iraq. A female Mossad agent befriended Redfa. He told her that he was forced to live far away from his family in Baghdad, he was not trusted by his commanders, and allowed to fly only with small fuel tanks because of his Christianity. He also expressed his admiration towards Israelis, \\"few against so many Muslims\\". Redfa was persuaded to travel to Europe to meet with Israeli agents. Meir Amit himself observed the meeting between Redfa and an intelligence officer, using a peep-hole. Redfa was offered $1 million, Israeli citizenship, and full-time employment. Redfa's conditions about smuggling all his relatives out of Iraq were accepted. Later Redfa traveled to Israel to see the airfield he was going to use to land the plane. He also met with the commander of Israeli Air Force, Major General Mordechai \\"Mottie\\" Hod. They discussed the dangerous flight and its path. Numerous Mossad agents were sent to Iraq to assist the transfer of Redfa's wife Betty, their two children aged three and five, his parents and a number of other family members out of the country. Betty and their two children went to Paris for what she thought was a summer vacation. Redfa, who promised to prepare her for what was going to happen, told her nothing. When Betty was contacted by a Mossad agent, who had her new Israeli passport, she initially became very upset and threatened to contact the Iraqi embassy, before she calmed down. The other family members were taken to the Iranian border, where Kurdish guerillas helped them to cross into Iran, from where they were taken to Israel. The opportunity to defect came about on August 16, 1966. While Redfa was flying over northern Jordan, his plane was tracked by radar. The Jordanians contacted Syria but were reassured that the plane belonged to the Syrian air force and was on a training mission. When Redfa's plane reached Israel, he was met by two Israeli Air Force Dassault Mirage IIIs, which escorted him to a landing at Hatzor. Later at a press conference, Redfa said that he had landed the plane on \\"the last drop of fuel\\". Aftermath Soon after his defection, Redfa's MiG was renumbered 007, reflecting the manner in which it had arrived. Within a few weeks the aircraft took off again with Israeli test pilot Danny Shapira at the controls, on the first of many test flights. The jet's strengths and weaknesses were analyzed and it was flown against IAF fighters, eventually training Israeli pilots to deal with the aircraft. In May 1967 director of CIA Richard Helms said that Israel had proven that it had made good use of the aircraft, when on April 7, 1967, during aerial battles over the Golan Heights, the Israeli Air Force brought down 6 Syrian MiG-21s without losing any of its Dassault Mirage IIIs. In January 1968, Israel loaned the MiG to the United States, which evaluated the jet under the HAVE DOUGHNUT program. The transfer helped pave the way for the Israeli acquisition of the F-4 Phantom, which the Americans had been reluctant to sell to Israel.

On December 17, 2015, the aquarium announced it was closing effective February 16, 2016, and said the animals will be distributed to other aquariums in its chain of private, for-profit aquariums. The company's press release also said it was looking for a new location in Portland. However, even the owners said any reopening was 24 to 36 months away, and no new location has been identified. Many of the animals were sold to third parties. Organization The Portland Aquarium is a private, for-profit aquarium built with funding provided by an investment group. According to the owners, the for-profit model was chosen to allow the aquarium to be built quickly. The aquarium was constructed in a leased former steakhouse in Oak Grove. It was initially proposed to be called the \\"Oregon Aquarium.\\" The Portland Aquarium is a limited liability company whose current members are Crystal Covino, David Rowe and Shane Shimada. The founding owners, in 2012, were brothers Vince and Ammon Covino, and Marc Gottlieb of Boise, ID. Vince and Ammon Covino also were involved in starting the Idaho Aquarium in Boise and the Austin Aquarium in Texas. The Idaho Aquarium has since been taken over by a new director and new board members, in response to legal problems and controversies involving Ammon Covino and his co-founder, Chris Conk. Portland Aquarium was not an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) or the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA); it was \\"taking the steps necessary to become AZA and ZAA accredited.\\" Features The Portland Aquarium featured 30 exhibits displaying more than 2,500 species. Animals exhibited included sharks and stingrays, a giant Pacific octopus, a jellyfish exhibit, a cold water tank with fish found off the Oregon Coast, and warm water tanks and tide pools with tropical fish. In addition to aquatic and marine exhibits, the aquarium included a rainforest room with animals like tree frogs, lizards, and lorikeets. The Portland Aquarium was intended to be a ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù educational experience that would provide ample opportunity to pet and feed aquarium animals. Most exhibits were geared toward children about age 10. The aquarium was located on a two-acre site that was zoned to permit the aquarium to build outdoor exhibits in the future. Proposed future exhibits included a 30,000-gallon shark tank and a seal exhibit.  Controversies One of the original co-owners of the Portland Aquarium, Ammon Covino, was arrested on February 21, 2013, in Boise, Idaho, on charges of illegally harvesting marine animals. He later pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally obtain sharks and rays from the wild in Florida and was sentenced to a year and one day in prison. In October 2015, he was rearrested for allegedly violating terms of his two-years of supervised release by getting involved again in the family aquariums. At least two senior employees of the Portland Aquarium, including a veterinarian, quit their jobs at the aquarium citing concerns about how the animals were being treated. Along with this, a former employee from the Portland aquarium showed to The Oregonian a death log of animals that had died in the aquarium from February 18 to May 16, 2013. The death log contained over 200 animals that died during that time, causing much controversy and making the Oregon Humane Society launch an investigation to the aquarium. The aquarium has been subject to citizen protests at the site.

One of his arguments criticizes the unified Asian American movement with uniform interests. The book was well received by major reviewers, including The New York Times Book Review and Time magazine. Essays The Accidental Asian is a collection of seven essays and short memoirs by Liu. In the first chapter, \\"Song for My Father\\", the author recounts the story of his father's death and a memory book compiled by family and friends for the funeral. However, much of the book's content remains unknown to him as he is not able to read the Chinese text. He laments the inability to read Chinese despite being able to speak the language in the next chapter, \\"Notes of a Native Speaker\\". The discussion on family also involves a memoir of his paternal grandmother in the final chapter, \\"Blood Vows\\". In \\"The Chinatown Idea\\", Liu writes about a short history of the New York City Chinatown. The titular chapter, \\"The Accidental Asian\\", criticized the idea of a unified Asian American movement with uniform interests. Liu argues against a monolithic community citing statistical evidence that more than half of Asian Americans under 34 years old are married to non-Asians. He also argues that Asians have taken the place of the Jews as the new \\"model minority\\" in \\"The New Jews\\". International topics are also covered in \\"Fear of a Yellow Planet\\", including the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy which involved individuals of Chinese descent who contributed to President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. Reviews Liu's book was generally well received by book reviewers. Writing for The New York Times Book Review, writer Gary Krist praised The Accidental Asian because it is \\"enriched by elements beyond polemics\\", and Liu's work \\"covers a lot of territory without succumbing to glibness\\". Romesh Ratnesar, in a review for Time magazine, praised Liu's balanced approach toward racial topics. In the process, he \\"sacrifices depth for breadth\\", as exemplified in his discussion on the links between Chinese and Jewish cultures. This approach also caused Ratnesar to be somewhat disappointed at Liu's broad treatment of affirmative action topics.

The channel is available throughout Cox's Oklahoma City and Tulsa-area cable television systems. Background The channel originated on cable channel 67 in Oklahoma City in 1995, and in its early days had only carried a bulletin board for local events and for the system itself, as well as occasional free preview weekends of premium channels and some sports programming. After acquiring TCI's cable system in Tulsa in 2000, Cox Communications added similar programming to the local origination channel on cable channel 9. Cox adopted a uniform branding for its local origination channel in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa service areas as The Cox Channel in 2004; two years later in 2006, the channel was moved to channel 7 in the Oklahoma City market, trading its channel placement with NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), and to channel 3 in the Tulsa market; in Oklahoma City, it returned to channel 3 in March 2010. Until 2006, the channel was also available on cable outside the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas in portions of Oklahoma; that year, Cox sold its systems outside the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas to Cebridge Connections (now Suddenlink Communications), and was dropped by December of that year.http://enidnews.com/sportslocal/x518662301/Cox- Channel-dropped-from-cable-ESPN-Classic-added On December 14, 2010 Cox Communications relegated access to TV Guide Network's programming on channel 2 in Oklahoma City to digital cable subscribers and subscribers using a CableCard on their analog cable box, at which time Cox dropped the program guide from the channel due to the presence of an interactive program guide that digital subscribers can access on their TVs; on that date, Cox separated the standard definition feeds of the Cox Channel to its customers: analog cable subscribers began seeing the TV Guide Network's former scrolling program grid (restyled to the color-coded version of the guide based on genre, used on the channel nationally until July 1, 2010) on the bottom ¬º of the screen while regular programming was carried at the top ‚Öî of the screen. Digital cable subscribers continue to see The Cox Channel full-screen without the grid. In March 2017, Cox Communications rebranded its local origination channels under the YurView banner (with The Cox Channel relaunching as YurView Oklahoma), as part of a nationwide effort by Cox to bring all of their community access channels under a unified brand. Programming More or less, it operates as a regional sports network for Oklahoma's two largest metropolitan areas (although officially, the primary regional sports network for the Oklahoma City and Tulsa television markets is the Fox Sports Oklahoma subfeed of Fox Sports Southwest), but it mostly offers public interest programming. The channel's sports offerings consist mainly of high school sports with football games during the fall season and basketball games during the late winter and early spring months, along with high school swimming events; these games are broadcast under the banner \\"Oklahoma Ford High School Game of the Week.\\" The channel also broadcasts Southland Conference football games, Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys women's basketball and softball games, as well as St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball games not carried via national sports channels, generally simulcasting Cardinals games carried by Fox Sports Midwest during the MLB seasonhttp://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=225&articleid;=20100415_225_B6_hChann957729 (Cox Communications has offered Cardinals games to its Oklahoma cable system area since the late 1990s, as games were carried by the Oklahoma City system on analog cable channel 67, when they began carrying the games). Since 2010, the Cox Channel/YurView has also carried games from the WNBA's Tulsa Shock women's professional basketball team that are not carried nationally on ESPN and NBA TV.http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=413&articleid;=20100513_413_0_TeTlaS650654 The channel also carries a sports wrapup program called SportsNight Oklahoma, airing on weeknights at 6:30 and 10 p.m. (CT). In June 2012, the channel began airing Texas Rangers games from KTXA on Friday nights. YurView Oklahoma airs local programming, informercials or older TV series (such as the classic western Gunsmoke) when there is no sports programming to air. It airs a limited amount of news programming as it carries the University of Oklahoma's weekday afternoon newscast called OU Nightly, produced by the university's journalism department. The channel also carries simulcast blocks of programming from the local real estate channel GoScout Homes (which is carried as a standalone channel on digital cable channel 22 in Oklahoma City and digital cable channel 122 in both Oklahoma City and Tulsa) and since July 2010, a simulcast of the morning newscast from news/talk radio station KRMG- AM/FM (Tulsa) on weekday mornings from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m. CT.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_20100722/ai_n54598501/ References External links * * Cox Communications - Oklahoma Category:Television stations in Oklahoma City Category:Television stations in Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Television stations in Oklahoma Category:Sports television networks in the United States Category:Cox Communications Category:Television channels and stations established in 2004 ","title":"YurView Oklahoma"},{"id":"28199172","text":"Faxonius immunis is a species of crayfish in the family Cambaridae. It is native to North America and it is an introduced species in Europe, where it lives along the Upper Rhine. Its common names include calico crayfish and papershell crayfish.Adams, S., Schuster, G.A. & Taylor, C.A. 2010. Orconectes immunis. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2010. Downloaded on 16 June 2016. Taxonomy Faxonius immunis was first described by Hermann August Hagen in 1870, in his Monograph of the North American Astacidae, under the name Cambarus immunis. The original specimens came from Lawn Ridge, Marshall County, Illinois. Description Faxonius immunis is similar to a number of species of crayfish in the genus Faxonius. While the colouration of the claws is distinctive, it can be difficult to use that to identify a specimen without reference specimens for comparison. F. immunis can be distinguished from O. virilis by the presence of a notch near the base of the dactylus (finger) of the claw, which is not found in Faxonius virilisF. virilis. Distribution and habitat =North America= Faxonius immunis naturally occurs across a wide area of eastern North America, from Maine and Connecticut in the east to Colorado and Wyoming in the west, and from Alabama in the south and north to Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Populations in Quebec may be the result of introductions by anglers from New York; the Canadian populations are centered in southern Ontario. It is believed to have been introduced to a number of states in New England, including Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. =Europe= Faxonius immunis has been popular in the aquarium trade in Germany, and is kept as a pet both in aquaria and garden ponds. The first recorded escape was a single individual in a small canal in the Rhine valley of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1997. Later, a breeding population was discovered, and this has now spread at least as far downstream as Karlsruhe ( downstream) and possibly as far as Speyer ( downstream from Karlsruhe). It has since been recorded from other locations in Europe, including the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as in France. It appears to be out-competing another invasive species, F. limosus, which has been present in the area for five decades. =Habitat= Faxonius immunis is only found in slow-flowing bodies of water, such as streams, ponds, marshes and roadside ditches, in contrast to O. virilis which also lives in rivers with moderate flow. It can survive in areas with large fluctuations in the amount of available water, by burrowing into the ground when the surface waters recede.

The film was shot in black-and-white in film noir style, and its setting in an industrial town in northern England mirrors the kitchen sink realism movement coming into vogue in English drama and film at the time. The screenplay was adapted from the stage play Blind Alley (1953) by Jack Popplewell. Plot The action takes place in the Yorkshire steel town of Rawborough - Rotherham was used for the extensive location filming - to which native son Johnny Mansell (George Baker) has fled after racking up large gambling debts in London. Johnny moves into a cramped flat with his brother Dave (Terence Morgan), a clerk in a local steel mill, and Dave's girlfriend Calico (Diana Dors), a hostess in a local nightclub. Calico comes up with a plan for the brothers to rob the payroll at Dave's workplace to steal enough money to cover Dave's fraud and Johnny's debts.

It was shot at Walton Studios in Walton-on-Thames. Reception Tread Softly Stranger did reasonable business at the box-office on its original release but received little critical attention, being seen as a typical crime potboiler which would be watched once and then forgotten. Its reputation was upgraded in later decades, with critics finding much to admire, particularly the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe with its authentic feel of everyday life in a steel town of the era. The main incongruity in the film is cited as the noticeable lack of Yorkshire accents in characters who were supposedly born and brought up in the area. It is also questionable whether a town such as Rawborough in the 1950s would have been the venue for a nightclub of the type in which Calico is employed, a far cry from the working men's club it purports to be. The eponymous theme tune was sung by Jim Dale.

Biography The son of French painter Ernest Gustave Girardot, he studied at an art school, but left at age seventeen to go on stage. Having played in the provinces, he made his debut on the London stage at the Haymarket Theatre. He went to America in 1893, where he continued his career. He was a success, with numerous Broadway shows to his credit, including the 1893 production of Charley's Aunt, in which he played Lord Fancourt Babberley for three years. He also worked in film, both silents and talkies, debuting in 1911 in Intrepid Davy. Among his film roles were the harmless lunatic who fancies himself a millionaire in the 1934 screwball comedy Twentieth Century, with John Barrymore and Carole Lombard, and the harassed coroner in three murder mysteries starring William Powell as detective Philo Vance.
