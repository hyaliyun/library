The Global Standard Deity begins to threaten to smite Swindon, and the solution lies with Thursday's daughter, Tuesday.

Reception Some critical reception for The Woman Who Died a Lot has been positive. The Plain Dealer praised the work, writing \\"By the end, all of Fforde's myriad particles of plot, accelerated by his immense skill and narrative sense, collide, producing pyrotechnics and a passel of new particles to propel his next tale.\\" DNA India also gave a favorable review but stated that the book would not be a \\"breezy read, particularly if you are not familiar with Fforde‚Äôs version of the world.\\" The Express was more mixed in their review, as they enjoyed the book but that some readers might not find the book as satisfying as earlier entries.

It is powered by an air-cooled lithium polymer battery. Its maximum speed and acceleration are comparable to those of the Tesla Roadster.  History  The Detroit Electric was an electric car model produced by the Anderson Electric Car Company in Detroit, Michigan, from 1907 to 1939. The brand was revived in 2008 to produce modern all-electric cars by Detroit Electric Holding Ltd. of the Netherlands. The Detroit Electric brand was revived in 2008 by Albert Lam, former Group CEO of the Lotus Engineering Group and Executive Director of Lotus Cars of England.Detroit Electric: 10 things to know about the new electric vehicle company (MLive.com, March 20, 2013) Detroit Electric was relaunched to the world on 19 March 2013, with the signing of its new U.S. office in the Fisher Building in Detroit, Michigan. The company's website contains no news after September, 2017, and so the company's current status is unknown. Detroit Electric SP.01 The Detroit Electric SP.01 two-seat all- electric roadster is Detroit Electric's first product and sales were originally scheduled to begin in the United States in August 2013 at a price starting at . Production was delayed because, , the company had not been able to secure an agreement for a manufacturing facility. The SP.01, like the Tesla Roadster, will be built on a Lotus Elise aluminum chassis with carbon fiber body, and production will be limited to 999 units. The SP.01 prototypes are being assembled in Europe. The commercial version was to have been built at a factory in Wayne County, Michigan, but Detroit Electric announced it would initially be built in the Netherlands. In June 2014 Detroit Electric announced that the SP.01 would be built in Royal Leamington Spa, England, with their Netherlands facility handling the sales and marketing side of the operation. The SP.01 will have a total weight of , and it will be powered by a 150 kW (201 bhp) electric motor mounted behind the passenger cabin that delivers 225 N¬∑m (166 lb-ft) of torque. The electric motor drives the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission, and a fifth and sixth gear ratios in the gearbox are redundant and available as an option. Top speed is and its time from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 100 km/h) is 3.7 seconds, the same as the Tesla Roadster. The electric car will have a 37 kWh lithium-polymer battery pack capable of delivering a range of under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. A 7.7 kWh home charging unit will fully charge the car in 4.3 hours, a charging through a standard 13A power source will take 8 hours. The first production unit was exported to China in February 2016 to be used as a demonstrator. Volume production was planned to begin at the Leamington works later in 2017, as the first of a series of Detroit Electric models.\\"PS300m Electric Car deNaewls Will Create 200 New Jobs; Sportscar Based on the Lotus Elise Will Have a Range of 180 Miles and a Top Speed of 155mph.\\" Coventry Evening Telegraph (England). MGN Ltd. March 11, 2017. Retrieved February 20, 2018 from HighBeam Research. Technology Unique to the SP.01 is its thermal management system, developed in-house by Detroit Electric. As opposed to liquid coolant, Detroit Electric has opted for conditioned air to cool and heat the battery pack as this not only lengthens the battery life, but also makes the entire drive system lighter and safer in the event of a crash. The SP.01 has a telemetry-link to the company's central portal for continuous monitoring of battery and powertrain condition. An Android application, the Smartphone Application Managed Infotainment(‚ÄòSAMI‚Äô), will provide access to all auxiliary functions ranging from music player, satellite navigation, regenerative braking adjustment and access to vehicle systems status, level of battery charge, range to recharge and other vehicle telemetry. Via GSM, SAMI will also be able to detect the vehicle location. The SP.01 has bi-directional charging technology ('360 Powerback‚Äô) which can detect loss of inflow current and reverse feed to the home circuit. Charging other electric vehicles is also made possible with 360 Powerback (i.e. vehicle to vehicle).

The VCGLR is located in North Richmond, Victoria. This regulation includes liquor and gaming licensing, compliance and education.  Background  The VCGLR commenced operations on 6 February 2012, replacing the Responsible Alcohol Victoria, and Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation. The VCGLR has the power to undertake liquor disciplinary actions, which replaced the role of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. At its inception the VCGLR had 60 Liquor and Gaming Inspectors situated in Morwell, Wangaratta, Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong and Melbourne. In 2013 the VCGLR centralised the inspectors believing that all compliance and education related work performed by the VCGLR could be managed by the central location. Inspections and education of the industry dropped by 40% as a result of this reshuffle and staff were forced into redundancies and a reduction of qualified staff to manage the compliance of the industry. In 2018, inspectors were again placed in the field in Sale and Ararat. The statutory obligations are set out in several Acts of Parliament. These include regulating: * the liquor industry in accordance with the Liquor Control Reform Act 1998 * all forms of legalised gambling in accordance with the Gambling Regulation Act 2003, the Casino Control Act 1991 and the Casino (Management Agreement) Act 1993.  Commissioners  The Commissioners of the VCGLR are accountable for statutory decision-making and governance. They are required to make decisions, either individually or collectively with other Commissioners relating to the grant, variation and transfer of licences and permits, conditions attached to licences and permits, disciplinary actions against licensees and permittees and reviews of decisions made under delegation by individual Commissions or members of staff.  Organisation structure  The VCGLR has six functional divisions, each reporting to the Chief Executive Officer: * licensing * compliance * strategy and planning * legal services * finance and business services * people and culture.

The band is composed of bassist/keyboardist Ken Jaquess (Atlantis, New Cross), keyboardist Ryo Okumoto (Spock's Beard, Natalie Cole), drummer Doug Sanborn (the Untouchables), electric violinist Yvette Devereaux, singer Shaun Guerin, guitarist Allan Holdsworth (Tempest, Soft Machine, Gong and U.K.) and guitarist John Miner (Art Rock Circus).  History  K¬≤ was founded by Ken Jaquess. When Jaquess' previous group, Atlantis. disbanded in 2000, he was left with a full album's worth of new material that was originally to become Atlantis' third album. The untitled project needed a new vehicle, and Jaquess decided to take the advice of an old friend and finally produce a solo album. Picking the moniker \\"K-Squared\\" or \\"K¬≤\\", he embarked on a journey that would last four years and would eventually end with the release of K¬≤'s first album, Book of the Dead.Book of the Dead. Review, Sea of Tranquility  Formation and first album  K¬≤ began in May 2001 when bassist Ken Jaquess asked drummer Doug Sanborn to contribute to some new music he was working on. Having no idea if anything would come of these sessions, they set out to record a project that would soon take on a life all its own. After only four rehearsals and five hours of recording, Jaquess and Sanborn had laid the foundation for an epic album of high musicianship, complex compositions and haunting themes. Over the next four years, fellow musicians Allan Holdsworth, Shaun Guerin, Ryo Okumoto, Yvette Devereaux and John Miner added layers of unique, signature sounds that resulted in K¬≤'s first album, Book of the Dead. Sadly, just after recording his vocals, original vocalist Shaun Guerin died.Shaun Guerin Critically acclaimed around the world, K¬≤ went on to perform BOTD live with a new lineup consisting of Jaquess and Sanborn, Ryo Okumoto (keyboards), Karl Johnson (guitar), and Josh Gleason (vocals). In 2006, K¬≤ filmed their first gig, which was released on their 2008 concert DVD, K¬≤ Live in Hollywood.  Black Garden  Tour 2012 In 2007, this lineup went back to the drawing board to create what would become their long overdue second release, Black Garden.Black Garden Released on September 21, 2010 through Magna Carta Records, this outing showcases this modern rock quintet in an entirely new setting. With a central theme of Oceania, K¬≤ explores the hidden depths of this mysterious region and take the listener on a dark, sonic journey to places rarely visited, and offers a glimpse of a people unlike any other on earth. K¬≤ followed this release with a short east coast tour that saw the band gaining new fans and appreciation, with an amazing gig in Boston that was the high point of the tour.  Third album  After the tour, writing and recording of new material commenced with a couple of epics and some shorter songs working their way through the band. During this time, vocalist Brent George and guitarist Steve Poloni came on board. With this lineup change it was decided to head back out on the road, this time to Europe. K¬≤'s 2012 European tour was an amazing experience for the whole band, making new friends and adding more fans with each stop. It proved to be a resounding success for K¬≤, playing all over England and ending in the Netherlands. A DVD of their concert was filmed in Rotterdam at the iO Pages Festival during the tour. Originally meant to be a bonus disc for their third album, it came out better than expected and was released as a separate DVD on September 15, 2015. K¬≤ were finishing the recording of their untitled third album, ad hoping for another tour to follow in 2020.  Musical style  K¬≤'s music is characterized by skilled musicianship, odd-numbered time signatures, mixed meters and unusually varied keyboard, bass and drum interplay, with an emphasis on darker, symphonic compositions.

Kastein Dr. Gerrit Willem Kastein (25 June 1910 - 21 February 1943) was a Dutch communist, neurologist and resistance fighter and leader during World War II. Early life Kastein was born in Zutphen, the eldest son of Albertus Gerhardus Kastein and Gerdina Leurink. He studied medicine and became a neurologist. He was married and had two children. During the 1930s Kastein became an ardent Communist, who often gave lectures. For that reason he was being watched by the Dutch authorities. During the Spanish Civil War he joined the efforts as a general doctor, who along with a Dutch ambulance team provided assistance. On returning to the Netherlands, he later provided medical assistance to fellow-communist Arie Kloostra during a riot in Den Haag, whom he would later join in the Dutch resistance. Kastein was strongly against racism, and wrote a book on the subject. World War II Immediately after the Dutch capitulation, Kastein joined the Dutch resistance. On 17 May 1940 he attended the inaugural meeting of The Hague branch of the illegal CPN, at the home of Toon van der Kroft. During the meeting, the Spark Group was founded. Kastein was also one of the initiators of the medical Resistance. Kastein's sympathies and activities came under suspicion, and the first attempt to arrest him was on 2 September 1941. But forewarned, he went into hiding. Kastein formed the Communist Dutch resistance group CS-6, named after their address Corellistraat 6 in Amsterdam, where the two brothers Boissevain lived. The members were: Jan Verleun; Pam Pooters; Reina Prinsen Geerligs; Leo Frijda; Hans Katan; Sape Kuipers; the brothers Jan Charles Boissevain and Gideon William Boissevain; their cousin Louis Boissevain. Kastein also chose to work closely with non-communist resistance groups. He gathered extensive pictures of German coastal defences along the Dutch coast, and planned to send them to the Dutch government in exile in London via a neutral Swedish ship via Gothenburg. He was provided with a contact in the form of , who was also a double-agent for the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). This meant that the Germans gained a copy of the film, which was altered before being forwarded via Kees Dutilh. Gemachtigden van den Leider After Hitler had approved Anton Mussert as \\"Leider van het Nederlandse Volk\\" (Leader of the Dutch People) in December 1942, he was allowed to form a national government institute, a Dutch shadow cabinet called \\"Gemachtigden van den Leider\\", which would advise Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart from 1 February 1943. The institute would consist of a number of deputies in charge of defined functions or departments within the administration. On 4 February Retired General and Rijkscommissaris Hendrik Seyffardt, already head of the Dutch SS volunteer group , was announced through the press as ‚ÄúDeputy for Special Services‚Äù. As a result, CS-6 concluded that the new institute would eventually lead to a National- Socialist government, which would then introduce general conscription to enable the call-up of Dutch nationals to the Eastern Front. However, in reality the Nazi's only saw Mussert and the NSB as a useful Dutch tool to enable general co-operation. Furthermore, Seyss-Inquart had assured Mussert after his December 1942 meeting with Hitler that general conscription was not on the agenda. However, CS-6 assessed that Seyffardt was the first person within the new institute eligible for an attack, after the heavily secured Mussert. After approval from the Dutch government in exile, on the evening of Friday 5 February 1943, after answering a knock at his front door in Scheveningen, Den Haag Seyffardt was shot twice by student Jan Verleun who had accompanied Kastein on the mission. In the later Nazi lawsuit against Verleun, he declared that he was accompanied by Kastein, while other sources suggest that Leo Frijda accompanied him in the attack and that Kastein was only present during preparation. A day later Seyffardt succumbed to his injuries in hospital. A private military ceremony was arranged at the Binnenhof, attended by family and friends and with Mussert in attendance, after which Seyffardt was cremated. On 7 February, CS-6 shot fellow institute member ‚ÄúGemachtigde voor de Volksvoorlichting‚Äù (Attorney for the national relations) H.Reydon and his wife. His wife died on the spot, while Reydon died on 24 August of his injuries. The gun used in this attack had been given to Kastein by SD agent Anton van der Waals, and was used to track Kastein. Operation Silbertanne Seyffardt and Reydon's deaths led to massive Nazi Germany reprisals in the occupied Netherlands, under Operation Silbertanne. SS General Hanns Albin Rauter immediately ordered the murder of 50 Dutch hostages and a series of raids on Dutch universities.The 'SILBERTANNE' murders from Niederlanders in de Waffen-SS. Retrieved 11 April 2008. By accident the Dutch resistance had attacked Rauter's car on 6 March 1945, which in turn led to the killings at De Woeste Hoeve, where 117 men were rounded up and executed at the site of the ambush and another 147 Gestapo prisoners executed elsewhere.The Hins' World War II Collection ‚Äì Memorial Woeste Hoeve .

Retrieved 11 April 2008 Arrest and death On 19 February 1943, Kastein was scheduled to meet fellow CS-6 member in The Crown public house, Delft. However, Wapperom had been arrested by the SD Rotterdam in Utrecht, where a subsequent search of his rooms found a notebook with details of the meeting with Kastein. Compromised, Wapperom agreed to co-operate, but the SD also tied a broomstick down his trousers to ensure that he could not escape. After entering the public house as agreed at 10:00, Kastein was arrested. Taken to a waiting car, he was placed in the back with of The Hague SD. A struggle ensued, in which Kastein managed to seriously shoot Knorr. A subsequent search of Kastein at the local SD offices found a notebook scheduling a second meeting that day with fellow Dutch resistance member \\"Luc\\" at a cafe near the Binnenhof. Kastein agreed to cooperate, with the meeting scheduled to take place at a coffee shop in Voorburg, Den Haag. Taken there in a car by SD agent John Hoffman, a struggle ensued during the journey where by Kastein shot SD agent Martin Kohlen who was driving the car in the leg. Kastein then tried to make an escape, but was quickly recaptured, although four resistance members who exited the cafe attempted to rescue him. On the return journey to the Binnenhof, Kastein tried to retrieve a hidden weapon from his body, but it bounced out and was taken by the SD agents. Placed in an interrogation room and tied to a chair, while left alone he jumped through a closed second floor window while still attached to the chair. On landing he fractured his skull and died a few hours later. A colleague of Kastein from another hospital and the wife of another colleague attended him and were witnesses to his injuries and death. After the war, it emerged that Luc was in fact a pseudonym for Anton van der Waals. It was hence interpreted that Kastein had recognised Van der Waals as a double agent, and had set up the meeting to interrogate the traitor.

The species has two described varieties, C. araliifolia var. araliifolia and C. araliifolia var. montana, and the common names are used for both. Carnarvonia araliifolia var. araliifolia grows naturally in the lowlands and up to the lower parts of the uplands, from about altitude. The trees are recorded as developing into the largest size on basalt derived fertile soils. Carnarvonia araliifolia var. montana grows naturally in the uplands, tablelands and mountains of the region, from about altitude, with its variety name referring to mountains. Taxonomy and naming In 1867, the colonial botanist Ferdinand von Mueller named the species in honour of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon. In 1995, the Australian tropical rainforest botanist Bernie Hyland updated the description and described the two different varieties. Phylogenetics studies have indicated that C. araliifolia branched off from an early lineage of the plant family Proteaceae and it retains the ancient characteristics. Botanists have classified the species as a member of the subfamily Grevilleoideae because its cotyledons have auricles, which all other Grevilleoideae have and other Proteaceae outside the subfamily do not have. Description C. araliifolia grows up to a tall trees in its native rainforest habitats. The trunks have a pale grey colour and have rounded buttresses with bases likened to an elephant's foot.

Environmental Design degree programs generally take four years of full-time study to complete, and many institutions allow a specialty emphasis within urban planning, architecture or landscape architecture.http://www.archcareers.org/website/article.asp?id=13 \\"Arch Careers.org. Architecture Degree Programs\\", Retrieved on April 4th, 2013. Other pre-professional degrees include the B.S. in Architectural Studies, B.A. in Architecture, the B.S. in Architecture, and the B.S. in Construction Management. Though the Bachelor of Environmental Design is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board NAAB, like other college degrees, programs in Environmental Design are accredited through their host-institution schools by various regional agencies, such as the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, or the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The Bachelor of Environmental Design should not be confused with the M.Arch or the five-year accredited B.Arch degree.http://www.ncarb.org/Studying-Architecture/Difference-Between-NAAB- Accredited-And-Non.aspx \\"DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAAB-ACCREDITED AND NON-ACCREDITED PROGRAMS\\", NCARB, Retrieved on April 4th, 2013.  Purpose and nature of training  Modern environmental design began as a series of separate disciplines that intersect between the professional worlds of architecture, product design, and the eco/environmental movement. Intersecting disciplines of similar philosophies include permaculture, complementary gardening, sustainable agriculture, zero-energy building design, passive solar architecture, pollution mitigation, cradle-to-grave, open space preservation, New Urbanism, sustainable transportation and traffic planning, multi-modal transportation design etc. With the development of a bachelor's degree, these various different disparate fields are brought together in a unified, but interdisciplinary field of environmental design. In the academic world, environmental design may cross disciplines with departments of geography, environmental science, climatology, neuroscience, and various others. The most publicly known example of environmental design is LEED certified design, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. Sustainable design is rapidly being adopted by governments around the world. On October 28th, 2010, the U.S. General Services Administration moved to mandate LEED certification in all new federal buildings.Beatty, MaryAnne. http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/197325 \\"GSA Moves to LEED Gold for All New Federal Buildings and Major Renovations\\", the General Services Administration, Retrieved on April 4th, 2013.

It was originally named Hung Shui Kiu (Bridge of Flooding) for being frequently overflown by heavy rains. In 1955, a group of teachers and students from St. James' Settlement died in an accident on a day of heavy rain .:zh:Êùæ‰ªîÂúí Ghost haunting stories related to the incident have continued in the area ever since.Hong Kong & Macau - Page 117 2006 -\\"The main entrance and the information centre are at the village of Tsung Tsai Yuen in the northernmost part of the reserve along Tai Po Rd. TAI PO KAU NATURE RESERVE Map pp404-5 Tai Po Rd; bus 70 or 72 The Tai Po Kau Nature Incident Tsung Tsai Yuen is a popular picnic area due to its convenient transportation and natural scenery of trees and a miles-long river. On 28 August 1955 at around 1:30 in the afternoon, a group of teachers and students from St. James' Settlement on a week-long camp in the nearby Tai Po Rural Orphanage were having a final picnic at Tsung Tsai Yuen before returning home. An unexpected rain came, so they sought shelter under the bridge, but most were washed away to the lower course of the river by a sudden landslide. 28 of them died with only few alive. Related ghost haunting stories Ghost haunting stories related to the accident has never stopped after the accident. Ashen-faced children are said to wave to passing cars and hikers at night. Drivers claim to see white shapes flitting across the road nearby and mini-bus drivers said some of their passengers vanished once they got off the bus. Some families living at the area also claim to see their children holding hands and playing with air multiple times. Still, in tradition Chinese culture, it is believed one need not to be afraid of supernatural if he is an upright man who has never affront any spirits. It was said a bus driver was driving past the Mang Gui Kiu without any passengers on board. A woman with long hair and pale face got on the bus. But the driver only found joss paper in the cashbox. The angry driver shouted ‚ÄòLady, please pay the fee!‚Äô but received no answer. He found that there was nobody on the bus. He reckoned the woman was a ghost but stayed calm and kept on driving not to offend the spirit. When he drove to the next bus stop, the signal light was on. He stopped the bus and opened the door but suddenly heard a voice saying, \\"Thank you.\\" Myth It was said Dan Kwai Village near Mang Gui Kiu was an execution ground during the Second Sino- Japanese War. The blood of the deceased washed into the sea and the water became red. Therefore, the bridge was named Hung Shui Kiu (and later also called the Mang Gui Kiu), in which \\"Hung\\" means \\"flood\\" and sounds the same as the word \\"red\\" in Chinese language. Years later, villagers heard the marching sound of soldiers and witnessed a ghost at midnight. But the truth as to whether executions were indeed carried out at the village is unknown. Present Stone Plaque After the accident, the Tai Po Tsat Yeuk Rural Committee erected a stone plaque to commemorate the tragedy and to placate the restless spirits. To avoid similar accident from happening, the Hong Kong Government constructed a dam on the head-stream to reduce impulse generated by the flash floods. The downstream area where bodies are found was turned to a private housing estates. The original Mang Gui Giu has need replaced by a reinforced concrete bridge after several road works and thus no longer exists. Yet, constant car accidents on Tai Po Road close to the original Mang Gui Giu site continues to bring more para-normality to the haunting place.

Originally for boys only, the school became co-educational in 1906. Over a period of more than four hundred years, it had a number of homes around Marlborough. In 1975 it was closed, and its final buildings were re-used for the new St John's Marlborough comprehensive school. History The Abolition of Chantries Act of 1547 closed all of the Kingdom of England's chantries, including the Hospital of St John, Marlborough. The town's burgesses then petitioned the Crown for the hospital to be converted into a \\"'Free-scole for the inducement of youth\\", and by letters patent dated 18 October 1550 a grammar school was established.'Education', in A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 5 (1957), pp. 348-368, accessed 7 April 2013Alfred Redvers Stedman, A History of Marlborough grammar school 1550-1945 (Devizes, 1945) The former hospital thus became the school's first home, but in 1578 it was demolished and a new building was erected which provided a schoolroom, a house for the schoolmaster, and dormitories. This survived until 1790. The school was sometimes known as King Edward's School, Marlborough, in memory of King Edward VI,William W. Kenawell, Frederick Bligh Bond, The Quest at Glastonbury: a biographical study of Frederick Bligh Bond (1965), p. 20 but in the course of the 18th century it began to be known as Marlborough Grammar School.Michael Bosher, Patrick Hazlewood, Nurturing Independent Thinkers: Working with an Alternative Curriculum (2005), p. 15 In 1834 a Charity Commissioners' report called the school the \\"Free Grammar School\\" and found that its original purpose was to teach Greek, Latin, and the church catechism, and that the governing body was the Corporation of Marlborough. Fourteen boys were then being taught the prescribed subjects without the payment of fees, but had to pay for other subjects. There were also twenty-six \\"pay-scholars\\", including some boarders.\\"Marlborough ‚Äì Free Grammar School\\" in Public Charities: Analytical digest of the Reports made by the Commissioners of inquiry into charities. Digest of schools and charities for education (W. Clowes & Son, 1842), p. 128. In 1853 the school survived a proposal by Earl Bruce to amalgamate it with the new Marlborough College.The Wiltshire archaeological and natural history magazine, vols. 78-80 (Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society - 1983), p. 74 During the nineteenth century it declined.John Carey, William Golding: The Man Who Wrote Lord of the Flies (2012), p. 3 In 1872, the school had endowments worth ¬£248 a year, and there were five schoolmasters teaching 85 boys. Some 37 of those were \\"sons of persons resident three years in town\\" and so were on the foundation, paying fees of six guineas a year, while the rest were boarders paying between 45 and 50 Guineas. The school was entitled to Exhibitions at Brasenose College, Oxford, two worth ¬£52 a year and four worth ¬£36, and to a smaller number at St John‚Äôs College, Cambridge.F. S. de Carteret-Bisson, Our Schools and Colleges, 1872, p. 322 In 1899 the school was closed, but in 1906 it reopened in new buildings, now taking the form of a mixed school for eighty boys and girls. In 1947 a boarding-house for both sexes was established at Wye House. Having already occupied a variety of different sites in Marlborough, in 1962 the school again moved into new buildings, this time on the edge of the town centre. In 1975, the school and the local secondary modern school, Marlborough Secondary Modern, were both closed, and a new comprehensive school, now called St John's Marlborough, was created and took over the buildings of both former schools. New school buildings were later built alongside those of the old grammar school, and the old buildings were demolished in 2010.Camilla officially opens St John's, Marlborough, from The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald at gazetteandherald.co.uk Headmasters *Dr John Hildrop, 1711 *Rev.

Construction and transfer The ship was ordered on 25 January 1942 as the U.S. Navy destroyer escort DE-273 and named USS Sanders, the first ship of the name, on 23 February 1943. She was laid down by the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 23 April 1943 and launched on 4 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Eugene Thomas Sanders.

The first structure on the site of the Old Tavern, likely used for storage, was built by John Sutter after he constructed Sutter's Fort across the street. This edifice was expanded in the early 1850s when a Philip Scheld turned it into a two-story building and founded Scheld's Sacramento Brewery. Additional floors and buildings were added to the estate over the years as it was used for various business including a speakeasy, apartments, and a data- processing center. During its time as a tavern, the site was a widely known landmark and a frequent stopping spot for stagecoaches on their way to downtown Sacramento. The building was renovated in the mid to late 1980s to allow for an Italian restaurant to occupy the original tavern section and medical offices for other parts of the building. It is rumored, with at least one historian agreeing, that in the 19th century there was a brothel upstairs frequented by Sacramento pioneers.

Around 1280, he composed the Ludus super Anticlaudianum (\\"Play on the Anticlaudianus\\"), a rhyming paraphrase of Alain de Lille's poem Anticlaudianus. The Ludus is conserved in one known manuscript, F-Lm 316 in the Biblioth√®que Municipale Jean Levy in Lille, which may be in part a work of Adam's own hand.Hughes, \\"Adam de la Bass√©e\\". Adam's influence can be seen in the romans composed around Lille, and possibly also in the Jeu de Robin et Marion, written by Adam de la Halle after he left Arras in 1283. The form of the Ludus, \\"a comprehensive musical anthology ... in which almost every contemporary sacred and secular style is represented\\", may have been copied directly for the Roman de Fauvel, composed around 1316. Adam was probably not advanced in age when he died, since his sister was alive twenty years later.Hughes, \\"The Ludus\\", 2. Ludus super Anticlaudianum According to the work's prologue, Adam composed it for personal enjoyment while he was ill. This must have been between 1279 and 1285, and his first editor, Abb√© Bayart, favoured his having written it in one season in 1279. His re-working of the Anticlaudianus leaves it simpler, more overtly Christian and less academic. The Ludus has the same plot and message as the Anticlaudianus, but the allegory and the breadth are much reduced, making the Ludus read more like a vernacular romance than a medieval Latin dialogue. The most interesting aspect of the Ludus is the presence of thirty-eight (38) musical pieces with (semi-)sacred lyrics interspersed throughout the work. Of these, thirty-six (36) are monophonic and two polyphonic, while twenty are contrafacta whose models are usually named explicitly in the rubrics that accompany the music. The musical notation of the Ludus is that of the secular chansonniers or of plainchant. One of the original pieces is an Agnus Dei in two-parts conductus. Among the other pieces, by genre there are hymns, sequentiae, responsories (including a processional antiphon), an alleluia, chansons, dances (a notula and a rondeau), a pastourelle and a polyphonic motet. Of his contrafacta, his models can be classified as either widely available‚Äîas in the songs of King Theobald I of Navarre and Duke Henry III of Brabant, and the sequentia Letabundus‚Äîor of local provenance and popularity, as in two chants to Saints Peter and Elizabeth.

Although, a number of members have no known association with it. Student members are drawn from various disciplines university-wide including the law school, Ag Hill, the Greek system and UGA athletics. Honorary members are usually prominent leaders in government, law, medicine, or business, mostly from and associated with the State of Georgia. The organization has extensive alumni participation, with well-attended banquets held in Athens twice each year, but its purposes and activities remain a closely guarded secret. The organization is thought to have connections with certain structures and historic sites around the State of Georgia and the rest of the Southern United States (Warm Springs, Georgia Guidestones, Georgia Capitol building), but its members do not publish any information. The organization is believed to be associated with other secret organizations, which operate around the world under different names including Yale University's Skull and Bones.

The original was in Saxony and Thuringia with several textual versions from 1840.  Text and melody  The melody musically structures the text in the way of bar form. The framing lines follow a conventional four-bar period, where only the melodic variation in the postscript of the reprise (i.e. in the last two bars) enlivens the otherwise rather monotonous course. However, the symmetry of these run counter to the bars of the sung \\"middle part\\". This irregularity is common in folk songs when 'litany-like \\" prose texts are set to music. Familiar songs that use this effect are significantly stronger than that with a relatively simple three-bar song, examples like Backe, backe Kuchen include ' or the Christmas carol The Twelve Days of Christmas.  Text and variants  The text records what was probably a common practice when composed. That is to say, the bakers after baking bread called with a horn to signal to the women of the neighborhood, that the residual heat of the oven could now be used to bake the women's own cakes.Backofen, B√§ckern und Backstuben Also, where the bread was baked on certain days in the common village oven, there was a signal when the bread was removed and the residual heat of the oven could be used for baking cakes. It is striking that the text points to the yellow coloring effect of saffron. None of the other six mentioned ingredients provides an obvious rhyme word for the German standard \\"gelb\\" which means yellow. Therefore, the traditional lyric writes \\"gehl\\" (also known as \\"gel\\") to provide a plausible approximate rhyme to \\"Mehl\\" which means meal or flour. There are Upper German dialects, such as the Northeast Bairische which soften the plosive -b to a -w, so it was eventually not heard or was no longer spoken. Furthermore, \\"geel\\" is a Low German and Dutch word for \\"yellow\\". The line \\"sugar and salt\\" is sometimes replaced by \\"butter and salt.\\" The last line is added only in some variants, as the text is sung translated into Standard German as \\"Schieb ihn in den Ofen rein\\".

He has received a number of literary and cultural awards, including the Takami Jun Prize (1971), the Rekitei Prize, the Purple Ribbon Medal in 2003 (given by the Government of Japan), the 50th Mainichi Art Award for Poetry (2009), and the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays in 2013. Reading at the Daiwa Foundation (London), 5 July 2013 Major influences include Shinobu Orikuchi, Paul Klee, Vincent van Gogh, Paul C√©zanne, William Blake, John Cage, Patrick Chamoiseau. Many of his poems are multilingual, blending elements of French, English, Chinese, Korean, Gaelic, and more, and feature cross-linguistic and typographic wordplay. His poems rely on intimate experiences with geography and history, layering encounters in the present with a keen awareness of the past. Drawing on multiple translators whose detailed notes appear opposite the translations, helping to elucidate them, Alice Iris Red Horse: Selected Poems of Yoshimasu Gozo, a Book in and on Translation is the most extensive and adventurous attempt at an English translation of Yoshimasu's complex poetry. Yoshimasu's performances often include film, the display of fetish objects, chanting, ritual procedures, and the collaboration of musicians and other artists. In a 2014 interview by Aki Onda on the MoMA blog \\"Post,\\" Yoshimasu described the relationship of his poetry to performance by remarking, \\"My quest is to reclaim the poetry that lies at the root of performing arts.\\" His visual art has been gaining increased recognition, with the Japan Art Academy awarding him the Imperial Prize and the Japan Art Academy Prize in 2015.

It was described by Polunin (1940) as one of the most abundant, ubiquitous, and ecologically important of all arctic plants. Taxonomy and naming Luzula nivalis is classified under the section Thyrsanochlamydeae of the subgenus Luzula. It belongs to the genus Luzula of the rush family Juncaceae. With regards to the etymology of the binomial: the generic name Luzula could come from the Italian lucciola (\\"to shine, sparkle\\") or the Latin luzulae or luxulae, from lux (\\"light\\"), inspired by the way the plant's hairs sparkle when wet with dew. Nivalis is Latin for snowy, snow-covered or snow-like. The exact taxonomy of Luzula nivalis is a little confusing due to confusions over the naming of the taxon; the name L. arctica has frequently (though less occasionally in recent years) been applied this taxon, or it has been regarded as a separate species altogether. Elven et al. (2003) stated that \\"a number of authors (Hult√©n 1968, B√∂cher et al. 1968, Porsild and Cody 1980, Novikov 1990) have considered L. nivalis to be conspecific with L. arctica, but some of them (Hult√©n 1968, B√∂cher et al. 1968) have used the name L. arctica, while the others (Porsild and Cody 1980...) [have used] the correct name L. nivalis.\\". Elven et al. (2003) also noted that L. campestris var. nivalis was widely considered to be conspecific with L. arctica. The current botanical consensus seems to be that lectotypification solves the issue and that L. arctica and L. nivalis should be regarded as the same species, with the name L. nivalis being chosen as this (derived from L. campestris var. nivalis) is the species's basionym and was used before L. arctica. Description Luzula nivalis is a relatively small perennial herbaceous plant (or \\"herb\\") which grows to heights of between in a caespitose fashion. L. nivalis has fibrous roots and ascending rhizomes, older plants have vertical stems either at ground level or underground; the plant base is straw-brown/pale castaneous brown in colour. The plant is subglabrous with erect, aerial stems and numerous alternate basal leaves. These crowded leaves are marcescent, flat, remain for many years, usually up to long and wide. L. nivalis also has 1‚Äì2 cauline leaves which are long; both leaf types are grass-like, flat, linear, straight and possess parallel veins. The leaf tips are obtuse, acuminate, involute, caducous and slightly swollen. Both the blade adaxial and abaxial surfaces are glabrous, with sparse, white, non-glandular hairs along the blade margins. The inflorescence of Luzula nivalis is congested in a single, dark, many-flowered head 0.8‚Äì1.0 √ó 0.6‚Äì0.9 cm in size; between 5‚Äì60 small flowers can be found in each inflorescence. This in turn is made up of 2-7 compact clusters, with the basal cluster sometimes on a long erecto-patent peduncle. The colour of the subglabrous, linear-lanceolate lower bract ranges from straw-brown to scarious; this bract is much shorter than the inflorescence at a length of . No pedicels are present. The dark brown bracteoles are ovate, obtuse and sparsely ciliate above with either dentate or lacerate margins, reaching a length of up to . L. nivalis has subequal and acute tepals long and castaneous to blackish brown in colour. The plant has six stamens as well as anthers long, filaments long, three styles long and stigmas long. L. nivalis produces an ovoid-trigonous seed capsule with exceeding tepals; capsule segments are blackish brown and 2.1‚Äì2.3 √ó c. 1.2 mm. The seeds themselves are ellipsoidal, smooth, brown and 1.0‚Äì1.2 √ó 0.6‚Äì0.7 mm in size. Basel appendages are fibrillate and up to 0.2 mm long. The fruit of L. nivalis is sessile and dry with a persistent and glabrous calyx. The rosette-like whorl of short leaves in Luzula nivalis allows it to easily be distinguished from Luzula confusa. Distribution and habitat Luzula nivalis has an arctic-alpine circumpolar distribution, as L. nivalis is an alpine plant which grows in the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere. Places which L. nivalis grows in include Norway, Sweden, Finland, Svalbard, Greenland, northern Canada, and Alaska in the United States. Luzula nivalis has been found in a wide range of mainly moist habitats and substrates, including wet meadows, snow patches, seepages, along the margins of ponds, marshes, streams (and other water bodies) as well as tundra, slopes and ridges. Occasionally L. nivalis has been found on dry sites including gravel, sand, silt, clay, till.

It was created by a group of scholars and practitioners with the support of the Cultural Heritage Administration of the Republic of Korea. The ultimate goal is to enhance the significance of traditional cultures and cultural diversities.  Outline of Ichpedia  The Ichpedia project started with a movement to create a new paradigm for safeguarding of cultural heritage in the national and international arenas. With the awareness that there are conflicts and difference between Korea‚Äôs current policies and laws regarding cultural heritage protection and UNESCO‚Äôs 2003 Convention, the project started with a new understanding of ICH and a new methodology of collecting data. Ichpedia is the online encyclopedia of intangible cultural heritage established on the basis of survey data. Its immediate goal is to create an exclusive record using internet surveys and taking a wiki-model based on the Web 2.0 platform. This project entails some innovations such as the utilization of a bottom-up approach, the collective intelligence, and community's active involvement. First, the online survey is used. Second, a wiki-model for collecting data and a new network system is set up. Third, the online-based networks have certain merits, including the ability to surpass barriers of time and space, as well as various divisions and partitions in the society. Ichpedia removes the walls between specialists and ordinary people, central organizations and regional ones, and between government and citizens. The ultimate goal of Ichpedia project is to increase cooperation among stakeholders for safeguarding ICH in Korea. ICH has recently drawn international attention because of its immeasurable contributions to the enhancement of human creativity and cultural diversity. However, ICH of each country has been disappearing rapidly as modernization and industrialization processes within each country were intensified. In particular, ICH is not easy to preserve and protect from destruction due to its immaterial and formless nature. It exists in people's memory, ideas, and everyday practices. UNESCO has strenuously made efforts to establish safeguarding measures of ICH throughout the world due to distinctive characteristics of ICH. UNESCO‚Äôs initiatives signify its view of ICH as the common cultural heritages of humanity. As part of such initiatives, UNESCO announced the convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. The Convention specifies safeguarding measures additionally proclaimed by the directives of ICH and related guidelines. Of the safeguarding methods, inventories are very important ways in which the intangible heritage community members can raise awareness of their cultural heritage. According to UNESCO, the process of inventorying ICH enhances the self-respect of heritage bearers and their respective communities and enriches human creativity. The Convention encourages the involvement of state parties in creating inventories of ICH existing in their territories and providing regular updates of any existing inventories. Updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be fully completed. The Convention allows some flexibility for the state parties in utilizing their own methods in inventory-making. Since the 1960s the South Korean government has made efforts to protect and preserve the Korean cultural heritages at the national level. Both legal and administrative measures have been undertaken affecting national treasures containing both tangible and intangible cultural heritages. The government's imperative to safeguard the national treasures was/is acknowledged being exemplary and draws international attention. However, since the Convention in 2003 and its operational directives have been ratified by many member states, Korea has fallen into confusion. There are some conflicts and differences between the Korea‚Äôs existing system and the UNESCO‚Äôs new one regarding the safeguarding measures. It is necessary to carefully consider the differences and distinctions between the two systems. Although Korea had an existing, mature system of protection and preservation of cultural heritages, it is now facing a change in its existing system. The UNESCO‚Äôs initiatives have caused Korea to take stock in the safeguarding ICH.

It would become the first confrontation of the Great Syrian Revolt. Preceding the battle, on 19 July, al-Atrash's forces shot down a French reconnaissance plane, the first shots of the revolt,Provence, 2005, p. 27. and captured its injured pilots. The next day, rebels captured Salkhad and its French garrison without facing significant resistance. Background In 1918, at the end of World War I, Ottoman rule in Syria came to end when their army was driven out by British forces and their Hashemite Arab allies during the Arab Revolt. Between 1918 and 1920 the Hashemite king Faisal ruled nominally from Damascus, but France was granted a mandate over Syria by the League of Nations in 1920. Britain and France had previously agreed to divide the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories between themselves in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement. After Faisal's army was defeated in the Battle of Maysalun, French forces gained control of Syria, later dividing into several autonomous entities, including Jabal Druze State based on the southeastern, mainly Druze- inhabited Jabal al-Arab mountain region. Tensions grew between the French authorities and the Druze leadership, as the latter viewed the former as encroaching on their territory and not respecting their traditions.Betts, 1990, pp. 84‚Äì85. In early July 1925 five Druze leaders were summoned to Damascus by the French High Commissioner Maurice Sarrail, ostensibly to decrease tensions between the Mandate and the Druze community. However, the Druze leaders, three of whom actually showed up, were instead arrested and incarcerated in the desert prison of Palmyra. Upon learning of their imprisonment, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, one of the two summoned leaders who chose not meet Sarrail, began to rally his forces in preparation for a revolt against French rule in all of Syria.Provence, pp. 27‚Äì29. French garrison surrender In mid-July Sultan and his cousin Mit'ib, the other summoned Druze leader who did not leave for Damascus, began an expedition to assemble their troops, beginning with their kinsmen in Rasas and al-Qurayya, and then onto the al-Kafr, Baka, Umm al-Rumman, al-Ghariyah, Malah and Orman, all satellite villages of Salkhad,Provence, 2005, p. 57. the second largest town of the Jabal. In Orman, on 19 July, the first shots of what would become the Great Syrian Revolt were fired as al-Atrash's forces gunned down a French reconnaissance plane surveilling their ground force, which numbered 250, all cavalry. The plane crashed, but its two pilots survived, albeit wounded. They were captured by the Ali Mustafa al-Atrash, then being a young teenager, and sheltered in his family's home, while others from Orman set the plane on fire.Provence, 2005, p. 58. On 20 July al-Atrash's forces entered and occupied Salkhad, calling its men to arms in the central square, to which many responded. They laid siege to the French garrison, but no resistance was encountered. The garrison, which consisted of 40 officers and government employees surrendered and the rebels proceeded to set on fire and loot all French-governmental buildings in the town, including the library of Salkhad's French delegation and the police station.Provence, 2005, p. 59. Aftermath The following day al-Atrash and his rebels departed further up the Jabal and more people from al-Kafr and Muslim members of the region's principal Bedouin tribes, Sulut and Sardiyya, joined the rebels.Provence, 2005, p. 60. On the orders of High-Commissioner Maurice Sarrail,Barr, p. 126. commandant Tommy Martin, the French commander in al-Suwayda, the capital of Jabal Druze State,Provence, pp. 59‚Äì60. dispatched 160 French soldiers under the command of Captain Normand to retrieve the French pilots and restore governmental over Salkhad and its vicinity. Al-Atrash's forces intercepted the French column at al-Kafr, killing most of the entire force, including Normand in a half-hour- long battle. Afterward, most Druze leaders of the Jabal joined al-Atrash's efforts and Syrian nationalists throughout the country were inspired to partake in the revolt.

The former branch connected the small town of Jericho on the Central Western railway line with Blackall and the latter branch connected Blackall to the even smaller town of Yaraka. Blackall was named after Sir Samuel Wensley Blackall who from 1868 to 1871 was the second Governor of Queensland. In the late 1890s it was government policy that Queensland's three major trunk lines should be extended to the south-west in order to link vast remote areas with the coast. Those trunk routes were the Western line which then ran from Brisbane to Charleville, the Central Western Line from Rockhampton to Longreach and the Great Northern line running from Townsville to Hughenden. The Western line was extended south-west to Cunnamulla and opened in 1898 whilst in 1917 the Quilpie Line was opened from Westgate (south of Charleville) due west to Quilpie. The Great Northern line was extended south-west to Winton and opened in 1899. Opening of the Blackall line, 1908 Extending the Central line was more problematic. Residents of the Jundah and Windorah regions (along the Thomson River south-west of Longreach) jostled for a line in their direction to run from Dartmouth, 50 kilometres east of Longreach via Stonehenge to Jundah and Windorah. Meanwhile, Longreach residents preferred an extension north-east to Winton thus providing a link to the Great Northern Line. An alternative option to the south-west was therefore examined being a line from Barcaldine or Jericho (both further east of Longreach) down to Blackall the oldest town in the region. Although Barcaldine was fractionally closer to Blackall than Jericho, the latter prevailed because most of the land over the Barcaldine route had already been settled. The Blackall Branch was therefore approved in 1905 and had the potential to be further extended south-west to Yaraka, Windorah and beyond. The branch was long and opened on 31 March 1908. Tiny sidings appeared en route at Joycedale, Lancevale, Yalleroi and Glenusk. Because Jericho had no depot, a thrice weekly service ran from nearby Alpha east of Jericho. Blackall passengers heading to Rockhampton usually changed trains at Jericho. In 1952, a weekly mixed Rockhampton to Blackall service commenced as did a second weekly service in 1967. The services ended in 1970 when The Midlander service could be met at Jericho for a more comfortable trip to and from Rockhampton. By all accounts, the Blackall Branch was reasonably well patronised but traffic inevitably declined when road transport increased. It faced closure in the early 1990s but earned a reprieve after staunch local opposition. The seasonal transport of cattle became its main source of activity but by 2005 the branch and its extension to Yaraka were untenable. The Queensland Parliament passed the Great Western Railway Act in 1910. Its purpose was to authorize construction of over of railway in far western Queensland so as to bring all sheep farming activities in the region within reach of a railway and hence eastern markets. The line was to run from Tobermory in the far south-west to Camooweal in the far north-west. Tobermory lay to the south of Quilpie and Eromanga whilst Camooweal sat to the north-west of Mount Isa and not far from the Northern Territory border. The proposed line would also double as a link in a grand plan to link Sydney by rail with Darwin. Also required were four spur lines to join the existing Queensland system at Charleville, Blackall, Winton and Malbon near Cloncurry on the Great Northern Line. In the end, the concept of the Great Western Railway was unrealistic and uneconomic. But some construction work was completed including extension of the Blackall Branch to Yaraka (and proposed to reach Windorah). The line opened in four stages ‚Äì to Malvernton (via Glenstuart siding) on 16 June 1913, to Benlidi shortly after on 1 July 1913, to Emmet (via Mekaree siding) on 16 December 1914 and to Yaraka (via Ungo and Konupa sidings) on 3 April 1917. Roughly 300 kilometres separated Blackall and Windorah, and Yaraka was about halfway. A twice weekly mixed service plied the Yaraka Branch. It was slow at six hours but worse was a trip between Yaraka and Rockhampton at twenty-six hours although that included a through service between Alpha and Yaraka. The service was later cut back to once per week. As with the Blackall Branch the line faced closure in the early 1990s but earned a reprieve after local opposition. The ‚ÄòYaraka Mixed‚Äô later achieved novelty status as one of the last of its kind but by April 2001 passengers were not permitted aboard and by September 2005 had closed completely. As compensation for the closure, the locals were promised all-weather road upgrades in the region. As an aside, the Central Western Line was eventually extended from Longreach and opened to Winton in 1928.

On the eve of the Battle of Agincourt, which fell on Saint Crispin's Day, Henry V urges his men, who were vastly outnumbered by the French, to recall how the English had previously inflicted great defeats upon the French. The speech has been famously portrayed by Laurence Olivier to raise British spirits during the Second World War, and by Kenneth Branagh in the 1989 film Henry V, and it made famous the phrase \\"band of brothers\\".

He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, and was a close associate of Natsume S≈çseki, Seiichi Hatano, Kyoshi Takahama and Shigeo Iwanami, although he was forced to return home to teach English in Matsuyama due to reduced family circumstances. He later married the sister of Misao Fujimura. While still a student, he began writing literary criticism and was interested in the development of naturalism. From 1920, Abe worked as a professor at Hosei University; however, he toured Europe extensively and spent some time at Heidelberg University in 1924 where he studied Kantian philosophy. In 1926 he accepted a position at Keij≈ç Imperial University in Seoul Korea, where he became interested in Korean culture and Korean literature. He travelled to China in 1929, visiting Jinan, Qufu and climbed Mount Tai, and noted the strong Japanese commercial presence throughout Shandong Province. He also visited Manchuria and noted the increasing Chinese presence in Harbin Abe returned to mainland Japan in 1940, returning to his alma mater, the Daiichi High School in Tokyo. However, Abe soon ran afoul of the military authorities with his outspoken criticism of the military‚Äôs plans to cut short school curriculums to increase the numbers of conscripts, and of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe‚Äôs efforts to create a single- party state. Although occasionally harassed by the Kempeitai, he was not arrested. After the end of World War II, Abe was appointed to a seat in the Upper House of the Diet of Japan in December 1945, and from January through March 1946 served as Minister of Education in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara, where he oversaw the post-war reform of the Japanese educational system. He helped draft the Fundamental Law of Education, and the current T≈çy≈ç kanji and Modern kana usage guidelines.

It originally aired on NBC on April 25, 2013. The episode features guest stars Roseanne Barr, Nora Kirkpatrick, Mark Proksch, Blake Robbins, and Bobby Ray Shafer. It was also the final half-hour episode of the series, being the fourth-to-last episode aired. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office staff compete against each other in a paper airplane contest. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) prepares for a potential acting job, and Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) utilize new skills that they learned in couples' counseling. The episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics; some felt that the episode was humorous, whereas others were critical of the main plot involving Pam and Jim. The episode was viewed by 3.25 million viewers and received a 1.7/5 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, giving it the lowest viewership rating of any episode of The Office. \\"Paper Airplane\\" ranked fourth in its timeslot, but was nevertheless the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis A paper airplane contest is being hosted at Dunder Mifflin by a new paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against each other for a $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) prepares for an acting job in a laboratory safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have to talk him out of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes, impressing Carla. In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) have been told to express appreciation for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything they do not want to do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with their co- workers present, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him. Production The episode was the second to guest star Roseanne Barr as talent agent Carla Fern. \\"Paper Airplane\\" was written by co-executive producers Halsted Sullivan and Warren Lieberstein, marking their first writing credit for the season, as well as their first writing credit since season eight's \\"Turf War\\". It was directed by first-time Office director, Jesse Peretz. Comedian Roseanne Barr guest stars in this episode. It was announced on January 31, 2013 that she would be doing a two episode arc and would play a talent agent named Carla Fern. Barr began filming her scenes the week following January 31. She first appeared in the previous episode, \\"Stairmageddon\\". The episode features both archival footage‚Äîas well as new footage‚Äîof Pam and Jim's wedding from the sixth-season episode \\"Niagara\\". In order to get a shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after \\"Niagara\\" had been filmed. Daniels noted, \\"To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [when the camera was facing them] so they were both looking at me with the full actor-power of all the emotions they were supposed to be feeling at their own wedding, just blasting in my face. I got chills and a fever.\\" Cultural references Dwight refers to the new paper as the \\"Cadillac of paper\\". Andy notes that if he is successful in his industrial film, he could potentially land a role in the movie Moneyballs 2, a sequel to the 2011 film Moneyball starring Brad Pitt. When told to act like he is doing a newscast, Andy does a Tom Brokaw impersonation. Andy also says that if necessary he will go all-nude for the role in a \\"full-on Lena Dunham\\", a reference to her skit at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. Darryl tells Andy that he was in a production of The Wiz in high school. Kevin mistakes Orville and Wilbur Wright‚Äîthe credited inventors of the airplane‚Äîfor \\"Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher\\"‚Äîa brand of popcorn. In the last scene, when Jim and Pam resolve their differences, the cut-scene shows Jim's brother Tom reading 1 Corinthians 13:7‚Äì13 from the Bible. Reception Ratings \\"Paper Airplane\\" originally aired on April 25, 2013 on NBC. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an estimated 3.25 million viewers and received a 1.7 rating/5 percent share. At 3.25 million viewers, it is the lowest rated episode of the series to ever air. This means that it was seen by 1.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a decrease in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Stairmageddon\\". The Office ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which scored a 2.7/7 rating, an entry of the CBS series Person of Interest which garnered a 2.4/7 rating, and installment of the Fox series Glee which received a 1.8/5 rating. When DVR numbers were included, the episode was watched by 4.956 million viewers and increased its ratings up 65 percent to a 2.8, meaning it was seen by, in total, 2.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds. Reviews Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a \\"great\\" episode. She praised the final scene, and said that Pam's decision was \\"a gorgeously simple emotional shift\\". She was complimentary towards the balance between characters and felt that \\"the rest of the episode was entertaining and well constructed, if not earth shatteringly hilarious.\\" Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars, summarizing that \\"An otherwise funny episode of The Office, highlighted by Toby's awkwardness, Dwight's craziness and Kevin's pride, was held back by yet another trip down Pam and Jim's boring avenue of problems.\\" Nick Campbell of TV.com gave the episode a more moderate review, writing that \\"The Jam story was probably the only bright spot for me in an episode generally devoid of chuckles\\", and that it was \\"not a terrible episode, but basic and a little boring.\\" He was complimentary towards the conclusion of the Jim-Pam plot, noting that the final scene was \\"a warm moment\\", although he was surprised by the scene's placement in the season as a whole. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote positively of the finale scene, noting that \\"it really worked\\", and that Krasinski and Fischer were \\"terrific\\" during the sequence. However, he said that the \\"comedy parts of 'Paper Airplane' were so dire I'm not going to dwell on them at all\\". Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\" and felt that the finale scene, while set up to be emotional, was \\"hollow\\". He argued that the tension does not feel as threatening as it should; he compared it to the second season episode \\"Casino Night\\", which had invoked real fears about the future of Jim and Pam. He summed up: \\"I wish the final scene of 'Paper Airplane' made me feel something deeper.\\" Adams also was not impressed with the Dwight-Angela storyline, but was \\"enjoying Andy's day on the industrial-safety film‚Äîmuch more so than [he] anticipated\\" due to the \\"unintentional hilarity\\" that ensued. Roseanne Barr's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an \\"Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series\\" Emmy consideration.

The peak rises 12 km west of Highway 203, between the towns of Loei and Phetchabun. Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park surrounds the mountain.Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park The park overlaps the borders of two provinces, Phitsanulok and Phetchabun.Phu Thap Boek & Phuhinrongkla National Park Most of the mountain is covered in mixed evergreen forest. There are farms on its slopes where the climate favors cabbage cultivation. The area around the mountain is part of the Luang Prabang montane rain forest ecoregion. The villagers of Phu Thap Boek are predominantly Hmong hill tribespeople who immigrated from northern Thailand. They established the Phetchabun Hilltribe Development and Relief Center in 1982. The mountain has since been overrun by allegedly illegal resorts and restaurants. Geography The summit of Phu Thap Boek is at 1,768 meters elevation. Geological uplifts changed the area of Phetchabun Province from a flat plate to sandstone mountains. The east and south are Lom Sak District and Khao Kho District.

Per capita use of fresh- market spinach averaged during 2004‚Äì06, the highest since the mid-1940s. The fresh market now accounts for about three-fourths of all US spinach consumed. Much of the growth over the past decade has been due to sales of triple- washed, cello-packed spinach and, more recently, baby spinach. These packaged products have been one of the fastest-growing segments of the packaged salad industry. Production The United States is the world‚Äôs second-largest producer of spinach, with 3% of world output, following China (PRC), which accounts for 85% of output. California (73% of 2004‚Äì06 U.S. output), Arizona (12%), and New Jersey (3%) are the top producing states, with 12 other states reporting production of at least 100 acres (2002 census). Over the 2004‚Äì06 period, U.S. growers produced an average of 867 million pounds of spinach for all uses, with about three-fourths sold into the fresh market (includes fresh- cut/processed). According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture, spinach was grown on 1,109 U.S. farms‚Äîdown 17% from 1997, but about the same number as in 1987. The farm value of U.S. spinach crops (fresh and processed) averaged $175 million during 2004‚Äì06, with fresh-market spinach accounting for 94%. The value of fresh-market spinach has more than doubled over the past decade as stronger demand has boosted production, while inflation-adjusted prices largely remained constant. California accounts for about three-fourths of the value of both the fresh and processing spinach crops. Consumption Like other cool-season leafy crops, most (about 96%) of the fresh spinach consumed in the United States is produced domestically. Although rising, imports (largely from Mexico) totaled about 23 million pounds in 2004‚Äì06, compared with 3 million pounds in 1994‚Äì06. During the last 10 years, exports (largely to Canada) have jumped 70 percent to 47 million pounds (2004‚Äì06), with much of the growth occurring earlier this decade.USDA 2007, retrieved on 2008-02-01 Per capita spinach consumption is greatest in the Northeast and Western US. About 80% of fresh-market spinach is purchased at retail and consumed at home, while 91% of processed spinach is consumed at home. Per capita spinach use is strongest among Asians, highest among women 40 and older, and weakest among teenage girls.USDA 2004 Food poisoning outbreaks  E. coli, 2006  In September 2006, an outbreak of disease caused by the E. coli strain O157:H7 occurred in 21 US states. Over 100 cases were reported, including five deaths. The E. coli was linked to bags of fresh organic spinach, after which the FDA issued a warning not to eat uncooked fresh spinach or products containing it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release updating the available information. According to the FDA release on 2006-10-4, 192 cases of E. coli O157:H7 infection have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 30 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome; there was one death and 98 hospitalizations. The infection affected 26 states. By early 2007, there were 206 illnesses and three deaths attributed to E. coli-tainted spinach. Based on epidemiological and laboratory evidence, the FDA determined the implicated spinach originated from an organic spinach field grown by Mission Organics and processed by Natural Selection Foods LLC of San Juan Bautista, California. The FDA speculated the spinach had been tainted by irrigation water contaminated with pig feces because feral pigs were seen in the vicinity of the implicated ranch. Salmonella, 2007 On August 30, 2007, 8,000 cartons of spinach (from Metz Fresh, a King City-based grower and shipper, Salinas Valley, California) were recalled after Salmonella was discovered upon routine testing. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers complained it exposed significant gaps in food safety, even if 90% of suspect vegetables did not reach the shelves.

The species Nothorites megacarpus grows naturally only in restricted mountain regions (endemic) of the wet tropics rain forests of north-eastern Queensland, Australia. The species was first formally scientifically described as Orites megacarpa in 1995 by Alex S. George and Bernie P. M. Hyland. Genetic studies published in 2008 by Austin Mast and colleagues demonstrated that it was not correlated with other species in the genus Orites. Instead it correlates with the group of Macadamia related species and genera. Therefore, the new genus Nothorites was created and this species name combination was published. The species occurs in rainforests around Mount Spurgeon and Mount Lewis (both inland above Mossman) as well as Mount Bartle Frere at an altitude of 1100 to 1200 metres.

He composed the work on the Normandy coast, suffering from cancer and concerned about the involvement of France in the Great War. The work is full of personal literary and musical allusions. Each movement comes with a literary motto. In the second movement, Debussy quoted Luther's hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" as a symbol of militant Lutheran Germany. The three movements were dedicated respectively to three people: Serge Koussevitzky, Jacques Charlot (an associate of Debussy's publisher who was killed in the war), and Igor Stravinsky.  History  Debussy composed En blanc et noir at his vacation residence on the Normandy coast between 4 and 20 June 1915. He was suffering from cancer. France had been at war since 3 August 1914, and emotions were heated against everything German. The work is a late fruit of his experience as a pianist and composer, and it contains many personal allusions which have not been completely deciphered. In the second movement, he quoted Martin Luther's hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\", known in English as \\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\", as a reference to Lutheran Germany. Around the same time, during a late flourish in his prolific output, he composed his Cello Sonata, Sonata for flute, viola and harp, and the piano √âtudes, to which En blanc et noir is often compared. In a letter dated 22 July 1915, Debussy wrote to his publisher Jacques Durand, shortly before offering him the composition, that he thought that the \\"Austro-Boches\\" were on their last legs and that the French soul would always remain clear and heroic. By saying \\"Austro-Boches\\", Debussy mentioned Austrians and Germans together, influenced by a tendency among French intellectuals to boycott artists and art, literature and music from all German-speaking countries and focus on French traditions. The original title of the composition was Caprices en blanc et noir, and it was first performed under this title on 21 January 1916 at a private charity concert (to benefit struggling musicians) in the Paris salon of the Princesse de Polignac by Walter Morse Rummel and Th√©r√®se Chaigneau (sister of Suzanne Chaigneau). The first public performance took place on 9 March 1916 in the Casino St-Pierre in Geneva by Marie Panth√®s and Alexandre Mottu. The composer and Jean Roger-Ducasse performed the work for the first time under its shortened title on 21 December 1916 at another charity benefit (for prisoners of war) in the Paris home of Madame Georges Guiard. The title En blanc et noir refers not only to the piano keys, but also had a hidden meaning, as Debussy explained in a letter to Robert Gode: \\"These pieces need to draw their colour, their emotion, simply from the piano, like the 'greys' of Vel√°zquez, if you understand me.\\" Diego Vel√°zquez, the 17th-century Spanish painter, achieved nuances of grey by shading black and white. Debussy used a similar technique with orchestral \\"colours\\", in this case represented on two pianos. Conservative romantic Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, complaining about the style of the music, condemned the work, saying \\"We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut [de France] against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures.\\"  Music  En blanc et noir consists of three movements, each preceded by a literary quotation.  I.  The first movement is marked Avec emportement. An energetic waltz, it is in C major and 3/4 time, 18px=66. The movement is dedicated to Serge Koussevitzky, a musician friend from allied Russia. Debussy prefaced the movement by an excerpt from Barbier and Carr√©'s libretto for Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette. The motto translates to \\"He who stays in his place and does not dance quietly admits to a disgrace.\\" Debussy may have found himself a disgrace as he could not participate in the \\"dance\\" of fighting for France due to his illness.  II.  The second movement is marked Lent. Sombre. It is in F major and 6/8 time, 18px=42. The movement is prefaced by a passage from Fran√ßois Villon's Ballade contre les ennemis de la France. Debussy had set some of the ballads by the 15th-century poet to music. The quotation is chosen from a ballad \\"against France's enemies\\". The movement is dedicated to the memory of Jacques Charlot, a business associate of Debussy's publisher Durand who had been killed in the war. It has been called a political comment of unexpected intensity. The German hymn \\"Ein feste Burg\\" by Martin Luther is quoted in the foreground, with a focus on its military aspect, while the French Marseillaise appears almost hidden.  III.  The third movement is marked Scherzando. The playful scherzo is in D minor and 2/4 time, 18px=72. Dedicated to Igor Stravinsky, another musician from Russia, the movement is prefaced by a quote from another 15th-century poet, Charles of Orl√©ans: \\"Yver, vous n'estes qu'un vilain\\" (Winter, you are nothing but a villain). Debussy had earlier set the poem containing the line for choir a cappella, an \\"outburst against a hostile force\\".  Performances and recordings  Pianists Richard Goode and Jonathan Biss played En blanc et noir as the final work in a recital at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on 31 May 2008, which also included Schubert's Allegro in A minor, Debussy's arrangement of Schumann's Canons for pedal-piano, Beethoven's transcription of the Gro√üe Fuge and Stravinsky's Agon. On a 2008 recording, Vladimir Ashkenazy and his son played En blanc et noir together with other works by Debussy and Ravel, including Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole and La Valse. A review described their playing as swirling but clear in the first movement, painting \\"a bleak and devastated landscape\\" in the second, and in the third with \\"an understatement which is breathtaking\\". A 2015 recording by the Duo Tal & Groethuysen combines the work with another work written in response to the World War, Reynaldo Hahn's Le ruban d√©nou√©, composed at the front near Verdun, where the volunteer soldier experienced anxiety, fascination and deadly boredom. A cycle of twelve waltzes recalls the 19th-century balls in nostalgic reminiscence.  Evaluation  En blanc et noir has been regarded as a subtle comment on the historical condition through literary and musical allusion, under the sparkling surface of brilliant pianistic artistry, making it a key work of 1915.

The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur,Winfield and Roberts (2015), p.246. to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as best she could. By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Cr√©ole. In 1800, Cr√©ole was part of a division under contre-amiral Lacrosse, tasked to cruise off Morbihan and cut off the royalists from their British support. In order to avoid the British blockade, the squadron anchored to Camaret, but attracted the attention of the British and sailed back to harbour to avoid engagement. The division was retasked to ferry 4600 troops to Santo Domingo, but again ran into the British blockade, turned back and adjourned its mission.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 188 During the cruise, Cr√©ole sustained some damage in a collision with Fid√®le.Fonds Marine, p.237  Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801  On 27 January 1801, Cr√©ole departed Brest with a division under contre- amiral Ganteaume, tasked to ferry ammunitions and reinforcements to the Arm√©e d'√âgypte, taking part in Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801. After several false starts due to unfavourable weather or to the British blockade, Ganteaume eventually set sail on 23 February on a heavy sea which soon dispersed his squadron.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 228 The next day, Cr√©ole rejoined Indivisible, and the two ships sailed together until they finally made contact with their division.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 229 Ganteaume reached Toulon on 18 February;Troude, Batailles navales, p. 230 Gourr√®ge left Cr√©ole to take command of the flagship Indivisible on 9 March.Quintin, Dictionnaire des capitaines, p. 157 The squadron set sail on 25 April. His crew much weakened by an epidemic, Ganteaume managed to establish a blockade of Elba on 1 May and bombard Portoferraio on 6 May, supporting the Siege of Porto Ferrajo, but he had to detach Formidable, Indomptable, Dessaix and Cr√©ole to ferry the sick to Livorno and return to Toulon.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 231 Cr√©ole took an incidental part in the Action of 24 June 1801, where the lone British 74-gun HMS Swiftsure met the French squadron and was captured after a running battle.Clowes, p. 453  Santo Domingo  On 9 January 1802, Cr√©ole departed Toulon with a division under contre-amiral Ganteaume, ferrying troops to Santo Domingo to consolidate the French occupation of Santo Domingo.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 270 After Toussaint Louverture surrendered, he was embarked on Cr√©oleTOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE FRAN√áOIS DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT dit (1743-1803) before being transferred on H√©ros and ferried to France, where he died in prison.

Her crew suffered from the yellow fever that was endemic to the campaign, so that only 150 men were fit and the frigate was 177 short of her usual complement.Troude, Batailles navales, p. 288 In the morning of 30 June, Cr√©ole met five British ships of the line, who closed in to investigate and gave chase. Cr√©ole was unable to escape the ships of the line as Vanguard and Cumberland came up and flanked her. Vanguard opened fire, and after a single token gunshot, Cr√©ole struck to her overwhelmingly better-armed opponents. Fate A prize crew conveyed Cr√©ole to Port Royal in Jamaica for repair. There the Royal Navy commissioned her as HMS Creole under Captain Austin Bissell. In late 1803 Cr√©ole sailed for Britain with a prize crew and numerous French prisoners. Cr√©ole was in a poor state, and on 26 December she sprang a leak. The crew and prisoners manned her pumps but were unable to prevent the accumulation of water such that by 30 December the water was rising by two feet per hour. Two leaks became evident, one forward and one aft of the hold. The crew threw her guns, shot, iron ballast and some stores overboard, and slung a sail under the hull. Still, by 2 January the pumps were again unable to prevent the accumulation of water. The crew and the prisoners were exhausted and so Bissell decided to abandon ship. Cumberland came up to take everyone off Cr√©ole. The last men left on 3 January, at which time she sank beneath the waves at .Hepper (1994), p. 103.

He was the sole master of the beombuchum (the Dance of the Commoner) and a recognised master of the obukchum or Five Drums Dance. Ha's primary focus was on the improvisational dance form known as heoteunchum. Because of their unstructured nature, Ha was able to continue performing these dances well into his eighties, abbreviating or adapting them according to his physical ability. Life Ha was born in Miryang province, the home of the Miryang Baekjung Festival, to parents who were folk dancers and musicians. He specialised in the drum from his mid- teens, and developed a reputation in the area for his skill in the drum dance. At 19, he became an official member of his family's dance troupe, and performed with them at local events and wrestling matches. In his early twenties, Ha absconded from Miryang to Manchuria, using the proceeds from the sale of an ox he had been asked to sell on his father's behalf. On returning to Korea, his economic situation obliged him to work as a manual labourer in Chagang. Ha's father died shortly thereafter. Ha continued to lead a vagrant lifestyle for much of his life, until finally, in his sixties, he returned to Miryang. Here, he founded a traditional music association, which eventually developed into the Folklore Preservation Society. He also performed in the annual Miryang Baekjung festival, which brought him national recognition after it was designated an Important Intangible Cultural Property. Ha received the Prime Minister's Award in the 1980s National Folk Arts Contest, and was subsequently recognised as an Important Intangible Cultural Asset in his own right.

Gaddis was born in Mattoon, Illinois and was nicknamed Gadabout by a boss who said he could never find him.Hobson, Dick. (1966, April 2-8). One day, Gadabout Gaddis posted a sign GONE FISHING and that was 56 years ago. TV Guide, pp 24-26. Gaddis, an avid fisherman since his youth in Illinois, was also a pilot and adventurer. He began his career in the early days of television by showing his home movies of his fishing expeditions. In 1939 he briefly hosted a program about fishing on General Electric's experimental TV station W2XAD in Schenectady, New York. When W2XAD became WRGB in the mid-1940s, Gaddis returned to the station to host Outdoors with Liberty Mutual, which was only the second sponsored television show (Lowell Thomas's being the first). The show was eventually carried on 73 stations. Going Places with Gadabout Gaddis in the 1950s was less successful, but beginning in the early 1960s Gaddis starred in The Flying Fisherman, also sponsored by Liberty Mutual. The Flying Fisherman The Flying Fisherman was a weekly program, usually broadcast on Saturday or Sunday afternoon, that showed Gaddis fishing in a different location each episode. The show's lone crew member was a cameraman who paddled alongside Gaddis in a nearby boat. The shows were filmed without sound, and Gaddis would add his low-key and folksy narration in the studio. The program had the look and feel of a home movie, which some analysts theorized was a major factor in its appeal to audiences. Not all programs showed Gaddis making a catch, including an episode shot at Thomas Lake in Colorado, where Gaddis filmed for five days without catching a fish. Gaddis was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1968. Gaddis earned his Army Air Corps pilot's wings during World War I and flew himself to each filming location in his Piper Cherokee 235. Each episode would open with a shot of Gadabout Gaddis landing his plane, but in reality it was his friend, Jack Phillipps, landing the plane in Gaddis's cowboy hat, as Gaddis could not \\"hit the mark\\"; i.e. he could not touch down on the spot required for the stationary camera to capture the landing. Gaddis lived in Bingham, Maine, and Gadabout Gaddis Airport in that town was his base of operations. The airport was built about 1950 and later bought by Gaddis.

The G√∂ttingen minipig is the smallest domestic pig breed known in the world; as an adult, they weigh around . Beside being known for their exceptionally small size, the G√∂ttigen minipigs are known for their docile nature and very clean and well-characterized health status. Raising of this breed began in the late 1960s at the Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics (Institut f√ºr Tierzucht und Haustiergenetik) at the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany, by crossbreeding the Minnesota minipig, the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, and the German Landrace pig.Bollen, PJA & Ellegaard, L.(1996). Developments in Breeding G√∂ttingen Minipigs. In Tumbleson & Schook (eds.) Advances in Swine in Biomedical Research. New York: Plenum Press G√∂ttingen minipigs are highly favored as pets, however, the breed was specifically developed for biomedical research. Today, they are extensively bred at four separate locations globally. History The G√∂ttingen minipig was raised for use in biomedical research. Smaller pigs required less space and feed, were easier to handle, and required a lesser amount of the compound being tested.McAnulty, PA, Dayan, AD, Ganderup, NC, & Hastings, KL. (2012). The Minipig in Biomedical Research. Boca Raton: CRC Press The G√∂ttingen minipig was the first miniature pig breed to be developed in Europe. They were available to the German biomedical research community from the late 1960s. Breeding began by crossing the Minnesota minipig, obtained from the Hormel Institute in the United States, and the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, obtained from a German zoo. Subsequent cross breeding with the German Landrace produced the white/pink skin pigmentation which characterizes modern G√∂ttingen minipigs. Breeding goals included a low body weight, good ear veins, and low inbreeding coefficients. In 1992, the first colony of barrier-bred, microbiologically defined G√∂ttingen minipigs were derived in Denmark. From this colony, G√∂ttingen minipigs were provided for biomedical research performed throughout Europe and to a limited extent in North America. Beginning in 2003, a colony of G√∂ttingen minipigs were established in the United States. Since 2010, the breed has also been available in Japan. Global use of G√∂ttingen minipigs for biomedical research has been increasing over the past two decades. In the United States in the 2010s, G√∂ttingen minipigs were soon purchased and bred locally to be sold as pets, in multiple locations. They are now a popular breed of pet pig, renowned for their small size.

An economy cannot be sustained if the underlying social structure is unsustainable. A social structure cannot be sustained if the environment it depends upon is unsustainable. Vice versa we find that in our modern day the environment cannot be sustained unless proper economical and social practices are in place. The radical sustainable philosophy addressed problems of sustainability through a bottom-up approach - a form of \\"grass roots\\" sustainability. Radical sustainability advocates and supports autonomous development, indigenous movements, women's rights, social justice and green practices. There are those who note that radical sustainability is accepted as a general vision, indicating a complex process once it is translated to specific goals. In terms of transitioning towards sustainable urban systems, a criticism also cites the inconsistency of its approaches with the established architecture making it less favorable.  Examples  There are widespread examples of radical sustainability including open source ecology, rainwater harvesting (e.g. the projects by Brad Lancaster) and the Bushmen who live a life where social and environmental aspects are completely intertwined. Radical sustainability can also be used in the case of product- service system (PSS) but it is proposed that there is a need for a better understanding and wider perspective on system, which exceeds the purview of narrow business-client interaction along a value chain. Empirical research also show that this concept is more prevalent in smaller firms, suggesting that there is a negative link between the radicality of sustainable innovation and firm size.

This group sought reform within the Catholic Church by drawing inspiration from the Protestant Reformation. It is known that the second edition was published in Venice in Italian in 1543 ‚àí although at least three editions are likely to have been published there in the 1540s, as well as one printing at Mantua). After a couple of years the book was said to have been sold in 40,000 copies and translated into English, French, Croat, and Castilian.

However, in 1566 it was revealed that it had been written by a Benedictine monk called Benedetto da Mantova, residing in Sicily. The work had then been substantially edited by Marcantonio Flaminio - a protege of Juan de Valdes and Cardinal Reginald Pole, and presented mystical themes from \\"Valdesian\\" theology. The work was heavily influenced by Jean Calvin's \\"Institutes\\" of 1539, and incorporated substantial quotes.Dermot Fenlon, Heresy and obedience in Tridentine Italy, Cambridge University press, 1972 It has been described as a \\"deeply Augustinian work\\", and stresses throughout man's absolute dependence on Christ for salvation. The first four chapters in particular expounded the doctrine of salvation by faith alone (Sola fide). Without faith in God, man is incapable of good works. Soon after its appearance the work was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (the Index of forbidden books, first published in 1559) and successfully suppressed by the Italian Inquisition. It continued with an underground following, but even by the 1560s and 1570s was proving hard to come by.

Her music is based in the traditions of Southern soul and international roots music. Song engages in social activism and is involved with environment, food justice, human rights and prison reform. She has been a speaker at TEDx in Asheville, North Carolina. Early life and education Leah Smith was born and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia into an artistic family. Her father, Andrew Hunter Smith, was a folk-sculptor and painter. Her mother, Jan Smith, was a jazz pianist and folk musician schooled in the traditions of southern Appalachian folk music who played fiddle with the Rosin Sisters. Her musical education was nurtured by her mother, who ensured that both sisters received classical and jazz piano training for most of their upbringing. Smith's mother also guided their training in vocals and harmony singing. Banjo, fiddle and guitar came later, after the sisters had left home and moved to Asheville, North Carolina. She graduated from Henry W. Grady High School where she was involved in political activism. Determined to pursue an experiential form of education, at 19 she moved to Mexico, where she became involved with the Zapatista movement. In a 2014 interview, she said of the experience, Musical career Rising Appalachia at the FloydFest 2010 in Floyd, Virginia Song and her sister Chloe decided to record their first album, Leah and Chloe (2006), one afternoon in the basement studio of a friend in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The album was meant as a gift for family and friends but they received so much support and recognition for it that they decided to officially start a band called Rising Appalachia. In the early days, the sisters busked in the French Quarter of New Orleans and elsewhere. They began to find their own natural interpretation of Appalachian music which brought together folk, soul, hip- hop, classical, southern gospel and other styles based on their upbringing on traditional Appalachian string band music, as well as on their exposure to urban music like hip-hop and jazz and the influence of roots music of all kinds which they experienced during their worldwide travels. Song's spoken- word poetry is a driving influence behind Rising Appalachia's music. Her background in movement arts has inspired her to cultivate a relationship with the global circus arts and street theater communities. Activism Leah Song performing with left Song is involved in the environmental activism of the Appalachian Mountains and Gulf Coast regions. She is also involved with food justice, human rights activism and prison activism. She works with prison programs which cultivate emotional release through the arts around the United States. Rising Appalachia has sung in support of the Occupy movement. The Slow Music Movement and the Wider Circles Rail Tour  Song coined the term \\"Slow Music Movement\\" while preparing for a TedX talk. During Rising Appalachia's Wider Circles Rail Tour, the band travelled by Amtrak train. Song connected this with the \\"Slow Music Movement\\", which she described as exploring the question as to how music can be a public service, saying: Personal life Song is a global traveller and lives between New Orleans, North Carolina, Cuba, India, Appalachia, and Latin America.

The first mails from the islands are believed to be those sent by the British Resident Commissioner, Charles Woodford, who was appointed in 1896 and established an administrative centre at Tulagi. Letters were sent in a sealed bag to Sydney where New South Wales stamps were affixed. Later, a stock of New South Wales stamps was kept at Tulagi and the stamps were cancelled in Sydney. From April 1906, Woodford used a paid handstamp instead and stamps were again added in Sydney.

Personal life  Cushing was born in 1823 in Hingham to Unitarian parents. When he was a teenager and started to read The Bible alone, he became a follower of the Orthodox Christian school of thought. When he was 18, he stated that he felt that God wanted him to become a minister. Cushing remained true to Christian principles throughout his life. He once gave all of his life savings of $1,000 (approximately $ in 2013) to a blind girl in order for her to receive an education.  Ministry  Cushing started his training to become a Unitarian minister based along his parents' theology. His first posting as an ordained minister was to Searsburg, New York, west of Trumansburg. There he met his future wife, Rea, and they were married in 1854. In the same year, Cushing wrote his first hymn, \\"When he Cometh\\", based on Malachi 3:17, for children in his Sunday School. Cushing then later went on to minister in a number of locations around New York until 1870 when Rea died, requiring Cushing to return to Searsburg. Shortly afterwards, Cushing suffered from a \\"creeping paralysis\\" that caused him to lose his voice, requiring him to retire from the ministry after 27 years in it.  Hymn writing  After having to retire from the ministry, Cushing asked God for something to do to occupy his time. He discovered he had a talent for hymn writing and made that a way to keep busy after work in the ministry. Throughout the rest of his life, Cushing wrote 300 hymns including \\"The Name of Jesus\\" and \\"Home at Last\\". In 1880, he co-wrote \\"Follow On\\" with Robert Lowry and W. Howard Doane. This hymn became popular and was associated with The Salvation Army; its tune was adopted by Scottish association football club, Rangers as the basis for their club anthem, \\"Follow Follow\\".  Death  Cushing died on 19 October 1902 in Lisbon Center, New York. He was buried in the Jones Cemetery, near Searsburg.

The term \\"plantain\\" can refer to all the banana cultivars which are normally eaten after cooking, rather than raw (see cooking banana), or it can refer to members of other subgroups of Musa cultivars, such as the Pacific plantains. True plantains are divided into four groups based on their bunch type: French, French Horn, False Horn, and Horn plantains. Each bunch type has a variety of cultivars associated with it: * French cultivars: 'Obino l'Ewai' (Nigeria), 'Nendran' (India), 'Dominico' (Colombia) * French Horn cultivars: 'Batard' (Cameroon), 'Mbang Okon' (Nigeria) * False Horn cultivars: 'Agbagba' and 'Orishele' (Nigeria), 'Dominico-Harton' (Colombia) * Horn cultivars: 'Ishitim' (Nigeria), 'Pisang Tandok' (Malaysia) In the 1990s, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture published two guides to help scientists and farmers identify plantains in West Africa and support their cultivation. * The IITA Reference Guide for \\"Plantain cultivation under West African Conditions\\" (1990, page 14) contains photos of different plantain types. * IITA's Research Guide 66 \\"Morphology and Growth of Plantain and Banana\\" (1997, but no longer available online, page 10) contains figures of the plantain inflorescence types.

It was dedicated to Fyodor Tyutchev and subtitled: \\"First part of the drama The Thirsty One\\". History In his commentaries to the first, magazine version of the poem, Maykov explained: > Beguny‚Ä≤ (The Runners) or The Wanderers, or the Sopelsky Agreement > (Sopelkovskoye soglasiye), after the Sopelki village where they were based, > are all the names for a priest-less sect, representing one of the raskol's > extreme factions. The wanderer has to leave behind everything that he‚Äôs ever > owned, sever all of his social and family ties so as to start living \\"as a > Christ's man\\". In the same commentaries the author mentioned several of the sources he used: The Historical Sketches of Russian Priesthood by Pavel Melnikov (part 1, Moscow, 1864), Stories from the History of the Old Believers by S.Maksimov (Saint-Petersburg, 1861), Songs Collected by P.V. Kireevsky (4th issue, Moscow, 1862), works by the raskol scholar N.I.Subbotin. Working upon the language, he studied Avvakum's literary legacy and some old Russian Bible- based texts. The plot of the poem (or the Scene, as Maykov has defined it) was based on Melnikov-Petchorsky's novel Grisha. Maykov omitted many trivial scenes as well as the episode of his ‚Äòtemptation by romantic passions' but strengthened the final, adding a scene of arson which was absent in Melnikov's novel. The first reading of \\"The Wanderer\\" took place on December 3, 1866, at the Karamzin Party. E.A. Stackensneider. Diaries and Notes. Moscow-Leningrad, 1934, Pp.347-348 The poem was praised by Fyodor Dostoyevsky who called it Maykov's masterpiece. \\"I've heard it on many occasions in different houses but still am never tired of hearing it each time discovering in it something new.

The mechanical pump is employed in order to have an adequate and positive circulation in steam and hot water boilers. History Martin Benson was the first to work on the idea of forced circulation drum boilers.Spencer, J. F. (1859). Description of a New Construction of High Pressure Steam Boiler. Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1859, pp. 264-278. In 1918, brought the forced circulation boiler from concept into existence.La Mont, Walter Douglas (1918). Steam generator. US Patent No. 1545668 La Mont was a Lieutenant Commander and an engineer in the US Navy. He died of a heart attack in 1942 in New York. La Mont's initial designs confirmed the lighter, safer and higher rates of heat transfer and evaporation per square foot as compared to that of the standard water tube boilers, also the circulation of vaporized water at a differential pressure of 2.5 bar was 8 to 10 times greater. The time needed for a La Mont Boiler to be able to deliver an evaporation rate of 100,000 pounds per hour was between 15 and 20 minutes. During World War II the U.S. Navy mainly relied upon Babcock & Wilcox boilers which were used commonly at the time. On the other hand, thousands were built in Europe and several German and Japanese ships used La Mont boilers. Principle The circulation of water and steam mixture takes with the help of an external pump which supplies water at a higher pressure than in a natural circulation boiler. Working A centrifugal pump which forms the heart of this boiler is responsible to circulate water within the boiler system. It receives water from the drum and delivers this water to a distribution header as shown in the diagram here. The number of headers may differ in numbers and depends on the size and boiler design of each boiler. The boiler heating surfaces includes a number of tubes arranged in a parallel form and the inlet ends are welded to the distributors or the headers. A circulation pressure is to be provided during the installation of the pump as per the boiler design and it should be sufficient to over come the resistance offered by the tubes. An even circulation takes place with the helps of the inlet nozzles provided at the inlet of tubes which creates the differential pressure adequate to cover the variations occurring at fluctuating loads or uneven firing conditions. The riser tubes outlet is welded to the collector headers and also directly to the drum containing steam and water .

He joined the administrative service in 1987. He served as the twelfth Commissioner of Customs and Excise of Hong Kong. He is the current Permanent Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs  Career   1987: Civil Service in Administrative Service  In 1987, Tang joined the Administrative Service for the Government of Hong Kong.  2010: Deputy Secretary for Labour and Welfare  In 2010, Tang was appointed Deputy Secretary for Labour and Welfare.  2011-2015: Director of Broadcasting, RTHK  On September 9, 2011, Tang was appointed by the Hong Kong government as the Director of Broadcasting, the head of Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). Tang's appointment took effect on September 15, 2011. However, Tang, previously an Administrative Officer, did not have experience in the field of broadcasting at the time he was appointed. Therefore, people, especially staff from RTHK, called Tang‚Äôs suitability for the role into question and saw Tang as the embodiment of government intervention into freedom of the press, fearing he would interfere with their editorial independence. After Tang took up his broadcasting post, he was criticized for politically interfering with the affairs of the RTHK. Criticisms of Tang continued from his initial appointment until present. A survey conducted by the Democratic Party in 2013 revealed that over 40% of respondents wished for Tang to step down from his position. Besides his inexperience in broadcasting before his appointment, Tang was accused of having a dual role as he is both the chief editor of broadcaster in RTHK and an administrative officer in the government. This led to criticisms that Tang may have a pro-government stance while performing his job in RTHK. = 2012: Legco Review = In 2012 Tang suggested terminating the 26-year-old programme Legco Review in an internal meeting. This led to criticisms that Tang was attempting to eliminate the voice in RTHK of criticizing controversial issues in the world. Some parties believe that RTHK's programmes were mostly used to mock the government officials and government policies in a one-sided manner. They think that Tang, who was from the government, can balance the internal views in RTHK towards the government. Thus, they staged a rally and started campaigns to support Tang. Some parties are dissatisfied with Tang's actions, which they view as political interference. They aired their grievances through the mass media. For example, they created groups and pages in social media like Facebook to draw attention to the issue. Some even made fun of Tang by nicknaming him \\"the last samurai of RTHK\\" or spoofing his photos. = 2013: Headliner = In 2013 Tang criticized the idea of using Adolf Hitler and the Nazis as characters in the programme Headliner. At last, the producers scrapped the idea and use characters from the story Journey to the West. This led to criticisms that Tang was interfering with RTHK's editorial independence by using his authority.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on March 26, 2013. The episode is written by Bill Nuss and directed by Tom Wright, and was seen by 18.62 million viewers. The team investigates death of a navy medical officer aboard a ship that went through a storm. The prime suspect turns out to be a 4-star admiral, who is also McGee's estranged father. Plot In the opening scene, the body of a navy medical officer is found during a storm at sea and quickly determined to have been murdered. The team leaves to investigate at the scene, but McGee is late as a result of being with Adam, a middle school-aged boy he is spending time with through a Big Brothers Big Sisters program. When he arrives at the ship, he encounters his father, John McGee, a 4-star admiral. It immediately becomes apparent that their relationship is somewhat strained. Meanwhile, Tony and Ziva come across NCIS Agent Stan Burley, who assists in the investigation. Tony shortly afterwards becomes concerned that Burley is attempting to flirt with Ziva, who is \\"vulnerable\\" due to her father's recent death, telling McGee, \\"You see he would use that to his advantage. Swoop right in, like a hawk going after a sweet, innocent, furry little Israeli.\\" However, when Tony speaks with Burley, the latter responds by announcing that he is engaged to be married. McGee briefly considers quitting the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, but decides against it and encourages Adam to stand up to a bully. Numerous potential killers are introduced. It is discovered that there was a drug problem on the ship, though all related suspects are cleared. The admiral later becomes a suspect, prompting him to admit that he has cancer, though he is also cleared. Later, it is found that John McGee's aide had killed the medic in order to prevent the news of the cancer from being released. As the episode closes, McGee decides to attempt to repair his relationship with his father. Production Joel Gretsch reprised his role as Stan Burley. \\"Squall\\" is written by Bill Nuss and directed by Tom Wright. This is Nuss' first episode on NCIS, and was written as a freelance assignment. \\"Sometimes episodes just come together beautifully\\", executive producer Gary Glasberg said about the episode. \\"Writing an NCIS is no easy task and Bill certainly rose to the occasion. I'm the first to admit I handed Bill a pretty tricky episode complete with significant visual effects, a touching story about McGee and his father, and a fun little runner revealing Tim as a \\"Big Brother\\" to a teenage boy\\", Glasberg continued. As shown in other episodes in season 10, the theme \\"fallen heroes\\" also applies to Admiral McGee, diagnosed with stage four cancer. On February 25, 2013, TV Line reported the casting of Jamey Sheridan as Timothy McGee's father, Admiral John McGee. Showrunner Gary Glasberg told TV Line that \\"The role of McGee‚Äôs father is complex and layered with some real surprises thrown in\\". He also mentioned Admiral McGee \\"will be part of what leads us into our final arc\\". Joel Gretsch reprised his role as the recurring character NCIS special agent Stan Burley, last seen in the episode \\"Playing With Fire\\". Reception \\"Squall\\" was seen by 18.62 million live viewers following its broadcast on March 26, 2013, with a 3.2/9 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Squall\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 14.53 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"Seek\\", \\"Squall\\" was down in viewers and even in adults 18‚Äì49. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5/5 and stated that \\"You have to admire the work done by Jamey Sheridan as McGee's father: his portrayal of a charismatic boor was outstanding. I think that when an actor can portray a character which affects the viewer the way his did, it speaks loudly of his ability. [...] \\"Squall\\" introduced us to Tim's father as the Admiral of a ship on which a doctor was killed. It took the full episode to discover that Admiral McGee was suffering from stage-four cancer (we're not told what kind), and that his advancement to a cabinet-level post at the White House would be in jeopardy should anyone find out about his illness.\\" Wolfe also criticized the choice to give McGee father issues, as it was previously established in earlier seasons that Gibbs, Ziva, and Tony all had difficult relationships with their fathers.

Founded in 2009, the society has campaigned against the use of homeopathy, challenged the claims of psychics, and hosts regular events in Liverpool, podcasts, and an annual conference in Manchester, QED: Question. Explore. Discover. As part of their Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub events the society hosts guest speakers, who have included Simon Singh, David Nutt, and Robert Llewellyn. It also organises the awareness and protest against homeopathy campaign, 10:23. History The Merseyside Skeptics Society was founded in February 2009 to develop and support the sceptical community in Merseyside. The Society held its first speaker's meeting on 17 September 2009 at the Crown Hotel in Liverpool, England. Professor Chris French, editor of The Skeptic magazine gave a talk entitled \\"The Psychology of Anomalous Experiences\\". Merseyside Skeptics Society Limited was registered in the United Kingdom as a private, limited by guarantee, no share capital company on 20 August 2010. According to co-founder Michael Marshall, the group chose to use the American spelling of 'skeptic' because \\"in the States, the word isn‚Äôt as strongly linked to cynicism. It's not seen as being as negative as it is over here.\\" When climate change deniers began identifying as sceptics, vice president Michael Marshall made a clear distinction, stating: \\"In our view, climate change sceptics are not sceptics. A sceptic looks at the available evidence and makes a decision, and for homeopathy the evidence is that it doesn't work. But the sceptical position on climate change is that it is happening.\\" Activities Meetings Brian Deer talks to the Merseyside Skeptics Society at a Skeptics in the Pub meeting The Society holds several regular meetings in the Liverpool area, including the Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub, Skeptic Dinners, and Women's Socials. Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub holds two meetings a month, one of which is a social event and the other of which features a guest speaker. Guest speakers have included Ariane Sherine, Simon Singh, David Aaronovitch, Evan Harris, Elizabeth Pisani, Brian Deer, Jon Ronson, Stephen Law, David Nutt, Mark Stevenson, Mark Lynas and Robert Llewellyn, among others. Topics covered vary widely and include health care, science, atheism, the paranormal and supernatural, psychics, politics and psychology. Homeopathy Michael Marshall leads a homeopathic overdose during QED 2011 in Manchester. In 2009, the society wrote an open letter to pharmacy chain Boots in which they denounced the sales of homeopathic products in their store. In the letter they wrote that \\"We trust brands such as Boots to check the facts for us ... We don't expect to find products on the shelf at our local pharmacy which do not work\\", calling for them to remove the \\"bogus therapy\\" from their shelves. The Society organised the 10:23 campaign to raise awareness of, and campaign against, homeopathy. This campaign included protests in 2010 against Boots for selling homeopathic preparations as equivalent to mainstream, scientifically-based medicine and involved mass homeopathic overdoses outside Boots stores to mock what the protesters asserted to be the lack of efficacy in homeopathic products. Following the overdose, Boots responded by saying \\"We know that many people believe in the benefits of complementary medicines and we aim to offer the products we know our customers want.\\" These protests took place in 70 cities in 30 countries around the world, including Australia and New Zealand, and resulted in no ill effects to those taking the products. In addition, the Society has complained about GPs who have advocated alternative medicine including homeopathy. Sports wristband test In 2012, Merseyside Skeptics Society investigated claims that the Shuzi Qi sports wristbands ‚Äì bands supposed to improve athletic performance similar to Power Balance bands ‚Äì had any effect. These bands were promoted in marketing materials as containing a computer chip programmed to \\"resonate with blood cells' natural frequencies\\", improving circulation by causing them to \\"unclump\\". The study cited by Shuzi UK used a technique called live blood cell analysis which has been discredited, and Merseyside Skeptics Society characterized the claims as \\"nonsensical techno-babble\\". After the society conducted tests with a rugby player, it was reported that the bands had made \\"no discernable difference\\" and that when subject to double blind trials, the product failed to have any effect on the rugby player's performance. Following the test, a spokesman for Shuzi UK stated that the claims made on its UK website would be updated; however, the director of the company claimed that the tests were biased and unfair. Challenging psychic claims Ash Pryce demonstrating psychic surgery at a Skeptics in the Pub meeting In 2011, celebrity psychic Sally Morgan was accused of having an off-stage assistant at her shows who passed information to her via radio. Merseyside Skeptics Society subsequently challenged her to participate in a test of her supposed powers, designed by psychologist Chris French. Around the same time, Simon Singh received emails from Sally Morgan's solicitor, stating that she had instructed the solicitor to \\"take libel proceedings, if necessary, in relation to allegations that she is a cheat\\" following the campaign encouraging her to take the test. The Society turned the initial challenge into an annual event titled the \\"Halloween Challenge\\"; a scientific test to investigate if professional mediums could demonstrate psychic abilities in a controlled setting. In 2012, researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London conducted the challenge with two professional mediums, who both agreed beforehand that it was a fair test of their abilities, asking them to attempt to identify information about five volunteers they had not previously met and could not see. The experiment involved the mediums writing details about the volunteers, who then had to identify themselves from the descriptions. With a success rate of one in five, the results showed little evidence of the mediums' claimed psychic ability. One of the mediums described the test as \\"designed to confirm the researchers' preconceptions\\", saying that she had to work face-to-face to make a connection. Vice-president Michael Marshall supported the ban of the sale of tarot readings and spells on eBay in 2012, stating he thought it was \\"solid consumer protection\\". He continued that \\"tarot, spells and curses are all highly unproven\\", noting that although many tarot readers are sincere and believe they have psychic abilities, \\"that doesn't make it any more real.\\" When the owner of a missing cat in Lincolnshire enlisted the help of a psychic, who said that it had been adopted by another family and would be found in an area children play, the society said: \\"Both of these are incredibly obvious scenarios to suggest for a missing cat, and would likely be the suggestions you'd get from someone without psychic powers ‚Äì and without the need for a fee, too.\\" In June 2010, Liverpudlian psychic Joe Power made allegations to the police that threats of violence had been directed towards him from members of the society on social media site Facebook. After police contacted the society in regards to the claims, a member was able to explain that the allegations were unfounded. In a statement on their website following the incident, they wrote \\"nobody involved with the Merseyside Skeptics Society ‚Äì or anyone that I even know of ‚Äì has ever made threats to Joe or his family, and we absolutely never will.\\" Podcasts The current Skeptics with a K lineup: Michael \\"Marsh\\" Marshall, Mike Hall, and Alice Howarth, at the 2015 QED conference in Manchester. Merseyside Skeptics Society produces three podcasts titled Skeptics with a K, InKredulous and Be Reasonable. =Skeptics with a K= Skeptics with a K, \\"the podcast for science, reason and critical thinking\\", is the official podcast of the Society. Its first episode was recorded on 28 July 2009, at Mike Hall's home. The podcast features hosts Mike Hall, Michael \\"Marsh\\" Marshall and Colin Harris ‚Äì in April 2014 replaced by Alice Howarth ‚Äì discussing recent events from a skeptical point of view. Co-host Michael Marshall described it as, \\"a fairly-shambolic, overly-enthusiastic and snarky mix of science, skepticism and sarcasm.\\" A popular semi-regular segment, until 14 July 2011 when it concluded with a special \\"Best of\\" edition, was a fact check on the children's book The Giant Book of Fantastic Facts. On 1 April 2013, an entire episode consisted of fictional stories including a parody of Ghost Busters, a story about the \\"Mersey Book of Monsters\\" and one about the \\"Paranormal Investigation Society Scotland (PISS)\\". The hosts have appeared as guests on other popular podcasts including Cognitive Dissonance and the Token Skeptic. =InKredulous= InKredulous is a comedy panel quiz show, inspired by shows such as Mock the Week, Have I Got News for You, and The News Quiz, featuring a variety of guests from the sceptic community. In the pilot episode, host Andy Wilson described it as \\"the quiz show where we satirically examine news stories, websites, events and personalities who will tweak the spider sense of our sceptical listeners and delicious looking panelists.\\" The first episode was released on 8 February 2010. Hosts of other podcasts are frequently guests, including Steven Novella of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Robin Ince of Infinite Monkey Cage, George Hrab of Geologic, Brian Dunning of Skeptoid, Kylie Sturgess of Token Skeptic, Ross Blocher and Carrie Poppy of Oh No, Ross and Carrie!, and others. Other notable guests include David Aaronovitch, Paul Zenon, and Jon Ronson. =Be Reasonable= Be Reasonable is a monthly interview show that engages guests with ideas outside the mainstream scientific consensus, such as a member of the Flat Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography and the presence of aliens on Earth. QED: Question, Explore, Discover QED 2013 Panorama Starting in February 2011 the Merseyside Skeptics Society, in conjunction with the Greater Manchester Skeptics Society, began organising and presenting an annual two-day sceptical science festival, QED: Question. Explore. Discover. QED is organised by sceptics volunteers and any proceeds go back into the event or a charity. On the \\"Token Skeptic\\" podcast Michael Marshall said, \\"How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by people who are just part of that community who are doing this because we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK scepticism and also international scepticism\\". =QED 2011= The master of ceremonies for the first QED was George Hrab. Notable speakers included Steven Novella and Eugenie Scott, and episodes of the podcasts InKredulous, The Pod Delusion, and Strange Quarks were recorded live during the event. In an article on the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry website about the first QED conference, Kylie Sturgess said, \\"The organisers of QEDCon didn't need to proclaim the success of their convention from the stage‚Äîit was evident from the beginning to the end.\\" =QED 2012= The second QED convention in 2012 was sponsored by the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and featured speakers such as Robin Ince and Maryam Namazie. The Skeptic magazine awarded the first annual \\"Ockhams' Awards\\" at QED 2012. The categories and winners were; Editor's Choice Award ‚Äì Mike Hutchinson from The Skeptic; Best Skeptic Video ‚Äì Tim Minchin's \\"Storm\\"; Best Science Video ‚Äì Daniel Keogh and Luke Harris; Best Skeptic Blog of 2011 ‚Äì Skepchick; Best Podcast ‚Äì The Pod Delusion; and Best Event/Campaign/Outreach ‚Äì Robin Ince. =QED 2013= Richard Dawkins at QED 2013 The third QED, sponsored by the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and the British Humanist Association, featured speakers such as Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss. The second annual Ockham's Awards were presented to \\"Shut Up Infinity\\" (Best Video); Quackometer (Best Blog); Kylie Sturgess, Token Skeptic (Best Podcast); Skeptics on the Fringe, Edinburgh Skeptics Society (Best Event/Campaign) and The Pod Delusion (Editor's Choice). =QED 2014= The fourth QED was hosted by magician Paul Zenon, who co-wrote and appeared in the humorous opening film and was also a panelist. Notable speakers included Richard Wiseman, Elizabeth Pisani, Mark Crislip, Robert Llewellyn, Nathan Phelps, Susan Gerbic, Mark Edward and Deborah Hyde.

Introduced as bill AB1616, the California Homemade Food Act was signed by Governor Jerry Brown and became law effective January 1, 2013. Prior to the enactment of the California Homemade Food Act, entrepreneurs were subjected to the same regulations as commercial restaurants and bakeries. Food safety laws forced owners to have to rent part of a retail kitchen and prepare all of their products there. Rental costs, along with the costs of complying with other health regulations, made it difficult for small-scale homemade food businesses to turn a profit. This law allows home cooks to run enterprises, termed a Cottage Food Operation or a \\"CFO\\", that manufacture \\"low-risk\\" foods from within the individual's home. These \\"low-risk\\" foods must be less susceptible to bacterial growth that could cause food poisoning; they must be able to stay fresh without needing refrigeration. For this reason, Cottage Food Operations are still barred from selling dairy products and meat. The California Department of Public Health has compiled a list of \\"low-risk\\" foods, which are approved for a CFO to produce, prepare, package, and peddle to customers out of their \\"private home\\". A CFO is limited to producing and selling foods found on this list. A \\"private home\\" can be either owned or rented by the operator of the CFO, and thus includes both houses and apartments. The California Homemade Food Act also relaxes many zoning restrictions for CFOs, since traditional bakeries would not be allowed to operate out of a residential area. Nevertheless, Cottage Food Operations will still have to apply for a permit from the County Department of Health and follow numerous other regulations set under the law. Legislative history On February 8, 2012, Mike Gatto, the assemblyman for the 43rd district, introduced the California Homemade Food Act on to the floor of the California State Assembly. Gatto authored the bill in response to the closure of a cottage food business of one of his constituents. Mark Stambler's homemade bread business was deemed in violation of food safety laws by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and forced to shut down. Gatto's bill sought a state-wide standardization of food safety laws for cottage food industries while curbing regulations Gatto called \\"paradoxical and nonsensical.\\" The Assembly passed the bill on May 29, 2012, by a vote of 56-19 with 5 members not voting. The Senate passed the bill along with several amendments on August 30, 2012, by the unanimous vote of the 34 senators present (6 senators did not vote). The Senate amendments required the bill to return to the Assembly, which approved the amended version on August 30 by a vote of 60-16 with 4 Assemblymen not voting. No Assembly members who supported the bill in the first vote opposed the bill in the second vote. There were two assembly members, Connie Conway and Jim Nielsen, who voted against the bill in the first vote but subsequently voted for the bill in the second vote. Governor Jerry Brown signed the California Homemade Food Act into law on September 21, 2012. Brown praised the bill as a measure to facilitate hiring by California businesses.

He played as an outside left. Life and career Gresham was born in Liverpool, the younger brother of William Gresham, who also went on to play for Lincoln City. James Gresham played once for Lincoln in September 1889 in the Midland League and moved to Doncaster Rovers for the beginning of the 1890‚Äì91 season. Rovers were playing in the newly formed Midland Alliance League. He played inside forward as well as outside left for Doncaster, and was part of the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA Senior Challenge Cup-winning side who beat Sheffield United 2‚Äì1. The following season Doncaster were in the Midland League. After a 3‚Äì1 defeat in the FA Cup at Lincoln, the Rovers' committee dropped a player for the following game at Loughborough; this infuriated him, and Gresham and Tom Kisbey, who had also moved to Rovers from Lincoln, refused to play in support of their teammate. Doncaster lost that match 11‚Äì2, and both Gresham and Kisbey were given a one-match suspension despite asking for their release from the club. In all games, Gresham scored 12 goals and played until he and other players made a demand for higher wages and insurance on 23 November 1891, going on strike after the club refused. A week later, all except Gresham and Kisbey resolved their differences with the club. Following this, Lincoln City paid a ¬£20 fee to bring Gresham back to the club in December. The next season, Lincoln's first in the Second Division of the Football League, he was ever- present, but spent the season after that with Rossendale in the Lancashire League. He signed for Lincoln again in 1894, but his return was short-lived. Having injured a shoulder in the opening match of the season, he was unavailable for two weeks, and lost a significant amount of weight during that time. He returned to action, but after the match on 20 October asked the committee to allow him a rest to recover his strength. The club refused, told him he would no longer be paid, and resolved that \\"as Gresham has failed to qualify for a position in the first team his services be dispensed with, in accordance with the undertaking he gave when he signed, that if he did not prove strong enough he should not hold the club responsible.\\" Gresham began legal proceedings against the club, claiming that his summary dismissal was unjust because any decrease in performance was entirely due to injuries sustained while performing his duties in the club's employ. The judge ruled that his contract was not unconditional, so could be cancelled in the event of inadequate performance, but was not convinced by the club's argument that the player's deficiencies were unrelated to his injuries. He refused Gresham's claim of ¬£33 loss of earnings (from the date of his dismissal to the end of the football season, at his basic weekly wage of 30s), on the grounds that he had a trade to follow when not engaged in football, but awarded him ¬£20 in damages plus costs.

They are named after Masakatsu Shibasaki, whose group first developed them, and are used as asymmetric catalysts. Development The Shibasaki group produced the first chiral lanthanide- binaphtholate complex in 1992, which was used to catalyse nitroaldol reactions. The complex was not characterised but was the first to perform the reaction enantioselectively. This success led to further research which resulted in the development of heterometallic complexes with the formula [Ln(binol)3(M)3], the structure of which was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Scope Shibasaki catalysts are effective for a wide range of enantioselective reactions including nitroaldol, Michael, Diels-Alder and hydrophosphonylation reactions. Their effectiveness arises in part from their ability to act as both a Br√∏nsted base by virtue of the metal alkoxide and a Lewis acid via the lanthanide ion. Enantioselectivity has been found to be sensitive to both Ln and M; with the nitroaldol reaction being most effective when Ln = Eu and M = Li whereas the Michael reaction requires Ln = La and M = Na. It was observed that alterations of Ln and M caused predictable changes in the bite angle of the binaphthol backbone.

Manasa is acknowledged as leading young exponent of Kuchipudi the classical dance form of India that has its cultural roots in ancient history. Her dance journey began at age six under the guidance of Guru Smt Madhu Nirmala, who had taught some basic steps and later Guru Sri Narasayya. Her debut live performance was at the age of six. She continued her artistic endeavor under the tutelage of renowned gurus by Guru Sri Mahankali Suryanarayana Sarma for three years where a strong foundation has been laid. Later, she has been moulded as a complete Kuchipudi artiste and has been transformed as a gem of Kuchipudi by her Guru \\"Devaparijatham\\", \\"Raja Hamsa\\", \\"Natyavisarada\\" Sri Kaza Venkata Subrahmanyam, who is a disciple of the Gurus Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam and Sri Chintha Adinarayana Sarma.

Immigration consultants may or may not have legal expertise about immigration laws and visa laws and about procedures for obtaining different types of visas, as the designation is regulated by some, but not all, governments. In the United States, immigration consultants/notaries are not required to have formal immigration law training and are not allowed to answer even the most basic immigration legal questions. Doing so would constitute unauthorized practice of law, which is a crime. Because of this, many organizations including the Central America Resource Center recommend that all persons seeking immigration assistance completely avoid notaries and immigration consultants and, instead, seek legal advice from a licensed attorney. On the other hand, Canada provides certification as a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant through the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council, and Australia provides it through the Migration Agents Registration Authority. Immigration consultants started working in the 1960s when a large number of qualified people have started migrating from Asia and Latin America to the United States, Canada and Europe. Generally these developed countries have requirement of highly skilled professionals and so they have very strict and complicated rules for immigration and visa processing. To help aid people who need clarity regarding the visa and immigration rules of various countries, this concept of immigration consultancies has come forward.

Later research showed that he was born in Villena in 1646. He was named by the artists of the day El Castellano. Biography He studied in the city of Murcia, under Mateo Gilarte and Nicol√°s de Villacis. After passing some years under those masters he went to Italy, and at Rome became a scholar of Giacinto Brandi, under whose tuition he made considerable progress. Pietro da Cortona, Salvator Rosa, and Carlo Maratti assisted him with their counsels; but the climate of Italy proving detrimental to his health, he returned to Spain, where he attached himself to Carre√±o, and, though far advanced in the art, worked as a young pupil. In 1674 he went to Madrid, and was employed by Charles II in a series of twenty-four pictures on the life of St. Augustine, for the cloisters of San Felipe el Real, which occupied him, with other commissions from the king, till 1711. He was also much employed by Philip V, who made him his principal painter in 1703, and shortly after a chevalier of the order of St. Michael. In the latter part of his life he retired to the convent of San Felipe, and died there probably in 1719. He published Principios para estudiar la nobilissima arte de la Pintura, 1691, and several other works on anatomy and painting for the benefit of students. His productions are at Madrid, Valencia, Sig√ºenza, San Jago, and Guadalaxara. Works His works included Marie Louise of Orleans (1679) which is now in the Prado, Saint Augustine (1663) and Two Fathers Painting the Virgin (c. 1670-1719, oil on linen: 185 x 146 cm.) which is also at the Prado.

As a matter of fact, the two are a pair of thieves seeking a treasure which is hidden in the Applejohn home. This treasure was hidden in the house by a pirate ancestor, known as Captain Applejack. Ivan Borolsky shows up at the house but, eventually, Applejohn manages to get Borolsky and Valeska out of the house. Applejohn falls asleep and dreams of his pirate ancestor, of his ship, and of his conquest of a pretty woman, who is at first resistant, but in the end completely surrenders to him. When he awakes he finds that a parchment really exists in the house and that his visitors are really thieves and are seeking a hidden treasure. He races to find the treasures indicated on the parchment before the thieves can find it themselves. In the end he put the villains to rout, finds the treasure and discovers that he also loves Poppy. Pre-Code aspects The film is filled with pre-code material, especially during the pirate dream sequence. During that sequence, Captain Applejack brazenly forces a woman to submit to his sexual advances and actually grabs her breasts.

It was one of the first buildings to be rebuilt on the Black Country Living Museum site. It is an excellent example of a typical Black Country Methodist chapel. Chapel Origins The Darby family brought a plot of land on Northfield Road and in 1828 work began on building the chapel. The ‚ÄòProvidence Chapel‚Äô was named after a chapel in Epwarth, Lincolnshire and was affiliated to the Methodist New Connection. The chapel played a central part in the life of the local community for one hundred and fifty years. It was a well-known centre of Christian beliefs and practices with a strong tradition of choral singing. The chapel was also a centre of education and welfare; it helped to alleviate hardship amongst the low paid workers of the Black Country. Trustees of the chapel created clubs like the Darby Hand Doctors Club to provide medical assistance.  Relocation  In May 1971 the Sunday school building was destroyed by a fire, the chapel was closed in August 1974. The land was set to be sold and the building demolished. The Black Country Living Museum was invited to save some of the pews. The Museum was in fact interested in saving the whole building and in November 1975 the building was dismantled and the larger parts transferred to the Museum site. There were however problems with certain bricks which could not be used again. As luck would have it, it was possible to dismantle another chapel in Wolverhampton Street, Dudley which dated from 1828-9. This provided the right kind of brick for the chapel. Reconstruction at the Museum began in June 1977 and took two years, the chapel was dedicated in 1979.  The Building  The chapel is a simple, brick-built, rectangle with two small rear extensions. The front is ‚Äòrelieved‚Äô by an impressive entrance of rendered brick. The interior is plain and functional with a small lobby underneath a gallery that runs down the sides and rear of the chapel. The side galleries are supported by fluted columns with ornate capitals that divide the interior into aisles. In the middle stands a dominant pulpit where the Minister would be able to see the whole of his congregation. The pulpit is situated below a scrolled banner painted on the wall which proclaims ‚ÄúWorship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness‚Äù .

Following the French Revolution of 1789, diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic had steadily deteriorated and France was in political and social turmoil. One of the strongest hotbeds of republican activity was the principal Atlantic naval base of the French Navy at Brest in Brittany, the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790. On 2 January a small British warship, the 14-gun brig HMS Childers under Commander Robert Barlow, was ordered to enter the Roadstead of Brest to reconnoitre the state of readiness of the French fleet. As Childers entered the Goulet de Brest, the vessel came under fire from French batteries flying the tricolour. Although Barlow clearly identified his brig as a neutral British vessel the fire continued until he was able to withdraw. Although Childers had been struck by a cannonball, none of the crew were wounded. The incident was of itself inconsequential, with minimal damage and no casualties on either side, but it marked a symbolic moment in the deterioration of relations between Britain and France in the approach to war, which broke out on 1 February 1793. Background Following the French Revolution of 1789 relations between the newly declared French Republic and its European neighbours sharply deteriorated. In April 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz was jointly issued by the Austria and Prussia stating their support for King Louis XVI. In February 1792 Austria and Prussia formally allied and the French Legislative Assembly responded on 20 April 1792 by declaring war on Austria. This first conflict, known as the War of the First Coalition, began on land as other than France the principal European seapowers remained neutral. The arrest of the French king in August 1792 and the expansion of the war into Northern Italy brought about the start of the naval war in the Mediterranean Sea. Britain had remained neutral throughout the first stages of the war. Although unsympathetic to the violence and upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling to go to war alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself was very strong, having been expanded and improved during the 1780s ‚Äì indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy had been one of the causes of the original Revolution in 1789. Childers incident Map of the Roadstead of BrestThe strength of the French Atlantic fleet was a major cause of concern to the British Admiralty, and in late 1792 orders were issued for the small British brig, the 14-gun HMS Childers under Commander Robert Barlow, to enter the Roadstead of Brest and investigate the state of readiness of the French fleet. On 2 January 1793, Childers was approaching the entrance to the roadstead under overcast skies and with a light, unreliable breeze. The only entrance to Brest harbour is through a narrow waterway known as the Goulet de Brest. The Goulet lies between the Pointe du Petit Minou and the Pointe du Portzic on the north shore and the √Ælot des Capucins and the Pointe des Espagnols on the Roscanvel peninsula to the south. Due to its importance as the entrance to Brest, the shores of the Goulet were heavily fortified. As Childers entered the Goulet one of the forts covering the entrance from the southern shore fired a shot at a distance of which passed over the brig into the sea beyond. Assuming this warning shot had been fired in the belief that his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly identified as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon. Under fire and with the wind too calm for sailing, Barlow ran out oars to try and pull his brig away from the French batteries. The diminutive size of his vessel made it a difficult target and he was soon able to take advantage of a fresh breeze to withdraw from the crossfire. A single shot struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, although none of the crew were wounded by the strike. Aftermath French batteries firing at Childers off Brest 1793; National Maritime Museum Having successfully withdrawn Childers from danger, Barlow returned to Britain on 4 January after battling a strong gale in the Channel. Anchoring at the small Cornish port of Fowey, Barlow took an express coach directly to the Admiralty in London, arriving on 11 January carrying the 48 lb (22 kg) cannonball as evidence of the incident and what British historian William James called the \\"strong spirit of hostility on the part of the new republic\\". Historian Edward Pelham Brenton, writing in 1825, noted however that French hostility on this occasion was justified, commenting that \\"in the then troubled state of Europe Childers and her captain had no business to be prying into the equipments at Brest within gunshot of the forts: if we had seen a French vessel of war running from the Needles to St Helens, and making observations, I suspect we should, at such a crisis, have taken the liberty to bring her to action.\\" On 24 January the French ambassador was expelled in response to the execution of Louis XVI in Paris on 21 January and on 1 February the National Convention declared war on Great Britain. The naval campaign in the Atlantic began in earnest in March 1793, when a French battle squadron briefly put to sea before a mutiny forced it to return. The war between Britain and France begun in the Goulet on 2 January 1793 was to last, with a 14-month break in 1802‚Äì1803, until 1815.

The Idea (, \\"Idea, her birth, her life, her death\\") is a 1920 wordless novel by Flemish artist Frans Masereel (1889‚Äì1972). In eighty-three woodcut prints, the book tells an allegory of a man's idea, which takes the form of a naked woman who goes out into the world; the authorities try to suppress her nakedness, and execute a man who stands up for her. Her image is spread through the mass media, inciting a disruption of the social order. Filmmaker Berthold Bartosch made an animated adaptation in 1932. Overview An artist is struck with an idea, which manifests itself as a naked woman with long, black hair. He displays her to the public, but the authorities, offended by her nudity, chase her around the city in order to cover up her body. A man who is not offended by her nudity takes to the woman's side, and the two fight injustice together; the man is caught and executed. The authorities destroy all books published with the woman's image, but she finds new outlets in the mass media, and succeeds in disrupting the social order. The woman returns to the artist, who has a new idea‚Äîa white-haired woman. He frames and hangs the black-haired woman on the wall, and releases the white-haired woman to the public. The allegorical book is open to interpretation. It can be seen as representing new ideas, and how they disrupt and are resisted by tradition. From the perspective of the woman, it can be seen as how the image of women is manipulated by society and the media, or how society is threatened by women who express themselves freely. Publication history The book first appeared as in 1920 from French publisher under the title Id√©e, sa naissance, sa vie, sa mort: 83 images, dessin√©es et grav√©es sur bois (\\"Idea, her birth, her life, her death: 83 pictures, drawn and engraved on wood\\"). It was printed from 83 woodcuts of each. Of the 878 copies made, the first 28 were signed and hand- numbered and printed on Japon imperial paper, one in a serious number 1‚Äì25 and another A‚ÄìC. A further 50 printed on Hollande van Gelder paper were unsigned but hand-number in Roman numerals from I to L. The unsigned rest of the run was on volumineux anglais paper. German publisher Kurt Wolff released a popular edition in 1924 under the German title Die Idee: 83 Holzschitte. An introduction by writer Hermann Hesse prefaced the second edition in 1927. An English edition didn't appear until London publisher Redstone Press released it in 1986 in a paired edition with Story Without Words (1920), entitled The Idea and Story Without Words: Two Novels Told in Woodcuts. Legacy American artist Lynd Ward used the concept of an idea surviving oppression in his wordless novel Madman's Drum (1930). Austro-Hungarian filmmaker Berthold Bartosch spent two years on an animated film adaptation of The Idea in 1932; initially Masereel agreed to a collaboration in 1930, but backed out of the production. Bartosch's version has the idea defeated in the end. He tries to create a three-dimensional feeling through the use of multiple levels of animation cels. Film historian William Moritz called it \\"the first animated film created as an artwork with serious, even tragic, social and philosophical themes\\". Historian Perry Willett wrote that the film is at times unclear, and was \\"something of a disappointment\\".

Biography Washburn attended Pierce Academy in his hometown of Middleboro and Phillips Academy in Andover, and graduated from Amherst College in 1855. Spending a year traveling Europe and the Middle East, he then attended Andover Theological Seminary in 1859 for one year. He initially went to Constantinople as the treasurer of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, an early American Christian missionary organization and, in 1859, married Henrietta Loraine, the daughter of Robert College president Cyrus Hamlin. Washburn returned to the Andover Seminary to complete his education in 1862, and was ordained as a Congregational minister the next year. Being appointed as a missionary for the American Board of Commissioners in Constantinople, he returned to the city, and subsequently became professor of philosophy in Robert College. Leaving Constantinople to pursue Christian work in New York City, he returned a year later at the request of Christopher Robert, founder of Robert College, and became acting president of the school between 1870 and 1877, replacing his father-in-law. Washburn was appointed president in 1878, and retained his role until September 20, 1903. He was an authority on the political questions of southeastern Europe. In 1876 he was instrumental, together with Dr. Albert Long, in sounding the first alarm and publicizing the Turkish massacres in Bulgaria.See During the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in 1893, he delivered an address on Islam.John Henry Barrows, The World's Parliament of Religions, Vol 1, Chicago: The Parliament Publishing Company, 1893, pg 565-582. He contributed many articles regarding current affairs, history, and geology to English and American periodicals such as the Contemporary Review and the American Journal of Science.

It connects Bhusawal and Kalyan both in the Indian state of Maharashtra. One of the branch lines, Jalgaon-Surat line, runs partly in Gujarat. Geography Part of some of the major trunk lines in the country, this line passes through a section of the Deccan Plateau, starting with Khandesh, It crosses the Western Ghats across the Thul Ghat and enters the Western Coastal Plains. Thul Ghat Thul Ghat (incline) is a series of mountain slopes in the Western Ghats traversed by this line. From Kalyan to Kasara, the line covers a length of and rises to an altitude of above sea level at Kasara. The next section from Kasara to Igatpuri is across Thul Ghat and within that distance the line rises from to the gradient in the section being 1:37. The line negotiates this steep incline with the help of curves. The Ehegaon viaduct along this line is long and high. According to IRFCA, \\"The viaduct is situated in a steep valley nestling in the midst of hills that skirt around it in the tunnels and then is carried across the yawning chasm on a tall imposing structure‚Ä¶ Some of the viaducts and tunnels on this line are considered outstanding achievements in Civil Engineering and are among the finest works in the world.\\" Economy This line serves two coal based thermal power stations: the 880 MW Nashik Thermal Power Station of Mahagenco and 850 MW Ukai Thermal Power Station of Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited. Nasik TPS consumed 4,626,000 tonnes of coal in 2006-07 and Ukai TPS consumed 3,200,000 tonnes the same year. Coal transportation forms 42 per cent of the total freight earnings of Indian railways. History Main line The first train in India traveled from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station in Mumbai, then known as Boribunder, to Thane on 16 April 1853. Within about a year Great Indian Peninsula Railway connected the Mumbai-Thane line to Kalyan. Service up to Igatpuri (across the Thul Ghat) was started in 1865. Before that, Bhusawal station was set up in 1860 and most of the line between Bhusawal and Igatpuri was laid in 1861-62 but the line was activated in mid-1860s, after completion of the line across Thul Ghat. Branch lines The Tapti Valley Railway linked Surat, on the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, to the Great Indian Peninsula system at Amalner in the Khandesh region, in 1900. It was one of the railways set up by Killick Nixon Limited. The Manmad-Daund line was opened in 1878 and connects the two main sections (the south-east and north east) of GIPR. The line is being doubled. The Hyderabad-Godavari Valley Railways opened the Manmad-Secunderabad line (not shown in the route chart) in 1900. The Chalisgaon-Dhule line was opened in 1900. The Pachora-Jamner narrow gauge line was opened by Central Province Railway in 1919. Shirdi The long wide broad gauge Puntamba-Shirdi link, connecting Shirdi to the Manmad-Daund branch line was completed in 2009. The Manmad-Puntamba-Sainagar Shirdi line was electrified in 2011-12. New lines Indian Railways have cleared the construction of Manmad-Indore and Nashik-Pune new lines after sixteen years of active lobbying. Railway reorganisation The Great Indian Peninsula Railway was taken over by the state in 1925. In 1951, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway, the Scindia State Railways and the Dholpur Railways were merged to form Central Railway. In the same year, the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, the Saurashtra Railway, the Rajasthan Railway, the Jaipur Railway and the Cutch State Railway were merged to form Western Railway. Electrification and electric loco sheds The Kalyan-Igatpuri section was electrified with 1.5 kV DC overhead system in 1929. Subsequent electrification with 25 kV AC overhead system in the Igatpuri-Manmad sector, with AC/DC change over at Igatpuri, was carried out in 1967‚Äì69. The Manmad- Bhusawal sector was electrified in 1968‚Äì69. The change over of mainlines in the Mumbai area from DC to AC traction was completed in June 2015. There are large loco sheds at Bhusawal and Kalyan, and the smaller trip sheds at Manmad and Igatpuri. The loco shed at Bhusawal was established by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in 1919. At that time it was the largest in Asia and third largest in the world. WAM-4, WAP- 4, WAG-5, WAG-7, WCM-6, WCG-2, WCAM-3 and WCAG-1 electric locomotives find a place in these sheds. Kalyan also houses some diesel locomotives. Speed limits The entire Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line is classified as a \\"Group A\\" line which can take speeds up to 160 km/h. The branch lines have speed limits within 100 km/h. Passenger movement Bhusawal and Manmad on this line, are amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway.

Understanding the great presence of peacocks in the region, the Government of India declared Bankapura as a peacock sanctuary on June 9, 2006. Any visitor to this sanctuary will not return without seeing a flock of peacock, our national bird, happily dancing in the sprawling sanctuary, without a care in the world. This sanctuary is situated on 139 acres of land which has the remains of the historic Bankapura Fort. The high mound and deep trenches of the land have provided a perfect home for these birds.

He played at centre half, left half or left back. Life and career Robson was born in 1899 in Ryhope, County Durham, a younger son of Emma Louise Robson and her husband, Frederick, who was variously employed as a labourer in a carpet works, a fireman in a papermill, and a colliery labourer. An older brother, Fred, also became a professional footballer. Robson played for the Sunderland Schools football team that reached the final of the English Schools' Shield in 1913; they lost 2‚Äì1 to Watford Schools, whose second goal was an own goal scored by Robson. He represented England schoolboys twice that year, against their Scottish and Welsh counterparts. He joined Football League Second Division club South Shields from Tyneside League club Marsden Rescue in October 1920. He made his first-team debut on 26 February 1921, playing at left half in a 1‚Äì0 win at home to Notts County, and returned to the side for the last eight matches of the season, used mainly at left back. He had a run of games in the first half of the following season, but played just once more before joining Southend United, a previous club of his brother Fred, ahead of the 1923‚Äì24 season. He played in four Third Division South matches early in the season, but made only two more first-team appearances, and was granted a free transfer at his own request in January 1924. Robson returned to the north east and signed for Durham City of the Third Division North; Fred had joined a few months earlier. In contrast to his Football League career elsewhere, Robson was ever-present for Durham City for what remained of that season and the whole of the next. In his Complete Record and Who's Who, Garth Dykes writes that \\"in any position in the intermediate line he could be relied upon to put in a workmanlike performance. An untiring worker and a strong tackler, he was the most constructive half on the club's books\\". He scored his first Football League goal on 13 December 1924 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat away to Wrexham, whose goalkeeper \\"saved well, and was only beaten in the fading light by a long shot from J.W. Robson.\\" As had been the case the previous season, Robson's contract allowed him to leave on a free transfer. This time he did leave, moving to Rochdale together with Durham team-mate Billy Bertram. Although Bertram stayed, Robson moved on again after four appearances to another Third Division North club, Lincoln City, who had just sold Wally Webster to Sheffield United for a record fee and opted to spend the proceeds on strengthening their half-back line. Lincoln's manager, Horace Henshall, thought Robson \\"the best half in any Northern Section team\\", and proceeded to select him, mainly at centre half, for the rest of the season. Robson missed six weeks of the 1926‚Äì27 season after suffering an injury in the second match, came back into the side for another two weeks and was dropped for a further six, but once Lincoln were able to field a settled half-back line, with Robson at centre, Alf Basnett on the right and Alf Hale on the left, they found a run of form that included seven consecutive wins in March and April and took the team into mid-table. Robson lost his place at centre half to close-season arrival Charles Foulkes, made just four appearances in the 1927‚Äì28 season, and was released on a free transfer. He again returned to the north east where he played for a string of non-League clubs: his former employers, Durham City who had failed to be re-elected to the League, Pegswood United, Horden Colliery Welfare and Blyth Spartans. A trial with Third Division Ashington came to nothing, and he returned to non-League with clubs including Bedlington United, Pegswood United, Seaton Burn Welfare, Burradon Colliery Welfare and Newbiggin West End. The 1939 Register finds Robson living in Dene Street, Sunderland, with his wife, Mary, and two children and working as a boilersmith. He died in Silksworth, County Durham, in 1961 at the age of 62.

It has an API that uses established GUI application development patterns. The programming model is component-based and event-driven, similar to Swing. The goal of the library is to benefit from the stateful component model used in desktop applications APIs, applied to web development, instead of the traditional model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) model. Rather than using MVC at the level of a page, MVC is pushed to the level of individual components. While the library uses a desktop application development model, it does support web-specific features including semantic URLs, browser history navigation support, internationalization, themes, and styling. A unique feature of the library is its abstraction layer of the browser rendering model. The library uses Ajax for communicating with Ajax-capable browsers, while using plain HTML form post-backs for other user agents (for accessibility and search engines). Using a progressive bootstrap method, the user interface is initially rendered as plain HTML, and for Ajax-capable browsers, it is automatically upgraded to use Ajax for increased interactivity. In this way, it is the only server-side framework that implements progressive enhancement automatically, and the only Ajax framework with search engine optimization (SEO) qualities. JWt is distributed as a jar file. A JWt application is a war file that is deployed in a standards-compliant servlet container. Major features See the feature list on the project homepage for a more detailed overview. * Automatic graceful degradation and progressive enhancement * On all modern browsers, a JWt application is a single-page application, with full support for forward/back and bookmark navigation, but still fully SEO. * Supports server- initiated events (Comet), and uses asynchronous I/O when deployed within a Servlet 3.0 container. * A unified 2D rendering API (SVG/HTML5 canvas/VML/PDF) with java.awt.Graphics2D compatibility * Integrated PDF rendering for Widgets, Graphics (Charts) and HTML/CSS, to generate reports * Both client-side and server-side validation * Various automatic built-in security features to avoid cross-site scripting and CSRF vulnerabilities. * Theme support through CSS or Twitter Bootstrap * Available widgets are demonstrated in the widget gallery * A 3D painting API for WebGL rendering, with fallback to server-side GPU accelerated rendering * A 3D chart API (surfaces, points, bar charts, ...) supporting selection, intersection highlighting, height maps, isolines, ...

It is the second mosque to be built in Taiwan after Taipei Grand Mosque in Taipei. History First building Kaohsiung Mosque first building Kaohsiung Mosque was built in 1949 in Taiwan by Muslim nationalists after their defeat against the communists in the Chinese civil war. In the beginning, Muslim public officers worked with the Kuomintang government to suggest the construction of a new mosque in Taiwan and started to raise funds from January 1949. Initially, they rented a 270 square meters of space at 117 Wufu 4th (‰∫îÁ¶èÂõõ) Road in Yancheng District as a temporary location. Second building Due to the limited space available at 117 Wufu 4th Road, they moved to a 460 square meters Japanese wooden style building at 196 Linsen 1st (ÊûóÊ£Æ‰∏Ä) Road in Sinsing District in 1951. The main prayer hall area was 135 square meter. With the growing number of Muslim worshipers, they started to raise funds for the new mosque. In October 1988, the land of the old mosque were sold and the money they received was used to finance the construction of the new mosque. 196 Linsen 1st Road now houses FarEasTone customer care service center. Current building Kaohsiung Mosque prayer hall In February 1990, they finally moved the mosque to the current bigger site and better equipped building to accommodate their growing numbers of Muslims located at 11 Jianjun (Âª∫Ëªç) Road in Lingya District. Construction started on 17 December 1990, completed in late December 1991 and it was opened on April 1992. Architecture Friday prayer at Kaohsiung Mosque Kaohsiung Mosque is a three-story building that features a large Middle Eastern vault. The design of the prayer hall, nooks, corners and components of the buildings are based on traditional mosques in the Middle East. The building covers an area of 2,657 square meters. The first floor is the male and female dormitories, female prayer room and female activity center. The second floor is the main prayer hall, study center for Arabic language and Islamic culture display room. The third floor is the guest room, youth activity center, office and kitchen.

Though burgeoning Arab filmmakers still struggle with constrained funding and a lack of established distribution channels, artists are beginning to produce more and more commercially viable films. Films featured at festivals both in the Middle East and around the world run the gamut from films about war, identity, political or social issues to romantic comedies and thrillers. Goals of festival organizers are largely to provide an alternative portrayal of Arabs to that in mainstream global media in order to promote understanding and dialogue between the Arab world and the West. In addition, festivals work to support Arab filmmakers in the Middle East and elsewhere by providing a platform for them to screen and promote their cinematic achievements to broad audiences.  Arab film festivals in the Middle East   Egypt  The Cairo International Film Festival is a world-class annual film festival in Cairo, Egypt. Established in 1976, it was the first film festival to be held in the Arab world and is the only international competitive feature film festival in the Middle East and Africa recognized by the FIAPF. The festival has awarded many Egyptian and internationally renowned actors, actresses and directors. Special awards, such as the Best Arab Film Award, are bestowed upon the most exceptional regional films of the year. In addition, the Alexandria International Film Festival, Egypt's second largest film festival, is held every September in local theaters. Organized by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics (EAFWC), the festival promotes film culture and aims to bolster relations among international filmmakers and the Mediterranean in particular. Celebrating its 10th edition in 2017 is the Cairo International Women's Film Festival. From its earliest edition, Entre Cineastas, to the Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films, CIWFF has developed and expanded over the years. The festival aims at introducing films made by female filmmakers from around the world and serving as a meeting point for them and the audience. Chosen solely by public vote, one film is presented with the Audience Award.  Jordan  Founded in 2004, the Jordan Short Film Festival is managed by the Amman Filmmakers Cooperative, a film collective based in Amman, Jordan. In addition to a week-long event, the festival organizers promote independent cinema with screenings throughout the year and have launched two main competitions: the International short film competition and the Arab short film competition. Notably, the festival was suspended in 2011 as an act of protest against the killing of peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring. In a statement, the JSFF founder and director noted that \\"it would be misleading and dishonest to pretend that Jordan under such circumstances can host film festivals that can openly and freely screen films about human rights and other pressing issues.\\" In 2009, the Karama Human Rights Film Festival was conceived and organized by Ma3mal 612 (Think Factory), a collective of avante-garde artists and filmmakers. Karama, which means dignity, promotes cinema that explores human rights issues and opens democratic dialogue about human rights between and among local and international audiences.  Kuwait  The Green Caravan Film Festival, in its 5th year now, is the Middle East's premiere film festival dedicated to the niche market of environmental films. It began in Kuwait in 2009, and from 2010 added Dubai-based screenings to its programming, and plans to add more Gulf cities to its venue locations in the future. The Kuwait Young Film Festival, an offshoot of the Kuwait International Film Festival, aims to provide talented youth in Kuwait and elsewhere with an avenue to display their work and compete for awards. Participants must be in school and under 30 years old in order to enter their work. The festival includes film screenings, workshops and social gatherings. Now in its second year, the Kuwait International Film Retreat is a three-day mini film festival with short and feature film screenings, workshops, social gatherings and an awards ceremony showcasing the best short films in competition.  Lebanon  Now in its sixteenth year, the Beirut International Film Festival is Lebanon's oldest and most prestigious film festival. The annual competition includes categories for feature films, short films and documentaries.[Beirut International Film Festival] Recent years have seen smaller and more intimate editions of the festival due to the uncertain political climate in the country. \\"Tripoli Film Festival - Lebanon\\" has been launched in 2013, it is an international cinematic competition organized yearly during spring, and covering features, shorts, animation and documentaries.  Morocco  The International Film Festival of Marrakech, an annual event dedicated to Moroccan and foreign feature and short films, has been held at the end of every year for the past twelve years. His Royal Highness Prince Moulay Rachid presides over the event, which always attracts a bevy of stars. In addition to a grand prize, awards are also given out for best actor, best actress, best short film and jury favorite.  Oman  The Muscat International Film Festival, now in its eighth year, showcases films and filmmakers from more than 90 countries. In addition to film premieres and screenings, seminars, workshops and awards shows round out the event.  Qatar  The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was launched in 2009 through a cultural partnership between Doha Film Institute and Tribeca Enterprises, a diversified global media company based in New York City. The annual five-day event - a \\"celebration of film, education and community\\" - promotes Arab and international film and helps develop a sustainable film industry in Qatar.  Saudi Arabia  The Saudi Film Festival takes place every year, and is in its 6th edition in 2020 with its first online film festival in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A handful of notable Saudi filmmakers exists and in 2012 the first female Saudi filmmaker released the first critically acclaimed feature film filmed entirely in Saudi Arabi, Wadjda, at the Cannes Film Festival.  Syria  Established in 1979, the Damascus International Film Festival is a biannual film festival hosted by the government of Syria. The festival was established by the late Syrian film director Muhammad Shahin and alternates with the Carthage Film Festival in Tunisia. Since 2011, however, the film festival has been cancelled until further notice due to the crisis in Syria.  United Arab Emirates  The now defunct Abu Dhabi Film Festival was created in 2007 and presented works by Arab filmmakers in competition alongside those by major talents of world cinema. It was presented each October, the festival curated \\"exceptional programs to engage and educate the local community, inspire filmmakers and nurture the growth of the regional film industry.\\" It was unfortunately brought to a close after eight editions in 2015. The Dubai International Film Festival, was held each December since 2004, showcases new and exciting cinema from the Middle East, Asia, Africa and beyond. It is the oldest film festival in the Persian Gulf region and aims to promote better cultural understanding through achievements in film. The DIFF has also pioneered several industry initiatives within its Dubai Film Market, which runs concurrently with the festival and is designed to help support and develop the Arab cinema industry. The 2018 festival was officially cancelled and the management announced that it would return in 2019 with a \\"new approach\\". The Gulf Film Festival took place annually in Dubai. Held in April, the festival presented the best in cinema from the Persian Gulf region. Festival organizers recently announced the formation of the Gulf Film Market, an initiative aimed at developing local and regional film culture through mentoring and social networks. The market will also help create more opportunities for Gulf filmmakers in training, development, production and distribution. The festival was 'postponed' in 2014 and it never returned. Tropfest Arabia, a short film festival, debuted in 2011 in Abu Dhabi. The festival aims to support emerging talent that might otherwise be excluded from the region's film festivals. Tropfest Arabia is a part of Tropfest, the largest short film festival in the world and what many consider the first truly global festival.  Arab film festivals abroad  A large and growing number of Arab film festivals take place outside of the Arab world. These festivals play a key role in increasing access to and interest in Arab cinema outside of the Arab world. They are also important for Arab diasporas eager to stay in touch with the cultural scene of their homelands. Established in California in 1996, the Arab Film Festival is the largest independent annual exhibition of Arab films in the United States. It is regarded as one of the most important Arab film festivals outside of the Arab world. The official mission of the festival is to \\"enhance public understanding of Arab culture and to provide alternative representations of Arabs that contradict the stereotypical images frequently encountered in the American mass media.\\" The festival shows films from and about the Arab world in order to furnish audiences with realistic images of Arab culture, art, history, people and politics. Amal Euroarab Film Festival was born in 2003 in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. It is developed by Araguaney-Bridge between Cultures Foundation and directed by Ghaleb Jaber Mart√≠nez. Amal means \\"hope\\" in Arab language, the hope that Arab world needs more than ever. Amal Festival seeks to promote the development of co-productions between Galicia and Spain and Arab countries, building cross-cultural bridges. The London Middle East & North Africa Film Festival, created in 2011, provides an annual platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and reach audiences who might not otherwise get the opportunity to view cinema from the region, stimulating cross-cultural dialogue, connection and understanding. Also in London, the annual London Palestine Film Festival was established in 1998, making it the UK's longest- running festival specialising in film from and upon any region of the Arab world. Providing a platform for international as well as Palestinian film, the festival takes place in Spring and is managed by UK-based non-profit the Palestine Film Foundation. It combines screenings, artists' talks, and panel discussions, with art exhibitions, conferences, and book launches. The Middle Eastern Film Festival NYC, produced by Media Space NYC, aims to entertain and enlighten moviegoers with both short and feature-length films about topics related to the Middle East. It is an offshoot and new medium incarnation of the very successful Noor Play Festival. The Sofia Middle East & North Africa Region Film Festival is an annual Arab/Islamic event in the Balkans, presenting films from the Middle East and North Africa to a Bulgarian audience. Since its inception in 2009, the festival has screened more than 120 titles. Malm√∂ Arab Film Festival (MAFF), founded in 2011 has rapidly grown to be one of the major yearly manifestations of Arab film outside the Arab World. The founder, Mouhamad Keblawi, is also managing director. Thirteen prices are awarded yearly. In addition, a number of Arab film festivals abroad focus specifically on the issue of Palestine. Events such as the Boston Palestine Film Festival, Toronto Palestine Film Festival, Houston Palestine Film Festival and Chicago Palestine Film Festival bring Palestinian and Palestine- related cinema, narratives and culture to a dispersed audience.  LatinAmerica  1.1 LatinArab International Film Festival The Latin Arab International Film Festival has been held yearly for the last seven years in the City of Buenos Aires. The only festival of its kind in the American continent, it has grown into a platform where to meet and promote Arab cinema and where to build a bridge and bring together the Latin American and Arab cultures, as they have so much in common. The festival's venues are public theatres Cine.Ar and el cultural San Mart√≠n and the Alliance Francaise. At the same time, LatinArab's industry Forum (The Latin Arab Co-Production Forum), held within the frame of the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, aims at potentiating both regions' film industries with the conception of films carried out as co-productions.  Notable films  Arab film festivals sometimes serve as forums for political and cultural statements. In 2003, for instance, Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Hagar presented his controversial Girls' Love, the story of a love affair between an Egyptian man and a Jewish woman. More recently, films screened and/or competing at the festivals have reflected the Arab Spring. The 2012 Dubai International Film Festival showcased Hinde Boujemaa's It was Better Tomorrow, in which a homeless woman and her son live hand to mouth, squatting in apartments left empty by fleeing multinationals. Another documentary, True Story of Love, Life Death and Sometimes Revolution by Nidal Hassan, gathers the views and testimonies of Syrian women during the Syrian revolution.

The basadi was constructed by the devout Jain lady Achiyakka (also called Achala Devi), wife of Chandramouli, a Brahmin minister in the court of the Hoysala king. The main deity of the temple is the twenty- third Jain Tirthankar Parshwanath.Jain and Jain (1953), p.37B.L. Rice (1889), p.57 (Chapter:Introduction) The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. Temple plan Rear view of Akkana Basadi at Shravanabelagola Kirtimukha relief on vesara shikhara (tower over shrine) at Akkana Basadi in Shravanabelagola According to art historian Adam Hardy, the basadi is a simple single shrine with superstructure (ekakuta vimanaFoekema (1996), p.25) construction with a closed hall (mantapa). The material used is Soap stone.Hardy (1996), p.343 The sanctum (garbhagriha) that houses the standing image of Tirthankara Parshwanatha (under a seven headed snake canopy) connects to the hall via an antechamber (vestibule or sukanasi). From the outside, the entrance to the hall is through a porch whose awning is supported by lathe turned half pillars. According to art historians Percy Brown and Gerard Foekema, all these features are commonly found in Hoysala temples.Brown in Kamath (2001), pp.134-135Foekema (1996), pp.21-25 According to historian Kamath, the use of Soap stone as basic building material was a technique the Hoysalas adopted from the predecessors, the Western Chalukyas.Kamath (2001), p.136 The temple which faces east is enclosed with in a bounding wall (prakara), while the entrance is from the south. Typical of a Jain basadi, the outer walls of the temple are plain, giving it an austere outlook. The temple stands on a base (adhisthana) that comprises five moldings. The tower over the shrine (shikhara) is plain. However, on a projection on the east side is a panel sculpture in relief that depicts a saint with his attendants (yaksha, the benevolent spirits) on either side and a Kirtimukha (imaginary beast) over his head. This is a work of merit. The tower comprises three tiers, each ascending tier diminishing in height. Above the third tier is a dome like structure. This is the largest sculptural piece in the temple with a ground surface area of about 2x2 meters (amalaka, \\"helmet\\" like structure). The shape of the dome usually follows that of the shrine (square or star shape).Foekema (1996), p.27 The vestibule also has a short tower which looks like an extension of the main tower over the shrine. Gerard Foekema calls it the \\"nose\\" of the main tower.Foekema (1996), p.22 The vestibule contains two free sculptures of the yakshas, Dharnendra and Padmavati. The door lintel and jamb of vestibule and the sanctum are decorative and have perforated screens on either side. The hall ceiling is supported by four centrally placed large lathe turned, bell shaped and polished pillars that divide the ceiling into nine \\"bays\\". The bay ceilings are rich in relief.

Three species grow naturally in northeastern Queensland, Australia and two species in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Descriptively they are the tropical or northern macadamia trees group. Lasjia species characteristically branched compound inflorescences differentiate them from the Macadamia species, of Australia, which have characteristically unbranched compound inflorescences and only grow naturally about further to the south, in southern and central eastern Queensland and in northeastern New South Wales. The Bama aboriginal Australian peoples in the late 1800s Bellenden Ker Range rainforests (north east Queensland) taught European‚ÄìAustralian scientists of L. whelanii trees bearing the large seeds \\"extensively used for food\\". One of those scientists, colonial botanist Frederick M. Bailey, collected and in 1889 formally published a scientific description of specimens of them under the name Helicia whelanii and later again in 1901 as a species of Macadamia. Of these five Lasjia species, it was the first to receive a European‚ÄìAustralian scientific name. Names and classification Genetics studies published in 2008 by Austin Mast and colleagues show they have separated from the genus Macadamia, correlating less closely than previously thought from morphological studies. The ancestors of Lasjia appear to have diverged just under 30 million years ago in the Oligocene epoch from a lineage which has given rise to the Australian genus Macadamia, the South African species Brabejum stellatifolium, Australian rainforest species Nothorites megacarpus, and South American genus Panopsis. The genus name was coined from the initials of Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson (LASJ), who had done much pioneering work on the Proteaceae. The type species is Lasjia claudiensis. L. claudiensis and L. grandis were only formally scientifically described as recently as 1993 under the genus Macadamia, with botanists making field collections of scientific specimens only since about 1948. Genetics studies to date, report L. whelanii as the earliest offshoot within the genus. Species * Lasjia claudiensis : Synonym, base name: Macadamia claudiensis C.L. Gross & B.

Mast}} : Synonyms: base name: Helicia whelanii F.M.Bailey; Macadamia whelanii Descriptions and natural distributions All species grow naturally into trees, with whorled, simple adult leaves with smooth margins (unserrated, spineless) and bearing their flowers in branched compound inflorescences generally at the ends of the foliage or sometimes from older branches under the foliage. The fruits of L. claudiensis, L. grandis, L. hildebrandii, and L. whelanii have thin inner shells (testae) of about unlike the well-known macadamia nuts' thicker woody inner shells. L. claudiensis and L. grandis have significantly larger fruits and seeds; they have fruit diameters of and , respectively, and seeds diameters of and , respectively. L. claudiensis is endemic to the Iron Range region of Cape York Peninsula, far north Queensland, in more seasonally dry rainforests and gallery forests, from about altitude. L. claudiensis has the Australian national conservation status listing of \\"vulnerable\\" in the Australian government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC), and the Queensland official state conservation status of \\"vulnerable\\" species in the Queensland government Nature Conservation Act 1992. L. grandis grows naturally only in the rainforests of the Wet Tropics region of northeastern Queensland, from about altitude. L. grandis trees received their name for growing to the largest size of the macadamia group, of up to about , with trunks up to diameter, with some having buttresses. L. grandis has an official Queensland state conservation status of \\"vulnerable\\" species in the Queensland government Nature Conservation Act 1992. L. whelanii grows naturally only in the rainforests of the Wet Tropics region of northeastern Queensland, from about altitude. L. hilderbrandii and L. erecta are endemic to Sulawesi (Indonesia) and its smaller adjacent islands, and there's even less published knowledge of them. Up to the date of 1995, all populations of L. hilderbrandii were found below altitude, except one specimen collection. A collection beyond Sulawesi was made in west Sumatra, although whether its origin was natural and a significant extension of range or a recently introduced plant, was unconfirmed in 1995. Up to 1995, all populations found of L. erecta were between altitude. Therefore, as far as was known in 1995, the two species have separate habitats and geographic distributions (allopatric). The two species clearly have a close evolutionary relationship with many characteristics in common, endemic to the Sulawesi region, the flower structures in whorls of racemes at the ends of uppermost branches and the whorled leaves with smooth margins. The distinctive characteristics of L. erecta of short and erect flower structures and of smaller leaves in whorls of four compare to the characteristics of L. hildebrandii of flower structures longer and arching or pendulous and of larger leaves in whorls of five to seven. Uses for foods Peoples of Sulawesi (Indonesia) make foods from the uncertain and inconclusively toxic or nontoxic seeds of L. hildebrandii, according to incomplete English language documentation. Umpila and related peoples in the Iron Range region make use of L. claudiensis and Bama peoples of the Wet Tropics region also make use of L. grandis, apparently knowing them well for their uses and regarding their distributions, respectively. Only in recent decades has English-language botanical science recognised, described, and published brief documentation about these two species, with more learning or field work required to record their full distributions and uses. The few documents available are the brief journal paper formally scientifically describing these two species, the published archaeological work of Nicky Horsfall‚Äôs journal papers and PhD and the reports of the 1889 Archibald Meston expedition; the latter two bodies of work were undertaken in the Bellenden Ker Range region.

Their mission is to preserve and restore sight amongst some of the most under-privileged communities in the region. The OPC's principal actions concern blindness prevention, treatment and the elimination of blinding diseases, such as onchocerciasis, trachoma, glaucoma and cataracts as well as formal ophthalmological training.  History  The OPC was founded on January 13, 1978 by Christian Monnier. Retired from the banking industry, he decided to work with Professor Andr√© Dubois-Poulsen, who was the head of department of the XV-XX Hospital and President of the French Ophthalmological Society and Pierre Aub√©, an ex-financial advisor. Professor Dubois-Poulsen presided over the OPC Board of Directors for eight years and organised its first projects in Africa, notably the Yeleen Program in Mali. Thanks to this project, the OPC became a member of the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) Over the years, the OPC has greatly increased its number of missions, creating primary eye care networks, and supporting the African Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology (IOTA).http://www.iotaoccge.org/par.html Then, under the presidency of Professor Jean Langlois, the ex-Head of department of the CHU of Rouen, and thanks to Dr. Marcel Chauvet, the medical Inspector General, onchocerciasis, or ‚Äúriver blindness‚Äù, control in Africa was elevated to high priority. Onchocerciasis control is still being carried out in conjunction with other NGOs and the World Health Organization. Links were also established with the Ministry of Cooperation and Development. During this period of the OPC's history, a program to create an ophthalmological service in at GRALL Pediatric Hospital in Saigon (Vietnam) was successfully led for five years. In 1997, Professor Langlois became Honorary President, giving the position of President to Professor Yves Pouliquen, ex-Head of the Ophthalmological Department of l‚ÄôH√¥tel-Dieu in Paris, member of the Academy Fran√ßaise from 2001, and member of the French National Academy of Medicine and the International Academy of Ophthalmology. From 1997, Professor Pouliquen reinforced the importance of onchocerciasis and trachoma control in West Africa with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They also developed technical support for the treatment of cataracts. Dr Dominique N√©grel, Executive Director of the OPC, expert in ophthalmological public health and in the implementation of eye care structures, contributed greatly to the OPC's involvement in training health workers in ophthalmology. Additionally, the OPC implemented a support plan to help combat age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) by providing several centres with powerful diagnostic materials integrated into the resources. This plan was led forward by OPC Vice-President Professor Christian Corb√©, medical Inspector General and founding President of the Representative Association of Low-Vision Initiatives,http://www.academie- air-espace.com/mship/newdetail.php?varMbre=832 Dr. Jean-Fran√ßois Ceccon, ophthalmologist, administrator and ex-Chief Programs Officer of the OPC, and Denis Brillard, OPC administrator and Director of the Welcome centre and Head of the rehabilitation for the blind in N√Æmes, ARAMAV. In 2006, the OPC debuted a prevention program for diabetic retinopathy in collaboration with the Valentin Ha√ºy Association, and the AP-HP (Public Hospitals‚Äô Public Assistance) OPHDIAT network. 16 centres were equipped in the Paris region and in Province (the province). The same year, at the initiative of the OPC, a think-tank composed of 5 Parisian hospitalsincluding H√¥tel Dieu, Lariboisi√®re, Piti√© Salp√™tri√®re, XVXX, Institution nationale des Invalides participated in a network constitution project (WTF) concerning low vision in √éle de France. In 2010, after 12 years as OPC President, Professor Pouliquen gave the reins to Nathalie Brunet, a jurist and head of a French company that is a world leader in its field. The OPC developed its missions in French-speaking countries, mainly Africans ones, but also in Haiti and Moldova as well as in France. In 2011, Dr Serge Resknioff became President of the OPC. He is the former head of Prevention of Blindness and Deafness at the WHO and is involved in various organisations associated with blindness prevention.  The OPC  * Has existed since 1978 * Is honoured by the High Patronage of the President of the French Republic: Mr. Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Chirac then Mr. Sarkozy have shown their interest in the work of the OPC * Is a recognised charity * Maintains an official working relationship with the World Health Organization * Is an active member of the global initiative vision 2020 ‚Äì The Right to Sight; * Approved by the Comit√© de la Charte ‚Äì Don en confiance, an approval and control organism for donations in France, since 1997.

Programmes  In developing French-speaking African countries, cataracts, trachoma, onchocerciasis and glaucoma are the main causes of visual impairment and blindness. It is also estimated that 80% of causes of loss of vision are avoidable and/or curable. This is why the OPC works with its various partners in the creation, implementation, the follow-up and evaluation of sustainable programs that address the greatest number possible and allow: * The training of qualified and autonomous ophthalmological human resources at all levels: doctor, nurse, senior technician and community agent; * The dispensing/distribution of comprehensive eye care of excellent quality; * The administering of medical treatments to those in need; * The performing of early screening for eye diseases.  Training  The OPC sets up training programs for ON (Ophthalmic Nurse) and OCO (Ophthalmic Clinical Officer) level ophthalmic mid-level personnel. There are between 8 and 12 students each academic year. * Niger: fifth class of OCOs is currently studying. * Central African Republic: Despite a delay due to the difficult conditions which the country has experienced, the implementation and recruitment of the first class of OCOs has been done in February 2013. * Mali: renovation of Kayes Hospital which will become the new training site for students of the Higher education degree in ocular health (DESSO). The ophthalmologist currently working in this establishment has received a grant from IOTA (Institut d‚ÄôOphtalmologie Tropicale de l‚ÄôAfrique - African Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology) in order to undertake training to perfect his surgical capacities. The training of primary eye care personnel, which was supposed to begin in Mopti, has been postponed due to recent events in Mali.

Coffee wars, sometimes referred to as caffeine wars, involve a variety of sales and marketing tactics by coffeehouse chains and espresso machine manufacturers to increase brand and consumer market share. In North America belligerents in these wars typically include large coffeehouses, such as Starbucks, Dunkin', McDonald's, and Tim Hortons. According to The Economist, the largest coffee war of the late 2000s was between Starbucks and McDonalds in the United States. The U.S. market has, since the early 2010s, been primarily contested by its two largest players, Starbucks and Dunkin'. Since 2020, competition over the Chinese coffee market has intensified between Starbucks and Luckin Coffee. Periods of low economic activity and business recessions ‚Äì which contribute to diminished consumer demand ‚Äì have been linked to an increase in coffee wars. Major innovations in the coffee industry, particularly the advent of single-serve espresso pods, have lowered the market's barrier to entry. Although store count has been traditionally seen as gauging market share, both firms and analysts have incorporated revenue, balance sheets, organic growth, operating margin, and stock market performance as comparable indicators. Asia  China  Since 2020, Luckin Coffee is China's largest coffee chain by store count. Since 2017, competition over the Chinese coffee market has intensified between Starbucks and Luckin Coffee. From the early 1990s to the late 2010s, Starbucks was the largest coffeehouse in China. In August 2018, they signed a distribution deal with e-commerce group Alibaba to increase their online retail presence in China. In January 2020, Luckin Coffee overtook Starbucks in store count in China, by 500 retail spaces. Luckin had 4,500 stores in China while Starbucks had 4,200. However, the Chinese firms' entry into the U.S. capital markets faltered in early April 2020 after reports surfaced of fraudulent accounting and inflating market share projections. Luckin Coffee's stock was halted on the U.S. stock market, meaning it could no longer trade, after a corporate fraud investigation was initiated by U.S. and Chinese authorities. The 2018 trade war between the U.S. and China, with the two companies serving as respective proxies, led to a resurgence of Luckin Coffee in China during late-April 2020. Chinese consumers were boosting Luckin Coffee's market share as a rejection of American-led companies, specifically Starbucks. The Chinese government cautioned domestic investors from doing this soon-after, writing \\"Luckin‚Äôs actions harm the reputation of Chinese companies overseas.\\" Fearing a possible bankruptcy, Luckin Coffee customers flooded their online app with orders redeeming free drink vouchers leading to a temporary rise in market share.  Europe  The coffee wars in North America have promoted a rise in mergers and acquisitions in the European coffee market to better compete in coffee wars. In October 2018, the Italian coffee proprietor Illy merged with the German JAB Holding Company to reconfigure its market share. The two respective companies also announced that they will be producing espresso pods, to compete with Nestl√©'s Nespresso brand. European, and particularly Italian, brands struggle to compete in U.S.-based coffee wars due to their cultural rejection of third-wave coffee culture. However, their Italian identity is \\"a big advantage over the multinationals\\" with respect to espresso. The 2018 entrance of Starbucks and Nestl√© into the Italian coffee market had Lavazza and Illy increase their merger and acquisition (M&A;) activity. In October 2018 Lavazza acquired Mars Inc.‚Äôs coffee business for $650 million while Illy signed a distribution deal with JAB. The Wall Street Journal reported that the European coffee market was worth $83 billion in 2018, estimating a 16 percent increase in 2019. The vice chairman of Lavazza, Giuseppe Lavazza, conceded in 2018 that Starbucks was competitive in the Italian market. North America Canada Several coffee chains operate in Canada, including Blenz Coffee, Coffee Time, Country Style, Second Cup, Starbucks, McDonald's Canada, Tim Horton's, and Timothy's World Coffee. A Tim Hortons store in Shelburne. Tim Hortons is Canada's largest coffee chain by number of locations. A \\"coffee war\\" began in Canada in the late-2000s after Starbucks made an effort to attract the Canadian breakfast market; markets traditionally dominated by Tim Hortons and McDonalds. During the 2010s, coffee chains offered several specials and promotions in an attempt to attract market shares from the competition. McDonalds began to compete directly with Tim Hortons' annual \\"Roll Up the Rim\\" contest, by introducing a semi-annual promotion of a free small coffee in 2010. In a 2011 report released by the NPD Group, the 3,295 Tim Hortons locations accounted for 26 percent of all restaurant traffic in Canada, whereas McDonalds' 1,400 locations accounted for 10 percent, and Starbucks locations accounted for 1.3 percent. In 2011, Tim Hortons accounted for 76 percent of the baked food and coffee market in the country; with eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold at \\"quick-service restaurants\\" in Canada were from Tim Hortons. Tim Hortons sold over 2.1 billion cups of coffee that year; Conversely, McDonalds sold 200 million cups of coffee that year. As of December 31, 2016, Tim Horton's remained the largest coffee chain by number of locations available in Canada, with 4,613 stores. McDonald's, and Starbucks both operate over 1,400 stores in Canada. In 2014, Canada has more Starbucks per capita than any other country in the world, with 39.54 Starbucks stores for every million residents in Canada. In an effort to gain further market share in the Canadian coffee market, McDonald's began opening standalone McCaf√©s in Canada in 2015. McDonald's tripled its sales of brewed coffee in Canada from the 1970s to 2018, doubling its market share to 13 percent. In addition to coffee, several of these fast food retailers, including Country Style, McDonald's, Starbucks, and Tim Horton's also compete for the country's fast food breakfast market, referred to as the \\"breakfast wars\\". United States According to The Economist, the largest coffee war of the late 2000s has been between Starbucks and McDonalds in the United States. This dynamic between the two coffeehouses was shared by the Financial Times. During the 2008 financial crisis, Starbucks' market share tapered after consumer spending dropped. McDonald's launched a marketing blitz to capitalize on this from 2008 to 2009. In December 2008 McDonald's erected a billboard that read \\"four bucks is dumb\\" a play on words for \\"Starbucks is dumb\\" for selling coffee at higher price points than McDonalds. Another billboard read \\"large is the new grande\\", a jab at the social and cultural perceptions of Starbucks. However Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, a major proponent of coffee wars, voiced his concern about market saturation and vocally opposed the comparison between the McCaf√© and his firm's products. \\"We are up for the defense and we are going to get on the offense,\\" Schultz told investors in late-2008. John Moore, the firm's marketing head, denounced McDonald's as \\"selling hot, brown liquid masquerading as coffee\\" in 2003, in reference to recent market gains. In line with this the spread of instant coffee has also intensified competition in the packed coffee markets, particularly at lower price points. In 2009, McDonald's was seen to formally \\"kick off the coffee war\\" with Starbucks, particularly, by offering specialty espresso drinks. However, coffee accounted for 6 percent of domestic sales for McDonald's during this time. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that the closer price points were for coffee the more competitive coffeehouses were with each other, in spite of different demographic markets. Dunkin' coffee, 2017 The U.S. coffee market has since the early 2010s been primarily contested by its two largest players, Starbucks and Dunkin', which make up most of the country's commercial coffee shops. In 2014 The Guardian reported that \\"There is a war going on in America, and the battleground is coffee.\\" In July 2011 Dunkin' Donuts went public on the U.S. stock market, raising $427.5 million to \\"heat up the fast-food java battle.\\" In 2011 Dunkin' Donuts controlled more than half of the New England coffee market. Around 60 percent of the company's domestic sales were attributable to coffee and beverages. In 2016, Dunkin' Donuts revamped their iced coffee offering, a departure from their portfolio of warm drip coffee and basic espresso-based drinks. Two years later, in 2019, the donut company dropped \\"donuts\\" from its name in order to better compete in the beverage industry. In September 2019, Dunkin' committed $100 million to position itself against Starbucks and McDonalds, calling the former coffeeshop its \\"arch enemy\\". By June, both companies registered record, yet comparable stock market growth, Dunkin' rising by 24 percent, Starbucks by 29 percent. A 2017 CNN analysis found that Dunkin' was \\"particularly aggressive in the coffee wars.\\" During that year's Starbucks annual meeting Schultz responded to Dunkin' market gains by telling shareholders to metaphorically bring the \\"sabers out.\\" Tim Hortons, a Canadian chain which historically had only a limited presence in the U.S. (primarily in Western New York), made a major expansion into the U.S. in the early part of the 21st century, culminating in its corporate merger with established U.S. fast food chain Burger King in 2014. In 2013, The Motley Fool speculated that the spread of Starbucks' gift cards and national loyalty program was a primary driver in coffee-driven market gains. A year later, McDonalds conceded that Starbucks was \\"winning the coffee wars\\" by cornering the caffe latte market. Competing firms have retooled their market expansion by spinning off divisions to finance store openings. In 2018 Starbucks sold its packaged coffee business to Nestl√© in order to free up $7.2 billion for their stores. In an effort to undercut its competition, Starbucks released its signature Pumpkin Spice Lattee in August 2019 ‚Äì instead of its typical Autumn release. In March 2020, Panera Bread launched a coffee subscription service to compete directly with Starbucks' national loyalty program. The COVID-19 pandemic led to severe backsliding in market share for the largest coffeeshops, with smaller caf√©s closing permanently due to lack of demand. Most of the major players initiated distribution deals with delivery platforms during the pandemic to sustain growth: Uber Eats (Starbucks), GrubHub (Dunkin'), and DoorDash (McDonald's).  Espresso machine market  Along with the competition between coffeehouses, the manufactures of espresso machines have also competed to enlarge their respective shares. Typically coming in three styles, manual (pulls), automatic (pulls and serves), and super- automatic (grinds, pulls, and serves), the advent of espresso pods, have lowered the market's barrier to entry. In 2010, Nespresso launched a home-brew method of pulling espresso shots by inventing a compact single-use coffee container. Typically contrasted with the more traditional ground coffee served by most major coffeeshops, the use of espresso pods have proliferated. In March 2014 Nespresso's patent expired, allowing Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee to market their own brands. From 2014 to 2018, Green Mountain was acquired by Keurig who was in turn acquired by Dr Pepper to create Keurig Dr Pepper. In March 2016, Starbucks announced a partnership with Keurig to distribute Starbucks-branded pods in their brewers officially entering the market. In April 2019 Starbucks launched a large suite of espresso pods, featuring all of their branded-espresso, with Nestl√©. This linked the world largest coffeehouse with the largest pod-manufacturer. Since then many companies ‚Äì including Italian manufactures Lavazza and Illy ‚Äì have launched their own brands.

It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic cottage industry model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers. Consumer Within the maker movement and DIY culture, small scale production by consumers often using peer to peer resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an open design repository website like Youmagine or Thingiverse and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as 3D Hubs, Geomiq or at home with an open-source 3-D printer such as the RepRap.Sells, Ed, Zach Smith, Sebastien Bailard, Adrian Bowyer, and Vik Olliver. \\"Reprap: the replicating rapid prototyper: maximizing customizability by breeding the means of production.\\" HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION AND PERSONALIZATION, (2010).Jones, R., Haufe, P., Sells, E., Iravani, P., Olliver, V., Palmer, C., & Bowyer, A. (2011). Reprap??? the replicating rapid prototyper. Robotica, 29(1), 177-191. Enterprise The primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, shipping costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets. Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes. Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing. Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production (Cloud manufacturing).

The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, the civil society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customised productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems and threats rise due to the large democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones.

It delivers an international, biennial festival and organises other events to promote disability and deaf arts from a variety of cultural perspectives. Alongside the festival and events, DaDaFest organises opportunities for disabled and deaf people to gain access to the arts. This includes training and a youth focused programme. DaDaFest is funded by Arts Council England and Liverpool City Council as well as other private and public sector partners. History DaDaFest was founded as Arts Integrated Merseyside (or AIM) as a part of the Shape Arts network in 1984. AIM was integral to the early campaign for greater equality and access for disabled people, but was not disability led. With John McGrath as its Development Officer, the organisation became one of the UK's first disability control-led arts forums after it broke away from the Shape Network and set itself up as North West Disability Arts Forum (NWDAF) in 1986. It was formally constituted in 1990, with Mandy Colleran becoming its director. The organisation eventually re-branded itself to 'DaDa - Disability and Deaf Arts' in 2008 and again to 'DaDaFest' in 2012. Festival DaDaFest delivered its first international festival in 2001 and continued to put on yearly festivals until 2010 when it became a biennial. The festival has since taken place in 2012 and 2014 (8 November 2014 ‚Äì 11 January 2015). The next DaDaFest International festival will take place from 18 November to 3 December 2016. The organisation works with a number of partners to deliver the festival. These include: National Museums Liverpool, Liverpool Biennial, The Bluecoat, Liverpool Everyman, Liverpool Playhouse, FACT, Unity Theatre and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic amongst others.  2016 Festival  DaDaFest International 2014 presented high quality and exciting work produced by artists close to their home in Liverpool as well as internationally that will challenge ideals and celebrate disability culture. An exciting programme of music, dance, live arts, comedy and much more was presented.\\" Highlights included: *Amadou and Mariam - Amadou and Mariam, the Grammy Award nominated musical duo from Mali and DaDaFest International 2016 headliners, produce music that infuses traditional Malian sound with rock guitars and instruments from Cuba, Egypt, Syria and India in a combination that has been dubbed ‚ÄúAfro- blues‚Äù. *The Viewing by Matin O'Brien, Sheree Rose and Rhiannon Aarons - The Viewing is the final of a trilogy of works which were originally conceived by Rose and Bob Flanagan to address his early death from cystic fibrosis. *DaDaFest International Congress ‚Äì ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs a stage‚Ä¶ But not if you can‚Äôt get on it.‚Äù - The two-day event explored how the arts are delivered from artists and practitioners from across the globe, and how the context within which we operate makes for exhilarating, diverse, disruptive and radical arts work. *Assisted Suicide: The Musical - Disabled activist, actor and comedian Liz Carr has chosen the spectacular world of musical theatre as the backdrop to explore the complex and controversial subject of assisted suicide in her new show. *Guide Gods - Using dance, live music, humour and interviews with religious leaders, academics and deaf and disabled people, acclaimed performer Claire Cunningham goes on a perilous quest to explore how the major world faiths view deafness and disability in this witty and illuminating show.  2014 Festival  DaDaFest International 2014 presented a \\"breathtaking array of high quality disability and Deaf arts from around the world.\\" Highlights included: *Art of the Lived Experiment - Curated by Aaron Williamson, this exhibition addressed the idea that life and art are in a state of continual change and uncertainty. *The Ugly Girl by Terry Galloway (US) - a no-holds barred play with a wildly comic twist on the stereotype of a queer, disabled, intellectual trouble-maker. *Backstage in Biscuit Land - the highly acclaimed show from Jess Thom. *Staff Benda Bilili - the super-band appeared at the Philharmonic Hall. 2012 Festival The 2012 festival brought together a large collection of exhibitions and performances. These included: *Niet Normaal - Difference on Display - This was an exhibition created by Ine Gevers and Garry Robson that brought together the work of 24 artists from across the world. It was adapted from an earlier exhibition that premiered in Amsterdam. The theme that this exhibition discussed was 'What is normal? And who decides what normality is?', this was a question that the creator herself deemed as 'unanswerable' but that it was 'worth debating anyway'. *Changing Capacities - Changing Identities - This was a seminar that was part of the 2012 festival and was organised by the University of Liverpool's new Thinking on Living with Dying research network. It discussed how the changes to peoples' lives caused by illness and disability is not always a loss. *The Eavesdropper - This was an intervention at the Walker Art Gallery by artist Aaron Williamson. Williamson explored the 'secretive dialogue' lurking beneath the gallery's paintings. He also took up residence at the gallery throughout DaDaFest 2012. *The House of the Moles - This was a play created by Terry Galloway that worked with UK and USA based performers and musicians about the American Ugly laws in the period between 1940 and 1950. 2010 Festival In 2010, DaDaFest celebrated their tenth year. The 2010 programme explored the theme of Objects of Curiosity and Desire, investigating identity and our place in an ever-changing world. Highlights included: *A few Objects of Curiosity and Desire - a joint exhibition of the work of Tom Shakespeare, Tanya Raabe and Simon McKeown at The Bluecoat. This exhibition also featured work by Fourth Plinth artist and Turner Prize nominee Yinka Shonibare. *Oska Bright - short films made by people with a learning disability were shown from the Oska Bright Film Festival (Brighton). *GIMP ‚Äì the UK premiere of Heidi Latsky's performance. Projects & Initiatives While the festival every two years may be the main attention of the organisation, DaDaFest also organises various projects and initiatives outside of the festival programme. Projects that DaDaFest has organised or is currently organising are: *DaDaFest Rookies - DaDaFest Rookies aims to increase employability within the creative sector for young disabled people through training, mentoring and placements within arts organisations. The project will see more disabled people involved in training, mentoring and placements within arts organisations. *Young DaDaFest - DaDaFest organises various projects that involve young people, these include: steering groups that allow young people to make decisions for other projects; short films and a separate youth festival. DaDaFest also enables young people to earn Arts Award accreditation. Since the start of the young people's program in 2002, DaDaFest has had 2000 people involved in youth projects. *Disability Equality Action Training - This is a scheme that addresses the issues faced by disabled and deaf people regarding access to everyday opportunities. Participants on the course are taught about these issues and gain an understanding of how to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, Human Rights and how to work without bias. The training promotes working to the Social Model of Disability. *Hands On - This is a website and network set up in 2011 designed to provide deaf people working in the arts with a place to share ideas and network with others in the industry. *Arts-Life - This is a research project with the aim to increase the attendance of disabled and deaf people, including older people at arts venues and events around Merseyside. It also aims to improve the experience that people have while attending. It is led by the Liverpool Arts Regeneration Consortium.

The becalmed gun-brigs became easy targets for the oar-powered gunboats, which were able to manoeuver as to overpower them and force their surrender. Also, the French vessels were armed with guns, which outranged the carronades that constituted the bulk of the British gunboat's armament.  Strategic background   Battle  In July 1805 , together with her sister-ship , were part of the Royal Navy force blockading the coat of northern France. On 15 July the two gun-brigs were off Granville, Manche when they became becalmed. To avoid the tide carrying them onto the coast, the two anchored in the afternoon off Chausey. The news that the gun- brigs were anchored off Chausey was carried to Commander Joseph Collet, commanding officer of the 1st gunboat division of the Boulogne FlotillaFonds Marine.

Collet departed Granville on 15 July at 21:00, leading seven gunboats and a dogger, or six gunboats, a schooner, and a ketch. A heavy fog came up and at 2:30 am on 16 July, several French vessels were seen to emerge from the darkness. Plumper attempted to get closer to Teazer so that they could support each other, but was unable to so. The French force, which consisted of six brigs, a schooner, and a ketch, stood off and battered Plumper with their guns. Plumper returned fire, but being armed primarily with carronades, was outranged. During the exchange of fire, Lieutenant James Henry Garrety, Plumpers captain, had an arm shot off, a leg crippled by grapeshot, and his chest lacerated by a piece of langrage. Four seamen were also wounded. After an hour, Sub-Lieutenant Richards, who had taken over command after Garrety had been taken below, struck. Later, some of Plumpers crew accused Richards of having too quickly surrendered.Hepper (1994), p.111. Having overpowered Plumper, Collet anchored his vessels to give his rowers some rest. After daybreak, Collet pressed his attack on Teazer, which struck at 7:30am.  Aftermath  The French took the two badly damaged gun-brigs into Granville. Plumper in particular was in a sinking condition, and barely reached Granville before she ran aground. Collet was slightly wounded by a splinter, but otherwise there were no reported casualties. Plumper was brought into service in the French Navy, where she served until 1827; from 1815 on her name was Argus.Winfield and Roberts (2015 forthcoming), Chap. 7.

Background A site on Wood Street in the centre of the Cardiff had been identified in the 1930s as a good location for a new swimming baths. However, the construction of a new pool was not realised until Cardiff was chosen as the hosts of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. The pool's site was immediately next to the Cardiff Arms Park, which was the main stadium for the Games. The building was acclaimed as the first example of modernist architecture in Cardiff, and was similar in design to the Royal Festival Hall in London. It was designed by D. M. Davies, believed to be influenced by Peter Behrens' 1910 AEG turbine factory. The Royal Institute of British Architects differs in opinion, attributing the design to John Dryburgh, the City Architect 1957‚Äì74. The structural engineer was Oscar Faber, who was known for his work with reinforced concrete. Work on the new pool began in January 1956 and the completed building was opened by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, J. H. Morgan, on 18 April 1958, two months before the Empire Games started. The City Council were initially reluctant to finance the new pool, but agreed to do so when confronted with the ultimatum of \\"No Pool ‚Äì No Games\\". The total cost of construction was ¬£650,000 and the 1958 Empire Games went on to achieve a financial surplus of ¬£37,000. Facilities The main attraction of the Empire Pool was the international standard swimming pool, which measured with a depth of between , with diving boards. For spectators there were 1,722 permanent seats. In addition to the main pool, there was an aerotone therapeutic bath, Turkish baths, physiotherapy rooms, hot showers, a restaurant and a large reception area. In 1970 the main pool was shortened to 50 metres, meeting new international standards. In 1973 a teaching pool was created for school children, opened by Winifred Mathias, Lord Mayor of Cardiff. Demolition Plaque commemorating the pool The Empire Pool was demolished in 1998 to make space for the Millennium Stadium, leading to a severe lack of swimming facilities in the South Wales area. In 2003 a new Wales National Pool was opened in Swansea while Cardiff received the ¬£32 million Cardiff International Pool, which opened in Cardiff Bay in February 2008.

Windship first introduced Weight Training in the United States between 1859 - 1872. He toured with lecturers and exhibitions. He was born in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, to Dr. Charles May Windship and Susan Barker. He attended Roxbury Latin School and then Harvard Medical School, where he obtained his M.D. in 1857 at the age of 20. After a brief flirtation with acting as a career, he was appointed Assistant Physician at Boston Lunatic Hospital in June, 1856. On 28 April 1868 he married Rebecca G. Haskins, daughter of Rev. Green Haskins. When he entered Harvard at 16 he was 5 feet tall and weighed 100 pounds. Because of his stature he was the victim of relentless teasing. After a larger student threw his books downstairs and refused to apologize, Windship determined to build himself up by practicing gymnastics at the school gym, working on the various equipment, including the spring-board, horse, vaulting apparatus, parallel bars, suspended rings, horizontal and inclined ladders, pulley-weights, pegs, climbing rope, and trapezoid every evening after classes. Originally motivated by revenge, in an article published in the January 1862 Atlantic Monthly, he said that his desire for retaliation was quickly extinguished as habit and progress took its place. He discovered that his perseverance in exercise transferred to other areas of his life and he found he had gained the ability to resist and overcome other bad habits and ailments of the body, from which he coined the slogan \\"Strength is Health\\". At the time of his graduation, he could do 12 one-arm chinups with either arm and perform a one-arm chin with either arm using only his little finger. He died 12 September 1876, in Roxbury of a stroke.Harvard College. (1894) Report of the Class of 1854. Boston: Geo. H. Ellis, pp. 55-6.

He played representative level cricket for Northumberland (1892‚Äì99), and at club level for Wakefield (1879‚Äì80), North Leeds (1888‚Äì89), Benwell (1890‚Äì91, 1893‚Äì94, 1896), Elswick Works (1891‚Äì92), Belford (1893), Wallsend (1897-1900), and coached at school level for Royal Grammar School, Newcastle (1893-1903), and Loretto School, and representative level rugby union (RU) for North of England, and Yorkshire, and at club level Harrogate RUFC (twice), York RUFC , and Wakefield Trinity (was a rugby union club at the time, so no Heritage ‚Ññ is allocated), as a centre, he was a drop kick specialist. Prior to Tuesday 27 August 1895, Wakefield Trinity was a rugby union club. Background Teddy Bartram was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and he died aged in Andover, Hampshire, England. Playing career County Cup Final appearances During Teddy Bartram's time at Wakefield Trinity, they had a 2g, 1t, 7m - 0g, 0t, 0m victory over Kirkstall RUFC in the 1879 Yorkshire Cup Final at Halifax on Saturday 12 April 1879, a 3g, 6g, 7m - 0g, 1t, 2m victory over Heckmondwike in the 1880 Yorkshire Cup Final at Cardigan Fields, Leeds on Saturday 3 April 1880, a 1g, 2t, 11m - 0g, 0t, 0m victory over Halifax in the 1883 Yorkshire Cup Final at Cardigan Fields, Leeds on Monday 23 April 1883, and a 2g, 0t, 2m - 0g, 0t, 2m victory over Leeds St John's in the 1887 Yorkshire Cup Final at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 2 April 1887. In addition, they were runners-up in 1881, 1882, and 1888. Professionalism In 1879 Teddy Bartram became the first definite example of a rugby player being paid, he received money from Wakefield Trinity for travel expenses, etc. These were an open secret in the north of England but, at that time the RFU had no laws relating to amateurism and professionalism, since the issue had never arisen. The Yorkshire Rugby Football Union moved quickly in 1879 and copied the Marylebone Cricket Club's laws relating to the definition of a (cricketing) amateur. These were the first laws relating to amateurism in any football code. Consequently, Wakefield Trinity created an Assistant Secretary role for Teddy Bartram with an annual salary of ¬£52 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£23,170 in 2017). The Rugby Football Union did not provide national rules on professionalism until 1886. Teddy Bartram was banned from rugby union for life in 1889, he moved to North East England, and later Edinburgh, to play, coach, and umpire cricket. Genealogical information Teddy Bartram's marriage was registered during second ¬º 1895 in Newcastle district.

Moghaddam gives priority to collective over individual processes, and argues that personal worldview and identity emerge from collective worldview and identity. This sets him apart from traditional research, which he argued is individualistic and reductionist.

Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association Press. His claim is that in terms of personality characteristics, there are potential dictators in all human groups.

Since 2013 he is the editor of Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology. Since 2010 he has introduced and focused his research on two new concepts. The first is political plasticity, how fast and how much cognition and action in the political domain can change. Limits on political plasticity underlie the failure of political revolutions to create open societies and slow the pace of change toward democracy. The second new concept is mutual radicalization, the processes through which groups and nations radicalize and push one another to extremes. Drawing from well‚Äëestablished psychological principles, in his book ‚ÄòMutual Radicalization‚Äô Moghaddam presents a dynamic, cyclical three‚Äëstage model of mutual radicalization that explains how groups gather under extremist ideologies, establish rigid norms under authoritarian leadership, and develop antagonistic worldviews that exaggerate the threats posed by each other. This process leads to intensifying aggressive actions that can even reach the point of mutual destruction. Moghaddam applies his model to 10 real‚Äëworld case studies of mutual radicalization that focus on three main areas: the conflict between Islamist radicals and extreme nationalists in the West; nations that are mired in long-standing hostilities, including North Korea and South Korea; and the increasingly toxic atmosphere in American politics. He offers practical solutions for achieving deradicalization and highlights historical successes, such as German reunification. Bibliography * Moghaddam, F. M. (2018).

A youth prodigy on the traditional drums of Haitian Vodou in ritual context, Augustin took his genre to the modern stage, often exploring its common roots with various jazz styles. From his initial forays in Haiti with Lina Mathon Blanchet, Jacky Duroseau, and Jazz des Jeunes, he went on to work in the United States and Europe with Kip Hanrahan, Edy Brisseaux, and Andrew Cyrille. He also recorded for the late filmmaker Jonathan Demme. Augustin led his own ensemble, La Troupe Makandal, from 1981 until his death. He used the group not only to make music but also to change popular misconceptions in the public mind regarding Haitian Vodou, a poorly understood but richly developed Afro- Haitian spiritual discipline.  Early life in Haiti  Frisner Augustin was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on March 1, 1948.\\"Frisner Augustin, Haitian Vodou Drummer, Dies at 63\\", The New York Times, March 10, 2012.Lois Wilcken, The Drums of Vodou (Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs Media Company, 1992), 12. His mother, a poor retailer named Andrea Laguerre, gave birth to Frisner, her first child, under a tree outside the city's General Hospital while waiting for a room that never became available. Andrea took her son to the dirt-floor shack that was their home in the capital's Portail L√©ogane district, specifically, a community called \\"behind the cemetery\\" because of its location along the west side of the major burial ground at the south end of the city.James Ridgeway and Jean-Jean Pierre. 1998-99. \\"Haitian Drums Call from Port-au-Prince to Brooklyn\\". Natural History, Volume 107, Number 10 (December - January), p. 30. The child's father, a carpenter named Julien Augustin, left their home not long after the birth of his second child, a girl. Growing up without the presence of a father in the home, the boy decided it was up to him to support his mother and sister. Since the family had no means to put him in school, and since his passion was music, he began to follow in the footsteps of his uncle Catelus Laguerre, a drummer in the oral tradition, at the age of seven.Carol Amoruso, \\"Frisner Augustin, Vodou Ambassador: A Master Spell Caster Drums the Spirits In\\". RhythmMusic Magazine, Vol. V, No. 12 (December/January 1998), p. 20. He earned the nickname Ti Kelep (Tee Kay-lep), which means \\"Little Kelep\\", the second word referring to a pattern unique to the third drum of the Vodou ensemble. By the time Augustin had reached his early teens, the Vodou houses of his community had recognized his genius for drumming, and one house initiated him as its ount√≤gi (oo-taw-gee; sacred drummer).Lois Wilcken, The Drums of Vodou (Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs Media Company, 1992), 111. Frisner Augustin (center, holding large drum) and his youth Mardi Gras band, Port-au-Prince, early 1960s Julien Augustin returned to the family and placed his now adolescent son in a welding school at about the same time that Andr√© Germain, a director of Haiti's La Troupe Folklorique Nationale (National Dance Troupe), discovered him playing at a Vodou ceremony just outside Port-au-Prince. To his father's consternation, Augustin dropped out of the welding school when Germain introduced him to Lina Mathon Blanchet,Transcript 20110312 (Rebecca Dirksen); interview with Frisner Augustin, March 12, 2011; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. a classical pianist who had organized Haiti Chante et Danse (Haiti Sings and Dances), one of the country's first companies performing folklore,Lavinia Williams Yarborough, Haiti-Dance (Frankfurt am Main: Br√∂nners Druckerei, 1959), 3. a word used in Haiti to denote both traditional culture and a genre that represents traditional culture on the modern stage.Lois Wilcken, \\"Music Folklore among Haitians in New York: Staged Representations and the Negotiation of Identity\\" (Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 1991), p. 5. Blanchet also taught piano and guided the career of Jacky Duroseau,http://www.haitiantimes.com/black-history-profiles-katherine-dunham- lina-mathon-blanchet/ who went on to develop a unique style of Vodou jazz. Augustin soon found work with a small jazz combo featuring Duroseau, with Haiti Chante et Danse, and later with the folklore companies of African- American dancer Lavinia Williams and Haitian dance professor and choreographer Viviane Gauthier. While continuing to play in Vodou temples and in a Mardi Gras band of his own creation, he entertained tourists in theaters and hotels, inside and outside Haiti. In 1972, one year into the tenure of dictator Jean- Claude Duvalier, Augustin accepted an engagement in New York with Jazz des Jeunes, the orchestra that accompanied La Troupe Folklorique Nationale.Lavinia Williams Yarborough, Haiti-Dance (Frankfurt am Main: Br√∂nners Druckerei, 1959), 7. Like all other members of the company, he used the opportunity to emigrate from Haiti and settle in the burgeoning Haitian diaspora of New York City.

RhythmMusic Magazine, Vol. V, No. 12 (December/January 1998), p. 20. Augustin re-connected with childhood friend Oungan Emmanuel Cadet, who had established a Vodou society in the Bronx. In October 1973 Cadet performed a spiritual marriage between Augustin and √àzili Freda Dawomen,Unpublished document 19731021 (Gros Roche Beau Hougan, priest); certificate of Vodou marriage with √àzili Freda Dawomen, October 21, 1973; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. a Vodou spirit with roots in West Africa who represents romantic love.Maya Deren, Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti (Kingston, NY: McPherson & Company, 1983), 137-45.Leslie G. Desmangles, The Faces of the Gods: Vodou and Roman Catholicism in Haiti (Chapel Hill & London: University of North Carolina Press, 1992), 131-45. Such a marriage, according to Vodou practitioners, brings prosperity to the human partner in exchange for special devotion.Alfred M√©traux, Voodoo in Haiti, translated by Hugo Charteris (New York: Schocken Books, 1972), 212-15. Augustin would also go on to a real-life marriage with one of Cadet's initiates, who helped him secure his permanent residency in the United States in 1977. As he became Cadet's lead drummer, word of mouth helped him to find work in other Vodou societies taking root throughout New York City. Dancers and choreographers who had played with companies in Port-au-Prince since the 1940s were leaving Haiti during the 1960s and '70s and re-forming in New York.Lois Wilcken, \\"Music Folklore among Haitians in New York: Staged Representations and the Negotiation of Identity\\" (Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 1991), pp. 177-95. Augustin found work drumming for Jean-L√©on Destin√©, Louin√®s Louinis, Troupe Shango of Arnold Elie, and the Ibo Dancers of Paulette St. Lot; however, throughout the 1970s, he aspired to leadership of his own group even though dancers typically led folklore companies. In 1981 La Troupe Makandal, a company established in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Upper Belair and named after the eighteenth-century revolutionary and messiah Fran√ßois Makandal, arrived in New York and sought Augustin out for help in establishing itself in the diaspora.Lois Wilcken, \\"Music Folklore among Haitians in New York: Staged Representations and the Negotiation of Identity\\" (Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 1991), pp. 202-203. He took the group under his wing and introduced it to the Haitian community in a Thanksgiving festival at Brooklyn College.Lois Wilcken, \\"The Changing Hats of Haitian Staged Folklore in New York\\", Ray Allen and Lois Wilcken, eds., Island Sounds in the Global City, Caribbean Popular Music and Identity in New York (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2001), 175.

Together with his drumming student, musicologist Lois Wilcken, Augustin established the company as a not-for-profit organization incorporated in New York State.Unpublished document 19840207 (New York State Department of State); Certificate of Incorporation, February 7, 1984; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. Directing his own company gave Augustin the opportunity to develop a singularly powerful style of Vodou drumming and to train an ensemble in his own manner. He and the company soon attracted the attention of entrepreneurs, particularly with staged representations of Vodou rites that balanced the mystical with a mission to re-educate the public about Vodou and Haiti itself.Robert Palmer, \\"Stage: Voodoo Rituals\\", New York Times, May 25, 1983, n.p.Susanna Sloat, \\"La Troupe Makandal‚ÄîFebruary 4, 1998\\", Attitude, Vol. 13, No. 2 (Spring/Summer 1998), pp. 32, 34. Augustin carried this mission forward from the 1980s on, both in and in , , and . He took Makandal across the United States and abroad; venues included Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History, New York's Town Hall, the Festival International de Louisiane, the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, the 1995 Bouyon Rasin Festival in Port-au-Prince, Banlieues Bleues in France, and the Tokyo Summer Festival.Unpublished document 20120228 (La Troupe Makandal); professional resume, through February 28, 2012; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. Throughout his performing and teaching career, he continued to drum for Vodou houses both in and out of New York.McLane, Daisann, \\"Dead Heads, Saturday Night Voodoo in Brooklyn\\", Village Voice, November 27, 1990, 63. In his own analysis, he placed greatest value on drumming directly for the spirits in a consecrated space.Dr. Lo√Øs Wilcken, \\"Frisner Augustin: 'Ount√≤gi'\\", Voices from Ha√Øti.

Later life  Augustin (standing) soundchecking for his last performance at the Institut Fran√ßais, Port-au-Prince, February 16, 2012 Through frequent visits back home during his residency in New York, Augustin maintained his ties not only to Haiti but also to the community in which he grew up. When the Haiti earthquake of 2010 destroyed much of Port-au-Prince, he and Dr. Wilcken raised funds and brought relief to .Lois Wilcken, \\"Drummer, Give Me My Sound, Reflections on the Life and Legacy of Frisner Augustin\\", Voices: The Journal of New York Folklore (forthcoming). In the next two years, his company organized a Haitian Carnival for . During his visit in the winter of 2012, he made plans with the √âcole Nationale des Arts (ENARTS) of Port-au-Prince for a drumming course beginning in the fall of 2012.Philippe Dodard, email message to Lois Wilcken, February 5, 2012. ENARTS also presented him at the Institut Fran√ßais in Port- au-Prince as part of a collaborative series of the two organizations. Augustin met at that time with organizers of the annual International Jazz Festival of Port-au-Prince, and they were considering his participation in the Festival.Claudia Labissiere, email message to Lois Wilcken, December 29, 2011. During the same 2012 visit to Haiti, on the night of February 23‚Äì24, Augustin suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and died in the Bernard Mevs Hospital in Port-au-Prince on February 28.Unpublished document 20120228 (Hopital Bernard Mevs); Certificat/Constat de Deces (Death Certificate), February 28, 2012; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. He was buried in the Grand Cemetery in his . The night before the funeral a local mambo conducted the traditional Vodou desounen, rites that formally separate the spirit of the dead from the body and send it beneath the cosmic waters.Maya Deren, Divine Horsemen, The Living Gods of Haiti (Kingston, NY: McPherson & Company, 1983), 45-6. One year and one day later, as per tradition, a Vodou priest near Jacmel, a city in the south of Haiti and the source of Augustin's maternal line, reclaimed his soul and installed it in a place of honor.Video Recording (Paul Uhry Newman); Vodou reclamation of Frisner Augustin's soul, March 1‚Äì4, 2013; New City, NY. In June 2012 Makandal, together with Ayiti Fasafas, the Center for Traditional Music and Dance, and the Haiti Cultural Exchange, presented a memorial performance to Augustin in Brooklyn, New York.Video Recording 20120622 (Jeremy Robins); Rele Ount√≤, Remembering the Life and Legacy of Frisner Augustin memorial tribute, June 22, 2012; Makandal Archive , Brooklyn, NY. Other memorial projects in process include an annotated online archive (NEA 2013 Spring Grant Announcements, page 111) of his life and work, a biography, and ongoing performances and workshops that promote his style and aesthetic. Frisner Augustin was married and divorced once. Seven children, five grandchildren, his father, and his sister survived him.  Musical legacy  Frisner Augustin distinguished himself for his powerful, precise, and complex style of Vodou drumming and composition. Understanding his singularity calls for a brief discussion of the stylistic elements of the tradition. The following background supplements Haitian Vodou drumming. Dozens of different styles of drumming have evolved from the repertories of the West African and Congo nations that came to Haiti through the Middle Passage, but they share certain organizational principles. Most utilize three drums, an iron idiophone, a rattle, and a frame drum,Gerd√®s Fleurant, Dancing Spirits, Rhythms and Rituals of Haitian Vodun, the Rada Rite (Westport, Connecticut ‚óè London: Greenwood Press, 1996), 24-25. and all work with song and dance.Claude Dauphin, Musique du vaudou, fonctions, structures et styles (Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec, Canada: √âditions Naaman, 1986), 31-52.Gerd√®s Fleurant, Dancing Spirits, Rhythms and Rituals of Haitian Vodun, the Rada Rite (Westport, Connecticut ‚óè London: Greenwood Press, 1996), 24-33.Lois Wilcken, The Drums of Vodou (Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs Media Company, 1992), 92-108. A slow pulse, visible in the dance and audible in the drumming, marks measures or phrases.\\"Vodou Music\\". Drummers draw from a wide palette of tone to articulate points on and between the pulses;Lois Wilcken, The Drums of Vodou (Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs Media Company, 1992), 54.Yuen-Ming David Yih, \\"Music and Dance of Haitian Vodou, Diversity and Unity in Regional Repertoires (Ph.D. dissertation, Wesleyan University, 1995), 145-50. the strokes render a sense of off-beat phrasing, or the interplay of duple and triple time.Gerd√®s Fleurant, Dancing Spirits, Rhythms and Rituals of Haitian Vodun, the Rada Rite (Westport, Connecticut ‚óè London: Greenwood Press, 1996), 66. The lead drummer, also called \\"master drummer\\" because he qualifies to play the manman tanbou (mother, or lead drum),Lois Wilcken, The Drums of Vodou (Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs Media Company, 1992), 109-112. may launch into a kase (kah-say; in English, break), a pattern that musically opposes the main pattern, for example, it sets up a counter- pulse or emphasizes a contrasting sonority.Claude Dauphin, Musique du vaudou, fonctions, structures et styles (Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec, Canada: √âditions Naaman, 1986), 33. Apart from the kase, the drumming seemingly consists of repeated ensemble patterns, but a discerning ear will note that the cycles vary according to song phrasing and ritual action.Yuen-Ming David Yih, \\"Music and Dance of Haitian Vodou, Diversity and Unity in Regional Repertoires (Ph.D. dissertation, Wesleyan University, 1995), 152-56. In other words, each instrument draws from a considerable set of patterns available in each of the multiple styles, and further variation and invention arise from dialogues among the musicians and dancers. Haitian Vodou drumming is not formulaic, and a master drummer works on the same levels as arrangers and composers in other traditions. Frisner Augustin and Makandal drumming for a Haitian Vodou dance in Queens, New York, December 5, 2009Frisner Augustin's drumming style featured a refined balance of aesthetic cool and volatile energy. Critic Robert Palmer noted after a performance in Manhattan, \\"...Augustin embroidered explosive improvisations...over the ensemble's deftly layered rhythmic conversations while always keeping an eye on dancers and singers and guiding the ebb and flow of relaxation and intensity\\".Robert Palmer, \\"Stage: Voodoo Rituals\\", New York Times, May 25, 1983, n.p. Dancers recognized him for his intimate terpsichorean exchanges: \\"He lays luscious melodies like flowers at your feet, almost within reach, then yanks them away just as you are about to grab them\\".Carol Amoruso, \\"Frisner Augustin, Vodou Ambassador: A Master Spell Caster Drums the Spirits In.\\" RhythmMusic Magazine, Vol. V, No. 12 (December/January 1998), 23. He exploited the full tonal/timbral palette of the drum and often insisted, \\"The drum is a piano\\". Equally accomplished in hand and stick technique (both used in Vodou drumming), he delivered crisp, clear articulations of open and closed mid-range tones, bass tones, portamento glides, rimshots, etc. When a student failed to render the strokes properly, he admonished him or her to \\"clean it.\\" On the temporal side, Augustin broke new ground with his kase, which tested the limits of how far one can travel from the principal rhythmic framework without losing it: \\"More so than any traditional drummer, Augustin has the ability to drop out of the rhythm completely...riffing brilliantly in stunning jazz-like improvisations for carefully calculated intervals, then coming back in, skeletally at first, and finally resuming full melody\\".Carol Amoruso, \\"Frisner Augustin, Vodou Ambassador: A Master Spell Caster Drums the Spirits In.\\" RhythmMusic Magazine, Vol. V, No. 12 (December/January 1998), 23. Augustin made several recordings, some of which featured his compositions for La Troupe Makandal. A part of the Troupe's online archive of his performances and workshops, public and private lives, and Vodou activities went online in December 2018 as The Frisner Augustin Memorial Archive. The company continues to build the archive as new materials are collected and, when needed, digitized. Hard copy materials are stored at the Brooklyn Arts Council.

It uses algorithms to analyze internet and device data and predict whether two or more devices are owned by the same person. Participating websites and apps then cater their advertisements based on a collective knowledge of the user's actions across all of their devices. Tapad was founded in 2010 by Are Traasdahl. It raised $1.8 million in funding in June 2011 and another $6.5 million in March 2013. Telenor Group has on 29 January 2016 entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 95% of Tapad Inc. The purchase price is USD 360 million, on a debt and cash-free 100% basis.  History  The idea for Tapad was conceived by cofounder and CEO Are Traasdahl at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). He saw attendees switching between televisions, laptops and smartphones and thought that brands should be able to cater their ads to individual users even as they switch between devices. Cofounder and CTO Dag Liodden, Traasdahl, and four others began developing algorithms for the software and founded Tapad in 2010. It took almost a year for the company to obtain its first client, but afterwards the organization grew quickly. In 2011, it raised $1.8 million in funding and opened five more sales offices in major US cities. From mid-2012 to mid-2013, the company hired 44 people and moved its headquarters to a larger office in New York City. Another $6.5 million in funding was raised in March 2013 and $7 million was raised in July 2014 to fund additional expansion in Europe. An additional $18.5 million in funding was raised in July 2015. On January 29, 2016, Telenor Group entered into an agreement to acquire about 95 percent of Tapad Inc. for $360 million.  Software and services  Tapad uses data such as cookie IDs, operating system IDs, IP addresses, online registrations and data from partnering publishers to develop a probability that different devices are shared by the same person or household. According to Tapad, none of the data contains personally identifiable information (PII). In a data sample tested by Nielsen, Tapad accurately identified users across devices in 91.2% of cases. This is only slightly less than deterministic methods which require PII. Tapad is used for advertising to consumers across devices, where a user is shown an ad on their mobile or tablet device based on websites they visited on a desktop or based on a usage behavior that matches an advertiser's target audience. For example, if an Android phone visits a website shortly after a desktop PC from the same home network, Tapad will assess that there is a high probability that the two devices are operated by the same person and will show them similar ads on both devices. According to the company website, its services also include cross-device analytics for things like location, timing, user behavior, and audience analysis. Website publishers use Tapad's technology to understand how a consumer engages with page content, regardless of the device being used to access the site. This can be useful to customize advertising creative, editorial content and offer a more uniform experience for the user across all devices. http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/248704/new-yp-ad- product-offers-digital-audience-extensio.html/ In early 2015, Tapad partnered with Placed, a company that specializes in the measurement of in-store visitation by consumers, then introduced features and services that attempt to measure if an advertising campaign resulted in consumers visiting a business location. It also introduced TV Pulse, a product that uses data from first party data suppliers to attempt to measure the effect of digital advertising campaigns. Tapad‚Äôs Device Graph is also licensed to other technology companies and integrated into their products.  Privacy  Advertisements using Tapad usually feature a notification that explains the ad is being shown as a result of behavioral analysis and provide an opt-out button in compliance with standards set by the Digital Advertising Alliance. The disclosure features are provided by Evidon, which Tapad partnered with in November 2011. According to Forbes, Tapad's \\"burgeoning success risks irking Congress, regulators and privacy advocates.\\" The company's CEO says it shouldn't be a problem, since it doesn't collect personally identifiable information.

Gibb recorded a solo demo of the song on 1968. He sang the lead vocals and played acoustic guitar. Though Gibb was the only Bee Gee performing on the record, it was leaked on YouTube on 22 October 2011 under Barry Gibb's name but the tone quality is not good. The Tigers version \\"Smile for Me\\" was recorded in London with Barry Gibb's uncredited help and he is shown with the band on the picture sleeve. Gibb also make a cameo appearance in the movie Hi London!. The song was sung by Kenji Sawada. Since the band did not speak English, Biddu had to show them how to sing the English lyrics phonetically. It was also released on The Tigers' album The Tigers' Beat. This song was arranged by John Fiddy and produced by Biddu. The single was released in the UK and Japan on Polydor.

French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered the loss of their principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. The survivors of the French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at Genoa and Imp√©rieuse at Leghorn. To eliminate the threat these isolated frigates posed, Hood ordered a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Gell to investigate the harbour at Genoa. The squadron arrived on 5 October and discovered Modeste and two smaller warships at anchor. Later in the day, three ships of the squadron launched their ship's boats and instigated a boarding action against the anchored ships, in defiance of Genoese neutrality. The French crews resisted, but the British boarding parties successfully captured all three vessels without suffering any casualties. Six days later the detached HMS Captain also seized the abandoned Imp√©rieuse, which had fled to La Spezia. The action had strategic consequences: the Republican faction in Genoa was strong and they successfully barred Austrian reinforcements from sailing to join the Allied garrison at the developing Siege of Toulon. The outnumbered defenders of the port were overwhelmed and driven into the sea by a Republican assault on 17 December. Mediterranean in 1793 The French Revolutionary Wars, which began in 1792 as a conflict between the new French Republic and the Austrian Empire following the French Revolution, spread in 1793 to involve a number of other European nations, including Spain and Great Britain.Chandler, p. 269 In addition to these external threats, political tensions within France led to a series of uprisings against the Republic in the summer of 1793, particularly in the south of the country. One of the centres of Royalist activity was the city of Toulon, the major naval base and home port for the powerful French Mediterranean Fleet.James, p. 66 On 28 August, after fighting between Republican forces and British troops for control of the heights overlooking the city, Toulon surrendered to Lord Hood, commander of the British Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet. Hood's forces occupied the city, seized the French fleet in harbour and called for reinforcements to defend Toulon against the inevitable Republican counterattack, receiving Spanish, Neapolitan and Sardinian contingents over the following weeks as the Siege of Toulon developed.Clowes, p. 206 Austrian troops were also promised, to be dispatched from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark from the city port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which at this stage of the war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly- minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause.Gardiner, p. 98 Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.Rose, p. 48 The situation at Genoa was compounded by the presence of French warships in Genoese waters. Those parts of the French fleet which had not been seized at Toulon were now deprived of a home port and so had taken refuge in neutral Italian ports, relying on Italian neutrality to protect them from attack by the more numerous enemy fleets operating in the Ligurian Sea.Clowes, p. 213 Two of the largest such ships were the 36-gun frigate Modeste and 40-gun Imp√©rieuse, which had taken shelter at Genoa and Leghorn, in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, respectively. They presented both a threat to Allied shipping and an impediment to the movement of reinforcements through the Italian ports, but despite strong protests from Drake and Lord Hervey, Ambassador to Tuscany, the Republican sympathisers in Genoa and Leghorn refused to compel the French ships to leave. In July Modeste and the French corvette Badine had deliberately obstructed the frigate HMS Aigle in the neutral harbour, forcing Captain John Nicholson Inglefield to take evasive action, a calculated insult.Ireland, p. 146 In consequence, Hood resolved that the frigates be eliminated so that the Republicans in Genoa would be coerced into withdrawing their support.James, p. 87 Raid John Gell, Joshua Reynolds, 1786, National Maritime Museum To confront the French frigates, Hood diverted a powerful squadron from his fleet at Toulon. This force was led by Rear-Admiral John Gell in the 98-gun ship of the line HMS St George and included the 74-gun HMS Bedford under Captain Robert Mann, and HMS Captain under Captain Samuel Reeve, as well as the French Royalist Scipion. Smaller warships accompanied the larger warships: HMS Mermaid, HMS Tartar, HMS Alerte, HMS Eclair, HMS Vulcan, HMS Conflagration, and HMS Speedy under Commander Charles Cunningham. This force was ordered to sail to Genoa and eliminate Modeste, Hood stipulating in his orders that the operation was a warning to Republican sympathisers, \\"regicides\\", in Genoa.Ireland, p. 214 The squadron arrived off the port on 5 October. Modeste was clearly visible in the harbour, anchored at the mole near two tartanes (small Mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men). The senior officers of the squadron held a council to determine the best course of action, and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and the Genoese appeared to support the French, the British would resort to a military solution. On the afternoon of 5 October Bedford was slowly warped into the harbour and alongside Modeste, as Reeve launched the ship's boats from Captain and brought them close to the other side of the French frigate. The British arrival was reportedly greeted with derision by the French sailors, until a boarding party clambered onto the frigate from Bedford's deck, to be met by resistance from the French crew.Rose, p. 49 Mann then ordered his ship's Royal Marines to fire into the French sailors, killing several and driving many more over the side into the harbour.Ireland, p. 215 This attack broke their resolve and the French surrendered, several leaping into the sea to escape capture, only to be collected by the boats of Captain. As Modeste was subdued, the boats of Speedy approached the tartanes. As the boat parties boarded the small French warships, the crew of one surrendered while the other resisted the British boarders. A short melee broke out on the deck of the tartane, resulting in the captain and one other French sailor wounded and the tartane firmly in British hands. The raid completed, the British squadron withdrew from Genoa with their prizes. British sources reported that one French sailor had been killed in the operation and ten wounded, while the British boarding parties had survived unscathed, while French sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in the most extreme accounts, as many as 50 killed. La Spezia Alarmed by the raid on Genoa, the authorities in Leghorn ordered Imp√©rieuse to leave immediately. The frigate sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French had decided that since capture was inevitable, the frigate should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Imp√©rieuse was in the bay. Reeve discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Imp√©rieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the frigate, discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British were able to take possession of Imp√©rieuse without opposition from the battery. Reeve instructed his carpenters to make the frigate seaworthy again, refloating the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.James, p. 88 Aftermath Modeste and Imp√©rieuse were high-quality modern ships, and were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste with the same name and Imp√©rieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. The repercussions of this operation were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, and as a result the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark.Gardiner, p. 99 Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at Leghorn to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a barrel of brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.Grocott, p.4 Without the Austrian reinforcements the defenders of Toulon were outnumbered and outflanked, coming under sustained attack by French troops directed by 24-year-old artillery officer Captain Napoleon Bonaparte.Tracy, p. 24 On 17 December, French troops seized the high ground over the city and the allies were forced into a chaotic withdrawal. As Hood's ships removed the garrison and more than 14,000 refugees from the city, boat parties led by Sir Sidney Smith attempted to destroy the French fleet and dockyards with fireships.Mostert, p. 116 These efforts were only partially successful: fifteen ships of the line and five frigates survived the conflagration to form the nucleus of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the war to come. By the evening of 18 December Toulon was firmly in Republican hands.Clowes, p. 210 References Bibliography  * Category:Conflicts in 1793 Category:1793 in Italy Category:History of Genoa Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:1793 in the Republic of Genoa ","title":"Raid on Genoa"},{"id":"39021956","text":"Emilio Eiroa Garc√≠a (23 August 1935 ‚Äì 10 March 2013) was a Spanish politician and lawyer.

It was introduced by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on January 15, 2013 and it passed the House with a vote of 261-154 on February 15, 2013. The bill would prevent a 0.5% pay increase for all federal workers from taking effect, continuing a pay freeze that has been in effect since 2011. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this measure would save the federal government $11 billion over 10 years. Background In December 2010, President Obama issued executive order 13561 carrying out a two-year federal employee pay freeze. Two years later, on December 27, 2012, he issued a new order, Executive Order #13635, which would end the pay freeze and give civilian federal employees a 0.5% raise in 2013. The bill was proposed in response to this executive order. Procedural history Introduction The bill was introduced into the House by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on January 15, 2013. By the time the Bill has passed in the House, H.R. 273 had gained 48 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. The Bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Bill was freshman congressman Ron DeSantis' first bill introduced in Congress. Passage in the House The Bill passed the House on February 15, 2013 with a vote of 261-154. The vote was Roll No. 44. 218 Republicans voted in favor, with only 10 voting against. 43 Democrats voted in favor, with 144 against. Referral to the Senate The Bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The Bill did not pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. Provisions of the Bill The Bill would amend the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (which was itself amended by the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 ()), to extend through December 31, 2013: (1) the freeze on statutory pay adjustments for federal employees and officials, and (2) the prohibition against any member of the Senior Executive Service or any senior level employee in the executive branch from receiving an increase in his or her rate of basic pay absent a change of position that results in a substantial increase in responsibility or a promotion. The Bill also would eliminate the delayed statutory pay adjustment contained in the 2013 Continuing Appropriations Resolution that was permitted to take effect with the first applicable pay period beginning after March 27, 2013. The Bill would only prevent an across-the-board increase to all federal employees' pay. It would not effect merit pay, promotions, or tenure based pay increases. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, enacting the Bill would save the government $11 billion over 10 years. Arguments in favor Republican lawmakers, such as Rep. Rob Woodall (R-GA), argued that it was necessary to freeze federal pay due to the debt crisis the government faced and further argued that this was appropriate because federal workers already make more money on average than their private sector counterparts, according to a 2012 Congressional Budget Office report. The two-year pay freeze that federal workers experienced was originally recommended by the bipartisan Simpson- Bowles Commission to last three-years instead of two. The Bill was supported by conservative groups such as the Club for Growth, Heritage Action for America, the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and FreedomWorks. Arguments against The White House released a statement opposing the Bill, arguing that federal workers had not received any raises since 2011. The President did not, however, threaten to veto the Bill. Federal employee unions, as well as organizations such as the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, also expressed opposition to the Bill. Joseph Beaudoin, the President of NARFE, argued that ‚Äúcontinuing the pay freeze will only exacerbate the problem of an underpaid federal workforce and weaken the quality of our federal civil service over time.‚Äù Other arguments against the Bill included one from Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) who said that ‚Äúthis is one of the dumbest bills I‚Äôve ever seen come to this floor‚Äù because any savings would not significantly affect the deficit.

She was the wife of Donald W. Carter and mother of Keith B. Carter. Early life Mary Kennedy Carter was born Mary Kennedy in Franklin, Ohio, as the daughter of a barber and a teacher, the youngest of nine children. As a child she grew up in a part of Ohio, where racism was pervasive. As a child she had both black and white friends, but in the process of growing up racial segregation became more clear. At one point in her teens she became valedictorian of her class, but due to a race rule she was not proclaimed that. Instead, the teacher published 3 salutatorians in her place. Racial segregation for Mary also became apparent in that she couldn't use places to go out for entertainment unrestricted, like restaurants, swimming pools, the skate rink or the movie theatre. College and early career Unusual for their time and place was the fact that Mary and all of her siblings got into college. She herself attended Ohio State University to study to become an elementary school teacher. After teaching for several years in predominantly white elementary schools in Dayton, Ohio, California and San Diego, Mary received a teacher's fellowship at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City. This fellowship allowed her to travel to Uganda to teach at a teacher preparation college there. She was very thrilled to return to the continent of her ancestors, to learn from her heritage and be part of a majority, as she described it. There she also came into contact with presidents and officials of African countries. However she denied the request to stay in Uganda and returned to the United States.Carter, M., (2010), Teachers Whose Lives were Shaped by Segregation and the Battle for Civil Rights: Mary Kennedy Carter ‚Äì A Life Time of Activism, New York and New Jersey State Councils for the Social Studies, Social Science Docket Vol. 10 no. 2, p.33‚Äî34. Activism When back in the United States, Mary moved to New York City to work for McGraw-Hill publishers as editor and writer. There she met her husband Donald Carter. She left McGraw-Hill for the opportunity to create a module of Black History at the Roosevelt school district, Long Island. In that period she managed to get many important speakers to the school district, including Jackie Robinson and Betty Shabazz. After teaching and creating awareness at the Roosevelt school district, she went on to teach in Rockville, and went so far as to create the after-school clubs 'PINK' and 'BLUE' to promote diversity, multiculturalism and anti-violence. Mary Kennedy Carter was a preacher amongst students and teachers for equality and diversity everywhere she came. After retiring, Mary became a field supervisor and adjunct professor at Hofstra working with student teachers. She became part of a team developing and field-testing the 'New York and Slavery: Complicity and Resistance' curriculum that was developed with the support of the New York State Council for the Social Studies. In 2005, the curriculum won the Program of Excellence Award from the National Council for the Social Studies. In later years, Mary Kennedy Carter was a member of the New York State Amistad Commission, which was established by the State Legislature to research the best way issues of race can be taught in America's History classrooms. At the end of her career, Mary became the historian for her house of worship in Roosevelt, New York and a teacher educator at Hofstra University in Long Island.http://smartwaytoday.com/mary-kennedy-carter-dies-aged-76/222078/ She supervised student teachers and taught social studies methods and educational issues classes.

It is a potential space, and is paired on either side, located on the superficial surface of the mylohyoid muscle between the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle. The space corresponds to the anatomic region termed the submandibular triangle, part of the anterior triangle of the neck. Location and structure Anatomic boundaries The anatomic boundaries of each submandibular space are: * the mylohyoid muscle superiorly, * the skin, superficial fascia, platysma muscle and superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia inferiorly and laterally, * the medial surface of the mandible anteriorly and laterally, * the hyoid bone posteriorly, * the anterior belly of the digastric muscle medially. Communications The communications of the submandibular space are: * medially and anteriorly to the submental space (located medial to the paired submandibular spaces, separated from them by the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles). * posteriorly and superiorly to the sublingual space (located above the mylohyoid muscle) * inferiorly to the lateral pharyngeal space Contains In health, the contents of the space are: * the submandibular gland, which largely fills the space, * branches of the facial and lingual artery * lymph nodes. * cranial nerve XII * nerve to mylohyoid muscle Clinical relevance Diagram of medial surface of the mandible, showing the slanting attachment of mylohyoid (the mylohyoid line). This arrangement means that the apices of posterior teeth are more likely to be below the level of mylohyoid. Left submandibular space (right side shown with digastric muscle removed). Infections may spread into the submandibular space, e.g. odontogenic infections, often related to the mandibular molar teeth. This is due to the fact that the attachment of mylohyoid (the mylohoid line) becomes more superior towards the posterior of the mandible, meaning that the roots of the posterior teeth are more likely to be below mylohyoid than above. Signs and symptoms of a submandibular space infection might include trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), inability to palpate (feel) the inferior border of the mandible and swelling of the face over the submandibular region. If the space contains pus, the usual treatment is by incision and drainage. The site of the incision is extra-oral, and usually made 2‚Äì3 cm below, and parallel to, the inferior border of the mandible. Ludwig's angina is a serious infection involving the submandibular, sublingual and submental spaces bilaterally. Ludwig's angina may extend into the pharyngeal and cervical spaces, and the swelling can compress the airway and cause dyspnoea (difficulty breathing).

(born 1931) is a well-acclaimed Jesuit priest, scripture scholar and Marathi writer.Directory of South Asia, Delhi, JCSA, 2008, p. 48. He is professor Emeritus of Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune, India. He has contributed to the study of the Bible and especially through his Biblical commentaries in Marathi, the language of Maharashtra, India. Early history Fr. Francis was born on 4 December 1931, at Vadawali, Palli, Vasai of Catholic parents. The region of Vasai (formerly known as Bassein), like Goa, was evangelised by the Portuguese missionaries in the sixteenth century. His parents were simple people without much formal education, sufficiently well to do; they had their own farm and vegetable garden. By their life more than their words his parents taught Francis deep faith and genuine piety, integrity and honesty, love for all without discrimination of caste and creed, especially the poor and needy around in their neighbourhood. Francis and his brother and four sisters grew up in an atmosphere of peace and happiness within the family and in the neighbourhood. Two of his sisters are religious nuns. After his high school studies he did BSc (Hons) at the Bombay University in 1953, after which he joined the Society of Jesus at Andheri, Mumbai. He holds master's degrees in Philosophy (Barcelona, Spain) and in Theology (Pontifical Athenaeum, Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune. Francis was ordained a priest on 18 March 1964.Papal Seminary Directory: 1893‚Äì2003, Pune: Papal Seminary, 2003, p. 7. Academic Life Fr. Francis was appointed to teach Sacred Scripture in Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth.JDV Handbook, Pune: Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, 2006, p. 12. Accordingly, he did his Licentiate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, Rome. He started teaching New Testament Scripture from 1969. After teaching for a couple of years he did his Doctorate in Sacred Scripture at the same Biblical Institute in 1975, under the guidance of Fr. C.M. Martini, S.J. (later Cardinal Martini). Most of his life from 1969 onwards has been spent in teaching at Jnana-Deepa Vidyaapeeth (while staying at the Papal Seminary to which Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth was attached in the beginning), except for the break of five years when he was called to St. Pius College Seminary at Goregaon, Mumbai, to teach Scripture and to be a Spiritual guide for a period of five years (2000‚Äì2005).Carlos Merces de Melo, Papal Seminary of Kandy-Pune: A Hundred Years of History (1893‚Äì1993), Papal Seminary, Pune, 1993, p. 47. While he was at St. Pius College Seminary in Mumbai, he received a congratulatory letter from the Jesuit General, Fr. Hans-Peter Kolvenbach, S.J. on the occasion of his golden jubilee in the Society of Jesus on 1 July 2003. That letter shows how Fr. Francis came across to others. In the letter he wrote the following: :‚ÄúYou may certainly recall with satisfaction these fifty years during which the Lord has given you signal graces and enabled you to give valuable service to the Church and the Society. Especially noteworthy are the thirty years you spent at the Papal Seminary, Pune, teaching Sacred Scripture at Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth where you were much appreciated not only for your academic competence and teaching skill, but also because you infused your lectures with a spiritual and pastoral slant. Your knowledge of two Indian and five European languages and your facility in using them have been a valuable tool for communicating theology in books and periodicals. :Besides teaching, I am told that you have shown yourself an able and much sought after counsellor and spiritual director of both seminarians and religious. It is not surprising, therefore, that after your retirement from teaching at Jnana-Deepa your services were eagerly sought at the Diocesan Seminary in Goregaon, Mumbai, where you quickly won the trust of the Seminarians. I am very pleased to hear that besides teaching a course on Scripture, you are also busy composing a book in Marathi, so as to make available the best of your research on St Paul to the Marathi speaking Christians.Kuruvilla Pandikattu, James Ponniah and Thomas Kuriacose, Committed to the Church and the Country, Delhi, ISPCK, 2013, pp. 7‚Äì9. :Over and above your apostolic activities, your continuing witness as priest and religious testifies that the Lord Who is mighty has done great things for you and indeed your fifty years of generous fidelity are an effective witness to the continuing presence of God in our lives today. It is clear that you have touched many lives and these could recount better than I how you have been both Jesuit and priest for them.‚Äù His Books It was the letter of Fr. Kolvenbach which gave the impetus to Fr Francis to write Commentaries on NT books in Marathi. There has not been much written in Marathi regarding the Bible either by Catholics or even Protestants. So it was a challenge and inspiration from the Lord. There was a genuine need. * Ephesus: Climax of Universalism in Luke-Acts. A Redaction Critical Study of Acts 19:23- 20:1 (Gujarat Sahitya Prakash, Anand, India,1983); ASIN: B0006ERUTE * Gripped by God in Christ. The Mind and Heart of St. Paul (St. Paul Publications, Bandra, Mumbai, 1990; 5th print in 2011); . * Jesus: The Human and Humane Face of God. The Portrait of Jesus in Luke‚Äôs Gospel (The Bombay Saint. Paul Society, Bandra, Mumbai,2000).. With the encouragement and support of both the Bombay Provincial and the Provincial of South Asia, Fr. Francis returned to the Papal Seminary, Pune in June 2005 with this important 'assignment'. He has been primarily engaged in writing the Marathi Commentaries for the last eight years. He has been busy also with part-time work of being a spiritual guide to a good number of the Seminarians. So far, by the grace of the Lord he has been able to write five Commentaries in Marathi. They are of scholarly and scientific nature, but written in a simple, clear style so that even ordinary lay people can understand the message of the Word of the Lord. The five Commentaries are: * Gospel of St. Luke (Media Commission Prakashan, Diocese of Vasai, Jeevan Darshan Kendra, Giriz, Vasai, Thane Dist., Maharashtra, India, 2011); * Gospel of St. John (Media Commission Prakashan, Diocese of Vasai, Jeevan Darshan Kendra, Giriz, Vasai, Thane Dist., Maharashtra, India, 2013); * The Acts of the Apostles (Media Commission Prakashan, Diocese of Vasai, Jeevan Daeshan Kendra, Giriz, Vasai, Thane Dist., Maharashtra, India); * The Letters of St. Paul (Jeevan Darshan Prakashan, Diocese of Vasai, Giriz, Vasai, Thane Dist., Maharashtra, India, 2007); * The Book of Revelation (Media Commission Prakashan, Diocese of Vasai, Jeevan Darshan Kendra, Giriz, Vasai, Thane Dist., Maharashtra, India, (2013). Spiritual Experience It may be interesting to know that during the last 30 years or so, beginning with 1982, Fr. Francis has had a number of life experiences, moments of physical illness, which have in fact made him more happy, more peaceful and fruitful in the Lord. The words of St. Paul, \\"When I am weak, then I am strong; because Christ's grace and power take over\\" have been experienced by him on these occasions. The first was the massive heart attack in 1982, Then in 1993, he had a fall in the bath room at home in Vasai, and fractured his right femur and shoulder bone. The femur fracture, however, was healed miraculously. While he was recovering from the shoulder bone minor fracture, he had a mild stroke in May 1994. A year after that, when he was heading for another heart attack, he had a bypass surgery on 7 July 1995. Prior to that, he had an exceptional spiritual experience during the second half of May. He feels that for the greater glory of God something should be said about it. The following is an extract from the account of his \\"My Trinitarian Bypass Experience\\" (2007):This is an unpublished material. Taken from personal notes. :\\"One afternoon, after siesta, I was standing in the passage outside the small chapel. I was not actually praying. But suddenly I was carried in the spirit to the front part of our big Seminary chapel, outside, where there stand two pillars and a canopy-like concrete structure. In the open space there about twelve feet above the floor was a huge luminous sphere, shining with a brilliant, 'divine' light and splendour. And I was taken up into this sphere. I looked up; and I saw the three persons of the Blessed Trinity: the Father, the Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. I could perceive them distinctly. They appeared to be seated. It did not occur to me to see how they looked or what the surroundings were. But they were all bathed in the glow of diving light, splendour and holiness. They were all looking at me, smiling with love and affection; they seemed to be pleased with me. I felt so happy to be in their company. Then they said to me: ‚Äú Francis, we are going to have a bypass operation for you; and we will bring you back to your original condition of health which you had before your heart attack in November 1981‚Äù. I felt very glad, and said with a grateful heart: ‚ÄúPlease see that I behave as a good boy in response to this grace!‚Äù And the vision disappeared suddenly. I felt deep peace and consolation. I thanked the Triune God for this. :What struck me was the fact that so far in my prayer usually my heart and mind was directed to the Risen Lord Jesus. Sometimes I also directed my attention to the Father as well as to the Spirit. But all this practically always to the three persons ‚Äòindividually‚Äô and ‚Äòseparately‚Äô. Yet, today was the first time that I was taken to the three persons of the Blessed Trinity together, on their own initiative! It was not even in the act of my being at my personal prayer. :Then after a couple of days, at the same time in the afternoon, more or less in the same place, I was suddenly taken up to the presence of the Three persons exactly as on the previous occasion. They said the same thing; I responded with the same words; and the vision suddenly disappeared. I felt, once again, deep peace and joy within my heart.Ignatius of Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, Louis J. Puhl (ed), Loyola Press, 1968, :Then after a day or two, suddenly the same vision took place. Once again, I felt immense joy and peace in my heart with deep sense of gratitude.This is very similar to the experience the founder of the Society of Jesus had. See Ignatius of Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, Louis J. Puhl (ed), Loyola Press, 1968, :Since the same vision took place three times, I began to wonder if it was not perhaps a subjective imagination on my part, though in my heart of hearts I felt certain about the truth of the episode. I felt I should share this experience with some spiritually discerning and holy person. Hence I went to Fr. Lionel and told him the whole story. He listened to me carefully and finally said that it appeared to be an authentic spiritual experience. I thanked him and told him to keep it to himself. ‚Ä¶. :The bypass operation went off most smoothly. In fact, when they were getting ready to take me to the operation theatre, I had a distinct feeling that my whole being was being enveloped by the divine presence of the Triune God. One of the doctors, Dr. Nirmala, who visited me after the operation, and who happened to be in the operation theatre during my operation said, \\"Father, I wish we had patients like you\\". Then she added, \\"Usually during the operation, when we prick the body of the patient, it 'reacts' as if to resist; but your body was, so to say, offering itself to be completely at our disposal during the operation\\". I knew where the secret lay. Quietly in my heart I thanked my Triune God for His tremendous love and goodness‚Ä¶‚Äù From 2003 Fr. Francis has been suffering from a serious vertigo problem which still troubles him. And more recently, in April 2008 he had a severe stroke, A year after that came the prostate operation. In all these experiences, he sincerely feels that it has been the power of the Lord which has made him bounce back through all these ailments. And with all these limitations, his life has gone on as usual: the writing of the Marathi Commentaries on NT Books, Spiritual Guidance of Seminarians and others, etc. The Person In the perception of the staff and students in the Papal Seminary:Papal Seminary Newsletter (2012‚Äì2013), Pune, India, p.3. * \\"Fr. Francis has been an effective spiritual director for so many young seminarians. He has guided them through proper direction and given them the message of love and intimate relationship with the Lord. Many bishops, provincials of both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs Congregations have also profited from his spiritual guidance. Though he has dedicated his priestly ministry mainly to the formation of young seminarians, he has special love for the laity. This is evident when Fr. Francis gets visitors young and old from far and wide. As a person he is lovable, kind, understanding, outgoing, compassionate, and prayerful. Fr. Francis is always in the hearts of young seminarians. Many of his students still cherish the old memories of Fr. Francis and visit the Papal Seminary, the ‚Äòhome of love‚Äô. Many of his students are holding high positions like cardinals, archbishops, bishops and VGs and good priests and religious in the church of India and the church at large. For him a priest is a man of God, a man for others; someone who aims at being ‚Äòfully human in Christ‚Äô.\\"Lionel Mascarenhas, Unto New Horizons, Pune: Papal Seminary, 2005, p. 34. The Future According to a recent decision of the Jesuit Superiors, all the Jesuit professors in the Common Houses of Formation in India are supposed to return to their respective Provinces after their retirement at the age of 65. So Fr. Francis also, now 81, is going back to his Bombay Province in May 2013. He goes to Vinayalaya, Andheri,See http://en.CatholicCommons.org/Vinayalaya_House_of_Retreats where he hopes to do more or less the same type of work he has been doing at the Papal Seminary.

How to solve problems where there is an explicit time dependence is an open subject nowadays. For problems of this kind it is of importance to look for constants of motion or invariants. For the (time dependent) harmonic oscillator it is possible to write several invariants, among them, the Ermakov‚ÄìLewis invariant which is developed below. The time dependent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian reads : \\\\hat{H} =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\hat{p}^2+\\\\Omega^2(t)\\\\hat{q}^2\\\\right]. It is well known that an invariant for this type of interaction has the form : \\\\hat{I}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hat{q}}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) ^{2}+(\\\\rho\\\\hat{p}-\\\\dot{\\\\rho}\\\\hat{q})^{2}\\\\right], where \\\\rho obeys the Ermakov equationV.P. Ermakov, Univ. Izv. (Kiev) 20, 1 (1880) : \\\\ddot{\\\\rho}+\\\\Omega^{2}\\\\rho=\\\\rho^{-3}. The above invariant is the so-called Ermakov‚ÄìLewis invariant. It is easy to show that \\\\hat{I} may be related to the time independent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian via a unitary transformation of the form : \\\\hat{T}=e^{i\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\rho }{2}(\\\\hat{q}\\\\hat{p}+\\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{q} )}e^{-i\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\rho}}{2\\\\rho}\\\\hat{q}^{2}}= e^{i\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\rho}{2}\\\\frac{d\\\\hat{q}^2}{dt}} e^{-i\\\\frac{\\\\hat{q}^{2}}{2}\\\\frac{d\\\\ln\\\\rho}{dt}}, as :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\hat{p}^2+\\\\hat{q}^2\\\\right]=\\\\hat{T}\\\\hat{I}\\\\hat{T}^{\\\\dagger}. This allows an easy form to express the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the time dependent Hamiltonian. The first exponential in the transformation is the so-called squeeze operator. This approach may allow to simplify problems such as the Quadrupole ion trap, where an ion is trapped in a harmonic potential with time dependent frequency. The transformation presented here is then useful to take into account such effects.

With 3,420 employees the company generated a turnover of ‚Ç¨917 million in 2017.Diehl Stiftung & Co. KG: Annual Report 2017 Diehl Metall produces semi-finished products, forgings and rolled products, high-precision stamped parts with plating technologies as well as Schempp+Decker press-fit zones and metal- plastic compound systems. The company provides material development and production, sheet metal forming and forging technology as well as plating, press-fit, overmolding and assembling technology completely in-house.  History   Years of foundation  In 1902 Margarete, n√©e Schmidt (August 25, 1880, in Nuremberg), and Heinrich Diehl (born August 3, 1878, in K√∂lschhausen, died in Nuremberg) established an art foundry in Nuremberg. In 1914 they began producing rods and drop-forged parts which were launched at the Geuderstrasse site in Nuremberg. In the next few years a metal producing plant and a modern extrusion press for the production of rods and tubes were constructed. In 1930 Karl Diehl, only son of Margarete and Heinrich Diehl, joined the parents‚Äô company. He took on the metal processing company shortly before Second Worldwar. In 1938 they began building a new plant for semi- finished products at R√∂thenbach an der Pegnitz.  Historic years  During World War II, major parts of the plant facilities were destroyed by air raids and almost the entire company's equipment was dismantled. On the basis of remaining presses, furnaces and machine tools, Diehl started to reconstruct its facilities. The foundry was converted from light to heavy metal. In 1951 the setup of a 3,500-ton press took place. Diehl Metall started the production of synchronizer rings in 1956. The company acquired Sundwiger Messingwerk KG in Hemer and became a manufacturer of rolled products. During the next years Diehl Metall built a new tube plant including a 1,600-ton press and established the first continuous dual-string casting plant for brass, with an annual capacity of 47,000 tons. In 1973 Diehl do Brasil Metal√∫rgica was formed by Diehl Metall in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. From 1974 until 1984 the drop forge was expanded, another tube press was installed, a dust filtration system for the foundry was constructed and increased by the \\"Demag Continuous Casting System\\". In 1977 the so-called \\"Schumag hall\\" was set up. In 1981 a new strip rolling mill at Sundwiger Messingwerk was erected. In 1985 heat recovery systems were installed in the foundry. At the same time the laboratory building at Diehl Metall Messing was extended. In 1990 Diehl Metall took part in a pilot project by the \\"Berlin Department of Environment\\" and set up a new dust filtration system. In 1988, in Shenzhen, north of Hong Kong/China, a slitting and service center was established. Diehl Metall Schmiedetechnik was relocated to new facilities.  New headquarters of Diehl Metall  In 1999 R√∂thenbach an der Pegnitz became the headquarters of the corporate division Diehl Metall. One year later Diehl Metall took over The Miller Company (US).  Company expansion  In 2002 Karl Diehl retired from the company and his first-born son Werner Diehl undertook his position as chairman of the board. In 2003 Diehl Synchro Tec Manufacturing (Wuxi) Co. Ltd. was established in China. In 2006 Diehl Metall took over OTB Oberfl√§chentechnik in Berlin and formed Diehl Power Electronics S.A.S. in France. One year later, the company took over Diehl Aug√© D√©coupage in France. In 2009 Diehl Metal Applications GmbH (DMA) with locations in Germany, France and China was established, the subsidiaries of Diehl Metal Applications being Diehl Metal Applications GmbH (Location Berlin), Diehl Metal Applications GmbH (Location Teltow), Sundwiger Messingwerk (Hemer), Diehl Aug√© Decoupage (Besan√ßon), Diehl Power Electronic (Siaugues), Diehl Metall (Shenzhen). One year later Diehl Metall took over Zehdenick Innovative Metall- und Kunststofftechnik GmbH (ZIMK), which is also a subsidiary of Diehl Metal Applications. The DMA product development was established in 2011 and is involved in the development of the electrification of drive trains and the bonding of battery cells.9.12.2011 In 2012 Diehl took over the Schempp & Decker Pr√§zisionsteile und Oberfl√§chentechnik GmbH in Berlin. In the same year Diehl Metal India Pvt. Ltd. was established in India.

Children of Dreams was the second original operetta written especially for the screen by Oscar Hammerstein II and Sigmund Romberg. This team had previously worked on the musical Viennese Nights, which had proved to be a success. The film had the misfortune of being released at a time when the public had grown weary of musicals and did poorly at the box office. It was the only full-scale musical to be released in the summer of 1931. Although Children of Dreams was filmed in color and exhibited in a few select areas in color, Warner Bros. decided to circulate black-and-white prints in many areas as a cost saving measure due to the backlash against musicals.The Technicolor version of the film played in Naples, New York according to The Naples-News Wednesday, October 28, 1931 Page 30; available here Plot One day, Molly Standing (Margaret Schilling) is picking apples in her father's apple orchard in California, with her friend Gertie (Marion Byron), when they meet two boys, Tommy Melville (Paul Gregory) and Gus Schultz (Tom Patricola). Molly falls in love with Tommy while Gertie falls in love with Gus. They plan a double wedding. Gerald Winters and his mother, who are wealthy art patrons, hear Molly singing, and, at Gerald's suggestion, since he is very attracted to her, they sponsor her to study in Italy. Molly is reluctant to go but finally accepts when she discovers her father is in need of money. She leaves on the day that Tommy had hoped would be their wedding day. He says goodbye to her before attending Gertie and Gus's wedding ceremony. Molly becomes a success in Rome. She returns to the United States to sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where she is again a great success. After the performance, Tommy attends the party which has been given by Gerald and his mother. Molly asks Tommy to sing, but her society friends do not think much of his singing. Realizing that Molly now lives in a world far apart from his, Tommy breaks off his engagement and returns to the orchards. Molly stays in New York for two years and then moves on to San Francisco for a concert stop. Although she is supposed to marry Gerald soon, she is unhappy. She goes to her father's orchards to visit her old friend Gertie, to see how things are going with her. She happens to run into Tommy, and they rekindle their love and are married. Before they leave on their honeymoon, the doctor (Charles Winniger) informs Molly's manager and Tommy that Schilling has lost her voice and will never sing again, except perhaps, a lullaby.

Buccal administration may provide better bioavailability of some drugs and a more rapid onset of action compared to oral administration because the medication does not pass through the digestive system and thereby avoids first pass metabolism. As of May 2014, the psychiatric drug asenapine; the opioid drugs buprenorphine, naloxone, and fentanyl; the cardiovascular drug nitroglycerin; the nausea medication Prochlorperazine; the hormone replacement therapy testosterone; and nicotine as a smoking cessation aid were commercially available in buccal forms, as was midazolam, an anticonvulsant, used to treat acute epileptic seizures. Buccal administration of vaccines has been studied, but there are challenges to this approach due to immune tolerance mechanisms that prevent the body from over-reacting to immunogens encountered in the course of daily life.

As a historian, he is considered a hack, borrowing material from other books and rewriting them under his pseudonym, then publishing and marketing them under the Crouch imprint. Though he was the type of writer/publisher denounced in the following century by writers such as Samuel Butler (Prose Observations) and Alexander Pope (The Dunciad), more recent assessments of his life and career see him as an important figure in the development of historiography, especially in the popularization of a hitherto high-culture genre of discourse. Crouch was one of the authors who covered the 1655 Whitehall Conference to consider the resettlement of the Jews in England (the other being Henry Jessey). The report is found in the 1719 edition of his Two Journeys to Jerusalem. It is different from Jessey‚Äôs version in two respects: firstly it actually names the participants and secondly it includes some anti-Semitic additions to the conclusions of the conference.Crome, Andrew (2014). The Restoration of the Jews: Early Modern Hermeneutics, Eschatology, and National Identity in the Works of Thomas Brightman. Springer. . Around the date September 30, 1681, an unlikely forerunner of Readers' Digest, called Historical Rarities in London and Westminster was first published by Crouch. Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) elaborated: \\"With probably little education, but something of a natural gift for writing, Crouch had the sagacity to see that the works of the learned, from their form and price, were kept within a narrow circle of readers, while there was a vast multitude outside who were able and willing to read, provided that a literature suited to their means and capacities was supplied to them. He accordingly set himself the task of transfusing large and pompous books into a series of small, cheap volumes, modestly concealing his authorship under his nom de plume. Thus, he produced Surprising Miracles of Nature and Art, and many other treatises on very plain paper, and sold [them] at an exceedingly reasonable rate. His enterprise and diligence were rewarded by large sales and considerable wealth.\\" References Category:1630s births Category:English printers Category:English booksellers Category:English historians Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:17th-century printers Category:17th-century historians ","title":"Nathaniel Crouch"},{"id":"39022235","text":"Silverbridge Harps Gaelic Football Club () is a Gaelic football club in southern County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

Origins and recording Faith asked the Gibbs to write a new songs after he heard the Bee Gees' third LP Bee Gees' 1st, and certainly got what he asked for, a psychedelic rock song with intriguing lyrics. The backing band are The Roulettes, according to the notes on The Two Best Sides of Adam Faith, an LP collection on the EMI Records. According to the liner notes on Bee Gees Songbook (CD) the guitar is played by Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac. The backing vocals are the Gibb brothers and Robin singing with Faith on the bridge section. The song was recorded in August 1967 inside a little studio in Denmark Street Faith talk about \\"Cowman, Milk Your Cow\\": Barry agreed with Faith's admission that the Gibbs were a hard act to follow vocally and expressed frustration that performers of the Gibb's work didn't possess the same degree of extrasensory perception that the brothers claim plays an important part in their collective writing process.

His mother was Pomponia Decharis and he was adopted at a relatively young age into the gens Alleii, his original family name being Maius, and it is possible that his mother was a freedwoman. His mother was buried in the tomb of Eumachia, a wealthy and influential woman in the town, which suggests a close connection between the Alleii and Eumachia family. Allieus Maius may have been a beneficiary in the will of Eumachia.Pompeii, A Sourcebook by Alison E Cooley and M G Cooley  Political career  Allieus Maius enjoyed a very successful career in local Pompeian politics, having been elected aedile, duumvir and quinquennial duumvir (in 55 A.D.) before the age of forty. He gained wide popularity among the public through his sponsorship of gladiatorial games and many notices pertaining to the shows he sponsored have been uncovered during the excavations at Pompeii: At the dedication of (Ocella) of the opus tabularum of Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, at Pompeii on 13 June, there will be a procession, hunt, athletics, and awnings. Good fortune to Gnaeus Alleius Maius, the leading games-giver.  Business career  After he had exited public life, Alleius Maius concentrated on his private business interests and on the evidence of his private sponsorship of games, his palatial home, which is among the largest single properties in the town, and notices advertising rental properties, he was extremely successful financially. It is known that one of his businesses involved the leasing of residential and retail properties to tenants as among the surviving notices is the following advert: To let from July 1. In the insula Arriana Polliana, property of Cnaius Alleius Nigidius Maius, commercial/residential units with mezzanines, quality upper floor apartments and houses. Agent: Primus, slave of Cnaius Alleius Nigidius Maius. The fact that this sign was painted shortly before the eruption of Vesuvius that buried Pompeii, also indicates that Allieus Maius was still alive up to that date. It is not known whether he survived the catastrophe.Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius ‚Äì Welcome to Pompeii, VI.6: Insula Arriana Polliana, University of Virginia  Priesthood  Allieus Maius and his daughter were also prominent in religious circles in Pompeii. One of the surviving notices refers to him as 'Priest (or Flamen) of Caesar Augustus' which might refer either to the Emperor Claudius or Vespasian, the title suggesting a position of some eminence. His daughter Alleia was also a public priestess and may have had a statue dedicated to her in the Macellum, which was the town's market building.  The House of Pansa  Unfortunately much of the decoration of his large home (also known as The House of Pansa) was destroyed in the eruption. However its size, location and layout indicate that it was one of the finest homes in the town. It was located near to the Forum almost directly opposite the Forum Baths, and it occupied an entire city block. The exterior, ground floor sections of the house were rented out as shops and the first floor as residential units. Allieus Maius and his family occupied the extensive ground floor, which featured an impressive atrium, multiple bedrooms (cubicula), several dining or recreational rooms and a peristyle featuring sixteen Ionic columns. The rear of the property had a veranda which overlooked an extensive garden area.The House of Pansa ‚Äì Welcome to Pompeii, VI.6: Insula Arriana Polliana, University of Virginia The peristyle of the House of Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius (also known as The House of Pansa) in the ruined city of Pompeii  References   External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20100215093300/http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~jjd5t/region- vi/pansa/domus.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20080918081140/http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~jjd5t/region- vi/pansa/nigid.html Category:People from Pompeii (ancient city) Category:Ancient Roman merchants Category:1st-century Romans ","title":"Alleius Nigidius Maius"},{"id":"39022452","text":"The Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda was created on 25 April 1922 from the northern part of the former Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu, serving the territory of what is now Rwanda.

Since December 2014 it is operating between Hamburg-Altona and Budapest Keleti. The train's name, ' (; ), is the Latin word for the point where the Elbe river begins its passage through the ƒåesk√© St≈ôedoho≈ô√≠ (Central Bohemian Uplands or Bohemian Central Uplands). From 1993 to 2003, a predecessor train of the same name ran between Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and a number of different termini in northern Germany. Route The train takes the route via Berlin Hbf, Dresden Hbf, Praha hl.n., Brno hl.n. and Bratislava hl.st. A sister train named Jan Jesenius, composed of Hungarian and German rolling stock, is running two hours earlier from Budapest and two hours later from Hamburg. History In May 1993, there was a major reorganisation of the international train services through the Elbe valley. It involved the introduction of four daily EuroCity expresses. Two existing trains, the Hungaria (Budapest‚ÄìHamburg) and the Vindobona (Vienna‚ÄìBerlin) were upgraded to become EuroCity services, a new train, the EC Comenius (Prague‚ÄìBerlin), was added to the timetable, and the Porta Bohemica replaced another existing train, the Primator (Prague‚ÄìBerlin). All of these changes took effect from 23 May 1993.\\"International Services from May 23\\" (changes taking effect). Thomas Cook European Timetable (May 1‚Äì22, 1993 edition), p. 3; also pp. 74‚Äì75, 532. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. Initially, the Porta Bohemica ran between Praha-Hole≈°ovice in Prague and Hamburg-Altona in Hamburg. The northbound train, EC 176, was the last of the four daily northbound Elbe valley EuroCity services to leave Prague, in the early afternoon. The southbound train, EC 177, left Hamburg shortly after 08:00. On 27 May 1995, the northern terminus of the Porta Bohemica was moved south, to Nauen, Germany (on the northwestern outskirts of Berlin), and the southern terminus in Prague was switched from Praha-Hole≈°ovice to Praha hl.n.. On 24 May 1998, the northern terminus was moved back to Hamburg, and in 2001 it was moved even further north, to Westerland (Sylt), also in Germany. At the end of the following year, in December 2002, it was moved yet again, back to Hamburg for the second time. On 14 December 2003, all of the EuroCity trains running through the Elbe valley lost their names. Trains EC 176/177 continued to run without names for three years until 10 December 2006. But when the naming of the Elbe valley EuroCity trains was reintroduced, the name Porta Bohemica was not reused. From 14 December 2014, a two-hourly clock-face schedule was introduced between Prague and Budapest, alternating with a railjet between Prague and Graz every other hour. This meant that the EC 172/173 Vindobona was replaced by the EC 172/173 Porta Bohemica Hamburg-Altona‚ÄîBudapest Keleti. The connection in Praha to a Railjet via Wien Hauptbahnhof to Graz Hauptbahnhof and vice versa includes an hour of layover. Formation (consist) The train is currently hauled between Hamburg and Dresden by a DB Class 101 locomotive, between Dresden and Prague by a ƒåD class 371 locomotive and between Prague and Budapest by a ƒåD Class 380 locomotive. It is composed of rolling stock of the Czech Railways, one first class open coach Ampz143, one dining car WRmz815, five second class compartment coaches Bmz241/245.

The resulting circular or oval pieces of veneer are laid side by side in furniture to produce various decorative patterns. Because the shape formed resembles an oyster shell the technique acquired the name of oyster veneering.Antique terms  History  This technique is likely to have been developed by English cabinet-makers in the 1660s, immediately after the Restoration of the monarchy, first being used on furniture such as the cocuswood cabinet on stand which bears the cipher of Queen Henrietta Maria, constructed in c.1661-65, and now at Windsor Castle. Early oyster veneered cabinets were invariably in cocus or kingwood. Contemporary longcase clock cases were similarly veneered. By around the early 1670s softer and more cheaply available woods such as olive and walnut began to be used for oyster veneering, the fashion for such furniture becoming widespread and also spreading to Holland by around the mid-1670s. Oyster veneering fell out of fashion from c.1710. The chest illustrated here, if it is not a later reproduction, therefore appears to be an unusually late example.

Born on a farm in Oxford County, Ontario, he was one of thirteen children of Francis Patterson and Annie (Telfer). He matriculated to the University of Toronto, graduating in 1900 with a B.A. in engineering, and was awarded a 1851 Exhibition Science Research Scholarship to study physics for his M.A. at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. There he performed studies of thin metallic films and their electrical properties, ionization of the air, and the variation of electrical resistance of metals when exposed to magnetic fields. Patterson traveled to India in 1903 where he served as professor of physics at the University of Allahabad, until in January 1905 he was named imperial meteorologist to the Government of India at Simla. On January 1, 1906, he was married to Margaret Norris, a medical practitioner and professor of obstetrics working in India. The couple would have two children, one of whom died in India. With John suffering from ill health, the couple left for Toronto with their son Arthur in 1910. He became a physicist for the Canadian Meteorological Service, where he was responsible for organizing a pilot program for performing upper air observations using balloons. In 1912 he was placed in charge of the newly formed department of physics at the Central Office in Toronto. During the First World War, he worked for the British Admiralty to perform an experiment in extracting helium from natural gas. Following the war, he was involved in designing a new barometer and was responsible for developing the 3-cup anemometer now in widespread use. In 1925 he became assistant director of the Meteorological service, then in 1929 he was named director (controller), succeeding the retiring Sir Frederic Stupart. Patterson would hold this post until his retirement in 1946. He was elected to serve as president of the American Meteorological Society during 1930‚Äì31 and president of the Royal Canadian Institute in 1932‚Äì33. In 1954, the Patterson Distinguished Service Medal was created in his honnor and attributed to him..

Gary Heidt at the Knitting Factory, Brooklyn, January 9, 2013. Photo by Jordan Hollander.  Biography and Career  Heidt was described as a \\"hyper-productive experimentalist\\" with a \\"Janus-figure element\\" to his work on the fringes of music, writing and visual art. Heidt was born in Houston, Texas. From 1986 to 1988 he was lead singer for Devil Donkey, which also included Susie Ibarra (drums), Erik Amlee (guitar) and Enrique Gualberto Ramirez (bass). In 1991 he cofounded the Mammals of Zod with Raymond Seraphim Porter, Scott Wilcox and Chris Grace. At Columbia College he was Station Manager of WKCR-FM from 1992 to 1993. In 1992 his experimental poem cycle \\"Moo Goo Gai Pain\\" was published in D. R. Heiniger's Private Arts. In 1994 he moved to Austin, where he produced the Mammals of Zod CD Kill The Humans which Village Voice critic Richard Gehr dubbed a \\"masterpiece.\\" He returned to NYC and started an improvising collective using the name Mammals of Zod; core members included beatboxer Kid Lucky, Mem Nahadr, Sabir Mateen, Daniel Carter, Lipbone Redding (then known as CitiZen One), Emmallyea Swon- Young, Matthew Heyner (of the No-Neck Blues Band), Gary Miles and Ira Atkins. This group played frequently at clubs in NYC in the late 1990s, including CBGB's, The Cooler, The Continental, ABC No Rio and The Pyramid. Heidt posed shirtless for Paper Magazine's 1998 \\"Beautiful People\\" issue. During this period Heidt also wrote the columns \\"From the Priest Factory\\" and \\"The Gnostic Eye\\" which ran in the Religious Observer and its successor, Deolog. With CitiZen One and Metal Tiger Technologies, Heidt started the 67-year performance project Lovesphere in 1996 with a 36-hour improvised musical at the Museum of Sound Recording. Metal Tiger Technologies streamed the entire piece on the Web in a very early implementation of this technology. Four tracks from this event formed the core of the second Mammals of Zod CD, L'of. \\"With multi-instrumentalist Gary Heidt as unofficial ringleader, it's an enclave that draws upon improvisation and performance art as a means to promote its socio-musical vision.\\" In an interview with the East End Beacon, 'Mr. Heidt describes LoveSphere as ‚Äúa sphere inscribed in time in an embroidery of sound which can only be witnessed from a higher dimension. However, we can see its stitches.‚Äù' From 2003 to 2005 Lovesphere presented musical theater, which Heidt cowrote with Gary Miles, Nathan Metz et al., including \\"Feng Shui Assassin.\\" Lovesphere 21 (and subsequent festivals) took place in Greensboro, North Carolina and featured Lawrence \\"Lipbone\\" Redding, Mark Engebretson, and guitar virtuoso Eugene Chadbourne. Of Lovesphere 23, critic Lauren Barber wrote, \\"the 23rd annual Lovesphere (is a) creative-arts performance project devised to usher in the vernal equinox... one of the festival‚Äôs core values (is) deep listening.\\" Heidt wrote three librettos for composer Evan Hause's Defenstration Trilogy. Heidt's \\"engrossing \\" script for the second opera, Nightingale: The Last Days of James Forrestal \\"reflects, in accurate historical detail, on the political backstage manoeuvres that led to Forrestal's fall and on the dark side of his death....and can be considered a new chapter of its reception.\\" Poems appeared in Intervalsss: The poems and Words of Musicians (ed. Steve Dalachinsky) and his first published crossword poem in John M. Bennett's Lost and Found Times. He worked as a theater administrator for Crystal Field's Theater for the New City and Barbara Vann's Medicine Show. In 2003 he joined Imprint Agency, a literary agency in New York City. After a stint at Peter Rubie's FinePrint Literary Agency he started Signature Literary Agency with Ellen Pepus. He represents the Church of the SubGenius, Charles Yu, Benjamin Whitmer, Jeremy Bushnell, William Gillespie, Rob Klara, Jason Henderson and Chris Carter among others. In 2006 Heidt was canonized by the Church of the SubGenius.  Visual Poetry  In 2010 Fence published four more of his crossword poems, poems that can be read both across and down. Heidt gave a talk on alternate poetic forms in Spring of 2011 at the New York Public Library. In 2013 Infinity's Kitchen published \\"The Wordsquare,\\" a historical analysis of his predecessors in this art form, including the Formists and their successors the recreational linguists. Heidt showed an exhibit of crossword poems constrained by images at Spirols Gallery in Saugerties, NY in 2015. \\"Some of Heidt‚Äôs poems look a little like the letters from an intense game of Scrabble or a crazed crossword rendered on a canvas, hand-drawn (some blocky and dark, some wispy and tiny) ‚Äî like the colorful cells of a Chuck Close portrait, where each component functions like a square on a grid, making a big mosaic-like picture of letters and words, one that you can look at as writing or as an image, depending on your distance and frame of mind,\\" said Winston-Salem critic John Adamian. A second show, Skull Form, took place at the Code Gallery in Greensboro in 2018. Lauren Barber wrote, \\"His poems lay within 23-by-29 letter grids, the single-word titles at the summit of the crown and the body of the text descending into the shadowy caverns of eye sockets toward the closed mandible, following whatever path the beholder‚Äôs eyes take. The experience is a bit like a choose-your-own-adventure story... The remarkable precision of finer-lined letters is juxtaposed with bold, somewhat frenzied lettering where shadows fall. What is striking about Heidt‚Äôs skull-based series is this tension between systems and anarchy; he devises a scrupulously ordered chaos the viewer instinctively seeks to make meaning of ‚Äî this, through a form simultaneously universal and individual.\\"  Fist of Kindness  Heidt is a member of NYC band Fist of Kindness, \\"a country-inflected ensemble that defies convention by throwing in the odd fifth note into its arrangements,\\" and performs and wrote all of the songs on their three albums, The Dead and the Powerless (2010), Ponderin' with the Fist of Kindness (2011). The Thirteen Repentances of the Pistis Sophia (2012) included songs by Cassandra Chopourian. Fist of Kindness released two albums in 2015; the lyrics for all 16 songs on Electric Objects are adapted from the writings of Gertrude Stein, while Chopourian wrote the songs on The Beast Within. Fist of Kindness has been described alternately as \\"an art rock ensemble masquerading as a country western band\\" and as \\"edgy literate Tom Waits-ish alt-country rockers.\\" Composer Noah Creshevsky used samples from The Dead and the Powerless to create his composition \\"The Kindness of Strangers.\\" Tender Buttons With Cassandra Victoria Chopourian, Heidt started creating performances from Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons in 2010. They performed parts of this opus in London and the sister cities of Leipzig, Germany and Houston, Texas; as well as New York City and Jersey City. Heidt also composed music for the Van Reipen Collective's Shelly's Spherical Journey, which was first presented as part of Lovesphere 15. TENDER BUTTONS: OBJECTS FOOD ROOMS premiered at Theater for the New City in October 2014 on the centennial of the publication of its source text. The five-hour performance was divided into three parts; Heidt was dramaturg for all three and director of OBJECTS. Heidt staged OBJECTS as a comic operetta for 12 performers. OBJECTS was set inside a human aquarium populated by incestuous gentlepeople, a well-trained nursing staff, an AWOL soldier and his amphibious fianc√©e. Heidt's treatment of the text emphasized kabbalistic-phenomenological themes and the ongoing exorcism of patriarchy. Critic Lana Adler claimed that 'aided by the melodious, sometimes folksy, sometimes ambient, and sometimes ecstatic live music (arranged by Fist of Kindness) and the skilled, nuanced, and passionate singing and movement work of the actors, the viewer moves into what is at once a deeper and more vague process of experiencing the performance as it comes at them. This aim, it could be argued, is shared by all devotedly cubist work.' Stein scholar Karren LaLonde Alenier called OBJECTS \\"a troubadour-like entertainment where... music-making, song-singing, odd choreography kicked my subconscious into another realm.\\" Perceiver of Sound League To incorporate a legal entity for Lovesphere, Gary Heidt incorporated Perceiver of Sound League as a religious organization under the laws of New Jersey. Heidt started a Perceiver of Sound League concert series at Glenwood Community Bookshop in Greensboro with a concert by Sanders Davis, a Crystal Bright sideman, in December 2015. The series continues the third Saturday of every month at 4pm. Heidt also hosts a Perceiver of Sound League radio show on radio station WUAG (and sometimes WQFS) playing music by idiosyncratic American originals like Sun Ra, Conlon Nancarrow, John Cage and Ornette Coleman. in Greensboro.

Salunke and Annasaheb Saluke, was an Indian actor who performed female roles in early Indian cinema and also a cinematographer. He is credited as the first person to perform as a heroine in Indian cinema when he played the role of Rani Taramati of King Harishchandra in Dada Saheb Phalke's first full-length film, Raja Harishchandra (1913). In 1917, Salunke became the first to play a double role in Indian cinema, by playing the roles of both the hero and heroine in Lanka Dahan. Career Salunke portrayed the heroine in Raja Harishchandra (1913), the first full- length Indian feature film. He played the role of Queen Taramati, the consort of king Harishchandra, whose tale is told in Hindu mythology. Salunke worked as a cook or waiter in a restaurant on Grant Road, Mumbai, frequented by Dhundiraj Govind Phalke (Dadasaheb Phalke), the director and producer of the film. Phalke could not find a woman who agreed to act in the film; even prostitutes and dancing girls refused. Phalke saw Salunke, who had an effeminate figure and slender hands, and convinced him to play a female role. While Salunke was working for a monthly salary of 10 rupees, Phalke offered him 15 and Salunke agreed. Salunke also acted in Phalke's Lanka Dahan (1917), played in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Salunke played the first double role in Indian cinema, by playing both the male role of the hero Rama and the female role of his wife Sita, the heroine. However, Salunke had developed a more muscular physique by then, and the audience could see his biceps even as he played the goddess Sita. Salunke also acted in Satyanarayan (1922) directed by V.S. Nirantar and Phalke's Buddha Dev (1923). He was also the cinematographer on both films. Later, Salunke abandoned his acting career and fully concentrated on cinematography. Besides Nirantar and Phalke, he worked with G. V. Sane (who acted with Salunke in Raja Harishchandra) and Ganpat G. Shinde (co-starred with Salunke in Lanka Dahan) as directors. The last of his films as cinematographer were in 1931.CITWF Films Salunke, during his film career spanning 18 years from 1913 to 1931, acted in various films including five in the female role, most of them were on Hindu mythological themes.

Party-list purge The Commission on Elections (Comelec) purged the parties participating in the party-list election from almost 200 parties in the 2010 election to just over 100. However, most of the disqualified party-lists successfully got restraining orders from the Supreme Court to retain their names on the ballot. On April 6, 2013, the Supreme Court changed its earlier ruling on what are the criteria set for joining in the party-list election to a more liberal interpretation. With this, the court gave back the cases of the disqualified parties to the Comelec for consideration under the new interpretation.

The electoral divisions were the same as those used at the previous election in 2009. No elections were held in North Lincolnshire or North East Lincolnshire, which are unitary authorities outside the area covered by the County Council. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term- time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Summary The election saw the Conservative Party lose overall control of the council. The party previously enjoyed a sizable majority, holding around three quarters of the seats. After the election, the Conservatives found themselves 6 seats short of an overall majority; the UK Independence Party was the council's second biggest party, with 16 seats. Since the election the Conservative group have negotiated a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, whereby there is one Liberal Democrat cabinet member. UKIP replaced the Liberal Democrats as the council's official opposition. UKIP lost six of its councillors to defections shortly after the election, and as a result Labour now form the official opposition.

It is also the main shareholder of Conexus Baltic Grid, a unified natural gas transmission and storage operator in Latvia. History On 15 October 1939 the ƒ∂egums power plant and the first substation in Riga start operation. This day is considered as the beginning of AST. AST was a part of Latvenergo. On 2 January 2012, it was unbundled from Latvenergo and the Ministry of Finance of Latvia became the sole shareholder of AST. In December 2017, AST bought from Uniper Ruhrgas International and Itera Latvija 18.31% and 16.05% stakes in Conexus Baltic Grid, a natural gas transmission system operator in Latvia, for ‚Ç¨57.394 million. Operations AST operates Latvian power systems with voltages of 110 kV and above, which is leased from Latvenergo. Its overall strategic goal is to ensure the security of electricity supply of Latvia, to provide a continuous electricity transmission service.Augstsprieguma tƒ´kls Separate Annual Report 2018 Latvia and the Baltic states have historically operated in synch with the electric power systems of Russia and Belarus. The origins of the idea to synchronise with the European grid go back as far as 2007, when the prime ministers of the Baltic states proposed the idea of investigating this possibility. The synchronisation of the Baltics with the European electric power networks is planned for 2025. AST plans to invest ‚Ç¨445 million in the Latvian power transmission system in 2018-2027. In 2018, it invests ‚Ç¨89.05 million, of which ‚Ç¨62.1 million will be spent on implementation of the third stage in construction of the Kurzeme Ring power transmission line and ‚Ç¨4.25 million in construction of the third power interconnection between Estonia and Latvia. Corporate issues In 2017, the company had a turnover of ‚Ç¨158.86 million and a profit of ‚Ç¨309,244. In August 2018, the share capital of the company was increased up to ‚Ç¨63,139,313 by converting the loan of ‚Ç¨57.394 million for purchasing share in Conexus Baltic Grid into the share capital. AST reached 4.7 million euros in 2018, of which 3.6 million will be paid as dividends to the state; the remaining amount will be invested in the fixed assetsfor implementing development projects.

(28 June 1874 ‚Äì 31 January 1945) was a Catholic priest who was Vicar Apostolic of the Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda, in what is now Rwanda, from 1922 until his death in 1945. During his time as a missionary priest and then bishop a great many Rwandans were converted to Christianity. Classe was influential in persuading the Belgian colonial administration to favor the Tutsis as a ruling caste in the country over the Hutu majority. Early years L√©on-Paul Classe was born on 28 June 1874 in Metz, France. When he was aged six his family moved to Paris. For his secondary education he attended Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet and then the junior seminary of Versailles. He went to the major seminary of Issy-les- Moulineux to study philosophy. In 1896 he was accepted into the White Fathers (Society of the Missionaries of Africa). On 31 March 1900 he was ordained a priest by L√©on Livinhac, the Superior General of the Society. Several months later he was sent to John Joseph Hirth, Vicar Apostolic of Southern Nyanza, as an assistant. Missionary Classe was one of the first two missionaries to be sent to Rwanda. The ruler, King Musinga, was at first hostile to his mission. Later, Classe was allowed to make many converts. In Rwanda he helped found the missions of Nyundo and Rwaza (north). In 1907 Hirth named him delegate vicar general in Rwanda., On 12 December 1912, Jean-Joseph Hirth was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of Kivu, which covered modern Rwanda and Burundi. Hirth named Classe his vicar general in Rwanda. Classe was an admirer of the Tutsi elite, whom he considered natural rulers of the country. In Classe's view, the political structure of Rwanda was much like the feudal structure of the Middle Ages in Europe. As a presumed expert on the country, his 1916 paper on the political organization had great influence on the thinking of the Belgian administration, which came to support the leadership position of the Tutsis. In 1920, when the territories of German East Africa were being divided by the victors of World War I, there was debate between the Belgians and British over the boundaries of Rwanda. The Belgian colonial authorities asked Hirth for a study of the effect of ceding part of the east of the country to the British, and Hirth delegated the task to Classe. Classe gave his work to the colonial authorities before leaving Rwanda for Algeria on 20 August 1920. His work, full of praise for the unique African country with its Tutsi aristocracy, was submitted as a memorandum to the British in March 1922. It was influential in preventing the partition of the country. Bishop Classe was recalled in 1920 due to disagreements among the missionaries over how much they should be involved in politics. In Europe his superiors became fully confident in his capability, and his assistance in the question of the eastern boundaries gained him the support of the Belgian colonial ministry. The Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda was created on 25 April 1922 from the northern part of the former Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu, serving the territory of what is now Rwanda. Classe was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Ruanda on 10 April 1922, and on 26 April 1922 was appointed Titular Bishop of Maxula Prates. Classe remained a committed supporter of the Tutsi ruling class. In a letter to the resident Belgian commissioner on 21 September 1927 he said that the young Tutsis would be a great help in helping the colony advance. The Hutus would much rather receive orders from the Tutsi nobles than from commoners. In 1930 he again said that suppressing the Tutsi caste would cause great damage, leading to anarchy and viciously anti-European communism. The Tutsis were intelligent, active, and able to understand progressive ideas. Classe played an important role in the deposition of Yuhi V Musinga in 1931 and in the choice of his successor, Mutara III Rudahigwa, who was a Catholic catechist at the time. By 1943 all but two of the fifty-two chiefs of Rwanda were Christian. That year Classe baptized King Mutara III Rudahigwa in a ceremony attended by the chiefs. Classe designed many of the church buildings in Rwanda. He died in Bujumbura, Burundi, on 31 January 1945 and was succeeded by Laurent-Fran√ßois D√©primoz. He was interred in the cathedral of Kabgayi.

The book covers both sides of the story ‚Äì the Allied arguments over how to interpret intelligence concerning the status and existence of the V-weapons and the German debate over how to deploy the new weapons to make the most of their supposed capacity to reverse the tide of the war. During his research for the book, Irving discovered that the Allies had broken the German Enigma code, over a decade before that became public knowledge, but agreed to keep it secret. The Mare's Nest was well received by reviewers and those involved in Operation Crossbow and has been widely cited by authors writing about the V-weapons programme, even after the eclipse of Irving's reputation as a result of his Holocaust denial. Publication history The book was Irving's second, published the year after his best- seller The Destruction of Dresden, and had its origins in the success of that book. Irving had intended to return to studying for a degree but abandoned his plans when his publisher proposed that he should write two more books, covering the V-weapons programme and the life of Adolf Hitler. He discovered that Winston Churchill's scientific adviser, Lord Cherwell, had been closely involved in tracking the V-weapons and that Cherwell's papers were held at Nuffield College, Oxford. Irving was given full access to the archive and made a startling discovery: that the Allies had been reading the German codes, a fact that was still regarded as top secret. He began to fear that he would be denied access to the archive if the authorities realised that he had uncovered ULTRA, the Allies' wartime programme of descripting the Enigma machine codes and other German codes and cyphers. As he later put it, he resorted to doing \\"the unthinkable. I began borrowing documents, taking them down to London to copy. But I always sedulously returned them.\\"Guttenplan, p. 44 Irving nonetheless worked the secret material into his book, writing an entire chapter about Enigma in the first draft of The Mare's Nest. When it came to the attention of the authorities, \\"one night I was visited at my flat by men in belted raincoats who came and physically seized the chapter. I was summoned to the Cabinet Office, twelve men sitting around a polished table, where it was explained to me why [the information] was not being released and we appeal to you as an English gentleman not to release [it].\\" Irving cooperated and withdrew the chapter, but by this time he had copied enough material from Cherwell's archive to furnish several more books. ULTRA remained secret for another decade. The book's title comes from a phrase used by Lord Cherwell to describe the V-weapons; he was sceptical of the existence of the V-2 rocket, regarding it (wrongly, as it turned out) as technologically infeasible, and referred to it as a \\"mare's nest\\" (meaning a remarkable discovery which later turns out to be illusory). Reception The book was well received at the time by reviewers. Writing in The Economist, William Kimber called it \\"remarkable\\" for its coverage of both sides, Allied and German. He concluded that the book shows that the British reached the right conclusions, despite errors along the way, while the Germans hindered their own efforts with disputes between the army, air force, SS and civilian ministers. The Times noted that the book highlighted how the hunt for the V-weapons was punctuated by \\"conflicts of personality between scientists, intelligence officers, and Service leaders\\", while at the same time conveying \\"the efficiency of the British Intelligence Services at the lower level\\" even if the higher-level co- ordination was sometimes lacking. The Guardian's Clare Hollingworth noted that the book \\"provides some excellent quotations from intelligence documents, both British and German, as well as sketches of Peenem√ºnde and of the [V-2 rocket]\\" and suggested that \\"perhaps scientists or soldiers engaged in rocketry\\" would find it useful. William Connor, under his pen-name Cassandra in The Daily Mirror, called it \\"one of the most fascinating books I have read for a long time\\". Duncan Sandys, who had chaired the Crossbow Committee responsible for co-ordinating the Allied response to the V-weapons, called it an \\"authoritative account of the V-weapon offensive\\" in his review for the London Evening Standard. He commended the author for having \\"successfully woven [his research] together into a coherent narrative, written in a brisk style\\", though he faulted Irving for having relied too heavily on Lord Cherwell's papers, with the result that he had treated \\"the problem as primarily one of scientific intelligence and [paid] insufficient attention to other more important aspects of the operation.\\" Nonetheless, Sandys concluded, \\"students will find in The Mare's Nest a mine of important information, while much wider circles will enjoy David Irving's vivid presentation of a strange story.\\" The book has been widely cited by authors covering the V-weapons programme. Even after Irving's reputation was destroyed after his exposure as a Holocaust denier, Michael J. Neufeld of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum has described The Mare's Nest as \\"the most complete account on both Allied and German sides of the V-weapons campaign in the last two years of the war.\\" References External links * Category:1964 non-fiction books Category:Books by David Irving Category:English-language books Category:History books about World War II Category:V-weapons ","title":"The Mare's Nest"},{"id":"39023320","text":"Adrian Leftwich (1940 ‚Äì 2 April 2013) was a white South African student leader active in the early 1960s in the anti-apartheid struggle. He came to Britain, where he was a prominent academic in the politics department at the University of York. Anti-apartheid activism in South Africa Leftwich was educated at the University of Cape Town where he was active in student politics. For two years, 1961-1962, he was president of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) which opposed the government's apartheid policies.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/adrian-leftwich- leading-anti-apartheid-activist-who-turned-state-witness-8633563.html The scholar and author R.W. Johnson heard Leftwich speak at a NUSAS meeting and recalled almost sixty years later that \\"he spoke with a charm and a power that I have seldom seen equalled\\". Johnson, R.W. 2020. Foreign Native. Jonathan Ball Publishers, Cape Town. After leaving his NUSAS office Leftwich became involved in radical underground opposition to the regime. He became best known for turning state evidence against his comrades in a 1964 bomb plot with the African Resistance Movement (ARM). He and a small group of fellow students blew up a Cape Town suburban railway signal cable after which he was detained on 4 July 1964. He collaborated with the police under threat of torture, and other members of the movement were arrested and imprisoned. Leftwich was released and allowed to go into permanent exile in the United Kingdom. While some of those arrested maintained bitter resentment against Leftwich, others made efforts to reconcile with him. Stephanie Kemp, who spent time in jail for her involvement in the bombing, stated on her Facebook page that she had \\"gone through a painful journey of reconciliation with him over 12 or more years. He was the same person, although he could never forget his fall almost 50 years ago. I remember him for his courage in taking on the apartheid state at such a young age and his fortitude in bearing the notoriety of stumbling in the face of enormous state repression.\\" Author Hugh Lewin, who was also jailed for his role, wrote of his path to reconciliation with Leftwich in the book Stones Against the Mirror: Friendship in the Time of the South African Struggle. Later life In the UK, Leftwich worked on the politics of development, and was one of the foremost thinkers in the now increasingly popular political settlements approach to development, which sees deals between leading groups as crucial for effective development. He was research director of the Developmental Leadership Programme, which looks into the key roles played by leaders, elites, and coalitions in economic development. He noted that \\"development has also managed to come around in states that are run by corrupt elites - just as long as these elites are relatively less corrupt and as long as they are determined in the cause of development, independent of the special interest groups. Family and personal He died in 2013 of lung cancer, four months after diagnosis, leaving a daughter and a son, Benjamin Francis Leftwich.

() Can't Buy Me Like focuses on demonstrating to marketers how to build meaningful business returns in the Relationship Era by cultivating authentic customer relationships. The book was published in March 2013 by the Penguin Group. The book proposes that there is an ongoing shift in marketing from the Consumer Era, where marketers spin product advertising, to the Relationship Era, where companies who have a core purpose and who care about something other than selling products, sell more of their products. It indicates that the success of companies in the Relationship Era is based on authenticity, trust, and relationships.  Synopsis  Can't Buy Me Like is a narrative that proposes that the Relationship Era is a new direction for marketing and advertising and that a purpose is required for companies to succeed in the Relationship Era. The book is divided into an introduction, 11 chapters, and then an Authors' Afterword and Acknowledgements section. It is written in narrative format and includes case histories from large and small businesses, as well as public and proprietary data. It also includes graphics, charts, and step‚Äîby step instructions for succeeding in the Relationship Era. The book emphasizes the importance of purpose in the branding statements of companies. As indicated in the book's introduction, \\"At the most basic level, Can't Buy Me Like is a book about a simple truth: if you are still selling goods and services by blanketing the world with advertising, trying to persuade or entertain or flatter consumers into submission, you are doing things all wrong. Because the world has changed. A lot.\\"  Release and reception  Can't Buy Me Like was well received in the business and marketing fields.

The site was notified as an SSSI in 1985. The nearest settlement is the town of Sturminster Newton. The local planning authority is North Dorset District Council and Dorset County Council, but part of the site is managed by the Dorset Naturalists' Trust. Piddles Wood was first documented in the 13th century as Puttekwurth and Putteleswurthe. A \\"wurth\\" is an enclosure, and \\"Pyttel\\" was an Old English surname, so the name could mean \\"Pyttel's enclosure\\". However, another etymology is possible as \\"puttoc\\" is an Old English word for a kite, with \\"pyttel\\" or \\"piddle\\" also being used. It is also known as \\"Hanging Ground\\". The area of the site is . Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood is one of only a handful of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types‚Äîcaused by the underlying Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels‚Äîthe site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and coppiced hazel‚Äîfor which reason the site was listed as an SSSI‚Äîand its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset.

Zen, Chen, and Hu Shih August 1920 in Nanking Although Chen's family was from Hunan Province, she was born in Wujin, Jiangsu Province. Her parents encouraged her to follow the traditions of her extended scholarly family, but she could not find a school in which she could study formally. However, when she defied her father's choice for her husband, her paternal aunt took her in, tutored her, and found her a teaching position.Sophia Z.H.

Tsinghua University set up examinations in Shanghai to send students overseas for study on Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. She successfully passed the examinations in 1914, entering Vassar College to earn her BA in history and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. She then went to the University of Chicago for her master's degree in History. On a visit to Cornell University in 1916, she met Hu Shih, who was studying philosophy, and her future husband H. C. Zen (Ren Hongjun), who was studying chemistry. Returning to China in 1920, she taught Western history at Beijing University. Chen married Ren Hongjun on September 27, 1920.

Role in the New Culture Movement and later career The trip to Cornell in 1916 to meet her future husband and Hu Shih was a turning point for her. When the group of friends was drenched in a sudden downpour while rowing on Lake Cayuga, Ren composed a long poem in classical Chinese which Hu criticized for using \\"dead phrases of three thousand years ago\\" for such an everyday event. Chen and Hu took part in a \\"great pen war\\" over the use of classical Chinese. Chen's short story \\"One Day,\\" based on college life at Vassar, was published in Chinese Students' Quarterly, and is known as the first short story in modern vernacular Chinese.Stacey Bieler, Patriots Or Traitors: A History of American Educated Chinese Students (Armonk, NY: M.E.

He is the elected Guardian of the Society of the Holy Trinity, Woolwich Area Mission Enabler in the Diocese of Southwark and the Priest in Charge of the Church of St Lukes Camberwell in Peckham. Mobsby is the former Priest in Charge of the Guild Church of St Mary Aldermary in the City of London and the former missioner to the Moot Community. Mobsby has a background in the Emerging Church and in particular New Monasticism and as an associate missioner of the Fresh expression Initiative. He is completing PhD ethnographic and theological research exploring the spiritual but not religious as a social grouping through the Archbishop's Examination in Theology.  Biography   Early life and education  Mobsby was born in the heady days of the late 1960s, with a family inheritance of atheism and socialism on his mother's side and science, the arts and banking on his father's side. At an early age he took to music, which became a key motif to his life, particularly with the classical guitar and violin. He also had a love of nature and has described in his writing how this opened up the experience of spirituality in nature.\\"God Unknown: The Trinity in contemporary spirituality and mission\\", (London:Canterbury Press, 2012), 1‚Äì9 He trained for a BHSc (Hons) in occupational therapy at York St John University which was formally part of the University of Leeds at the time. It was while studying in York that Mobsby became a committed Christian, largely through an alternative worship project then called Warehouse and now called Visions.  Vocation and ministry  Mobsby completed an MA in Pastoral Theology validated by Anglia Ruskin University and taught through the Cambridge University's Cambridge Theological Federation part-time whilst still working split between Occupational Therapy and working as a lay pioneer. At the end of training, he was released from the Southwark diocese to be involved in forming a new missional and fresh expression of church at the Church of England church called St Matthew's Westminster in the Diocese of London. He was ordained by the Bishop of London to serve a training title with St Matthew's, Westminster and the Moot Community. In the second year of his curacy and work with Moot, Mobsby met with the new Archbishop's Missioner the then Revd Steven Croft now Bp of Oxford, where he was formally invited to become an Associate Missioner of the new Fresh Expressions initiative. At the same time Mobsby completed his MA research dissertation, Emerging and Fresh Expressions of Church, how are they authentically Church and Anglican?. Mobsby has founded several new monastic communities that include the Wellspring Community Peckham and the Moot Community, drawing heavily on a contemplative and sacramental basis to the Christian faith which seeks to promote a focus on following Jesus and in particular live out the marks of mission in how the community lives.Anglican Marks of Mission Both the Wellspring Community and Moot Community have become leading new monastic communities in the UK. In 2011 Mobsby was co-opted onto the Church of England's Advisory Council for the relations between Diocesan Bishops and Religious Communities to help this Anglican body discern a way forward to recognise New Monastic Communities as Acknowledged Religious Communities.Advisory Council After a lengthy period of discernment Mobsby was the first elected Guardian of the newly constituted Society of the Holy Trinity, a new Society for the promotion of Anglican & Epsicopal missional new monastic communities in the UK and beyond.  Theology  Mobsby has written about the Holy Trinity as the ultimate source of his theology and missiology. Phyllis Tickle stated: Mobsby makes connections between God as an event of grace, and a happening to inform his understanding of God and God's salvific purposes for all people, as God seeks to restore all things back into right relationship with the divine.

Movie collectibles career Hershenson began his career in movie posters in 1990, when auction house Christie's offered to sell some of his collection. He conducted an annual movie poster auction at Christie's for the following eight years, grossing between $1.5 million and $2 million each year. By 1998, Hershenson's customers and friends were increasingly suggesting he try selling his merchandise using online auction company eBay. Hershenson was skeptical of the company's value in selling rare collectibles. eBay became a public corporation in September 1998, and in 1999, Hershenson decided to begin posting some of his items on the auction company's website. Hershenson believed that some eBay sellers sold their vintage collectibles for much more than their fair market price, due to high fixed prices and less knowledgeable buyers. Unlike these sellers, Hershenson instead began each of his auctions at $2.99, hoping to build a loyal customer base. In the first 6 months he lost money, selling items for much lower than their market value. At the end of 2001, Hershenson had posted his first online major movie poster auction, which grossed $776,000, with each piece selling for an average of $1,000. In 2008, after selling approximately 330,000 vintage movie posters on eBay, Hershenson began selling exclusively on his own website, eMoviePoster.com, due to an objection with changes to eBay's rules and increases in their listing fees.eCommerce Bytes InterviewBusinessweek As of 2015, Hershenson's website reports an increase in sales each year, with just over $4 million in 2012, and an average of over $5 million per year in 2013 through 2016.eMoviePoster.com Sales By Year In December 2013, the website sold a one-sheet poster from The Grim Game starring Harry Houdini for $67,166, a new world record at that time for a Houdini poster (movie or magic).Grim Game Posterhttp://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2013/12/houdini-grim-game-poster-sets- new.html Other professional activities Hershenson had been a professional poker player in the 1970s and early 1980s, and won the Seven Card Stud event in the 1979 Super Bowl of Poker and the Seven Card Razz event in the 1981 World Series of Poker.Hendon Mob Poker Player DatabasePokerPages Player Information Starting in the early 1980s, Hershenson traded stock options on the floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange until shortly after the stock market crash of 1987, when he left the stock exchange in search of a more stable business.Scoop interviewEntertainment Weekly Hershenson published three comic books by Steve Ditko, The Avenging World in 1973, Wha !?! in 1974, and Mr. A #2 in 1975.Grand Comics Database References External links * eMoviePoster.com Category:Living people Category:American businesspeople Category:American poker players Category:World Series of Poker bracelet winners Category:Super Bowl of Poker event winners Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Bruce Hershenson"},{"id":"39023563","text":"Do Del () is a village in Gevar Rural District, Sarduiyeh District, Jiroft County, Kerman Province, Iran.

During his career he was convicted for mail fraud, for which conviction he received a presidential pardon after serving some months in jail. Biography He was a son of William T. G. Morton, whose name is connected with the first anaesthetic use of ether. He was educated at the Boston Latin School, Harvard University and in Vienna. On his graduation there, in 1872, his thesis on ‚ÄúAnaesthetics,‚Äù gained him the Boylston Prize. He practised medicine at Bar Harbor, Maine, and in Boston. He went to Kimberley, South Africa, where, besides practising his profession, he engaged in diamond mining. Settling in New York City, he became editor of the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. From 1882 to 1885, he was adjunct professor of nervous diseases at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School, served as neurologist to the New York Infant Asylum, 1887‚Äì90, and was afterward professor of nervous diseases and electrotherapeutics at the New York Post-Graduate School. As an authority in electrotherapeutics he won wide recognition, and by his mechanical device for establishing the ‚Äústatic induced current‚Äù of electricity ‚Äî the ‚ÄúMorton current‚Äù of the scientific world ‚Äî supplied a means for producing the X-ray, a service of great practical value to medicine and surgery. Indicted in January 1912, in association with Julian Hawthorne and others, on a charge of fraudulent use of the mails in the promotion of bogus mining companies, conviction followed nearly a year after. He was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, but was released in October 1913, pardoned by the president and reinstated in his profession.

It houses 69 lofts, townhouses and studios, and is located next to the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA). Mariza, a restaurant, opened in 2013.  History / Architecture / Graffiti  The Rice Mill Lofts building is a 108,000-square-foot structure originally built in 1892, and was once home to the largest rice mill in North America. Entrepreneur Sean Cummings purchased the building in 1993, but did not begin renovations until March 2010. In the meantime, the building was heavily vandalized. When the $20 million renovation began, Cummings decided to keep much of the original graffiti, including a large mural on the exterior building with the words \\"You are Beautiful,\\" which is rumored to have been created by British street artist Banksy. The remodeled building was designed and developed by Sean Cummings and Anthony \\"T.J.\\" Iarocci, in association with New Orleans architect Wayne Troyer and Los Angeles interior designer L.M.

April 7, 1725) is an English-born American merchant and attorney prominent in the early history of Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey during the colonial period. He was the father of colonial politician and plantation owner Edward Antill (1701-1770) and grandfather of Lt. Colonel Edward Antill (1742-1789) who served as an officer in the Continental Army notably at the Battle of Quebec (1775). Antill was born on 20 March 1658/1659Because of the Old Style/Julian Calendar that began on April 1, by the New Style/Gregorian Calendar, Antill's birth year would be 1659. in Richmond, County Surrey, England.Van Duesen, Mary S. Edward Antill the 1st. Retrieved April 5, 2013. Antill rose to prominence as an attorney and a merchant importing goods and slaves from the West Indies in the late seventeenth century. In the 1680s was apparently opposed to the administration of New York and New Jersey under the Dominion of New England, Sir Edmund Andros as he had considerable connections with Jacob Leisler who later overthrew the Andros government and deposed Francis Nicholson, Andros's Lieutenant Governor during Leisler's Rebellion in 1689. Leisler appointed Antill to his provincial council, but Antill was forced to flee after facing arrest for this involvement with Leisler. The hostilities between Antill and Andros originated years earlier. Andros had previously charged and tried Philip Carteret, the first governor of New Jersey in 1677 for riot‚Äîa trial in which Antill participated in some capacity. The trial was political in nature, as Carteret refused to give up his position as governor when demanded by Edmund Andros, Governor of New York. In response, Andros sent a raiding party to Carteret's home and had him beaten and arrested. He was acquitted at trial but the attack caused permanent injuries that led to his death in 1682. Antill was close to Carteret in the colony's affairs, and later inherited a significant portion of the estate of Carteret's widow. On November 20, 1686, he purchased one quarter of a one-twenty-fourth part of the East Jersey colony from David Toshack, the Laird of Monibaird. This propriety interest formerly belonged to James, Earl of Perth.New-York Historical Society. \\"Abstracts of Wills Liber 10 page 42\\" in Collections of the New York Historical Society for the year 1893. (New York: New-York Historical Society, 1894). Antill was among the proprietors who signed the documents surrendering East Jersey to the Crown in preparation for Queen Anne's uniting East Jersey and West Jersey into a Crown colony in 1702. His exact date of death is not known as his will was written in 1704 but not probated until 1725. It is thought that he died when his son Edward (1701‚Äì1770) was young, due to his son's adoption by pirate Giles Shelley.The Morris Family: Edward Antill 17 Jun 1701 - 15 Aug 1770. Retrieved January 26, 2013.Will of Giles Shelley, filed February 19, 1710, in Abstracts of Wills on File in the Surrogate‚Äôs Office, City of New York, Volume 2, 1708-1728. in Collections of the New York Historical Society (Volume 26). (New York: New York Historical Society, 1894). It is thought because of his name disappears from the legal history of New Jersey and New York that Antill died in or shortly after 1704.

The theater opened in 1927 at 213 Federal Plaza West and exhibited films until closing as a movie house in the early 1970s. On October 20, 1974, a night club called the Tomorrow Club opened in the old theater. Under the Tomorrow Club name, the venue hosted such bands as AC/DC, KISS, Rush, Ted Nugent, The Ramones and The Runaways. Most notably the club played host to The Ramones' first gig outside of the New York City metro area on July 20, 1976. This was also the gig where Joey Ramone was introduced to future members of the Dead Boys who later moved to New York City to set up shop as the house band at CBGB. The Tomorrow Club closed on December 22, 1978 and the venue opened as the Youngstown branch of the Agora concert hall chain on December 31, 1978.The Youngstown Agora continued to book popular rock acts until it closed on July 23, 1982. It reopened under the State Theater and Civic Center name in May 1983, but it closed abruptly again in July 1983. The theater booked heavy metal and hard rock acts under the Star Theatre name from 1984 until early '86 before being bought by a group interested in turning the theater into a showcase for R&B;, blues, jazz, hip-hop and soul groups in late 1986. The venue struggled under the Starr Palace name and closed for good in late 1988. The State Theater remained vacant until it was demolished in 2008. Only the facade remains.

Metals that can be found in powder form include aluminium powder, nickel powder, iron powder and many more. According to Belmont Metals, their design engineers are turning to metal powders because of the benefits such as cost effectiveness, versatility, and quality. There are four different ways metals can be broken down into this powder form: * Direct Reduction * Gas Atomization * Liquid Atomization * Centrifugal Atomization  Processes  # Direct reduction is where you blend carbon with iron oxide ore, heat it up, remove the sponge iron form the carbon, grind it, anneal it, and the regrind it to make it the powder form usable for manufacturing. # Gas Atomization is where a molten metal is passed through a passage way to a gas filled chamber that cools the metal, and as it falls it is collected and annealed into a powder that is right for the customer. # Liquid Atomization is similar to gas atomization but instead the metal is sprayed with high-pressure liquid which solidifies the droplets in a more rapid manner. This results in the powder being more porous, smaller, and cleaner. # Centrifugal Atomization is when a metal is put into a chamber as a rod and electrically melted, at the end of the rod, to produce melted droplets that fall into another chamber and them solidified.  Types and Uses  * Aluminum powder: Fireworks, metallic paints, manufacturing in solar cells in the green energy sector * Bismuth powder: production of batteries, welding rods, creating alloys * Cadmium powder: glazed used on ceramics, transparent conductors, nickel-cadmium batteries * Iron powder: magnetic and magnetic products, printing, brake pads, certain types of dyes and stains * Nickel powder: useful for corrosion resistance like in the marine industry See also *Powder metallurgy *Pressing and Sintering References Category:Metals ","title":"Metal powder"},{"id":"39023861","text":"Anthony \\"Tony\\" Albright (born April 2, 1962) is a Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives.

His work included civic, educational, commercial, and residential buildings, many of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and feature a wide variety of architectural styles. Early life and education Joseph Royer was born in Urbana on August 2, 1873. He attended Urbana High School and then attended the University of Illinois, graduating with a degree in civil engineering in 1895. Professional career From 1898 to 1906, Royer worked as Urbana's city engineer. As the city engineer, he designed the Champaign County Courthouse, which brought him local recognition for the first time. In 1905, Royer formed an architecture firm named Royer and Brown, that was later named Royer and Smith; Royer, Danely, and Smith; and Royer and Davis. The firm continued successful until Royer's death in 1954, with approximately 100 projects attributed to it. Personal residence In 1905, Royer designed his own house, located in Urbana at 801 W. Oregon Street, that he would live in for the rest of his life. It is an eight-bedroom mission style house, thought to be inspired by the \\"California Building\\" at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. Next to this house, Royer designed a house to be built in 1923 for his mother-in-law, in English cottage revival style.

Bred and originally campaigned in Yorkshire he won two of his three races as an unnamed three-year-old in 1791. On the day after his classic victory he defeated an unusually strong field of older horse to become the first St Leger winner to also win the Doncaster Cup. In the following year he was sold, renamed and raced mainly in Scotland, winning a further five races (including three walkovers) before the end of his racing career. Young Traveller does not appear to have been used as a breeding stallion. Background Young Traveller was a chestnut horse sired by King Fergus out of an unnamed daughter of Young Trunnion. He was bred, and originally owned and trained by John Hutchinson of Shipton, North Yorkshire. Hutchinson began his career as a stable lad before using his earnings in a brief, but lucrative career as a jockey to set himself up as a trainer. He later became one of the leading owners and breeders in the north of England, being associated with many successful horses including Hambletonian and Beningbrough. The name Traveller had previously been used for a leading racehorse and stallion of the mid 18th century and for a successful racehorse bred by Hutchinson in 1785 and later sold to the Prince of Wales. It seems likely that the St Leger winner was named in imitation of the latter horse. Racing career 1791: three- year-old season Until 1913, there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names, and the horse who later became known as Young Traveller (and Lauderdale) competed in 1791 as Mr. Hutchinson's ch. c. by King Fergus . The unnamed colt began his racing career on 1 June at York Racecourse where he finished third behind Roman and Rosalind in a sweepstakes over one and a half miles. Hutchinson's colt was still without a name when he was one of eight three-year-olds to contest the St Leger over two miles at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by John Jackson he won the classic from the favourite Huby, a colt owned by Giles Crompton. The winner's odds were not recorded. On the following day, the colt was matched against older horses in the Gold Cup, the eight-runner field for which included four St Leger winners: Hutchinson's colt, Ambidexter (1790), Pewett (1789) and Spadille (1787) the favourite. The nameless colt won the race from Spadille, with Ambidexter fourth and Pewett seventh. Although he had never raced under the name, Hutchinson's colt appears to have become known as Young Traveller before the end of the year. 1792: four-year-old season Before the start of the 1792 season Young Traveller was sold to H. Hamilton Esq and sent to compete in Scotland. On his way north he ran at Newcastle Racecourse in June and recorded walkover wins in two races when no other horse appeared to oppose him. A week later he arrived at Lamberton in the Scottish Borders where he walked over for another race, this time under his new name Lauderdale. Lauderdale had his first competitive races of the year at Edinburgh Racecourse in July. He first ran in a King's Plate, a race scheduled for a series of four-mile heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. Lauderdale settled the event by winning the first two heats from Mr Baird's mare Laura, his only opponent. On the following afternoon he won both heats of a 50 guinea race, beating Baird's horse Ratler. Lauderdale's last recorded race was a 50 guinea event at Kelso Racecourse in September in which he was opposed by Baird's mare Louisa. Lauderdale finished second to Louisa in the first heat, won the second, and was beaten by the mare in the deciding heat. Stud career Lauderdale/Young Traveller never appeared on the lists of stallions whose services were advertised in the Racing Calendar, and he has no offspring listed in the General Stud Book. He may have died of natural causes or been euthanised after his final race, although it is possible that he was gelded and used as a hack or hunter. Pedigree *Young Traveller was inbred 3 x 4 to Meynell, meaning that this mare appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 x 4 to the Godolphin Arabian.

League History  The idea for the league began in March 2011 amongst a small group of friends‚Äînone of whom had previous roller derby experience and who like many newcomers to the sport, had discovered roller derby after its popularisation from the 2009 film Whip It (film). The group began by learning basic skating skills in a small fitness studio in Coventry‚Äôs AT7 Centre. On 16 August 2011, the group (now 8‚Äì10 regular skaters) had their first official outing at the Goodwood Roller Marathon, under the name Coventry City Derby Dolls. Soon after, CCDD outgrew their original practice venue and began regular training sessions at Coventry Sports and Leisure Centre. Since 2011, Coventry City Derby Dolls have held several open intakes and, as of April 2013, have a membership of around 50 skaters.  League Structure  CCDD are a skater-run organisation. A committee of elected officers manages the league. These officers head up sub-committees in areas such as: Coaching, Referee Training, Head NSO, Merchandise Officer, Events Organisers, Social Media Officer, League Liaison, etc.  Coaching  CCDD have two dedicated Coaches: Head Coach and Club President Jon Scott (AKA Scott Jon DaRocks), and Newbie/Rookie Coach Paul Husiw-Aiken (AKA Hucifer), as well as a team of CCDD Referees who are trained under Head Referee Andy 'Psychotic' Hill. In addition to their in-house coaching team, CCDD have received valuable input and guest coach appearances from fellow Midlands roller derby teams: Crash Test Brummies, Central City Rollergirls and Birmingham Blitz Dames.  Bouts Played  CCDD made their public bouting debut 25/08/2013. It came from outer bounds was held at Coventry sports and leisure centre (Cov baths) against Oxford Wheels of Glory. Half time was called with a score of CCDD, 123 - OWG, 42. OWG made a good comeback in the second half bringing the bout to a nail biting conclusion of CCDD, 179 - OWG, 184. Coventry City Derby Dolls raised a total of ¬£273 with sales of cake and raffle tickets during the bout for the local charity Coventry Haven.  CCDD Mission Statement  \\"Our aim is to promote and foster the sport of Women's Flat Track Roller Derby within Coventry and the West Midlands. We are strong, diverse and competitive women, who practice good sportsmanship. We aim to instil a sense of loyalty, passion and sisterhood among our skaters, and build a sense of family amongst our organisation as a whole. We believe that with hard work, we can achieve anything!\\"  Events and Appearances Some of CCDD appeared at an interactive roller derby demo in Broadgate, Coventry, on 30 March 2013, where they were invited to participate in a game of human pinball as part of Coventry University‚Äôs Design Degree Show 2013. This event marked the first time roller derby had been seen in the city, drawing much interest from within the local community., Coventry Telegraph, 1 April 2013 As part of a grassroots fundraising drive, CCDD hosted a movie night at Taylor John‚Äôs House, Coventry, on 24 February 2013. Tickets were advertised via friends and social media in an effort to bring roller derby to a wider audience. The movie night featured the documentary ‚ÄòThis is Roller Derby‚Äô, along with a bake sale. CCDD members provided a talk at ‚ÄòRevolt‚Äô, a club night at Taylor John‚Äôs House, Coventry. During the talk, they promoted the league and sport as a whole, and even managed to recruit more members from the interest this generated.

Biography Pantaleimon was born to a Bulgarian family in 1793 in the Sudzhak village, near Adrianople (modern Edirne). The family was very poor and Panteleimon had since childhood worked in small shops. As child taught himself to read the Gospels. At this time a plague was raging in the country, every day, many corpses dispatched to the cemetery. Intimidation is the thought of the child's death fled the city and wandered through Thrace in search of a place where people had not died. To his inquiries about this place, all answered the same: \\"Everywhere, people are dying, a place where you could find protection from death, no.\\" But one old woman said to the boy that the monks of Mount Athos as if they were old, never die. Panteleimon immediately went to Mount Athos, where he asked to take a number of monks. Panteleimon was adopted by an old monk named Damascus, in the number of their students. One missed Panteleimon in the monastic life, he longed for frequent communion, however, the monks at the time took communion every forty days. In the Gospel reading Pantalaimon, \\"a man may eat it and not die\\" ( John 6:50 ), and \\"he who eats this bread will live for ever\\" ( John 6:51 ). Remembering the old fear that forced him to flee from Adrianople, the young man began to ask Damascus, whether these words are true and what kind of bread is it? At the time he lived in complete ignorance of the tenets of the faith, like most of the Bulgarian Orthodox Christians receive communion without knowing anything about the nature of this sacrament. After hearing from Damascus, under the guise of bread and wine hidden Savior, and that this ordinance gives humanity immortality, Panteleimon was trying Communion as often as possible. But monks laurels, noting that jealousy, began to condemn it, and eventually expelled him from the monastery. Pantalaimon took the communion in the one or the other monastery of Mount Athos. But it soon opened and angry monks first bound him in chains, and then completely banished from Mount Athos. Wandering Panteleimon requested communion in charity. Soon he began to join the supporters, which attracted his devotion and piety. Panteleimon gathered around his pupils, daily Communion was their rule, while they were traveling along the Sacraments in the chest following the example of the ancient Christians. Panteleimon followers lived in abject poverty, being content with bread and water, odivalis in rags and had no personal property. They carefully studied the Scriptures and the Creation of the Church Fathers. Soon after hearing about the sanctity of Panteleimon echoed throughout Thrace and Macedonia, the faithful flocked to him from everywhere. This popular movement aroused the envy of the Greek clergy, on the orders of Bishop Panteleimon of Adrianople was signed first in jail and then was held in different jails of the monastery of Mount Athos. Finally, after a long journey of persecution and Pantalaimon could find peace in his native Sudzhake, where he founded a convent, later he founded a monastery in Mostratli. At this time in Bulgaria gathered force the Uniate movement. Abbot of Saint Panteleimon, to which people flocked are initially hostile to this movement, not knowing how much of his countrymen, what is the Catholic Christians, and considering them heretics. But later, while in Adrianople, he was able to talk with the head of the Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church, Raphael Popov, and then he admitted the truth of the Catholic faith, and together with his monks and nuns, including 400 of them, they united to Catholic Church. Panteleimon joined the Catholic Church in December 1863. He had then seventy years old. After that, he lived for another 4 years, chased all the time by the Greeks for preaching the unity of the Catholic Church. Fourteenth day of October 1865, Pope Pius IX sent him a welcome and encouraging literacy. Pantaleon died as Catholic in Adrianople on 25 February 1868, and his body was buried in the same place, a huge crowd, and later his remains were moved to Sudzhaksky monastery when he is resting today.

He is the founder and CEO of Monster Inc. Lee graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and subsequently did work in laser fusion for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He quit his engineering job in 1974 to play drums for a country rock band. After the band separated, he founded Monster Cable Products in 1979, based on loudspeaker cables he invented and manufactured in his garage. Lee's audio cables met corporate resistance at first, because most audio cabling at the time was zip cord provided by audio vendors for free. Sales improved as retailers witnessed audio demonstrations and saw that his Monster-branded cables offered better profit margins than other electronics products. Lee is credited with building the Monster business and shaping today's audio components market.  Early life  Noel Lee was born in San Francisco, California on December 25, 1948 to Chein-San and Sarah Lee. His parents named him \\"Noel\\" because he was born on Christmas Day. His father worked for China's Central News Agency and Lee had four sisters. Lee's parents moved to San Francisco around the same time the Communist party took power. Lee took an interest in music as a child; he described himself as having a more diverse taste in music than other kids his age. Lee's senior project was an effort to improve the quality of audio from electronics. According to Lee, his high school experiences were \\"rough\\" due to the level of discrimination against Asian-Americans at the time. Lee attended San Francisco City College, then California Polytechnic State University, where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering in 1971. Engineer and drummer Noel Lee's first job out of college was as a laser fusion design engineer at a government-run nuclear research center called the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. On nights and weekends he played drums for an Asian country rock cover band called Asian Wood and worked on his home audio equipment. In 1974, Asian Wood was given an opportunity to go on a world tour. Lee quit his job as an engineer in order to be the band's drummer. Asian Wood's members moved to Hawaii to start their tour, but it was cancelled two weeks later. The promoter wanted a straight rock band without country influences. This left Lee and his family stranded in Hawaii until they could earn money for travel back home. The band reinvented itself, covering Top 40 popular songs in order to attract work. Asian Wood took on other gigs around Hawaii for 18 months before breaking up. Lee continued doing solo gigs for six months after that, before returning to the Bay Area for an engineering job with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He also worked as an independent salesperson for several small speaker companies in San Francisco.  Monster  Noel Lee is credited with turning the audio cable market into a \\"profitable cottage industry\\" and with changing the consumer mindset to see audio cables as a way to improve sound quality. He was awarded the Plus X Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in shaping a market and was named Northern California Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young. The company he founded became a household name and market-share leader. Monster does not disclose its financials, but industry analysts estimate the company is \\"hugely profitable.\\" Lee calls himself the \\"Head Monster\\" and calls the company culture the \\"Monster Attitude.\\" The company, while still best known for audio wiring, now carries 6,000 different products, such as headphones and home theater components. Its products are sold in more than 15,000 stores and it owns over 375 patents. Monster became one of the largest employers in the Bay Area. Origins In the late 1970s, Noel Lee wanted to improve the sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by improving inexpensive cabling. At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find an alternative to the zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Lee called the 12-gauge audio cable he created \\"Monster\\" due to its size. According to Vision Magazine, the first Monster cable was \\"a low- resistance twin-axial stranded design.\\" Lee manufactured the cable by hand on a ping pong table and sold it door-to-door. According to Lee, Pacific Stereo was the first electronics retailer to give him a chance to sell Monster cables in their store. Lee spent $50,000 in personal savings to demonstrate the cables at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago in 1979, using a borrowed portion of someone else's exhibit area. Lee received a positive response at the event and founded Monster, Inc. (formerly known as Monster Cable Products) later that year. Lee received an order from a Canadian distributor for 30,000 cables. The distributor wouldn't pay until the products were shipped, so Lee took out a $250,000 bank loan to pay for the production of the cables. According to Lee, he started the company without business experience or a strategy. Lee was met with resistance, because the audio industry at the time didn't believe cables made any appreciable difference in the sound and wire was generally provided for free. Lee demonstrated the difference between Monster cables and zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap wiring. Sales rose as retailers saw high profit margins selling the cables. Lee provided incentives to retail salespeople to sell the cabling, rather than spend money on advertising. Some critics say this practice creates aggressive salespeople. Establishment and diversification Within six years from when it was founded, Monster had $50 million in annual revenues and 400 employees. The company's growth was primarily due to Monster training sales staff at electronics stores to bundle the cables with other electronics purchases, an effort the company spent 15 percent of its revenues on by 1998. Lee kept the company private and grew the business, despite pressure to go public. In connection with his background as a musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine to collaborate on the Beats brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster had a role in the design of the headphones. Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed. In 2004, Lee bought the rights to the San Francisco 49ers football stadium, which was renamed to Monster Park. Citizens and local government protested that a public facility adopted a corporate name and a local ballot was passed to revert the stadium name after the four-year deal with Monster expired. The sponsorship was partially contentious due to a recent layoff of 120 local employees. Personal life Noel Lee is married with two children and two step-children. His son Kevin Lee, sometimes referred to as \\"Little Monster\\", started working for the company and developed the M-Design product line of high-tech furniture. Lee's son later quit Monster and started his own audio company Sol Republic in 2010. Lee has a degenerative nerve disorder that prevents him from walking without a wheelchair or Segway, which he says was caused by exposure to toxic doses of radiation when he worked as a fusion engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Lee enjoys collecting gadgets and has a collection of old sports cars. He enjoys socialising with musicians and counts Carlos Santana and George Benson among his friends. He is a member of the Asian Business League of San Francisco. He donated $75,000 worth of audio cables to the Los Angeles Unified School District. Lee describes his business ethic as \\"24/7; sleep when you're dead.\\" He lives in Hillsborough, California. Lee is also known for throwing large parties at the Consumer Electronics Show and spending time with celebrities at the event.

His main area of operations was in Damascus and its Ghouta countryside. He was killed in the struggle and is considered a hero by Syrians.Provence 2005, p. 119. As the qabaday (local youths boss) of the al-Shaghour quarter of Damascus, al-Kharrat was connected with Nasib al-Bakri, a nationalist from the quarter's most influential family. At al-Bakri's invitation, al-Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 and formed a group of fighters from al-Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity. He led the rebel assault against Damascus, briefly capturing the residence of French High-Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment. Towards the end of 1925, relations grew tense between al-Kharrat and other rebel leaders, particularly Sa'id al-'As and Ramadan al-Shallash, as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants. Al-Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta, where he was ultimately killed in a French ambush. The revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule. Early life and career alt=From left to right: A boy staring out from a store's window sill beneath which a lamb is walking by; three fully veiled women conversing on the street; beneath an olive grove jutting out of a large stone archway and beside a fountain, a man is walking, a woman is collecting water from the fountain, and two young boys are standing and smiling; a young girl walking on the street Al-Kharrat was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria.Moubayed 2006, p. 381. He served as the night watchman of the city's al-Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards.Batatu 1999, p. 117.Neep 2012, pp. 79‚Äì80. Damascus was captured by Arab rebels during World War I in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an Arab nationalist organization, emerged in the city to raise support for the rebels.Gelvin 1998, pp. 69‚Äì70. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir Faisal, who formed a rudimentary government. Al- Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour.Gelvin 1998, p. 75. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun.Khoury 1987, p. 97. Afterward, the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate. In the early years of French rule, al- Kharrat was al-Shaghour's qabaday (pl. qabadayat),Khoury 2006, p. 157. the traditional leader of a neighborhood's local toughs.Khoury 2006, p. 152. The qabaday was informally charged with redressing grievances and defending a neighborhood's honor against local criminals or the encroachments of qabadayat from other neighborhoods. He was popularly characterized as an honorable man, noted for his personal strength, and protection of minorities and the poor.Khoury 2006, p. 154. The qabaday was considered an \\"upholder of Arab traditions and customs, the guardian of popular culture\\", according to historian Philip S. Khoury. Khoury asserts that al-Kharrat was \\"probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day\\". Qabadayat normally shunned formal education, and historian Michael Provence maintains that al-Kharrat was likely illiterate. Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods. Al- Kharrat was allied with Nasib al-Bakri, a Damascene politician and landowner. The al-Bakri family was the most influential in al-Shaghour, and al-Kharrat served as the family's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter.Provence 2005, p. 101. Commander in the Great Syrian Revolt Recruitment and early confrontations A revolt against French rule was launched in mid-1925 by the Druze sheikh (chieftain), Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, in the southern mountains of Jabal al-Druze. As al-Atrash's men scored decisive victories against the French Army of the Levant, Syrian nationalists were inspired and the revolt spread northward to the countryside of Damascus and beyond. Al-Bakri was the chief liaison between al-Atrash and the emerging rebel movement in Damascus and the Ghouta. The Ghouta is the fertile plain surrounding Damascus,Neep 2012, p. 131. and its orchard groves and extensive waterways provided cover for the rebels and a base from which they could raid Damascus. In August, al-Bakri convinced al-Kharrat to join the uprising. According to Provence, al-Kharrat was \\"ideal\\" for the job, possessing \\"a local following of young men, notoriety outside the quarter, good connections and a reputation for toughness\\". The group of fighters he commanded was known as ‚Ä≤isabat al-Shawaghirah (the band of al-Shaghour). Though named after al- Kharrat's quarter, the band included twenty qabadayat and their armed retinues from other Damascus neighborhoods and nearby villages.Khoury 1987, p. 174. His main areas of operation were in the vicinity of al-Shaghour and the al-Zur forest in the eastern Ghouta.Provence 2005, p. 118. Through his alliance with a Sufi religious leader, al-Kharrat brought an Islamic holy war dimension to the largely secular revolt, something that was not welcomed by some involved. alt=A group of rebels in traditional Arab dress posing with rifles with date palms in the background Al-Kharrat commenced guerrilla operations in September, targeting French forces posted in the eastern and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al- Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In the first week of October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters.Provence 2005, p. 100. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed. On 12 October, French troops backed by tanks, artillery and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest.Provence 2005, pp. 101‚Äì102. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter were unable to lure the rebels out and retreated. As the French withdrew toward al-Malihah, they looted the village and set it on fire. French intelligence officials justified the collective punishment of al-Malihah as retaliation for the rebels' capture and humiliation of the gendarmes during the previous week; the French claimed a young boy from al-Malihah had notified al-Kharrat's men of the French presence in the village.Provence 2005, p. 102. Though they were unable to engage al- Kharrat and his forces directly, French troops executed around 100 civilians from Ghouta villages. Their corpses were brought to Damascus, and the bodies of sixteen men described by the French as \\"brigands\\" were put on display. Battle of Damascus and operations in Ghouta alt=Close-up of the French High Commissioner of Syria, Maurice Sarrail Spurred by French army actions in the Ghouta, al-Bakri planned to capture the Citadel of Damascus, where French forces were concentrated, and the Azm Palace, where General Maurice Sarrail, the French high commissioner of Syria, would be residing on 17‚Äì18 October (Sarrail was typically headquartered in Beirut). The high commissioner functioned as the overall administrator of Syria on behalf of France and exercised practically absolute power. The rebel units active in Damascus at the time were al-Kharrat's ‚Ä≤isabat and a mixed force of Druze fighters and rebels from the al-Midan quarter and the Ghouta.Provence 2005, p. 103. To compensate for the lack of rebel strength, al-Bakri sent a letter to Sultan al-Atrash requesting reinforcements. Al-Atrash replied that he was currently occupied with operations in the Hauran, but would dispatch his entire force to back the Damascus rebels as soon as affairs there were settled. Before he received al-Atrash's reply, al-Bakri decided to move ahead with the operation. On 18 October, al-Kharrat led forty rebels into al-Shaghour from the old cemeteries adjacent to the southern gate of Damascus, announcing that the Druze had arrived to relieve the city from French occupation. Crowds of residents enthusiastically welcomed the rebels, and many took up arms alongside them. Al-Kharrat's men captured the quarter's police station, disarming its garrison. They were joined by Ramadan al-Shallash, a rebel commander from Deir ez-Zor, and twenty of his Bedouin fighters. The joint forces proceeded to the Hamidiyya Market and captured the Azm Palace,Moubayed 2006, p. 382. but Sarrail was not present, having already left to attend a meeting in the Hauran town of Daraa. The rebels plundered the palace and set it on fire. Provence asserts that capturing the palace without Sarrail \\"held no tactical importance\\" but was a highly symbolic achievement for the rebels because of the Azm Palace's \\"importance as the historical seat of economic and political power in Damascus, now usurped by the French and totally undefended\\". While al-Kharrat captured the Azm Palace, al-Bakri and 200 rebels under his command rode through the city and were joined by civilians in increasing numbers. After sealing the Old City to prevent the entry of enemy reinforcements, al-Kharrat issued an order to kill anyone linked to the French army. About 180 French soldiers were killed. Sarrail ordered the shelling and aerial bombardment of the city, which lasted two days and killed about 1,500 people.Provence 2005, p. 104. Chaos and scattered fighting ensued as whole neighborhoods, mosques and churches were leveled, French forces moved in, and hundreds of leading figures in the Syrian national movement were arrested, including al-Kharrat's son Fakhri. The latter was captured on 22 October during a botched nighttime raid by the rebels against the French, who had by then retaken Damascus. Al-Kharrat was offered the release of his son in exchange for his own surrender, but refused. The rebels withdrew from Damascus as a meeting was held between French army commander Maurice Gamelin and a delegation of Damascene notables.Khoury 1987, p. 177. As a result of the meeting, the French agreed to end their bombardment in return for a payment of 100,000 Turkish gold liras by 24 October. The fine was not paid by the French deadline, but the bombardment was not renewed, likely as a result of orders from the French government in Paris.Provence 2005, pp. 104‚Äì105. International condemnation of Sarrail's bombardment of Damascus and growing criticism in France of his mishandling of the revolt led to his dismissal on 30 October.Provence 2005, p. 109. He was replaced by politician Henry de Jouvenel,Khoury 1987, pp. 181‚Äì182. who arrived in Syria in December.Provence 2005, p. 126. On 22 November, al-Kharrat commanded 700 rebels in a battle with about 500 French soldiers outside of Damascus. Al-Kharrat's men inflicted \\"trifling\\" losses on the French, but experienced heavy casualties themselves, with thirty dead and forty wounded according to Reuters. On 5 December, al- Kharrat was one of the commanders of a 2,000-strong force uniting rebels from disparate backgrounds, which assaulted the French Army barracks in al-Qadam, south of Damascus. The French claimed to have inflicted significant casualties, but rebel activity continued.Provence 2005, p. 116. Tensions with rebel leaders Centralized order and oversight among the revolt's armed participants was difficult to establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders was held in the Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November.Provence 2005, pp. 134‚Äì135. Sa'id al-'As accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta,Neep 2012, p. 81. while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al- Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma.Neep 2012, p. 83. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a central command, and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al- Kharrat was not included in the newly formed rebel leadership council, nor were any of al-Bakri's allies. Instead, al-'As served as the rebels' overall head. Sharp divisions among rebel factions became apparent during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist Munir al- Rayyes, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war taxes on the major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed him as a threat to the traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged.Provence 2005, p. 134. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al- Kharrat,Provence 2005, p. 135. who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al-Shallash to Saqba.Provence 2005, p. 137. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money. After his detention, al-Shallash was given a brief trial during which al-Kharrat accused him of making \\"impositions and ransoms and financial collections in the name of the revolt\\", while al-Bakri condemned him specifically for extorting the residents of Douma for 1,000 giney (Ottoman pounds), and imposing large fines on the inhabitants of Harran al-Awamid, al- Qisa and Maydaa for his own personal enrichment.Provence 2005, p. 136. Al- Kharrat and al-Bakri decided al-Shallash's verdict, and dismissed him from the revolt. While many rebels with officer backgrounds similar to al-Shallash disapproved of the judgement, they did not intervene. In his account of the meeting, al-Rayyis condemned the rebel commanders for complacency in the \\"ridiculous trial\\" and accused al-Kharrat of being motivated solely by personal animosity. Al-Shallash was able to escape‚Äîor was released by al-'As‚Äîwhen French planes bombed the meeting. Al-Shallash would later surrender to Jouvenel and collaborate with French authorities.Provence 2005, pp. 138‚Äì139. Death and legacy Al-Kharrat's son and rebel commander, Fakhri, hanged by French authorities in alt=A man executed by hanging with onlookers in the background Al-Kharrat was killed in an ambush by French troops in the Ghouta on 25 December 1925. He was succeeded as qabaday of al- Shaghour and commander of the ‚Ä≤isabat al-Shawaghirah by Mahmud Khaddam al- Srija. Al-Kharrat's men continued to fight the French until the revolt ended in 1927,Provence 2005, p. 138. though historian Thomas Philipp states that al- Kharrat's group dissipated after his death. In January 1926, al-Kharrat's son Fakhri was sentenced to death and publicly executed with two other rebels in Marjeh Square, Damascus.Neep 2012, p. 54. The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release, but Fakhri refused. Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, a prominent Syrian nationalist leader, described al-Kharrat as having played \\"the preeminent role\\" in the battle against the French in the Ghouta and Damascus. Historian Daniel Neep wrote that al-Kharrat was the \\"best-known\\" of all of the Damascus-based rebel leaders, although other leaders of the rebel movement attributed the publicity and praise of al-Kharrat to the efforts of the Cairo-based Syrian-Palestinian Committee, with which al-Bakri was closely affiliated. Al-Kharrat and his son Fakhri are today considered \\"martyred heroes\\" by Syrians for their nationalist efforts and their deaths in the Syrian struggle for independence from France.
