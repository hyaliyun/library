He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1961 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1995. He served as a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1957 to 1961 and 1973 to 1977. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Oireachtas from 1973 to 1977. He was a member of a family political dynasty; his father, Patrick Lenihan, and sister both followed him into D√°il √âireann; his sister Mary O'Rourke sitting in cabinet with him. Two of his sons, Brian Lenihan Jnr and Conor Lenihan, became TDs in the 1990s. Brian Lenihan Jnr served as Minister for Finance and Conor was Minister of State in the government of Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Two phrases associated with Lenihan Snr, No problem and On mature recollection, entered the Irish political lexicon. Early life Born in Dundalk, County Louth, Lenihan was the son of Patrick Lenihan and Anne Scanlon. His father had been active in the Irish Republican Army, which saw action during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. He had been an admirer of Michael Collins and took the pro-Treaty side in 1922, before later returning to his studies and qualifying as a teacher. Lenihan, who was one of five children, grew up in Athlone. He was educated at Marist College in the town before later studying law at University College Dublin, where he was actively involved in the Law Society as a Committee Member. He later qualified as a barrister from King's Inns. He then practised law for a few years before becoming a full-time politician. Political career =Beginnings= Lenihan first entered politics in 1954, when he ran as a Fianna F√°il candidate in Longford‚ÄìWestmeath in that year's general election. Of the four Fianna F√°il candidates, Lenihan was the only one not to be elected. Three years later Lenihan contested the 1957 general election, this time in the Roscommon constituency. Although he received more first preferences than any of the other Fianna F√°il candidates, he lost out on a D√°il seat once again. In spite of this, he became a Senator as one of Taoiseach √âamon de Valera's nominees. After four years as a Senator, Lenihan finally secured a seat in D√°il √âireann, following his success at the 1961 general election in Roscommon. He had the distinction of being made a Parliamentary Secretary on his first day in the D√°il as a TD, serving under both Minister for Lands M√≠che√°l √ì M√≥r√°in and Minister for Justice Charles Haughey. =Minister for Justice= A cabinet reshuffle saw Lenihan join the cabinet of Se√°n Lemass in 1964, as Minister for Justice. His predecessor in the office, Charles Haughey, systematically reviewed, repealed or amended Acts dating back 700 years in the single largest reform of the Irish civil and criminal code ever undertaken. Lenihan carried the legislative programme, covering everything from repealing medi√¶val laws to granting succession rights to married women. As Minister, it was Lenihan who repealed Ireland's notorious censorship laws. Controversially he also suggested that Ireland should rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, though it is unclear whether that suggestion actually reflected his opinion or whether he was simply raising the issue at Lemass's request to gauge public reaction. =Minister for Education= In 1968, Lemass's successor Jack Lynch appointed Lenihan as Minister for Education. As Minister, he controversially proposed the merger of Dublin's (then) two universities, Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Dublin (UCD).Both still exist, alongside a third since created, Dublin City University, formerly the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin (NIHE, Dublin). The scheme was abandoned after mass opposition, Lenihan famously being forced to flee student protests in Trinity through a toilet window. Lenihan was also Minister during a 19-day secondary teachers' strike in February 1969. =Minister for Transport and Power= Following the 1969 general election, Fianna F√°il returned to power for a fourth successive term of office. Lenihan had hopes of further promotion within the cabinet, however, his appointment as Minister for Transport and Power was largely seen as a demotion. =Minister for Foreign Affairs= In 1973, Patrick Hillery was appointed as Ireland's European Commissioner, upon the Irish entry to the European Economic Community. Lenihan then finally secured his much sought- after portfolio, that of Minister for Foreign Affairs. His tenure was short- lived, as the government fell and a new Fine Gael-Labour Party government took office, following the 1973 general election. Political return Lenihan also dramatically lost his Roscommon‚ÄìLeitrim seat. He once again became a Senator, becoming his party's leader in the upper house. In 1973, he was appointed a member of the second delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament. He moved his political base from rural Roscommon to Dublin West, where he was elected as a TD at the 1977 general election, which saw a landslide victory for Fianna F√°il. Jack Lynch appointed him Minister for Forestry and Fisheries. At Lynch's retirement in 1979, Fianna F√°il saw a leadership battle between Charles Haughey (the radical republican candidate) and George Colley (the party establishment candidate and mild republican). Lenihan dismissed the choice as being between a \\"knave and a fool\\". He also described himself as being the \\"x in Oxo\\"Oxo is a well-known brand of stock cube. He was believed to have backed Colley. Years later he claimed he had actually supported Haughey, but not everyone accepted this assertion. Haughey, seeking to weaken the faction supporting Colley, appointed Lenihan as Minister for Foreign Affairs, a post he held until Fianna F√°il lost power in 1981. His period in Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by a comment made after an Anglo- Irish summit between Haughey and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, when he spoke of Britain and Ireland being able to bring about Irish unity within ten years, a comment which infuriated the British and Northern Ireland unionists and which undid much of the goodwill achieved by the summit. His comments, at a time of major problems within Northern Ireland, with the Provisional IRA and Irish National Liberation Army campaigns in full swing along with Ulster Defence Association and other loyalists conducting reprisals were widely criticised in the Irish media as insensitive, especially as Irish unity had not even been on the agenda of the summit. One newspaper columnist commented simply \\"there goes Brian, pointlessly talking himself into trouble again\\".Sunday Independent. In 1982, when Fianna F√°il regained power for what would prove only ten months, Lenihan was appointed Minister for Agriculture, the announcement in the D√°il being greeted by a sustained round of laughter on the opposition benches. Anglo-Irish Agreement opposition In opposition, Lenihan and Haughey attracted some international criticism when, against the advice of senior Irish-American politicians Senator Edward Kennedy and Speaker Tip O'Neill, they campaigned against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which the government of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had signed with the British government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In 1987, Fianna F√°il returned to power and Lenihan was for the third and final time appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the additional post of T√°naiste (deputy prime minister). In power Haughey and Lenihan reversed their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Lenihan attending meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference which the Ireland's Foreign Minister and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland co-chaired. Liver transplant Lenihan's last period as Minister for Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by his serious ill- health. A long-standing liver problem had developed into a life-threatening issue requiring a liver transplant. Lenihan, previously a large-framed man, had been reduced to a bone-thin jaundiced-looking shadow of his former self, so ill-looking that the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, said afterwards that on seeing Brian at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting, he had speculated as to whether Lenihan would die at the meeting. In May 1989, Lenihan underwent the liver transplant at Mayo Clinic in the United States. In his absence he was re-elected to the D√°il in the 1989 general election for Dublin West, after which, while remaining T√°naiste, he was made Minister for Defence. Lenihan returned to Irish politics with a new lease of life. When he entered the D√°il chamber he received an ovation, an indication of his personal cross-party popularity. It was revealed subsequently that Lenihan's operation was partly paid for through fundraising by Taoiseach Charles Haughey, from businessmen with Fianna F√°il links. In evidence to the Moriarty Tribunal investigating Haughey's finances, it was established that much of the money raised but not ultimately needed for the operation was redirected by Haughey into his own personal bank account. Haughey was revealed in the 2006 tribunal report to have been engaged in numerous acts of corruption, to finance a lifestyle considerably in excess of his earnings as a politician. Presidential candidate In January 1990, leaks to the media suggested that Lenihan was considering seeking the Fianna F√°il nomination in the 1990 Irish presidential election, which was due in November 1990. Speculation abounded that this was part of a plan to discourage other parties from running candidates in the belief that Lenihan would prove unbeatable and so get the office unopposed. Labour Party leader Dick Spring indicated that Labour would run a candidate for the presidency, even if he had to stand himself. Ultimately, Labour chose former Senator Mary Robinson as its candidate. =Challenge of John Wilson= Lenihan was generally perceived as an unbeatable candidate, though he did receive a late challenge for the nomination from cabinet colleague John Wilson.Fears grew among the party leadership that the party, in a minority government, would have great difficulty holding Lenihan's seat in a by-election, whereas Wilson had a 'safe seat' the party would have no difficulty in holding. However, in September 1990, Lenihan was formally nominated as his party's candidate. The main opposition party, Fine Gael chose Austin Currie, a TD and former Northern Ireland cabinet minister, to be its candidate. Lenihan had a serious flaw. Though regarded by those who knew him personally as an intellectual heavyweight, he presented himself as a lightweight, semi-comic politician‚Äîthe \\"clown prince\\" of Irish politics, in the words of long-time friend and journalist John Healy. He was once described by Fine Gael politician John Kelly as \\"like a lighthouse in the Bog of Allen, brilliant but useless\\". During leadership campaigns against Charles Haughey in the 1980s, Lenihan had regularly appeared on television to insist that Fianna F√°il was not divided, even as Ministers were resigning and‚Äîin an incident involving Jim Gibbons‚Äîscuffles broke out in the environs of Leinster House. Lenihan's image was dealt a further blow by a disastrous Late Late Show special devoted to him, which was broadcast only weeks before the presidential campaign started. Colleagues and friends projected an image of him as a political cute hoor‚Äîsomeone who would do anything and pull any stunt that he had to. As a result, Lenihan was mistrusted. =The Lenihan tape= The issue of Lenihan's trustworthiness became the central issue of the second half of the presidential campaign. In January 1982, Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had asked President Patrick Hillery, a former government colleague of Lenihan's, to dissolve the D√°il, a request which Hillery granted.Under the Constitution of Ireland, the President has the absolute right in consultation with the Taoiseach to grant or withhold a dissolution of the D√°il. If President Hillery had refused a dissolution, Charles Haughey could have formed an alternative government and strengthened his own embattled position as leader of Fianna F√°il. Subsequently, it was reported in books by authors Stephen O'Byrnes and Raymond Smith, and by many political journalists in newspaper articles (some of whom had Lenihan as their source) that Lenihan had been one of the people who had made phone calls to √Åras an Uachtar√°in, the President's official residence, on the night in question, in order to persuade or pressure Hillery to refuse a dissolution. Lenihan himself never denied his involvement in the incident. Indeed, in May 1990, he confirmed his participation in an on-the- record interview with a postgraduate student and journalist, Jim Duffy. In September 1990, The Irish Times carried a series of articles on the presidency, one of which mentioned in passing the role of Lenihan, Sylvester Barrett, and Charles Haughey in making the calls. The article in question was sourced from Duffy's interview. In October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, Lenihan suddenly changed his story. In an interview in the Irish Press and on RT√â's Questions and Answers programme, he insisted that he had had \\"no hand, act or part\\" in efforts to pressure President Hillery. The Irish Times, which was aware that Lenihan himself was Duffy's source for the original article claim, published, with Duffy's agreement, a newspaper story confirming that Lenihan had indeed made the controversial phone calls to √Åras an Uachtar√°in. When Lenihan's campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, named Duffy on radio as someone who had interviewed Lenihan back in May, a political storm erupted in which the journalist was put under siege by the media and Fianna F√°il, leading to his reluctant decision, after consulting with lawyers, to release the portion of the tape in which Lenihan talked about the events of January 1982. =\\"On mature recollection\\"= Lenihan's reaction severely damaged his credibility. He appeared on a live TV news bulletin, and, looking into the camera, pleaded with the Irish people to believe him, stating that \\"on mature recollection\\" he had not phoned President Hillery and his account to Duffy had been wrong. He then requested an audience with President Hillery to seek his confirmation that he made no phone calls. No audience was granted, and his campaign manager Bertie Ahern withdrew the request ‚Äì though, in a sign of the chaos enveloping the campaign, Lenihan told journalist Charlie Bird that the request was still there until the journalist played back his interview with Ahern, after which Lenihan recorded a new soundbite explaining why the request had been withdrawn.RT√â showed the image of Lenihan listening to the RT√â reporter's tape recorder but the fact that he was listening to Ahern's interview before re-recording his own was not explained to viewers and only became known subsequently. At this point, the opposition put down a motion of no confidence in the government. The Progressive Democrats, Fianna F√°il's coalition partner, told Taoiseach Charles Haughey that unless Lenihan was either dismissed or an inquiry set up into the events of January 1982, it would pull out of government, support the opposition motion and force a general election. Though insisting that he would put no pressure on Brian Lenihan, \\"my friend of thirty years\\", Haughey drew up a letter of resignation for Lenihan's signature. Lenihan refused to sign, and Haughey formally advised President Hillery to dismiss Lenihan from the government ‚Äì which Hillery, as was required constitutionally, duly did, despite grave personal concerns. Many in Fianna F√°il were disgusted with what they saw as Haughey's betrayal of his old friend, and argued that the Progressive Democrats' threat to bring down the government was a mere bluff. This would be the first in a series of events generating discontent in Fianna Fail with Haughey's leadership, culminating in his downfall in early 1992. =P√°draig Flynn's attack on Mary Robinson= Lenihan's dismissal led to an immediate collapse in his popularity (from mid 40% to 31% almost overnight), though his standing in the polls subsequently improved. A personal attack by former cabinet colleague P√°draig Flynn on Mary Robinson, in which he accused her of showing a \\"new-found interest\\" in her family, backfired and destroyed Lenihan's campaign. Women voters rallied to Robinson and abandoned the Lenihan campaign in droves. =The result= In spite of his troubled campaign, Lenihan won the largest number of first- preference votes. However, most of the votes that initially went to Austin Currie, the third-placed candidate, transferred to Mary Robinson on the second count, in what was widely seen as a pact between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. As a result, Lenihan became the first Fianna F√°il candidate to lose an Irish presidential election. Out of government Lenihan remained active in politics right up to his death in 1995. Bitter at what he saw as his betrayal by the Progressive Democrats, he campaigned for Fianna F√°il to go into coalition with the Labour Party instead, something which happened after the 1992 general election. He also occasionally reviewed books, which showed an intellect that he had suppressed in his public persona as a politician. Death Brian Lenihan's health again deteriorated and he died in 1995, at the age of 64, sixteen days short of his 65th birthday. In the resulting by- election, his son Brian Lenihan Jnr was elected to his seat. In the 1997 general election another son, Conor Lenihan, was elected to D√°il √âireann. Brian Lenihan Memorial Lecture A Brian Lenihan Memorial Lecture is delivered annually in the Irish Institute of European Affairs. The first guest speaker was the late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead (previously known as Roy Jenkins; formerly British Home Secretary and President of the European Commission). In 2001, the lecture was given by Chris Patten, former British Conservative Party Minister and MP, former Governor of Hong Kong and current British European Commissioner.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin South-East constituency from 1977 to 1981 and 1982 to 2016. He was a Senator from 1976 to 1977, upon being Nominated by the Taoiseach and again from 1981 to 1982 for the Industrial and Commercial Panel. Early life Quinn was born on 2 April 1946. His family were prominent republicans in County Down in the south-east of Ulster in the 1920s, taking an active part in the IRA during the War of Independence and on the anti-Treaty side during the Civil War. The Quinn's were prosperous merchants in Newry, County Down, then moved to Dublin in the 1930s, where Quinn's father built a successful business career. Quinn was educated at St. Michael's College and Blackrock College, both in Dublin, where he was academically successful and an outstanding athlete and a member of Blackrock College's Senior Cup rugby team. From an early age, he was interested in art and won the all-Ireland Texaco Children's Art competition. This led him to study architecture at University College, Dublin (UCD), in 1964 and later at the School of Ekistics in Athens. In 1965, Quinn joined the Labour Party working for Michael O'Leary's successful campaign in Dublin North-Central. In the following years, Quinn was a leading student radical in UCD demanding reform of the University's structures and the old fashioned architectural course that then prevailed. This earned him the nickname \\"Ho Chi Quinn\\", after the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh. He travelled in Europe and became a europhile, which was to be a defining characteristic of his political career. He qualified as an architect in 1969 and married for the first time that year before embarking on studies in Athens. He and his first wife had a son and a daughter. He married again in 1990 and has a son with his second wife, the architect Liz Allman, whose family came from Milltown, County Kerry. He became employed as an architect with Dublin Corporation in 1971. In 1972, Quinn decided he would stand for the Labour Party in the next general election and hoped he would be the running mate of the sitting Labour deputy for Dublin South-East, No√´l Browne. The party organisation was largely moribund since Browne's election in 1969 as Browne had been ill and little work had been done locally. When the election was called in February 1973, Quinn found he was the only Labour Party candidate as Browne refused to stand in principled opposition to the Labour Party's decision to enter into a pre- election pact with Fine Gael to form a National Coalition. Quinn lost by 39 votes to Fergus O'Brien of Fine Gael in the final count. Following the 1973 election, Quinn began to rebuild the Labour Party in Dublin South-East with his mainly youthful supporters. He won a council seat on Dublin Corporation at the local elections in 1974 in the Pembroke-Rathmines local electoral area and took a leading role in the Labour Party group on the city council. He was a partner in an architecture firm from 1973 to 1982. In 1976, he was nominated by the Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, to Seanad √âireann when Brendan Halligan won a by-election in Dublin South-West and his Senate seat became vacant. He was first elected a Labour Party TD for Dublin South-East at the 1977 general election. Quinn was at this time quite associated with environmental issues being the first professional architect and town planner ever elected to the D√°il. He served as environment spokesperson for the Labour Party and was very close to the party leader, Frank Cluskey, whom he had voted for in the leadership contest of 1977. He lost his seat at the 1981 general election and was elected to the 15th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel. He was re-elected as TD at the February 1982 general election and has retained his seat until his retirement in 2016. On 10 March 1991, Quinn was observed by Garda√≠ driving erratically in the Clontarf area. At Clontarf Garda Station, Quinn provided a urine sample, which showed him to have an 202 mg of alcohol for 100 ml of urine. He was banned from driving for a year and fined ¬£250. Early ministerial career In 1982, he became Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. Between 1983 and 1986, he served as Minister for Labour. From 1986 to 1987, he was appointed Minister for the Public Service, held in addition to the Labour portfolio. In 1989, he became deputy leader of the Labour Party. He was director of elections for Mary Robinson's successful presidential election campaign in 1990. Minister for Enterprise and Employment In the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour Party coalition government of 1993‚Äì1994, Quinn became Minister for Enterprise and Employment. He oversaw the merger of the former Department of Industry and Commerce with the former Department of Labour, with a new focus on enterprise development and the reduction of the then high level of unemployment. Quinn implemented reform of industrial strategy and reorganised the industrial development agencies. He also introduced the Community Employment Programme to provide activity and involvement for unemployed workers in 1994. This proved to be particularly successful. Quinn was seen as comfortable with the Fianna F√°il members of the cabinet. He also tended to be a moderniser in economic terms but, despite attempts, failed to close the Irish Steel company in Haulbowline, County Cork, a classic loss-making smoke stack industry that harked back to an earlier era. Nevertheless, it was in August 1994, while Quinn and Fianna F√°il's Bertie Ahern were economic ministers, that the Irish economy was first described as the \\"Celtic Tiger\\". Quinn, along with many of his Labour cabinet colleagues, strove unsuccessfully to keep the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour government together during the Father Brendan Smyth crisis in November 1994. He records in his autobiography that he still cannot understand why that Government fell. Minister for Finance The following year he became Minister for Finance in the Fine Gael, Labour Party and Democratic Left \\"Rainbow Coalition\\" government. Quinn took a relatively conservative line as Finance Minister, being conscious of his position as the first Labour Party Minister for Finance in Irish political history. He quickly proved his competence, dispelling opposition jibes and stock market fears about a social democratic minister holding the sensitive finance portfolio. The Irish economy continued to perform, while inflation and the government finances were kept under firm control. Unemployment gradually fell and public debt levels improved. During Quinn's tenure as Minister for Finance, the overall tax burden in Ireland (the ratio of tax revenue, including pay related social insurance levies, to gross national product) fell from 38.7% to 34.8%, of by 1.3 percentage points each year. He achieved this by limiting current government spending to grow by 6.8% in nominal terms or 4.8% in real terms, against a backdrop of improving economic fortunes, due to increasing investment in technology intensive sectors of the Irish economy. Under Quinn, the General Government Balance went from a deficit of 2.1% in 1995 to a surplus of 1.1% in 1997. The General Government Debt went from 81% of GNP in 1995 to 63.6% in 1997. The year before Quinn became an economic Minister in 1993, Irish economic growth was 2.5% (1992). In 1993, GNP growth was 3%; in 1994, 6.5%; in 1995, 8%; in 1996, 7.8%; and finally in 1997, 10.3%. The unemployment rate fell from 15.7% in 1993 to 10.3% in 1997. Quinn served as the President of the Ecofin Council of the European Union in 1996, and worked to accelerate the launch of the European Single Currency, while securing Ireland's qualification for the eurozone. Quinn, and his party leader and T√°naiste, Foreign Minister Dick Spring enjoyed a somewhat uneasy relationship during the Rainbow Coalition, as recounted in Quinn's 2005 memoir. At the 1997 general election the Labour Party returned to opposition, winning only 17 of its outgoing 33 seats. Many other ministers of the Labour Party were under significant pressure from the media (particularly the Irish Independent) concerning allegations of cronyism (\\"jobs for the boys\\") and abusing the privileges of office. In comparison, the opposition under Bertie Ahern placed heavy reliance on cutting tax rates as opposed to widening tax bands favoured by Quinn. Ahern also claimed credit for the country's improving economy was due to his earlier term in government. Leader of the Labour Party =Accession to leadership= In October 1997, Dick Spring resigned as leader of the Labour Party following an unsuccessful campaign by the Labour Party candidate, Adi Roche, in the 1997 Irish presidential election. Quinn defeated Brendan Howlin to become the new leader. In 1999, the Labour Party and Democratic Left merged. Proinsias De Rossa of the latter party became the largely symbolic party president, while Quinn remained as leader of the party. He used the years of leadership to develop a strong policy platform, publishing a Spatial Strategy for future development of the country, promoting universal access to health insurance, advocating reform of the Garda S√≠och√°na, and arguing for closer European integration. Fianna F√°il countered by cleverly exploiting Quinn's comfortable middle-class background, labelling him \\"Mr Angry from Sandymount,\\" the middle class district of Dublin where Quinn is a longtime resident, and representative of, in the D√°il. =2002 general election= At the 2002 general election, which saw the ruling Fianna F√°il and Progressive Democrats government re-elected, the Labour Party returned with 1 seat less than it had held previously. Quinn fought that election on an independent platform although he indicated a preference to enter government with Fine Gael, which he had served with in the Rainbow coalition era. Quinn's strategy was predicated on the Labour Party holding the balance of power and keeping a distance from the two bigger parties. This underestimated the attraction for the electorate of the outgoing Ahern Government that had enjoyed extraordinary economic growth and prosperity. Realising that the choice was between a majority Fianna F√°il government on the one hand, or a government of Fianna F√°il in coalition with the Progressive Democrats, through their president, Michael McDowell, a constituency rival of Quinn's, seized the moment and put themselves forward as the guarantor of the public interest in a new Fianna F√°il government. This left the Labour Party stranded and almost as irrelevant to the outcome of the election. Under the leadership of Michael Noonan, Fine Gael lost 23 seats, being reduced to 31 seats, their worst performance in decades. Meanwhile, the Progressive Democrats doubled their seats to eight and emerged with two full cabinet positions in a new coalition with Fianna F√°il. Quinn was gravely disappointed that, even though Labour had not lost seats in net numbers and Fine Gael had lost 23 seats, he had failed to increase the number of seats his party held, in an election that resulted in gains for small parties on the left end of the political spectrum, such as Sinn F√©in and the Green Party. Quinn himself was re-elected on the last count by 600 votes. Accepting that he would now be in opposition for another term, and seeking to spend more time with his young family, Quinn announced that he would not seek re-election for another six-year term as leader of the Labour Party, at the end of August 2002. Post-leadership In October 2002, Quinn's term as party leader expired and he retired as Labour leader, being replaced in a leadership election by Pat Rabbitte. When Rabbitte resigned as party leader in 2007, Quinn supported the successful candidacy of Eamon Gilmore. His public support of Gilmore, where he also brought the endorsement of all the Dublin City Councillors in his area, was seen as instrumental in discouraging other candidates from entering the race. Quinn caused anger and controversy when he refused to give up his ministers pension worth ‚Ç¨41,656 while sitting as a TD in 2009. He eventually backed down after pressure was put on him to give up the pension. He led the European Movement Ireland, a pro-EU lobby group in Ireland until late 2007, when he re-founded the Irish Alliance for Europe to campaign on the Treaty of Lisbon. Quinn is also Vice-President and Treasurer of the Party of European Socialists. He is a brother of Lochlann Quinn, former Chairman of Allied Irish Banks, and a first cousin of Senator Feargal Quinn. His nephew, Ois√≠n Quinn, was a Labour Party Dublin City Councillor between 2004 and 2014, and a one-time D√°il candidate in 2007. In 2005, his political memoir, Straight Left, was published. 2007 general election At the 2007 general election, Quinn increased his share of the poll by some 4% and was returned to the 30th D√°il. He was nominated for the post of Ceann Comhairle but was defeated by John O'Donoghue. Quinn became Labour Party spokesperson on Education and Science as a member of Eamon Gilmore's front bench in September 2007. He played a pivotal role in the successful second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in September 2009, and continues to be an office holder with the Party of European Socialists. 2011 general election In September 2010, Quinn was appointed the Labour Party's national director of elections for the 2011 general election by Gilmore. He had been selected along with Kevin Humphreys to be a candidate for Labour in that election. Both Quinn and Humphreys were elected to the 31st D√°il on 27 February 2011, by clever vote management that saw the Labour Party in Dublin South-East secure two seats with only a quarter of the first preference vote. Minister for Education: 2011‚Äì2014 On 9 March 2011, Quinn was appointed as Minister for Education and Skills in the new Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour coalition government. In May 2011, he confirmed a U-turn on a pre-election pledge that he would reverse a proposed increase in third level student registration fees, instead providing for a ‚Ç¨500 increase in the fee payable by students. In July 2011, Quinn had again refused to rule out the return of college fees as he acknowledged the funding crisis in the higher education sector. The Minister told a meeting of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) the funding crisis in higher education will ‚Äúnot go away‚Äù for many years to come. Asked if new charges were planned he said: ‚ÄúI honestly can't say. We are looking for efficiencies in the system at third level. ... I have said to Brendan Howlin that I will deliver.‚Äù In October 2012, Quinn announced the phasing out of the current Junior Certificate programme over the next eight years, to be replaced by a school- based model of continuous assessment. He described his plan as \\"the most radical shake-up of the junior cycle programme since the ending of the Inter Cert in 1991\\", and claimed the scrapping of the Junior Certificate exams would help the ‚Äúbottom half‚Äù of students. On 12 October 2012, Quinn, speaking to an audience at an anniversary celebration for St Kilian's German school, said the ‚Äúdemons of nationalism‚Äù and ‚Äúchauvinism‚Äù embedded in our cultures would only stay under control if there was a deeper European culture. The private school, in Clonskeagh, Dublin, celebrated its 60th anniversary, having been founded after the second World War to cater for child refugees from Germany. Between 1945 and 1946, Operation Shamrock, initiated by the Irish Red Cross, resettled over 400 children from postwar Germany, as well as from Austria, France, and United Kingdom. Many of the children, some as young as three years old, had lost their parents in the war, while others had their homes destroyed. He went on to say ‚Äúwill only stay in the place where they belong if we have more Europe, if we have a deeper Europe, if we have a wider Europe‚Äù. On 29 January 2013, Quinn launched Ireland's first national plan to tackle bullying in schools including cyberbullying. The Action Plan on Bullying set out 12 clear actions on how to prevent and tackle bullying. In February 2013, Quinn published legislation to replace the largely discredited state training and employment agency, F√ÅS, with a new statutory body named SOLAS. On 2 July 2014, Ruairi Quinn announced his decision to resign as Minister for Education and Skills, which became effective in the cabinet reshuffle on 11 July. He also said that he would not be seeking re-election to the D√°il after the next general election.

Sir Henry Hamilton Johnston (12 June 1858 ‚Äì 31 July 1927), frequently known as Harry Johnston, was a British explorer, botanist, artist, colonial administrator and linguist who traveled widely in Africa and spoke many African languages. He published 40 books on African subjects and was one of the key players in the Scramble for Africa that occurred at the end of the 19th century. Early years Born at Kennington Park, south London, the son of John Brookes Johnstone and Esther Laetitia Hamilton. He attended Stockwell grammar school and then King's College London, followed by four years studying painting at the Royal Academy. In connection with his study he travelled to Europe and North Africa, visiting the little- known (by Europeans) interior of Tunisia.Obituary, (1927). Henry Hamilton Johnston, Ibis, Vol. XLIV, No. 1, p. 735. Exploration in Africa In 1882 he visited southern Angola with the Earl of Mayo, and in the following year met Henry Morton Stanley in the Congo, becoming one of the first Europeans after Stanley to see the river above the Stanley Pool. His developing reputation led the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association to appoint him leader of an 1884 scientific expedition to Mount Kilimanjaro. On this expedition he concluded treaties with local chiefs (which were then transferred to the British East Africa Company), in competition with German efforts to do likewise.Obituary, (1927). Henry Hamilton Johnston, Ibis, Vol. XLIV, No. 1, pp. 735‚Äì6. British colonial service and the Cape to Cairo vision In October 1886 the British government appointed him vice-consul in Cameroon and the Niger River delta area, where a protectorate had been declared in 1885, and he became acting consul in 1887,Obituary, (1927). Henry Hamilton Johnston, Ibis, Vol. XLIV, No. 1, p. 736. deposing and banishing the local chief Jaja. While in West Africa in 1886, Johnston sketched what has been termed a \\"fantasy map\\" of his ideas of how the African continent could be divided among the colonial powers. This envisaged two blocks of British colonies, one of continuous territory in West Africa, the Nile valley and much of East Africa as far south as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa, the other in southern Africa south of the Zambezi. This left a continuous band in Portuguese occupation from Angola to Mozambique and Germany in possession of much of the East African coast.National Archives. \\"Mr Johnston's Imagination\\", 21 September 2017 The original proposal for a Cape to Cairo railway was made in 1874 by Edwin Arnold, the then editor of the Daily Telegraph, which was joint sponsor of the expedition by H.M. Stanley to Africa to discover the course of the Congo River.K J Panton, (2015). \\"A Historical Dictionary of the British Empire\\", Lanham, Rowman & Littlefield, p. 113. . The proposed route involved a mixture of railway and river transport between Elizabethville, now Lubumbashi in the Belgian Congo and Sennar in the Sudan rather than a completely rail one.L Weintal, (1923). \\"The story of the Cape to Cairo Railway and River Route from 1887 to 1922 (Volume 4)\\", London, Pioneer Publishing, p. 4 Johnston later acknowledged his debt to Stanley and Arnold and when on leave in England in 1888, he revived the Cape-to-Cairo concept of acquiring a continuous band of British territory down Africa in discussion with Lord Salisbury. Johnston then published an supporting the idea article in Times anonymously, as \\"by an African Explorer\\" and later in 1888 and 1889 published a number of articles in other newspapers and journals with Salisbury's tacit approval.G Harper, (2002). \\"Comedy, Fantasy and Colonialism\\", London, Bloomsbury Publications, pp. 142‚Äì3. . Scramble for Katanga The Berlin Conference had allocated Katanga to the sphere of influence of King Leopold of Belgium's Congo Free State, but under the Berlin Conference's Principle of Effectivity this was only provisional. In July 1890, Leopold protested to Lord Salisbury that Johnston, as agent for Cecil Rhodes, was circulating maps showing that the Congo Free State did not include Katanga, and in response to Salisbury's enquiries, in August 1890 Johnston presented Rhodes' claim, which included the false information that Msiri, King of Garanganze in Katanga had asked for British protection.N. Ascherson, (1999). The King Incorporated: Leopold the Second and the Congo p. 161, London, Granta Books In November 1890, to justify his claim, Johnston sent Alfred Sharpe (who would become his successor in Nyasaland) to act for Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC), to obtain a treaty with Msiri, a move which had the potential to precipitate an Anglo-Belgian crisis. Sharpe failed with Msiri, though he obtained treaties with Mwata Kazembe covering the eastern side of the Luapula River and Lake Mweru, and with other chiefs covering the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. When Leopold again protested to Salisbury in May 1891, the latter had to admit Msiri had not signed a treaty asking for British protection and left Katanga open to Belgian colonisation. In 1891 Leopold sent the Stairs Expedition to Katanga. Johnston dissuaded it from accessing Katanga through Nyasaland, but it went through German East Africa instead, and took Katanga after killing Msiri. The southern border of the Congo Free State was settled by an Anglo-Congo agreement of 1894.N. Ascherson, (1999). The King Incorporated: Leopold the Second and the Congo pp. 162‚Äì3 Nyasaland (British Central Africa Protectorate) Portrait of Johnston by Theodore Blake Wirgman (1894) In 1879 the Portuguese government formally claimed the area south and east of the Ruo River (currently the southeastern border of Malawi) and then, in 1882, occupied the lower Shire River valley as far north as the Ruo. It attempted to gain British acceptance of this claim without success, and also failed in a claim that the Shire Highlands was part of Portuguese East Africa, as it was not under effective occupationF Axelson, (1967). Portugal and the Scramble for Africa, pp. 182‚Äì3, 198‚Äì200. Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press. As late as 1888, the British Foreign Office would not accept responsibility for British missionaries and settlers in the Shire Highlands after the African Lakes Corporation had tried but failed to become a Chartered company with interests there and around the western shore of Lake Malawi.J McCracken, (2012). \\"A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966\\", Woodbridge, James Currey, p. 51. . However, in 1885‚Äì86 Alexandre de Serpa Pinto had undertaken an expedition which reached Shire Highlands, which had failed make any treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs west of Lake Malawi.M Newitt, (1995). \\"A History of Mozambique\\", London, Hurst & Co, pp 276‚Äì7, 325‚Äì6. To prevent possible Portuguese occupation, in November 1888, Johnston was appointed as Commissioner and Consul-general for the Mozambique and the Nyasa districts, and arrived in Blantyre in March 1889.P.

The Arab War on Lake Nyasa 1887‚Äì1895 Part II, The Nyasaland Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 39 On his way to take up his appointment, Johnston spent six weeks in Lisbon attempting to negotiate an acceptable agreement on Portuguese and British spheres of influence in southeastern Africa. However, as the draft agreement did not expressly exclude the Shire Highlands from the Portuguese sphere, it was rejected by the Foreign Office.Sir Harry Johnston, (1897). \\"British Central Africa\\", New York, Edward Arnold p. 81 Among several pressing problems was the Karonga War, a dispute between and Swahili traders in slaves and ivory and their Henga allies on one side and the African Lakes Trading Company and elements of the Ngonde people on the other which had broken out in 1887.O.

The Arab War on Lake Nyasa 1887-1895 Part II, pp. 41-3 In late 1888 and early 1889, the Portuguese government sent two expeditions to make treaties of protection with local chiefs, one under Antonio Cardoso set off toward Lake Malawi, the other under Alexandre de Serpa Pinto moved up the Shire valley. Between them, they made over twenty treaties with chiefs in what is now MalawiJ McCracken, (2012). \\"A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966\\", pp. 52‚Äì3 Johnston met Serpa Pinto in August 1889 east of the Ruo and advised him not to cross the river, but Serpa Pinto disregarded this and crossed the river to Chiromo, now in Malawi.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 53, 55 In September, following minor clashes between Serpa Pinto's force and local Africans, Johnston's deputy declared a Shire Highlands Protectorate, despite the contrary instructions.M Newitt, (1995). \\"A History of Mozambique\\", p 346.

(1970). Johnston's Administration: 1891‚Äì1897. Malawi Government Ministry of Local Government, Department of Antiquities, p. 21. By that time he had already selected a team of men who were to assist in forming the administration of the new protectorate. They included Alfred Sharpe (Johnston's Deputy Commissioner), Bertram L. Sclater (Surveyor, Roadmaker, and Commandant of the Constabulary), Alexander Whyte (a zoologist who was to discover several new species in Nyasaland), Cecil Montgomery Maguire (Military Commandant), Hugh Charlie Marshall (Customs Officer, Collector of Revenues and Postmaster for the Chiromo district), John Buchanan (an agriculturalist who had been in Nyasaland since 1876, and was appointed Vice Consul by Johnston), and others. In 1891, Johnston only controlled a fraction of the Shire Highlands, itself a small part of the whole protectorate. He was provided with a small force of Indian troops in 1891, and began to train African soldiers and police. At first, Johnston used his small force in the south of the protectorate to suppress slave trading by Yao chiefs, who had established links with Swahili traders in ivory and slaves from the early 19th century. As the Yao people had no central authority, Johnston was able to defeat one group at a time, although this took until 1894, as he left the most powerful chief, Makanjira, until almost last, starting an amphibious operation against him in late 1893.J McCraken, (2012). \\"A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966\\" pp. 58‚Äì62 Before the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in May 1891, a number of European companies and settlers had made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs under which the land owned by the African communities that occupied it was transferred to the Europeans in exchange for protection and some trade goods.B Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi: An Examination of the Colonial Legacy, The Journal of African History Vol. 14 p. 685 The African Lakes Company claimed over 2.75 million acres in the north of the protectorate, some under treaties that claimed to transfer sovereignty to the companyOwen J.

European Settlers, African Apprehensions, and Colonial Economic Policy: The North Nyasa Native Reserves Commission of 1929, The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 17, No. 4, p.642, and three others individuals claimed to have purchased large areas of land in the south. Eugene Sharrer claimed 363,034 acres, Alexander Low Bruce claimed 176,000 acres, and John Buchanan and his brothers claimed a further 167,823 acres. These lands were purchased for trivial quantities of goods under agreements signed by chiefs with no understanding of English concepts of land tenure.J McCraken, (2012). \\"A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966\\", pp. 77‚Äì8.Sir Harry Johnston, (1897). \\"British Central Africa\\", p. 85. Johnston had the task of reviewing these land claims, and began to do so in late 1892, as the proclamation of the protectorate had been followed by a wholesale land grab, with huge areas of land bought for trivial sums and some claims overlapping. He rejected any suggestion that treaties made before the protectorate was established could transfer sovereignty to individuals or companies, but accept that they could be evidence of land sales. Although Johnston accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, so their chiefs had no right to alienate it, he suggested that each community had given their chief this right. Despite having no legal training, he claimed that, as Commissioner, he was entitled to investigate these land sales and to issue Certificates of Claim registering freehold title to the European claimants. He rejected very few claims, despite the questionable evidence for several major ones. The existing African villages and farms were exempted from these sales, and the villagers were told that their homes and fields were not being alienated. Despite this, the concentration of much of the most fertile land in the Shire Highlands in the hands of European owners had profound economic consequences that lasted throughout the colonial period.Sir Harry Johnston, (1897). \\"British Central Africa\\", pp. 112‚Äì13B. Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi, pp. 682‚Äì3, 685 In April 1894 Johnston returned to England and was away for a year. He had quarrelled with Cecil Rhodes who had so far provided most of his funds, and during the first three years the administration had run up a deficit of ¬£20,000. During his leave he managed to persuade the British Government to agree to take over the financing of the country. On his way back he visited Egypt and India with a view to recruiting soldiers, and eventually arrived back in Nyasaland with a flotilla of boats, 202 Sikh soldiers, and over 400 other men. 4000 porters were recruited in the Shire Highlands to carry stores and equipment. Johnston reached Zomba on 3 May 1895.Baker, C.A. (1970). Johnston's Administration: 1891‚Äì1897. Malawi Government Ministry of Local Government, Department of Antiquities, pp. 42‚Äì4. Johnston visited Karonga in June 1895 to try to make a settlement but the Swahili leaders refused either to meet him curtail their raiding activities, so Johnston decided on military action.P. T. Terry, (1965). The Arab War on Lake Nyasa 1887‚Äì1895 Part II, pp. 43‚Äì4 In November 1895, Johnston he embarked a force of over 400 Sikh and African riflemen, with artillery and machine guns on steamers to Karonga and surrounded the traders' main stockaded town, bombarding it for two days and finally assaulting it on 4 December. The Swahili leader, Mlozi was captured, given a cursory trial and hanged on 5 December and between 200 and 300 of fighters and several hundred non- combatants were killed, many while attempting to surrender. Other Swahili stockades did not resist and were destroyed.J McCraken, (2012). \\"A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966\\" pp. 61‚Äì3 North-Eastern Rhodesia and Nyasaland Johnston realised the strategic importance of Lake Tanganyika to the British, especially since the territory between the lake and the coast had become German East Africa forming a break of nearly 900 km in the chain of British colonies in the Cape to Cairo dream. However the north end of Lake Tanganyika was only 230 km from British-controlled Uganda, and so a British presence at the south end of the lake was a priority. Although the northern boundaries of North-Eastern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were eventually settled by negotiations between Britain, Germany. Portugal and the Congo Free State, Johnston ensured that British bomas were established (in addition to those in Nyasaland) east of Luapula-Mweru at Chiengi and the Kalungwishi River, at the south end of Lake Tanganyika at Abercorn, and at Fort Jameson between Mozambique and the Luangwa valley to demonstrate effective occupation. A. Keppel-Jones, (1983). Rhodes and Rhodesia, 1884‚Äì1902, pp. 549‚Äì50, Kingston, McGill-Queen's University Press Until 1899, Johnson had administrative control the territory which became North-Eastern Rhodesia (the north-eastern half of today's Zambia), and he helped to set up and oversee the British South Africa Company's administration in that area. North-Eastern Rhodesia was little developed in this period, being regarded principally as a labour reserve, with only a handful of company administrators.E. A. Walker, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire, Volume 1 pp. 696‚Äì7, Cambridge University Press Although he missed out in Katanga, altogether he helped to consolidate an area of nearly half a million square kilometres into the British Empire ‚Äì nearly , or twice the area of the United Kingdom in 2009 ‚Äì lying between the lower Luangwa River valley and lakes Nyasa, Tanganyika, and Mweru. Later years Okapi, from an original painting by Johnston, based on preserved skins (1901) In 1896 in recognition of this achievement he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), but afflicted by tropical fevers, transferred to Tunis as consul-general. In the same year, he had married the Hon. Winifred Mary Irby, daughter of Florance George Henry Irby, fifth Baron Boston.Obituary, (1927). Sir Harry H. Johnston, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 70, No. 4, pp. 415‚Äì416. In 1899 Sir Harry was sent to Uganda as special commissioner to reorganize the administration of that protectorate after the suppression of the mutiny of the Sudanese soldiers and to end an ongoing war with Unyoro. He improved the colonial administration, and concluded the Buganda Agreement of 1900, dividing the land between the UK and the chiefs. For his services in Uganda, he received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the King's Birthday Honours list in November 1901. Also in 1901, Johnston was the first recipient of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Livingstone Medal,RSGS memorial to recipients of the Livingstone Medal and in the following year he was appointed a member of the council of the Zoological Society of London. He received the honorary degree Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the University of Cambridge in May 1902. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their 1904 Founder's Gold Medal for his services to African exploration. In 1902 his wife gave birth to twin boys, but neither survived more than a few hours, and they had no more children. His sister, Mabel Johnston, married Arnold Dolmetsch, an instrument maker and member of the Bloomsbury set, in 1903. In 1903 and in 1906 he stood for parliament for the Liberal Party, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. In 1906, the Johnstons moved to the hamlet of Poling, near Arundel in West Sussex, where Harry Johnston largely concentrated on his literary endeavours. He took to writing novels, which were frequently short-lived, while his accounts of his own voyages through central Africa were rather more enduring. Wall plaque erected to the memory of Sir Harry Johnston in the church of St Nicholas, Poling, West Sussex. Designed and cut by Eric Gill Harry Johnston suffered two strokes in 1925, from which he became partially paralysed and never recovered, dying two years later in 1927 at Woodsetts House near Worksop in Nottinghamshire. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Poling, West Sussex, where there is a commemorative wall plaque within the nave of the church designed and cut by the Arts and Crafts sculptor and typeface designer Eric Gill who lived in nearby Ditchling. Legacy Harry Johnston is commemorated in the scientific names of the okapi, Okapia johnstoni and of two species of African lizards, Trioceros johnstoni and Latastia johnstoni.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The falls at Mambidima on the Luapula River were named Johnston Falls by the British in his honour. Sir Harry Johnston Primary school in Zomba, Malawi is also named after him. Prominent Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay mentioned the influence of Sir H. H. Johnston's works, one of many, in helping him portray scenes convincingly in his famous Bengali adventure novel Chander Pahar.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin South-Central constituency from 1965 to 1969, 1977 to 1981 and 1982 to 1989. Cluskey was born on 8 April 1930 in Dublin, and was educated at St. Vincent's C.B.S. in Glasnevin. He worked as a butcher and then joined the Labour Party. He quickly became a branch secretary in the Workers' Union of Ireland. At the 1965 general election he was elected as a Labour Party Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin South-Central constituency. In 1968 he was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin. In 1973 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Brendan Corish. He introduced sweeping reforms to the area while he held that position. He played a leading role in initiating the EU Poverty Programmes. The Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party coalition was defeated at the 1977 general election resulting in the resignation of Brendan Corish as Labour Party leader. Cluskey was elected the new leader of the Labour Party. In 1981, the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael. However Cluskey had lost his seat in D√°il √âireann at the 1981 general election and with it the party leadership. He was appointed on 1 July 1981 as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Dublin, replacing Michael O'Leary, who had resigned the seat after succeeding Cluskey as Labour leader. The coalition government fell in January 1982 over a budget dispute, and Cluskey was re-elected to the D√°il at the February 1982 general election. When the coalition returned to office after the November 1982 election, Cluskey was appointed as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. He then resigned from the European Parliament, to be replaced by Brendan Halligan. On 8 December 1983 he resigned as Minister due to a fundamental disagreement over government policy about the Dublin Gas Company. He retained his D√°il seat in the 1987 general election. Following his re-election his health deteriorated. He died on 7 May 1989 after a long battle with cancer.

He was the leader of the Monaghan Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and a prominent figure in the Ulster IRA during the Irish War of Independence. In this capacity he became Chief of Staff of the IRA in 1922. He was one of the Irish republicans who along with Michael Collins accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought as a General in the Irish Civil War on the pro-Treaty side. O'Duffy became the second Commissioner of the Garda S√≠och√°na, the police force of the new Irish Free State, after the Civic Guard Mutiny and the subsequent resignation of Michael Staines. He had been an early member of Sinn F√©in, founded by Arthur Griffith. He was elected as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Monaghan, his home county, during the 1921 election. After a split in 1923 he became associated with Cumann na nGaedheal and led the movement known as the Blueshirts. After the merger of various pro-Treaty factions under the banner of Fine Gael, O'Duffy was the party leader for a short time. A fascist, O'Duffy was attracted to various fascist movements on the continent. He raised the Irish Brigade to fight for Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War as an act of Catholic solidarity and was inspired by Benito Mussolini's Italy to found the National Corporate Party. During the Second World War, he offered to Nazi Germany the prospect of raising an Irish Brigade to participate in the fight against the Soviet Union, but this was not taken up. O'Duffy was active in multiple sporting bodies, including the GAA and the Irish Olympic Council. Early life Eoin O'Duffy was born Owen Duffy in Lough Egish, near Castleblayney, County Monaghan, on 28 January 1890 to an impoverished smallholder family. He was the youngest of seven children. His father, also named Owen Duffy, had inherited his 15-acre farm from his father Peter in 1888, however the family were forced to farm conacre land and work on the roads to make ends meet. O'Duffy attended Laggan national school. He graduated to a school in Laragh where he developed an interest in the Gaelic Revival and attended night classes hosted by the Gaelic League.McGarry (2005), p. 5 He was close to his mother, Bridget Fealy, who died of cancer when he was 12.McGarry (2005), p. 6 O'Duffy was devastated by her death and he wore her ring for the rest of his life. In 1909, he sat the king's scholarship examination for St Patrick's College in Drumcondra, but as a place was not assured, he applied to become a clerk in the county surveyor's office in Monaghan. O'Duffy decided to pursue a career as a surveyor and came fifth in the local government board examination in 1912.McGarry (2005), p. 7 O'Duffy was appointed and moved to Newbliss to take up his new position.McGarry (2005), p. 8 He later secured a post as an engineer. Involvement in sport =Ulster GAA= O'Duffy was a leading member of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ulster. He was appointed secretary of the Ulster Provincial Council in 1912. He later served as Treasurer of the GAA Ulster Council from 1921 to 1934. His important role in developing the GAA in Ulster is memorialised by the O'Duffy Terrace at the principal provincial stadium, St Tiernach's Park in Clones, County Monaghan. In December 2009 a plaque was erected in memory of O'Duffy in Aughnamullen. The plaque was unveiled by the President of the Ulster GAA Council, Tom Daly. He was also a member of Harps' Gaelic football club. =Other sports= As well as being a prominent figure in Ulster GAA he was also active in other sports. He was President of the Irish Amateur Handball Association from 1926‚Äì34, the National Athletic and Cycling Association from 1931‚Äì34 (which he founded in 1922), and the Irish Olympic Council from 1931‚Äì32. O'Duffy believed in the ideal of \\"cleaned manliness\\". He said sport \\"cultivates in a boy habits of self-control [and] self-denial\\" and promotes \\"the cleanest and most wholesome of the instincts of youth\\". He said a lack of sport caused some boys to have \\"failed to keep their athleticism, but became weedy youths, smoking too soon, drinking too soon\\". Political activities =Irish Republican Army and Sinn F√©in= British Army intelligence file for Owen O'Duffy (Eoin O'Duffy) In 1917, O'Duffy joined the Irish Volunteers and took an active part in the Irish War of Independence, after that organisation became the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He rose rapidly through the ranks. He started off as the Section Commander of the Clones Company, then Captain, then Commandant and finally appointed Brigadier in 1919. He came to the attention of Michael Collins, who enrolled him in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and supported his advancement in the movement's hierarchy.Fearghal McGarry, 'O'Duffy, Eoin (1890‚Äì1944)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011McGarry (2005), p. 27 One year later, Collins described O'Duffy as \\"the best man in Ulster\\".McGarry (2005), p. 26 O'Duffy's senior involvement in the GAA and knowledge of Monaghan from his job as a surveyor proved invaluable for organisation and recruitment.McGarry (2005), p. 28 In 1918 O'Duffy became secretary of Sinn F√©in's north Monaghan area council.McGarry (2005), p. 32 On 14 September 1918 he and Daniel Hogan were arrested after a GAA match and charged with \\"illegal assembly\\". He was imprisoned in Belfast Prison and released on 19 November 1918. After his release O'Duffy focused on organising his brigade and built an effective intelligence network by cultivating contacts with susceptible RIC men. He was forced to go on the run after an RIC raid on his house in September 1919 but continued to draw his salary from the Monaghan county council.McGarry (2005), p. 42-43 On 15 February 1920, he (along with Ernie O'Malley) was involved in the first capture of a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks by the IRA in Ballytrain, in his native Monaghan. The raid boosted local IRA recruitment, shook RIC morale and resulted in the closure of many barracks in rural Monaghan.McGarry (2005), p. 48 O'Duffy was once again arrested and imprisoned in Belfast Prison, where he went on hunger strike.McGarry (2005), p. 49 He was released in June and arranged which Sinn F√©in candidates would stand in Monaghan during the 1920 Irish local elections.McGarry (2005), p. 50 O'Duffy's brigade started raiding the homes of Protestants for arms, increasing sectarian tensions.McGarry (2005), p. 52-53 Armed Orangemen begun parading the roads of Unionist areas and tit-for-tat killings occurred in reprisal for IRA casualties incurred during raids.McGarry (2005), p. 54 He supported the Belfast Boycott and his brigade began harassing of Protestant stores, burning delivery vans from Belfast, raiding trains carrying northern goods and sabotaging rail-tracks.McGarry (2005), p. 57 O'Duffy became more ruthless in 1921, intensifying attacks on British forces and executions of suspected informers and other opponents of the IRA.McGarry (2005), p. 58-64 When a Protestant trader named George Lester held up and searched two boys he suspected of being dispatch carriers for the IRA in February 1921, O'Duffy ordered his death. Lester was shot but survived his injury. In retaliation the B Specials invaded Rosslea on the 23rd of February and sacked the Catholic part of the town. One month later the IRA, commanded by O'Duffy, raided the town in reprisal, burning fourteen houses and killing three Protestants, two of them B Specials.McGarry (2005), p. 60 He became director of the army in 1921. In May 1921 he was returned as a Sinn F√©in TD for the Monaghan constituency to the Second D√°il. He was re-elected at the 1922 general election. In March 1921, he was made commander of the IRA's 2nd Northern Division. Following the Truce with the British in July 1921, he was sent to Belfast. After the rioting known as Belfast's Bloody Sunday, he was given the task of liaising with the British to try to maintain the Truce and defend Catholic areas against attack. During this time he gained the nickname \\"Give 'em the lead\\" after delivering a belligerent speech in South Armagh threatening that if unionists \\"decided they were against Ireland and against their fellow countrymen\\" the IRA would \\"have to use the lead against them\\".McGarry (2005), p. 78-80 He was Director of Organisation in Ulster and Chief Liaison officer for Ulster at the time the treaty was signed. In January 1922 he became IRA Chief of Staff, replacing Richard Mulcahy. O'Duffy was the youngest general in Europe until Francisco Franco was promoted to that rank. =Civil War General and Garda S√≠och√°na= O'Duffy in his uniform as Garda Commissioner, In 1921 he supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, being pessimistic about the IRA's chances should the war resume and seeing the treaty as a stepping stone to a republic.McGarry (2005), p. 91 On the 14th of January, Dan Hogan was arrested in Derry by the B Specials. In response O'Duffy proposed the kidnapping of a hundred prominent Orangemen in Fermanagh and Tyrone to Collins. The raid was executed on the 7th of February.McGarry (2005), p. 99 On the 22nd of April, O'Duffy accused Liam Lynch's 1st Southern Division of retaining arms intended for the Northern IRA. Lynch in turn blamed O'Duffy for the arms not reaching the north.McGarry (2005), p. 98 He served as a general in the National Army and was given control of the South-Western Command. In the ensuing Irish Civil War he was one of the architects behind the Free State's strategy of seaborne landings in Republican-held areas. He took Limerick for the Free State in July 1922, before being held up in the Battle of Killmallock south of the city. The enmities of the civil war era were to stay with O'Duffy throughout his political career. In September 1922, Minister for Home Affairs Kevin O'Higgins was experiencing indiscipline within the recently formed Garda S√≠och√°na and O'Duffy was appointed Garda Commissioner after resigning from the army in order to take up the position. O'Duffy was a fine organiser and has been given much of the credit for the emergence of a largely respected, non-political and unarmed police force. He insisted on a Catholic ethos to distinguish the Garda√≠ from their Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) predecessors, and regularly told members of the force they were not just men working an ordinary job, but policemen fulfilling their religious duty. He was also a vocal opponent of alcohol in the force, instructing Garda√≠ to avoid it all costs. In February, following a general election in 1933 √âamon de Valera dismissed O'Duffy as Garda Commissioner. In the D√°il de Valera explained the reason for his dismissal, stating \\"[O'Duffy] was likely to be biased in his attitude because of past political affiliations\\". The true reason, however, appears to have been the new government's discovery that in 1932, O'Duffy's was one of the voices urging W. T. Cosgrave to resort to a military coup rather than to turn over power to the incoming Fianna F√°il administration.McGarry (2005), p. 189 O'Duffy refused the offer of another position of equivalent rank in the public service.McGarry (2005), p. 197 Ernest Blythe said many years later that the outgoing Government had become so alarmed by O'Duffy's conduct that had they returned to power they would have also acted as De Valera did and dismissed O'Duffy as Garda Commissioner.McGarry ,pp188,386 =Leader of the Blueshirts= In July 1933 O'Duffy, urged by Blythe and Thomas F. O'Higgins, became leader of the Army Comrades Association, an organisation set up to protect Cumann na nGaedheal public meetings, which had been disrupted under the slogan \\"No Free Speech for Traitors\\" by Irish Republican Army members newly confident after the elections. O'Duffy and many other conservative elements within the Irish Free State began to embrace fascist ideology, which was in vogue at that time and O'Duffy was seen to be an ideal choice to lead the Blueshirts as he was considered charismatic, skilled in organising and also untainted by association with the failures of the previous Cumann na nGaedheal government.McGarry (2005), p. 207-208 O'Duffy was approved as leader of the ACA on 20 July.McGarry (2005), p. 209 He soon changed the name of this new movement to the National Guard. An admirer of the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, O'Duffy and his organisation adopted outward symbols of European fascism such as the straight-arm Roman salute and a distinctive blue uniform. It was not long before they became known as the Blueshirts, similar to the Italian Blackshirts and the German Brownshirts. O'Duffy established a weekly newspaper, the Blueshirt, and published a new constitution that promoted corporatism, Irish unification and opposition to \\"alien\\" control and influence.McGarry (2005), p. 210 In August 1933 a parade was planned by the Blueshirts in Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, both of whom had died 11 years earlier. This was an imitation of Mussolini's March on Rome and was perceived as such despite contrary claims. De Valera feared a similar coup d'√©tat as seen in Italy and the Special Branch raided the houses of prominent treatyites to seize their firearms.McGarry (2005), p. 216 On the 11th of August, de Valera reinstated the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act 1931, banned the parade and placed Garda√≠ outside of key locations.McGarry (2005), p. 217 On 22 August the Blueshirts were declared an illegal organisation.McGarry (2005), p. 218 To circumvent this ban the movement once again adopted a new name, this time styling itself the League of Youth. In 1933 a group of Irish republicans, one member of which was Dan Keating, planned to assassinate O'Duffy in Ballyseedy, County Kerry, while he would be on his way to a meeting. A man was sent to Limerick to find out which car O'Duffy would be travelling in but the man purposely gave false information and O'Duffy escaped. During the early stages of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935 O'Duffy offered Benito Mussolini the service of 1000 Blueshirts because he believed the war represented the struggle between civilisation and barbarism. On 18 September, in an interview he said that the Blueshirts were volunteering to fight \\"not for Italy or against Abyssinia, but for the principle of the corporate system\\" against which \\"the forces of both Marxism and of capitalism\\" were ranged. O'Duffy and some of his men also made an appearance at the 1934 International Fascist conference in Montreux where he argued against antisemitism, telling the conference that they had \\"no Jewish problem in Ireland\\" and that he \\"could not subscribe to the principle of the persecution of any race\\".McGarry (2005), p. 254 =Fine Gael= O'Duffy leading a salute with the Blueshirts, December 1934 On the 24th of August 1933, representatives of Cumann na nGaedheal and the National Centre Party approached O'Duffy, offering that the Blueshirts join their ranks in exchange for O'Duffy becoming their leader. On the 8th of September the Blueshirts, under pressure after de Valera's ban on the organisation, approved the merger and so Cumann na nGaedheal, the Centre Party and the Blueshirt movement merged to form Fine Gael.McGarry (2005), p. 219 O'Duffy, though not a TD, became the first leader, with former President of the Executive Council W. T. Cosgrave serving as parliamentary leader and Vice-President. The National Guard, now rechristened the Young Ireland Association, was transformed from an illegal paramilitary group into the militant wing of a political party. The new party's policy document, published in mid-November 1933, sought the reunification of Ireland within the British Commonwealth but made no mention of a corporatist parliament and committed itself to democracy. As a result, O'Duffy was forced to tone down his anti-democratic rhetoric though many of his Blueshirt colleagues continued to advocate authoritarianism.McGarry (2005), p. 222-223 Fine Gael meetings were often attacked by IRA members and O'Duffy's touring of rural towns resulted in tensions and violence.McGarry (2005), p. 225 On 6 October 1933 O'Duffy was involved in disturbances in Tralee during which he was hit with a hammer on the head and had his car torched as he attempted to attend a Fine Gael convention. De Valera used the violence to justify a crackdown on Blueshirt activities. A raid on the Young Ireland Association found evidence that it was the National Guard under another name, and the organisation was once again banned.McGarry (2005), p. 226 O'Duffy responded with a speech in Ballyshannon where referred to himself as a republican and declared that \\"whenever Mr de Valera runs away from the Republic and arrests you Republicans, and puts you on board beds in Mountjoy, he is entitled to the fate he gave Mick Collins and Kevin O‚ÄôHiggins\\".McGarry (2005), p. 227 O'Duffy was arrested by the Garda√≠ several days later.McGarry (2005), p. 228 He was initially released on appeal but was summoned to appear before the Military Tribunal two days later and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and incitement to murder the president of the executive council, however they unable to convict him of either charges.McGarry (2005), p. 229-230 O'Duffy proved an unsuitable leader: he was a soldier rather than a politician, and was temperamental. He resented Cumann na nGaedheal's drift from republicanism following Collins' death and insisted that Fine Gael would not \\"play second fiddle to anybody in the matter of Nationality\\".McGarry (2005), p. 235 O'Duffy's nationalistic views alienated ex-Unionists who had supported Cumann na nGaedheal since the civil war, alarmed pro-Commonwealth moderates in Fine Gael, and resulted in O'Duffy being made the subject of an exclusion order in Northern Ireland.McGarry (2005), p. 239 O'Duffy also clashed with his party on economic matters. Whereas Fine Gael favoured a return to pasture farming and free trade, O'Duffy was supportive of the experiments in tillage and protectionism implemented by his Fianna F√°il rivals, and was forced to attempt to compromise between the two.McGarry (2005), p. 241-243 His Fine Gael colleagues who regarded themselves as defenders of law-and-order were embarrassed by the Blueshirts use of violence and attacks on the Garda√≠, in addition to O'Duffy's connections with foreign fascist organisations and his view of the IRA as a communist group. O'Duffy's prestige was damaged when Fine Gael won only eight seats to Fianna F√°il's fifteen in the 1934 Irish local elections. The cost of Blueshirt activism also began to strain the party financially.McGarry (2005), p. 260 O'Duffy's approval of illegal agitation against the collection of land annuities by the government, declaration of his support for a republic and the revelation of his connections with the British Union of Fascists and the Fedrelandslaget were the last straws for moderates in Fine Gael. On 5 and 7 September 1934 Cosgrave, Ned Cronin and James Dillon met O'Duffy resulting in an agreement that O'Duffy could \\"deliver only carefully prepared and concise speeches from manuscripts\\" and give interviews \\"only after consultation and in writing\\". In response O'Duffy resigned from the party on the 18th of September.McGarry (2005), p. 261-265 After his resignation, O'Duffy denounced Fine Gael as \\"the pan-British party of the Free State\\" and claimed he resigned \\"because he was not prepared to lead the League of Youth with the Union Jack tied to his neck\\".McGarry (2005), p. 240 =Spanish Civil War= At first, O'Duffy announced to the press that \\"he was glad to be out of politics\\" but in October 1934 he announced his intentions to lead the Blueshirts as an independent movement. The Blueshirts split into two factions, one supporting O'Duffy and the other supporting Ned Cronin's leadership.McGarry (2005), p. 270 O'Duffy and Cronin toured the country attempting to win the support of local Blueshirt branches.McGarry (2005), p. 271 By 1935 the Blueshirts had disintegrated. Seeking to regain his former political influence, O'Duffy attempted to court the IRA, encouraging his followers to wear Easter lilies and desist from informing on republicans.McGarry (2005), p. 279 In June 1935 O'Duffy launched the National Corporate Party, a fascist political party inspired by Italy's Mussolini. The following year he organised an Irish Brigade to fight for Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He was motivated to do so by Ireland's historic link with Spain, his devout anti-communism and a will to defend Catholicism, stating ‚ÄúIt is not a conflict between fascism and anti- fascism but between Christ and anti-christ‚Äù. In London in September 1936 O'Duffy met Juan de la Cierva and Emilio Mola, promising he would recruit an Irish contingent to fight against the Republicans.Fearghal McGarry, Irish Politics and the Spanish Civil War, p.27 Despite the Irish Government advising against participation in the war, 700 of O'Duffy's followers went to Spain to fight on Franco's side. He later stated he had received over 7,000 applications but several complications meant only 700 of these made it to Spain. O'Duffy's men saw little fighting and were sent home by Franco, returning in June 1937.Thomas Gunning, former secretary to O'Duffy, was also a \\"suspect\\" for Irish Military Intelligence (G2), having remained in Spain after the rest of the Irish volunteers for Franco departed under a cloud of recrimination. Gunning worked as a newspaper correspondent in Spain for a short time then made his way to Berlin, where he worked for the Propaganda Ministry until his death in 1940. Franco had not been impressed by the Brigade's lack of military expertise and there were bitter arguments among O'Duffy and his officers about the direction of the Brigade. Later life and death O'Duffy returned to Ireland from Spain in disarray. He wrote a book, Crusade in Spain (1938), about the Irish Brigade in Spain. The book had antisemitic undertones; O'Duffy wrote that trade unions are \\"powerful political Jewish-Masonic organisations, directed and focused by the Communist International.\\" He later congratulated General Franco for winning the Spanish Civil War; Franco thanked O'Duffy for his sending congratulations \\"on the victory of the Spanish Army in defence of Christianity, occidental civilisation and humanity, over the forces of destruction and disorder.\\" In 1936 O'Duffy attended the founding meeting of Cumann Poblachta na h√âireann but never became a member. In 1940 he also attended the founding meeting of C√≥ras na Poblachta along with former leaders of the Irish Christian Front.McGarry (2005), p. 332 In 1939 The Irish Times reported that O'Duffy and his followers were trying to set up a new organisation however nothing materialised. He was subsequently put under surveillance by the G2. In February 1939 he met up with Oskar Pfaus, a German spy whom he put in touch with the IRA. He also met the Italian diplomat Vincenzo Berardis. Berardis assessed O'Duffy as being a committed fascist and noted his approval of the S-Plan and his opposition to de Valera's coercion against the IRA.McGarry (2005), p. 324 A month later O'Duffy met Berardis again to solicit his support for a new fascist party that would unite Irish fascists and republicans.McGarry (2005), p. 325 He is thought to have met with several leading IRA figures and German diplomat Eduard Hempel in a remote corner of Donegal during the summer of 1939. G2 suspected O'Duffy was \\"flirting with the IRA\\" by acting as a negotiator between them and the Germans. At one point O'Duffy was offered a position as an IRA intelligence officer and on another occasion he was invited to join former IRA Chiefs of Staff Moss Twomey and Andy Cooney in a protest against the \\"Yankee invasion of the Six Counties\\" in the summer of 1941.McGarry (2005), p. 338 In early November 1940 O'Duffy spoke with German spy Hermann Goertz in a meeting arranged by Seamus O'Donovan. O'Duffy made a good impression on Goertz and put him in contact with General Hugo MacNeill, who met with O'Duffy and German diplomat Henning Thomsen the next month to draw up a bilateral understanding between the Irish army and Germany in the event of a British invasion of Ireland.McGarry (2005), p. 336 In the summer of 1943 O'Duffy approached the German Legation in Dublin with an offer to organise an Irish Volunteer Legion for use on the Eastern Front. He explained his offer to the German ambassador as a wish to \\"save Europe from Bolshevism\\". He requested an aircraft to be sent from Germany so that he could conduct the necessary negotiations in Berlin. The offer was \\"not taken seriously\\".See Stephan, Enno: Spies in Ireland (1963) P.232 By this time O'Duffy had developed a serious drinking problem and his health had begun to seriously deteriorate; he died on 30 November 1944, aged 54. He received a state funeral. Following Requiem Mass in St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, he was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

Early life and career Vincent Lopez was born of Portuguese immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York Distinguished Americans & Canadians of Portuguese Descent and was leading his own dance band in New York City by 1917. On November 27, 1921 his band began broadcasting on the new medium of entertainment radio; the band's weekly 90-minute show on the Newark, New Jersey, station WJZ boosted the popularity of both himself and of radio.Pat Browne,The guide to United States popular culture. Popular Press, 2001, p.611. Craig's Big Bands and Big Names, Lopezknightstemplar.org, Brother Vincent Lopez: Anatomy of a Band Leader He became one of America's most popular bandleaders, and would retain that status through the 1940s. He began his radio programs by announcing \\"Lopez speaking!\\". His theme song was \\"Nola\\", Felix Arndt's novelty ragtime piece of 1915, and Lopez became so identified with it that he occasionally satirized it. (His 1939 movie short for Vitaphone, Vincent Lopez and his Orchestra, features the entire band singing \\"Down with Nola\\".) Lopez worked occasionally in feature films, notably The Big Broadcast (1932) and as a live- action feature in the Max Fleischer cartoon I Don't Want to Make History (1936). In 1940, he was one of the first bandleaders to work in Soundies movie musicals. He made additional Soundies in 1944. Noted musicians who played in his band included Artie Shaw, Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Mike Mosiello, Fred Lowery, and Glenn Miller. He also featured singers Keller Sisters and Lynch, Betty Hutton, and Marion Hutton. Lopez's longtime drummer was the irreverent Mike Riley, who popularized the novelty hit \\"The Music Goes Round and Round\\". Lopez's flamboyant style of piano playing influenced such later musicians as Eddy Duchin and Liberace. In 1941 Lopez's Orchestra began a residency at the Taft Hotel in Manhattan that would last 20 years. In the early 1950s, Lopez along with Gloria Parker hosted a radio program broadcast from the Taft Hotel called Shake the Maracas in which audience members competed for small prizes by playing maracas with the orchestra. Vincent Lopez died at the Villa Maria nursing home in North Miami, Florida, on 20 September 1975.

It is a short connector between U.S. Route 9 in Middle Township and North Wildwood at New York Avenue. West of U.S. Route 9, the road continues to Route 47 as County Route 618 (Indian Trail Road); this route along with Route 147 provides an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47. East of New York Avenue, the route continues south through The Wildwoods as County Route 621 (New Jersey Avenue). The route passes through mostly marshland along its journey, intersecting the Garden State Parkway at a partial interchange and County Route 619 (Ocean Drive). The portion of the route east of the intersection with the latter forms a part of Ocean Drive. When the 500-series county routes were established in New Jersey in the 1950s, what is now Route 147 became a part of County Route 585, a route running from Lower Township north to Absecon. On November 1, 1971, Route 147 was designated along County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 and the North Wildwood border. The route was extended to its current location in North Wildwood by the 1990s. Route description alt=Route 147 heading westbound through the wetlandsRoute 147 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 in the Burleigh section of Middle Township, heading to the east along North Wildwood Boulevard, a two-lane undivided road. The road continues to the west of U.S. Route 9 as County Route 618 (Indian Trail Road) to Route 47. The road passes residences and businesses to the north and woodland to the south before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to and from the northbound direction of the parkway. Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 147 becomes a four-lane divided highway that briefly passes more homes and commercial establishments before entering a delta-type series of marshy rivers and inlets. It turns to the southeast and comes to an intersection with County Route 665 before crossing the Grassy Sound on a bridge. After the bridge, the route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of County Route 619 (Ocean Drive). At this point, the Ocean Drive moniker merges onto Route 147 and the road crosses over the Beach Creek into the Jersey Shore town of North Wildwood. Here, the route turns south and becomes Spruce Avenue, which heads between marshland to the west and homes to the east. At the intersection with West Angelsea Drive, Route 147 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues past more developments, turning to the southeast. Route 147 heads through a mix of residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue. From here, County Route 621 continues south along the roadway as New Jersey Avenue. Route 147, along with County Route 618, provide an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47. History View west along Route 147 at Delaware Avenue in North Wildwood What is now Route 147 was an unimproved road back in 1927. When the 500-series county routes were established in the 1950s, this road became a part of County Route 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of U.S. Route 9) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of County Route 18, which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47. On November 1, 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. In 1994, the current fixed-span steel girder bridge over the Grassy Sound was built. As a result of the bridge replacement, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood. In 2020, NJTA proposed a $10 million project to reconstruct the partial interchange between NJ 147 and the Garden State Parkway into a full interchange.https://www.njta.com/media/5179/proposed-2020-capital-improvement- program.pdf Major intersections See also * * References External links *NJ State Highways: 91-147 - Route 147 *New Jersey Roads: Route 147 *New Jersey Highway Ends: Route 147 *Speed Limits for State Roads: Route 147 Category:Intracoastal Waterway 147 Category:Transportation in Cape May County, New Jersey ","title":"New Jersey Route 147"},{"id":"264711","text":"Route 152 is a state highway in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States. Route 152 begins at an intersection with County Route 620 and County Route 635 in the city of Somers Point. The route heads along two causeways, ending at the foot of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway in Egg Harbor Township, where the state turns maintenance back to Atlantic County as County Route 629 to Longport. Route 152 originates as an alignment of Atlantic County Route 20, which ran along the entire alignment of Route 152 from Somers Point to Longport. The state took over Route 20 in 1969, designating the route as 152 in relation to the Route 52 designation further south. In 1988, the former bridge over the Broad Thoroughfare was demolished and replaced by the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge. Route description Route 152 heading westward towards the Broad Thoroughfare bridge Route 152 begins at an intersection with Atlantic County Route 620 (West Maryland Avenue) and 635 (Bay Avenue) in the city of Somers Point. The route heads eastward, passing to the north of a local marina as East Maryland Avenue, crossing over Bass Harbor Creek soon after. Just after crossing the creek, Route 152 leaves Somers Point, entering the community of Egg Harbor Township. On the other side of the creek, Route 152 becomes known as Longport-Somers Point Boulevard and heads along a causeway through Egg Harbor Township. The route passes to the north of a marina, curving soon after at an intersection with Anchorage Drive, which is a connector road to waterside residential homes. The east end of Route 152 in at CR 629 in Egg Harbor Township Route 152 continues eastward, crossing over several streams and passing to the north of a large estate. The route remains a two-lane causeway for a distance, intersecting with its former alignment to the south, which parallels the current route. Route 152 then rises in elevation as it heads onto the newer causeway (known as the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge), passing a lone fishing pier. After crossing over the Cooper Bridge, the highway parallels its former alignment for a short distance, intersecting with the Ocean Drive/Ocean City-Longport Boulevard. Route 152 heads along the Broad Thoroughfare as a three-lane waterside arterial boulevard. The route leaves the shoreline, running along the sandy surroundings. The route reaches Seaview Harbor, served by an intersection with Sunset Boulevard and Seaview Boulevard. Route 152 turns eastward, reaching the foot of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge. There, the state designation ends, and it continues as Atlantic County Route 629 (Ventnor Avenue) into Longport. The entire span of the Longport Bridge is accessible to pedestrians, runners, and bicycles, with dedicated lanes on each side. The bridge has been a featured route in running, walking, and cycling events including the Bike MS: City to Shore Ride. History The old alignment of Route 152, now a fishing pier In 1916, the causeway connecting Somers Point and Longport opened. The current alignment of Route 152 originates as a state takeover of Atlantic County Route 20, which was first brought to the floor of the New Jersey State Legislature in 1968. The state approved the measure, and effective January 19, 1969, the New Jersey Department of Transportation took over maintenance of County Route 20. The alignment was designated as Route 152, numbered after nearby New Jersey Route 52 to the south in Somers Point and Ocean City. Route 152 originally went along a lower wooden bridge across the Broad Thoroughfare. At least six people drowned from traffic accidents along the bridge from 1976 to 1986. Atlantic County Assemblywoman Dolores G. Cooper helped secure state funding for a new bridge, which opened September 1988 at a cost of $21 million. The new bridge was completed to the north of the former route. The former alignment to the south, designated as Old Road, is currently being demolished with the former fishing pier as of 2017. The route has remained intact virtually since 1988. In 1994, the new bridge was named the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge. The original alignment of Route 152 was designated by 1953 from Route 29 (which at the time went east via Memorial Drive and Lafayette Street to US 206) in Trenton to US 1 in Trenton. This became part of rerouted Route 29 by 1969, while the old route of Route 29 was given to the city.

The route begins at an intersection with County Route 561 in Cherry Hill, heading northward to the site of the former Ellisburg Circle, where Route 154 reaches its northern terminus at New Jersey Route 41 (Kings Highway) and New Jersey Route 70. The route ends concurrent with Route 41 for the short distance from the junction between the two routes. Brace Road is the local name for Route 154 for its entire length. Route 154 is an original portion of State Highway Route 41, defined in the 1927 renumbering. The route remained intact for several decades, until the construction of a bypass around Haddonfield. By the time of the 1953 renumbering on January 1, 1953, Route 41 was realigned onto a county-maintained roadway, signed as Temporary 41, while the former alignment went unnumbered. During the 1960s, the old alignment was designated as Route 154, but was unsigned until 1992. From 1984 to 1992, the New Jersey Department of Transportation removed the Ellisburg Circle, built in 1938 at Route 154's northern terminus. Route description View north at the south end of Route 154 at CR 561 in Cherry Hill Route 154 begins at an intersection with County Route 561 (Haddonfield-Berlin Road) in the community of Cherry Hill. The site of the former Cherry Hill Arena, now occupied by a shopping center, lies on the route's east side at its beginning. The highway progresses northward as Brace Road, passing through some large commercial districts and to the east of Tyndall Village. The route continues, passing several small commercial businesses until approaching an intersection with Camden County Route 671 in the northeast portion of Tyndall Village. Route 154 continues northward, passing to the east of several more commercial buildings, while the surroundings become all fields to the northwest and east for a short distance. The route continues northward, passing Kingsway Circle Park before becoming moderately developed with homes and businesses. After the intersection with Munn Lane West, Route 154 becomes surrounded by large, deep patches of trees until the intersection with Kenwood Drive, where residential homes return. At the intersection, Route 154 gains its own service road for the local residences, which terminate a block away. A short distance later, Route 41 comes in from the west and becomes concurrent with Route 154 for a short distance. Passing some large businesses in Ellisburg, a part of Cherry Hill, Route 41 and Route 154 intersect with Route 70, where Route 154's designation terminates. History The alignment of Route 154 was originally a stretch of State Highway Route 41 through Cherry Hill and Ellisburg assigned in the 1927 renumbering of state highways. The route went from its current alignment along former State Highway Route 25 to current Route 154 instead of via the Kings Highway. The route remained intact until plans for a bypass around Haddonfield arose in 1929. By the second state highway renumbering in 1953, the bypass around Haddonfield had only been partially built, so instead, the New Jersey State Highway Department realigned Route 41 onto the Kings Highway, leaving the former route unnumbered. The route remained unnumbered until the 1960s, when it was given the designation of Route 154. In 1938, the State Highway Department tore down the Ellisburg General Store, a market located at the intersection of then-Route 41 and Route 40 (now Route 70) to construct a new traffic circle at the junction. This circle, known as the Ellisburg Circle, was removed in 1992, while plans arose in the late 1980s to remove the congested circle, hosting the junctions of Route 154, 41 and 70. The impetus to remove the structure and replace it with a four-way intersection was produced in 1987, with a cost of $8 million (1987 USD) to rebuild.

Known for her powerful delivery of comical and risqu√© songs, she was one of the most popular entertainers in America during the first half of the 20th century. She was widely known by the superlative nickname \\"The Last of the Red Hot Mamas\\". Early life Tucker was born Sofia Kalish (in Ukrainian, –°–æ—Ñi—è ¬´–°–æ–Ω—è¬ª –ö–∞–ª–∏—à) in 1886 to a Jewish family in Tulchyn, Podolia Governorate, Ukraine, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. (Sonya is a nickname for Sofia in both Russian and Ukrainian, as well as for Sofya, the Yiddish form of the name Sophia.) They arrived in Boston on September 26, 1887. The family adopted the surname Abuza before immigrating, her father fearing repercussions for having deserted the Russian military. The family lived in Boston's North End for eight years before settling in Hartford, Connecticut, and opening a restaurant. At a young age, she began singing at her parents' restaurant for tips. Between taking orders and serving customers, Tucker recalled: \\"[I] would stand up in the narrow space by the door and sing with all the drama I could put into it. At the end of the last chorus, between me and the onions there wasn't a dry eye in the place.\\" In 1903, around the age of 17, Tucker eloped with Louis Tuck, a beer cart driver, from whom she would later derive her professional surname. When she returned home, her parents arranged an Orthodox wedding for the couple. In 1905, she gave birth to a son, Albert. However, shortly after Albert was born, the couple separated and Tucker left the baby with her family to move to New York. Career After she left her husband, Willie Howard gave Tucker a letter of recommendation to Harold Von Tilzer, a composer and theatrical producer in New York. When it failed to bring her work, Tucker found jobs in caf√©s and beer gardens, singing for food and tips from the customers. She sent most of what she made back home to Connecticut to support her son and family. =Stage= In 1907, Tucker made her first theater appearance, singing at an amateur night in a vaudeville establishment. It was here her producers thought that the crowd would tease her for being \\"so big and ugly.\\" Tucker also began integrating \\"fat girl\\" humor, which became a common thread in her acts. Her songs included \\"I Don't Want to Get Thin\\" and \\"Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love.\\" Tucker's 1926 song, \\"Some of These Days\\". In 1909, Tucker performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. Though she was a hit, the other female stars refused to share the spotlight with her, and the company was forced to let her go. This caught the attention of William Morris, a theater owner and future founder of the William Morris Agency, which would become one of the largest and most powerful talent agencies of the era. Two years later, Tucker released \\"Some of These Days\\" on Edison Records, written by Shelton Brooks. The title of the song was later used as the title of Tucker's 1945 biography. In 1921, Tucker hired pianist and songwriter Ted Shapiro as her accompanist and musical director, a position he would keep throughout her career. Besides writing a number of songs for her, Shapiro became part of her stage act, playing piano on stage while she sang, and exchanging banter and wisecracks with her in between numbers. Tucker remained a popular singer through the 1920s and became friends with stars such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, who introduced her to jazz. Tucker learned from these talented women and became one of the first performers to introduce jazz to white vaudeville audiences. In 1925, Jack Yellen wrote one of her most famous songs, \\"My Yiddishe Momme\\". The song was performed in large American cities where there were sizable Jewish audiences. Tucker explained, \\"Even though I loved the song and it was a sensational hit every time I sang it, I was always careful to use it only when I knew the majority of the house would understand Yiddish. However, you didn't have to be a Jew to be moved by My Yiddishe Momme.\\" During the Hitler regime, the song was banned by the German government for evoking Jewish culture. =Popularity= By the 1920s, Tucker's success had spread to Europe, and she began a tour of England, performing for King George V and Queen Mary at the London Palladium in 1926. Tucker re- released her hit song \\"Some of These Days\\", backed by Ted Lewis and his band, which stayed at the number 1 position of the charts for five weeks beginning November 23, 1926.CD liner notes. Chart-Toppers of the Twenties, 1998, ASV. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Tucker in the 1920s Tucker was strongly affected by the decline of vaudeville. Speaking about performing in the final show at E. F. Albee's Palace in New York City, she remarked, \\"Everyone knew the theater was to be closed down, and a landmark in show business would be gone. That feeling got into the acts. The whole place, even the performers, stank of decay. I seemed to smell it. It challenged me. I was determined to give the audience the idea: why brood over yesterday? We have tomorrow. As I sang I could feel the atmosphere change. The gloom began to lift, the spirit which formerly filled the Palace and which made it famous among vaudeville houses the world over came back. That's what an entertainer can do.\\" My Pet sung by Sophie Tucker in 1928 with the Ted Shapiro Orchestra In 1929, she made her first movie appearance, in the sound picture Honky Tonk. During the 1930s, Tucker brought elements of nostalgia for the early years of 20th century into her show. She was billed as \\"The Last of the Red Hot Mamas\\", as her hearty sexual appetite was a frequent subject of her songs, unusual for female performers of the day after the decline of vaudeville. The cartoon The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos caricatures Tucker as \\"Sophie Turkey\\". =American Federation of Actors= In 1938, Tucker was elected president of the American Federation of Actors, an early actors' trade union. Originally formed for vaudeville and circus performers, the union expanded to include nightclub performers and was chartered as a branch of the Associated Actors and Artistes. In 1939, the union was disbanded by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) for financial mismanagement. However, Tucker was not implicated in the proceedings. The AFL later issued a charter for the succeeding American Guild of Variety Artists, which remains active. =Later days= In 1938‚Äì1939 she had her own radio show, The Roi Tan Program with Sophie Tucker, broadcast on CBS for 15 minutes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. She made numerous guest appearances on such programs as The Andrews Sisters and The Radio Hall of Fame. In the 1950s and early 1960s Tucker, \\"The First Lady of Show Business\\", made frequent television appearances on many popular variety and talk shows of the day such as The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show. She remained popular abroad, performing for fanatical crowds in the music halls of London that were even attended by King George V. On April 13, 1963, a Broadway musical called \\"Sophie\\", based on her early life up until 1922, opened with Libi Staiger as the lead. It closed after eight performances.Sophie - Broadway Musical.

The marriage produced Tucker's only child, Albert. In 1906 the couple separated, and Tucker left Albert with her family, supporting them with money from her singing jobs in New York. They were divorced in May 1913. Albert was raised by his maternal aunt, Annie. Annie and Sophie had a close relationship and kept in touch with weekly letters. Her second marriage, to Frank Westphal (1917‚Äì20), her accompanist, and her third marriage, to Al Lackey (1928‚Äì34), her manager, both ended in divorce and produced no children. She blamed the failure of her marriages on the fact that she had been too adjusted to economic independence, saying, \\"Once you start carrying your own suitcase, paying your own bills, running your own show, you've done something to yourself that makes you one of those women men like to call 'a pal' and 'a good sport,' the kind of woman they tell their troubles to.

She also influenced Miami-based radio and television host-cum-singer Peppy Fields, sister of noted pianist Irving Fields, whom Variety and Billboard magazines called the \\"Sophie Tucker of Miami\\". Probably the greatest influence on Sophie's later song delivery was Clarice Vance (1870‚Äì1961). They appeared many times on the same vaudeville bill. Sophie made her first recordings in 1910, and Clarice made her final records in 1909. Clarice had perfected and was known for her subtle narrative talk-singing style that Sophie later used to her advantage when her vocal range became increasingly limited. At the time that Clarice Vance was using the narrative style it was unique to her among women entertainers. Legacy Tucker is briefly mentioned in the lyrics of the song \\"Roxie\\" from the musical Chicago (\\"And Sophie Tucker'll shit I know/To see her name get billed below/Foxy Roxie Hart\\") and was cited as the main influence for the character Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton.Chicago - The Musical.

Satellites can be polar orbiting, covering the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary, hovering over the same spot on the equator.NESDIS. Satellites. Retrieved on July 4, 2008. Meteorological satellites see more than clouds: city lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc. Other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites.

El Ni√±o and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. The Antarctic ozone hole is mapped from weather satellite data. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch. History The first television image of Earth from space from the TIROS-1 weather satellite in 1960 A mosaic of photographs of the United States from the ESSA-9 weather satellite, taken on June 26, 1969 As early as 1946, the idea of cameras in orbit to observe the weather was being developed. This was due to sparse data observation coverage and the expense of using cloud cameras on rockets. By 1958, the early prototypes for TIROS and Vanguard (developed by the Army Signal Corps) were created. The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched on February 17, 1959. It was designed to measure cloud cover and resistance, but a poor axis of rotation and its elliptical orbit kept it from collecting a notable amount of useful data. The Explorer VI and VII satellites also contained weather-related experiments. The first weather satellite to be considered a success was TIROS-1, launched by NASA on April 1, 1960. TIROS operated for 78 days and proved to be much more successful than Vanguard 2\\\\. TIROS paved the way for the Nimbus program, whose technology and findings are the heritage of most of the Earth-observing satellites NASA and NOAA have launched since then. Beginning with the Nimbus 3 satellite in 1969, temperature information through the tropospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant improvements to weather forecasts. The ESSA and NOAA polar orbiting satellites followed suit from the late 1960s onward. Geostationary satellites followed, beginning with the ATS and SMS series in the late 1960s and early 1970s, then continuing with the GOES series from the 1970s onward. Polar orbiting satellites such as QuikScat and TRMM began to relay wind information near the ocean's surface starting in the late 1970s, with microwave imagery which resembled radar displays, which significantly improved the diagnoses of tropical cyclone strength, intensification, and location during the 2000s and 2010s. Observation Observation is typically made via different 'channels' of the electromagnetic spectrum, in particular, the visible and infrared portions. Some of these channels include:EUMETSAT ‚Äì MSG Spectrum (PDF)EUMETSAT ‚Äì MFG Payload *Visible and Near Infrared: 0.6‚Äì1.6 Œºmfor recording cloud cover during the day *Infrared: 3.9‚Äì7.3 Œºm (water vapor), 8.7‚Äì13.4 Œºm (thermal imaging) =Visible spectrum= Visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours are easy to interpret even by the average person; clouds, cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms, lakes, forests, mountains, snow ice, fires, and pollution such as smoke, smog, dust and haze are readily apparent. Even wind can be determined by cloud patterns, alignments and movement from successive photos.A. F. Hasler, K. Palaniappan, C. Kambhammetu, P. Black, E. Uhlhorn, and D. Chesters.

Infrared satellite imagery can be used effectively for tropical cyclones with a visible eye pattern, using the Dvorak technique, where the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops can be used to determine its intensity (colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm).Chris Landsea.

Infrared pictures depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even El Ni√±o phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information. Types The geostationary Himawari 8 satellite's first true- colour composite PNG image Each meteorological satellite is designed to use one of two different classes of orbit: geostationary and polar orbiting. =Geostationary= Geostationary weather satellites orbit the Earth above the equator at altitudes of 35,880 km (22,300 miles). Because of this orbit, they remain stationary with respect to the rotating Earth and thus can record or transmit images of the entire hemisphere below continuously with their visible-light and infrared sensors. The news media use the geostationary photos in their daily weather presentation as single images or made into movie loops. These are also available on the city forecast pages of www.noaa.gov (example Dallas, TX). Several geostationary meteorological spacecraft are in operation. The United States' GOES series has three in operation: GOES-15, GOES-16 and GOES-17. GOES-16 and-17 remain stationary over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively. GOES-15 will be retired in early July 2019. Russia's new-generation weather satellite Elektro-L No.1 operates at 76¬∞E over the Indian Ocean. The Japanese have the MTSAT-2 located over the mid Pacific at 145¬∞E and the Himawari 8 at 140¬∞E. The Europeans have four in operation, Meteosat-8 (3.5¬∞W) and Meteosat-9 (0¬∞) over the Atlantic Ocean and have Meteosat-6 (63¬∞E) and Meteosat-7 (57.5¬∞E) over the Indian Ocean. China currently has three Fengyun (È£é‰∫ë) geostationary satellites (FY-2E at 86.5¬∞E, FY-2F at 123.5¬∞E, and FY-2G at 105¬∞E) operated. India also operates geostationary satellites called INSAT which carry instruments for meteorological purposes. =Polar orbiting= LEO weather satellites. Polar orbiting weather satellites circle the Earth at a typical altitude of 850 km (530 miles) in a north to south (or vice versa) path, passing over the poles in their continuous flight. Polar orbiting weather satellites are in sun- synchronous orbits, which means they are able to observe any place on Earth and will view every location twice each day with the same general lighting conditions due to the near-constant local solar time. Polar orbiting weather satellites offer a much better resolution than their geostationary counterparts due their closeness to the Earth. The United States has the NOAA series of polar orbiting meteorological satellites, presently NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 (POES) and NOAA-20 (JPSS). Europe has the Metop-A and Metop-B satellites operated by EUMETSAT. Russia has the Meteor and RESURS series of satellites. China has FY-3A, 3B and 3C. India has polar orbiting satellites as well. DMSP Turnstile antenna for reception of 137 MHz LEO weather satellite transmissions The United States Department of Defense's Meteorological Satellite (DMSP) can \\"see\\" the best of all weather vehicles with its ability to detect objects almost as 'small' as a huge oil tanker. In addition, of all the weather satellites in orbit, only DMSP can \\"see\\" at night in the visual. Some of the most spectacular photos have been recorded by the night visual sensor; city lights, volcanoes, fires, lightning, meteors, oil field burn-offs, as well as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis have been captured by this 450-mile-high space vehicle's low moonlight sensor. At the same time, energy use and city growth can be monitored since both major and even minor cities, as well as highway lights, are conspicuous. This informs astronomers of light pollution. The New York City Blackout of 1977 was captured by one of the night orbiter DMSP space vehicles. In addition to monitoring city lights, these photos are a life saving asset in the detection and monitoring of fires. Not only do the satellites see the fires visually day and night, but the thermal and infrared scanners on board these weather satellites detect potential fire sources below the surface of the Earth where smoldering occurs. Once the fire is detected, the same weather satellites provide vital information about wind that could fan or spread the fires. These same cloud photos from space tell the firefighter when it will rain. Some of the most dramatic photos showed the 600 Kuwaiti oil fires that the fleeing Army of Iraq started on February 23, 1991. The night photos showed huge flashes, far outstripping the glow of large populated areas. The fires consumed millions of gallons of oil; the last was doused on November 6, 1991. Uses Infrared image of storms over the central United States from the GOES-17 satellite Snowfield monitoring, especially in the Sierra Nevada, can be helpful to the hydrologist keeping track of available snowpack for runoff vital to the watersheds of the western United States. This information is gleaned from existing satellites of all agencies of the U.S. government (in addition to local, on-the-ground measurements). Ice floes, packs, and bergs can also be located and tracked from weather spacecraft. Even pollution whether it is nature-made or man-made can be pinpointed. The visual and infrared photos show effects of pollution from their respective areas over the entire earth. Aircraft and rocket pollution, as well as condensation trails, can also be spotted. The ocean current and low level wind information gleaned from the space photos can help predict oceanic oil spill coverage and movement. Almost every summer, sand and dust from the Sahara Desert in Africa drifts across the equatorial regions of the Atlantic Ocean. GOES-EAST photos enable meteorologists to observe, track and forecast this sand cloud. In addition to reducing visibilities and causing respiratory problems, sand clouds suppress hurricane formation by modifying the solar radiation balance of the tropics. Other dust storms in Asia and mainland China are common and easy to spot and monitor, with recent examples of dust moving across the Pacific Ocean and reaching North America. In remote areas of the world with few local observers, fires could rage out of control for days or even weeks and consume millions of acres before authorities are alerted. Weather satellites can be a tremendous asset in such situations. Nighttime photos also show the burn-off in gas and oil fields. Atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles have been taken by weather satellites since 1969.

Emperor Xiaowen implemented a drastic policy of sinicization, intending to centralize the government and make the multi-ethnic state easier to govern. These policies included changing artistic styles to reflect Chinese preferences and forcing the population to speak the language and to wear Chinese clothes. He compelled his own Xianbei people and others to adopt Chinese surnames, and changed his own family surname from Tuoba to Yuan. He also encouraged intermarriage between Xianbei and Han. In 494, Emperor Xiaowen moved the Northern Wei capital from Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi) to Luoyang, a city long acknowledged as a major center in Chinese history. The shift in the capital was mirrored by a shift in tactics from active defense to passive defense against the Rouran. While the capital was moved to Luoyang, the military elite remained centered at the old capital, widening the differences between the administration and the military. The population at the old capital remained fiercely conservative, while the population at Luoyang were much more eager to adopt Xiaowen's policies of sinicization. His reforms were met with resistance by the Xianbei elite. In 496, two plots by Xianbei nobles, one centered on his crown prince Yuan Xun, and one centered on his distant uncle Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÈ†§). By 497, Xiaowen had destroyed the conspiracies and forced Yuan Xun to commit suicide. Unfortunately for Emperor Xiaowen, his sinicization policies had their downsides‚Äînamely, he adopted the Jin Dynasty social stratification methods, leading to incompetent nobles being put into positions of power while capable men of low birth not being able to advance in his government. Further, his wholesale adoption of Han culture and fine arts caused the nobles to be corrupt in order to afford the lifestyles of the Han elite, leading to further erosion to effective rule. By the time of his grandson Emperor Xiaoming, Northern Wei was in substantial upheaval due to agrarian revolts, and by 534 had been divided into two halves, each of which would soon be taken over by warlords. One of Xiaowen's enduring legacies was the establishment of the equal-field system in China, a system of government- allotted land that would last until the An Shi Rebellion in the mid Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907).  Early life and regency of Emperor Xianwen  Tuoba Hong was born in 467, when his father Emperor Xianwen was himself young‚Äîat the age of 13, and not yet ruling by himself, but instead was emperor under the regency of Emperor Xianwen's stepmother Empress Dowager Feng. Tuoba Hong was Emperor Xianwen's oldest son. His mother, Consort Li, was the daughter of Li Hui, a mid-level official at the time, who was a brother of Emperor Xianwen's mother. Empress Dowager Feng, following Tuoba Hong's birth, ended her regency and returned power to Emperor Xianwen, while spending her time raising Tuoba Hong. In 469, at age two, Tuoba Hong was created crown prince. That same year, his mother Consort Li died‚Äîand while traditional histories did not describe how she died, it appeared likely that she was forced to commit suicide according to the Northern Wei tradition of forcing crown princes' mothers to commit suicide, for it was written that the entire palace mourned her bitterly. In 471, Emperor Xianwen, who favored Taoist and Buddhist philosophies, tired of the throne, and considered passing the throne to his uncle Tuoba Zitui (ÊãìÊãîÂ≠êÊé®) the Prince of Jingzhao. After opposition by virtually all high level officials, however, Emperor Xianwen was still resolved to pass the throne to someone else, but decided to instead yield the throne to Crown Prince Hong. He subsequently did so, and Crown Prince Hong took the throne as Emperor Xiaowen, while Emperor Xianwen took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor), although, due to Emperor Xiaowen's young age, Emperor Xianwen continued to be in actual control of important matters. When needed on the frontlines against Rouran, he conducted military campaigns himself, while leaving important officials in charge of the capital Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi) with Emperor Xiaowen. In 476, Empress Dowager Feng, resentful that Emperor Xianwen had put her lover Li Yi (ÊùéÂ•ï) to death in 470, had him assassinated. (Most historians, including Sima Guang, believed that she poisoned him, but another version indicated that Empress Dowager Feng readied assassins who, when Emperor Xianwen came to her palace to greet her, seized and smothered him.) She assumed regency over Emperor Xiaowen and assumed the title of Grand Empress Dowager.  Regency of Grand Empress Dowager Feng  After Grand Empress Dowager Feng re-assumed regency, she was said to be more dictatorial than she was before, but intelligent in her decisions and frugal in her living. Not only was she highly literate, but she also was capable in mathematics. However, she trusted several eunuchs and permitted them to interfere in governmental matters. Further, she greatly promoted her lovers Wang Rui (ÁéãÂè°) and Li Chong (ÊùéÊ≤ñ) ‚Äì both of whom were apparently talented officials, but whose promotions were beyond what their talents and contributions called for. She balanced her reputation by also promoting some honored officials who were not her lovers. Because she was concerned that she would be criticized for what was seen as immoral conduct, she punished those whom she perceived to be criticizing her or parodying her behavior with severe punishment, including death. One of her victims was Li Xin, who had contributed to her prior lover Li Yi's death, as she had Li Xin put to death in 477. Fearful that Emperor Xiaowen's mother's clan would try to take power, she falsely accused his grandfather Li Hui (ÊùéÊÉ†) the Prince of Nan Commandery of treason in 478 and had him and his clan slaughtered. She apparently accelerated the policy of Sinicization, which included social stratification, as she issued an edict in 478 requiring people to marry in their social classes. The Northern Wei started to arrange for Han Chinese elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba royal family in the 480s. Some Han Chinese exiled royalty fled from southern China and defected to the Xianbei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen were married to Han Chinese elites, the Han Chinese Liu Song royal Liu Hui ÂàòËæâ, married Princess Lanling Ëò≠ÈôµÂÖ¨‰∏ª of the Northern Wei,. Princess Huayang ËèØÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Sima Fei Âè∏È¶¨Êúè, a descendant of Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) royalty, Princess Jinan ÊøüÂçóÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Lu Daoqian ÁõßÈÅìËôî, Princess Nanyang ÂçóÈò≥ÈïøÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Xiao Baoyin ËêßÂÆùÂ§§, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei's sister the Shouyang Princess was wedded to The Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang's son Xiao Zong Ëï≠Á∂ú. In 479, after rival Liu Song's throne was usurped by the general Xiao Daocheng, who established Southern Qi as its Emperor Gao, Northern Wei commissioned Liu Chang (ÂäâÊò∂) the Prince of Danyang, a Liu Song prince who had fled to Northern Wei in 465, with an army and promising him support to rebuild Liu Song. However, Liu Chang's abilities were not up to task, and he was never able to gain much following in the border regions to mount a major drive to reestablish Liu Song. By 481, the campaign had fizzled.See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 135. Also in 481, the Buddhist monk Faxiu (Ê≥ïÁßÄ) tried to start a popular uprising at Pingcheng, but was discovered, captured, and executed. Some officials advocating the execution of all Buddhist monks, but Grand Empress Dowager Feng refused. Also that year, she started the building of her future tomb at Fang Mountain (ÊñπÂ±±), near Pingcheng, leaving instructions that after she died that it would be unnecessary for her to be buried with her husband Emperor Wengcheng, who was buried near the old Northern Wei capital Shengle (ÁõõÊ®Ç, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Later that year, a new criminal code that she commissioned Gao L√º to write was completed‚Äîwith 832 sections, 16 of them prescribing clan-slaughter as penalty, 235 of them prescribing personal death penalty, and 377 prescribing other forms of punishment. Sometime during Emperor Xiaowen's rise to power, Grand Empress Dowager Feng had him detained and considered deposing him in favor of his brother Tuoba Xi (ÊãìÊãîÁ¶ß), but her attendants persuaded her otherwise. While Grand Empress Dowager Feng never formally returned imperial powers to him, by about 483 he appeared to be fairly in control of the government, although Grand Empress Dowager Feng continued to retain substantial powers. Indeed, it was by her order that that year, after Emperor Xiaowen's concubine Consort Lin bore his oldest son, Tuoba Xun, Consort Lin was forced to commit suicide pursuant to Northern Wei customs. She raised Tuoba Xun herself. In 485, after Emperor Xiaowen created his younger brothers princes, Grand Empress Dowager Feng established an imperial school for these princes. In 486, perhaps as both a sign of Sinicization and demonstration of Emperor Xiaowen's authority, he began to assume traditional Chinese imperial clothing, including a robe with dragon patterns and a tasseled hat. As Emperor Xiaowen was raised by Grand Empress Dowager Feng, he also became very close to the family of her brother Feng Xi (È¶ÆÁÜô). For some time, he took two of his daughters as concubines, but one of them soon died of illness, and the other, Consort Feng Run, also suffered a major illness and was sent back to her father house, where she became a Buddhist nun. The power-sharing arrangement between stepgrandmother and stepgrandson could perhaps be illustrated by an incident in 489, when Emperor Wencheng's younger brothers Tuoba Tianci (ÊãìÊãîÂ§©Ë≥ú) the Prince of Ruyin and Tuoba Zhen (ÊãìÊãîÊ•®) the Prince of Nan'an were accused of corruption, a death offense. Grand Empress Dowager Feng and Emperor Xiaowen jointly convened an imperial council to discuss their punishment. Grand Empress Dowager Feng opened by asking the officials, \\"Do you believe that we should care about familial relations and destroy law, or to disregard familial relations and follow the law?\\" The officials largely pleaded for the princes' lives. After Grand Empress Dowager Feng fell silent, Emperor Xiaowen stated: \\"What the two princes committed is unpardonable, but the Grand Empress Dowager takes after the brotherly love that Gaozong [Emperor Wengcheng's Temple name] had. Further, the Prince of Nan'an is filially pious toward his mother. Therefore, the two will be spared the death penalty, but their offices and titles will be stripped from them, and they will be reduced to commoner status with no political rights.\\" In 490, Grand Empress Dowager Feng died, and she was buried with magnificent honors. Emperor Xiaowen was so distraught that he was unable to take in food or water for five days, and subsequently observed a three-year mourning period for her, notwithstanding officials' pleas for him to shorten the mourning period in accordance with rules that Emperor Wen of Han had set.  Early personal reign  After Grand Empress Dowager Feng's death, Emperor Xiaowen not only continued the sinicization campaign, but carried it out in earnest, changing many laws and customs of the Northern Wei states to conform with Han, particularly Confucian, customs. While he sought out his mother Consort Li's cousins (Consort Li's brothers had been executed with their father Li Hui) and rewarded them with relatively low offices, he later retracted the rewards, bringing criticism that he was treating the Fengs with too much kindness and not treating the Lis with sufficient kindness. in 492, in conformance with past dynasties' tradition, Emperor Xiaowen demoted the many princes in the state, unless they were descendants of the dynasty founder Emperor Daowu, to the titles of duke, with two exceptions: Baba Guan (ÊãîÊãîËßÄ) the Prince of Shangdang, because of the great accomplishments of his grandfather Baba Daosheng (ÊãîÊãîÈÅìÁîü), was allowed to remain prince; and the former Liu Song prince Liu Chang the Prince of Danyang, while having his own rank reduced to Duke of Qi Commandery, was given a special title, which appeared to be non- inheritable, of Prince of Song. In 493, Emperor Xiaowen married another daughter of Feng Xi, Feng Qing, as empress. Also in 493, Emperor Xiaowen began the first of a number of campaigns that he would conduct against Southern Qi ‚Äì although in the case of this campaign, it was intended to instead allow him to move the capital from Pingcheng south to the Han heartland of Luoyang, to further his sinicization campaign. As he reached Luoyang in the late fall, he ordered a continued advance despite heavy rains, and then, when the Xianbei officials who opposed the campaign tried again to stop him, he offered a compromise‚Äîthat the capital be moved to Luoyang, and the campaign be abandoned. The officials agreed. He also entrusted the matters of changing Xianbei ceremonies and music to Han ceremonies to the official Wang Su (ÁéãËÇÖ), who had only recently defected from Southern Qi. in 494, Emperor Xiaowen made a return to Pingcheng, and, for reasons that are not clear, reopened the discussions on whether to move the capital to Luoyang. This time, the Xianbei officials largely opposed the move, but Emperor Xiaowen overruled them and continued moving the governmental agencies to Luoyang, although maintaining a fairly substantial governmental presence at Pingcheng for it to serve as the secondary capital. To alleviate the concerns that the move from Pingcheng to Luoyang would cause a supply shortage of horses and other livestock, he had the general Yuwen Fu (ÂÆáÊñáÁ¶è) set up a large livestock grazing zone at Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Jiaozuo and Xinxiang, Henan). A fief of 100 households and the rank of Â¥áËÅñ‰æØ Marquis who worships the sage was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui's lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius's lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of Â¥áËÅñÂ§ßÂ§´ Grandee who venerates the sage was bestowed on Â≠î‰πò Kong Sheng who was Confucius's scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.  Late personal reign  Late in 494, under the stated reason that Southern Qi's Emperor Ming had usurped the throne (from his grandnephew Xiao Zhaowen), Emperor Xiaowen prepared a major campaign against Southern Qi, departing Luoyang about new year 495. He initially put the important cities Shouyang (Â£ΩÈôΩ, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) and Yiyang (Áæ©ÈôΩ, in modern Xinyang, Henan) under siege, but could not capture them easily, and battles that his armies conducted against Southern Qi armies were largely indecisive. By late spring 495, he abandoned the campaign. In summer 495, Emperor Xiaowen issued a number of edicts that made what was stated policy official law‚Äîthat Xianbei clothing and language be prohibited, and that the Han clothing and language be used instead. (An exemption was given to those over 30.) In spring 496, he also ordered that the Xianbei family names be changed to Han ones, changing his own clan's name from Tuoba to Yuan. He also strengthened the social stratification that had already been underway for some time, making eight Xianbei clans and five Han clans particularly honored, and ordering that all political offices be given by clan status, not by abilities, despite heavy opposition by his official Li Chong. The particularly honored clans were: * Xianbei ** Mu (Á©Ü, originally Qiumuling) ** Lu (Èô∏, originally Buliugu) ** He (Ë≥Ä, originally Helai) ** Liu (Âäâ, originally Dugu) ** Lou (Ê®ì, originally Helou) ** Yu (‰∫é, originally Wuniuyu) ** Xi (Â•ö, originally Daxi) ** Yu (Â∞â, originally Yuchi) * Han ** Lu (Áõß) ** Cui (Â¥î) ** Zheng (ÈÑ≠) ** Wang (Áéã) ** Li (Êùé) Emperor Xiaowen went as far as ordering his six younger brothers to demote their current wives to concubine status, and taking the daughters of officials from the five Han clans to be their new wives, an action heavily criticized by historians. Sometime prior to fall 496, Emperor Xiaowen had, perhaps due to recommendation from Empress Feng, welcomed her older sister Feng Run back to the palace to again be his concubine, and Feng Run, believing herself to be the older sister, refused to yield to Empress Feng and began to find ways to undermine her position. In summer 496, Emperor Xiaowen deposed Empress Feng, who then went to Yaoguang Temple (Áë§ÂÖâÂØ∫) and became a Buddhist nun. Also in fall 496, the crown prince Yuan Xun, who did not adjust well to Han customs or the much hotter weather in Luoyang, plotted with his followers to flee back to Pingcheng, perhaps to hold that city against his father. His plot, however, was discovered, and Emperor Xiaowen, after asking his brother Yuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁ¶ß) the Prince of Xianyang to cane Yuan Xun with him, deposed Yuan Xun. However, a second plot quickly arose, organized by the officials Mu Tai (Á©ÜÊ≥∞) and Lu Rui (Èô∏Âè°), who intended to again hold the northern regions against the Emperor. However, their plot was revealed by Emperor Xiaowen's distant uncle Yu Yi (ÂÖÉÈ†§) the Prince of Yangping, whom they had intended to make their leader but who had only pretended to go along with their plot. Emperor Xiaowen sent a force commanded by his cousin Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng to Pingcheng, putting down the plot before it started in earnest, and putting Mu and Lu to death. In spring 497, Emperor Xiaowen created another son, Yuan Ke, crown prince. Believing in reports by the official Li Biao (ÊùéÂΩ™), who then had the former Crown Prince Xun under house arrest, that Yuan Xun was still plotting rebellion, he forced Yuan Xun to commit suicide. In fall 497, Emperor Xiaowen created Feng Run to be empress, and when Yuan Ke's mother Consort Gao subsequently died, common belief was that Empress Feng had her secretly poisoned so that she could raise Yuan Ke herself. Also in fall 497, Emperor Xiaowen launched another major attack against Southern Qi, this time first concentrating on the city Wancheng (ÂÆõÂüé, in modern Nanyang, Henan). While he was able to capture Wancheng and Xinye (Êñ∞Èáé, also in modern Nanyang), the battles were still largely indecisive. During his absence, a major conflict erupted between Li Chong and Li Biao in the capital Luoyang, and Li Chong, after putting Li Biao under arrest, died in anger. Partly because of this and partly because, once Southern Qi's Emperor Ming died in fall 498, that he should not continue to attack a country that was mourning for its emperor, he ended the campaign in fall 498. At that same time, he himself was falling ill, and he entrusted the important matters to his brother Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng, although he subsequently recovered and was able to return to Luoyang. Meanwhile, however, in Emperor Xiaowen's absence, Empress Feng had been carrying on an affair with the attendant Gao Pusa (È´òËè©Ëñ©). When she, also in Emperor Xiaowen's absence, tried to force Emperor Xiaowen's sister Princess Pengcheng, whose husband Liu Chengxu (ÂäâÊâøÁ∑í, Liu Chang's son) had died earlier, to marry her brother Feng Su (È¶ÆÂ§ô) the Duke of Beiping, Princess Pengcheng fled out of Luoyang and arrived at Emperor Xiaowen's camp, accusing Empress Feng of adultery. Once Emperor Xiaowen arrived back in Luoyang, he arrested Gao and Empress Feng's assistant Shuang Meng (ÈõôËíô) and interrogated them. He then interrogated Empress Feng personally as well, concluding that she had in fact committed adultery. However, claiming that he did not want to shame the Feng clan, he did not depose her, but refused to see her again and also ordered Crown Prince Ke to not to see her again either. Emperor Xiaowen, despite his own weakened physical state, then decided to again advance south to react against a retaliation campaign by the Southern Qi general Chen Xianda (Èô≥È°ØÈÅî). He was able to repel and defeat Chen, but while on the campaign, he died. Yuan Xie and Yuan Cheng kept his death secret until his body could be returned to Luoyang, and then announced his death. Yuan Ke succeeded to the throne as Emperor Xuanwu. By Emperor Xiaowen's will, Empress Feng was forced to commit suicide.

Enolization is an example of isomerization, as is tautomerization. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it may be called a rearrangement reaction. When the activation energy for the isomerization reaction is sufficiently small, both isomers will exist in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with each other.

The mass in this lens is made up partly of normal (baryonic) matter and partly of dark matter. Distorted galaxies are clearly visible around the edges of the gravitational lens. The appearance of these distorted galaxies depends on the distribution of matter in the lens and on the relative geometry of the lens and the distant galaxies, as well as on the effect of dark energy on the geometry of the Universe. In astronomy and cosmology, baryonic dark matter is dark matter composed of baryons. Only a small proportion of the dark matter in the universe is likely to be baryonic. Characteristics As \\"dark matter\\", baryonic dark matter is undetectable by its emitted radiation, but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. This form of dark matter is composed of \\"baryons\\", heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms. Presence Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) - condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs. Estimates of quantity The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. Both indicate that the amount of baryonic dark matter is much smaller than the total amount of dark matter. =Big Bang nucleosynthesis= From the perspective of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then there would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than ), never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium. Other possibilities that were examined include \\"Jupiters\\", which are similar to brown dwarfs but have masses \\\\sim and do not burn anything, and white dwarfs.

Career Jones was born in Coalton, Ohio to a musical and mining family. His father, Richard Isham Jones (1865-1945), was a violinist. The family moved to Saginaw, Michigan where Jones grew up and started his first ensemble for church concerts. In 1911 one of Jones's earliest compositions \\"On the Alamo\\" was published by Tell Taylor Inc. (Taylor had formed a publishing company the year before when his song \\"Down by the Old Mill Stream\\" became a hit.) In 1915 Jones moved to Chicago, Illinois. He performed at the Green Mill Gardens, then began playing at Fred Mann's Rainbo Gardens.CD liner notes: Happy: The 1920 Rainbo Orchestra Sides, 2014 Archeophone Records Chicago remained his home until 1932, when he settled in New York City. He also toured England with his orchestra in 1925. Isham Jones in 1922 In 1917, he composed the tune \\"We're In The Army Now\\" (also known as \\"You're In the Army Now\\") when the United States entered World War I. The same tune was popular during World War II and it is played by the U.S. Army Band. The Isham Jones band made a series of popular gramophone records for Brunswick throughout the 1920s. His first 26 sides, made at Rainbo Gardens, were credited to \\"Isham Jones' Rainbo Orchestra\\". By the end of 1920, the name was simply \\"Isham Jones' Orchestra\\". He led one of the most popular dance bands in the 1920s and 1930s. His first successful recording, \\"Wabash Blues\\" written by Dave Ringle and Fred Meinken, was recorded in 1921 by \\"Isham Jones and his Orchestra\\". This million-seller stayed for twelve weeks in the U.S. charts, six at No. 1.CD liner notes: Chart-Toppers of the Twenties, 1998 ASV Ltd. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Noted musicians who played in Jones's band included Louis Panico, Benny Goodman (although no records were made during the short time he was there), Woody Herman, Walt Yoder, and Roy Bargy. Reed virtuoso Al Gallodoro appeared briefly with Jones in 1933, taking part in a record date October 3. From the start, his Brunswick records were popular. There was a gap from October 1927 to June 1929 where Jones did not record due to disbanding and reorganization. From 1929 to 1932, his Brunswick recordings became even more sophisticated with offbeat arrangements by Gordon Jenkins and others; Jones was his own arranger early on, but cultivated others. During this period, Jones started featuring violinist Eddie Stone as one of his regular vocalists. Stone had an unusual, almost humorous tone to his voice. His other vocalists included Frank Sylvano, Billy Scott, and Arthur Jarrett. In 1932, he added Joe Martin, another of the band's violinists, as a frequent vocalist. In April that year, young Bing Crosby recorded two sessions with Jones's group which included \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\". Crosby at this point in his career was still singing in a jazz idiom, transitioning to his better known \\"crooner\\" style. In August 1932, Jones signed with Victor, and these records are considered among the best arranged and performed commercial dance band records of the Depression era. Victor's recording technique was suited to Jones' band. In October 1932, he teamed up with the Three X Sisters in New York who had just departed from CBS radio. They recorded \\"experimental\\" songs for RCA Victor in which Jones began to fuse jazz and early swing music. They recorded \\"Where? (I Wonder Where?)\\" and \\"What Would Happen to Me If Something Happened to You.\\" His Victor releases had an almost symphonic sound, often with a strong use of tuba. During his Victor period, he recorded two long playing \\"Program Transcription\\" records as part of Victor's unsuccessful 33 1/3 RPM series. He stayed with Victor until July 1934, when he signed with Decca. Jones's recordings during this period rivaled Paul Whiteman, Waring's Pennsylvanians, Leo Reisman and other dance orchestras as examples of the most popular dance music of the era. Jones' Decca recordings are often unfavorably compared to his Victor recordings, due to Decca's recording techniques, Decca's insisting that Jones re-record many of his Victor recordings, and the apparent smaller size of his orchestra. After he left Decca in 1936, he again retired and his orchestra was taken over by band member Woody Herman. Jones started a new band in 1937‚Äì38 and recorded a handful of sessions under the ARC labels: Melotone, Perfect and Banner. In the 1940s, Jones resided on his poultry farm in Colorado, which he occasionally left for short tours with pickup bands. He later resided in Los Angeles. He moved to Hollywood, Florida in 1955, and died there of cancer in 1956. (He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, and perhaps for that reason is often erroneously listed as having died in Hollywood, California.) His great-nephew is the now-deceased jazz drummer Rusty Jones.

Pamphlets may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths, called a leaflet or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and saddle stapled at the crease to make a simple book. For the \\"International Standardization of Statistics Relating to Book Production and Periodicals\\", UNESCO defines a pamphlet as \\"a non-periodical printed publication of at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in a particular country and made available to the public\\" and a book as \\"a non- periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages\\". The UNESCO definitions are, however, only meant to be used for the particular purpose of drawing up their book production statistics.UNESCO definition Etymology The word pamphlet for a small work (opuscule) issued by itself without covers came into Middle English 1387 as or , generalized from a twelfth-century amatory comic poem with an old flavor, Pamphilus, seu de Amore (\\"Pamphilus: or, Concerning Love\\"), written in Latin.OED s.v. \\"pamphlet\\". Pamphilus's name is derived from the Greek name , meaning \\"beloved of all\\".. The poem was popular and widely copied and circulated on its own, forming a slim codex. History The pamphlet form of literature has been used for centuries as an economical vehicle for the broad distribution of information. Its modern connotations of a tract concerning a contemporary issue was a product of the heated arguments leading to the English Civil War; this sense appeared in 1642. In some European languages, this secondary connotation, of a disputatious tract, has come to the fore: compare libelle, from the Latin libellus, denoting a \\"little book\\".In German, French, Spanish and Italian pamphlet often has negative connotations of slanderous libel or religious propaganda; idiomatic neutral translations of English pamphlet include \\"Flugblatt\\" and \\"Brosch√ºre\\" in German, \\"Fascicule\\" in French, and \\"folleto\\" in Spanish. In Russian and Romanian, the word \\"\\" in Russian Cyrillic, \\"\\" in Romanian also normally connotes a work of propaganda or satire, so it is best translated as \\"brochure\\" (\\"\\" in Russian, bro≈üurƒÉ in Romanian). (DEX online - Cautare: pamflet) Pamphlets functioned in place of magazine articles in the pre-magazine era, which ended in the mid-nineteenth century. There were hundreds of them in the United States alone. They were a primary means of communication for people interested in political and religious issues, such as slavery. Pamphlets never looked at both sides of a question; most were avowedly partisan, trying not just to inform but to convince the reader. Purpose Pamphlets can contain anything from information on kitchen appliances to medical information and religious treatises. Pamphlets are very important in marketing because they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers. Pamphlets have also long been an important tool of political protest and political campaigning for similar reasons. A pamphleteer is a historical term for someone who produces or distributes pamphlets, especially for a political cause. Collectibility Ephemeral and to wide array of political or religious perspectives given voice by the format's ease of production, pamphlets are prized by many book collectors. Substantial accumulations have been amassed and transferred to ownership of academic research libraries around the world. Particularly comprehensive collections of American political pamphlets are housed at New York Public Library, the Tamiment Library of New York University, and the Jo Labadie collection at the University of Michigan.Oakley C. Johnson, Marxism in United States History Before the Russian Revolution (1876-1917). New York: Humanities Press, 1974; pg. vii. Commercial uses The pamphlet has been widely adopted in commerce, particularly as a format for marketing communications. There are numerous purposes for pamphlets, such as product descriptions or instructions, corporate information, events promotions or tourism guides and they are often used in the same way as leaflets or brochures.

Sir Thomas Smith (23 December 1513 ‚Äì 12 August 1577) was an English scholar, parliamentarian and diplomat. Early life Born at Saffron Walden in Essex, Smith was the second son of John Smith of Walden by Agnes, daughter of John Charnock of Lancashire. The Smiths of Essex are said to be descendants of Sir Roger de Clarendon, an illegitimate son of the Black Prince. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow in 1530, and in 1533 was appointed a public reader or professor. He lectured in the schools on natural philosophy, and on Greek in his own College. In 1540 Smith went abroad, and, after studying in France and Italy and taking a degree in law at the University of Padua, returned to Cambridge in 1542. He now took the lead in the reform of the pronunciation of Greek, his views being universally adopted after considerable controversy. He and his friend, Sir John Cheke, were the great classical scholars of the time in England. In January 1543/4 he was appointed the first Regius Professor of Civil Law. He was vice-chancellor of the university the same year. In 1547 he became Provost of Eton College and Dean of Carlisle Cathedral. Sir Thomas was an early convert to Protestantism, which brought him into prominence when Edward VI came to the throne. During the protectorate of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, he entered public life and was made the Secretary of State, and was sent on an important diplomatic mission to Brussels. In 1548 he was knighted. On the accession of Queen Mary I he lost all his offices, but in the reign of her sister, Elizabeth I, he was prominently employed in public affairs. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Liverpool in 1559. It became clear that he supported the religious settlement and Confessions of Westminster (1560), sitting on two committees of Inquiry. When an expert handler of the son of the King of Sweden visiting Westminster, he was sent in 1562 as ambassador to France as an emerging diplomatic talent; he remained in France from September 1562 with experienced envoy Sir Nicholas Throckmorton; and in 1572 Smith again went to France in the same capacity for a short time. However Smith came to dagger blows with Throckmorton over character and policy differences. He finally returned home in disgrace after suffering illness in April 1566. All was not lost: Smith remained one of Elizabeth's most trusted Protestant counsellors. He had long been a friend of Sir William Cecil. Ennobled as Lord Burghley, Cecil appointed Smith to the Privy Council, only a month before he was elected to Commons as a knight of the shire for Essex. Smith, a prime mover behind the Conformity Bills, sought to restrain extremism and secure a subsidy from his fellow members. But when he proposed that the bishops be consulted, the puritan William Fleetwood defeated his motion. As a Privy Councillor he was influential on a number of committees. He spoke on the Treason Bill on the floor of the house, and examined witnesses to the Catholic plot led by the Duke of Norfolk. He was noted as upholding a religious objection to torture. His outstanding work elevated him to the higher ministerial echelons: in 1572 he was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter and in July, principal secretary.. Failed colony in Ireland In 1571, Elizabeth I, a great believer in colonisation, granted Smith of East Ulster. The empty lands were to be used to plant English settlers in an effort to control areas claimed by Clandeboye O'Neill territory and thus control the native Irish. The grant included all of the area known today as North Down and the Ards, apart from the southern tip of the Ards peninsula which was controlled by the Anglo- Norman Savage family. Unfortunately for Smith, the booklet he printed to advertise his new lands was read by the Clandeboye O'Neill chief, Sir Brian MacPhelim, who just a few years earlier had been knighted by Elizabeth. Furious at what he saw as her \\"duplicity\\" in secretly arranging for the colonisation of unsettled areas claimed by O'Neill, he burned down all the major buildings in the area. The owners objected, but could do nothing. This made it difficult for the plantation to take hold. Then launching a wave of attacks on these early English settlers when they arrived, the O'Neills scorched the land Smith was to develop, burning abbeys, monasteries and churches, and leaving Clandeboye \\"totally waste and void of inhabitants\\".. Smith, who was also a Member of Parliament for Essex in 1571 and 1572, died on 12 August 1577 at Hill Hall in Essex.. Marriages and heirs Smith married twice. First he wed Elizabeth Carkeke, daughter of a London printer, April 15, 1548; she died in 1553. . His second marriage, which took place July 23, 1554, was to Philippa Wilford, the widow of Sir John Hampden of Great Hampden, Buckinghamshire, and the daughter of the London merchant Henry Wilford..Richardson states that she was the daughter of John Wilford, a gentleman, of London. . She died 15 June 1578. The title page of the 1609 edition of Smith's work. Smith had no issue by either marriage, although he had one illegitimate son named Thomas, who was killed during the failed Ards settlement. His heirs were his younger brother, George, and George's son, Sir William Smith (died 12 December 1626) of Theydon Mount, Essex.. Sir William Smith's daughter, Frances Smith, married Sir Matthew Brend, owner of the land on which the first and second Globe Theatres were built.; . Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, was brought up in Smith's house and his early education was supervised by him.Nelson, Alan H.

Works Sir Thomas Smith's book De Republica Anglorum: the of or of the of England,. written between 1562 and 1565, was first published in 1583. In it, he described England as a mixed government and a commonwealth, and stated that all commonwealths are of mixed character.

Ibex are found in Eurasia, North Africa, and East Africa. The name ibex comes from Latin, borrowed from Iberian or Aquitanian, akin to Old Spanish bezerro \\"bull\\", modern Spanish becerro \\"yearling\\". Ranging in height from and weighing , the ibex can live 20 years. Two closely related varieties of goats found in the wild are not usually called ibex: the markhor and the feral goat. Male ibex are commonly larger and heavier than females, and their most noticeable difference is the large size of their horns. Females grow a pair of smaller, thinner horns which develop considerably more slowly than the males'. The ibex's horns appear at birth and continue to grow through the rest of its life. Species of wild goats that are called ibex are: * The Bezoar ibex (Capra aegagrus aegagrus) is found in southwest Asia and the eastern Mediterranean, and is the main ancestor of the domestic goat. * The Alpine Ibex (Capra ibex) is found in the European Alps. Alpine ibex are found in France, Bulgaria, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Slovenia, and have been introduced to ranches in the United States, Canada, and Argentina. * The Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) occurs in the Middle East, in the Red Sea hills of Sudan as well as the highlands in Egypt. * The Walia or Ethiopian ibex (Capra walie) is found in the Semien Mountains of the Ethiopian Highlands, where it has recently been upgraded from critically endangered to endangered. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of Alpine Ibex. The Ibex is also a national emblem of the great ancient Axum empire. * The Spanish or Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) is now restricted to mountainous enclaves of the Iberian Peninsula south of the Pyrenees, but in the past it also occurred in the Pyrenees and southern France. There are approximately 50,000 Spanish ibex on the Iberian Peninsula. Two of its subspecies went extinct. One of its extinct subspecies, the Pyrenean Ibex, was cloned in 2003. Richard Gray and Roger Dobson, Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning, Telegraph.co.uk, 31/1/2009. * The Asiatic or Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) is a wild goat inhabiting long mountain systems in central Asian deserts. The animal is 80-100 cm high at shoulder, and weighs an average 60 kg. The adult males have long pointed beards and scimitar-shaped horns with prominent ridges on the frontal surface. The coat is dark brown with greyish underparts, and a dorsal stripe runs from the neck to tail. Adult males also have grey saddle patches on their backs. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, as the females are smaller with small straight horns that are widely separated at the base. Asiatic ibex is widely distributed over an area stretching from the Hindu-Kush Mountains in Afghanistan to Sayan Mountains in Mongolia. The animals are found most frequently at elevations ranging from 3000 to 5300 m above sea level, but are also known to occur in areas as low as 1000 m in the Altai Mountains. They have a predilection for rugged terrain as an anti-predator strategy. Namgail, T. (2006). Winter Habitat Partitioning between Asiatic Ibex and Blue Sheep in Ladakh, Northern India . Journal of Mountain Ecology 8: 7-13. * The West Caucasian ibex (Capra caucasica) is found in the western Caucasus. * The East Caucasian ibex (Capra cylindricornis) is found in the eastern Caucasus. In ancient history Evidence of the ibex is widely present in the archaeological record, particularly in the Near East and Mediterranean regions. Ibex motifs are very common on cylinder seals and pottery, both painted and embossed. Excavations from Minoan Crete at Knossos, for example, have yielded specimens from about 1800 BC, including one cylinder seal depicting an ibex defending himself from a hunting dog.C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (2007) From the similar age a gold jewelry ibex image was found at the Akrotiri archaeological siteM. Uda, G. Demortier, I. Nakai, X-rays for archaeology, 2005, Springer, 308 pages on Santorini in present day Greece. An Iron Age Capra ibex specimen was recovered at the Aq Kupruk Archaeological site in present day Afghanistan, illustrating either domestication or hunting of the ibex by these early peoples. However, archaeological records of ibex can be difficult to separate from those of domestic goats.Pam J. Crabtree, Douglas V. Campana, Kathleen Ryan (1989). Early Animal Domestication and Its Cultural Context, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology Earlier evidence of domestication or hunting of the ibex was found identified through DNA analysis of the contents of the stomach of √ñtzi, the natural mummy of a Chalcolithic man discovered in the √ñtztal Alps in 1991, who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE. According to DNA reconstruction, the man's penultimate meal contained ibex.F. Rollo, M. Ubaldi, L. Ermini, I. Marota, \\"√ñtzi's last meals: DNA analysis of the intestinal content of the Neolithic glacier mummy from the Alps\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2002.  Rescue from extinction  During the advent of firearms in the 15th century, the large population of ibex that spanned many of Europe's mountains decreased as they were easy targets for hunters. The ibex was often hunted for its meat and other body parts to be utilized for medicine. The ibex horns were highly sought after as a traditional remedy for impotence, while its blood was used for treating kidney stones. The relentless hunting of the ibex almost lead it to extinction if it was not for the foresight of the dukes of Savoy that stopped its persecution. Charles-Felix, the duke of Savoy and king of Sardinia, banned the hunting of the ibex across his estates of the Gran Paradiso after being persuaded by a report on the animal's endangered state. The ban was implemented on September 12, 1821 and its laws was soon extended to the rest of the kingdom. In 1856, Victor Emmanuel II, succeeding Charles- Felix as the king, inducted the Gran Paradiso as a protected hunting estate along with appointed gamekeepers to patrol the area.

He went into voluntary exile abroad, at first under royal licence (which he overstayed). He was captured and imprisoned in 1556, and under threat or apprehension of execution by the fire made a forced public recantation and affiliated himself to the Church of Rome. He died not long afterwards, filled with remorse for having forsworn his true belief from the infirmity of fear. His character, teaching and reputation were, however, admiringly and honourably upheld.T. Cooper, 'Cheke, Sir John (1514‚Äì1557)', Dictionary of National Biography (1885‚Äì1900), Vol. X.A.

(the son of Robert Cheke of Mottistone), was Esquire Bedell of the University of Cambridge from 1509 until his death in 1529. John's mother was Agnes Duffield, daughter of Andrew Duffield of Cambridge: John was born in that city in 1514, and had five sisters, Ann, Alice, Elizabeth, Magdalen, and Mary. His grammatical education was begun by John Morgan, M.A.C.H. Cooper & T. Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, I: 1500‚Äì1585 (Deighton, Bell & Co/Macmillan & Co, Cambridge 1858), pp. 166-170. He was educated at St John's College, where he proceeded to receive a B.A. in 1529, and obtained a Fellowship. He commenced with an M.A. in 1533.J. Venn and J.A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses I.i (Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 328. His tutor was George Day, who became an opponent of the Edwardian Reformation.Johnson, 'Cheke, Sir John', History of Parliament online. In the University Cheke, and his friend Thomas Smith (a student of Civil Law at Queens' College), were thought so outstanding that each was granted an exhibition by King Henry to support them in their studies. Both were largely impressed by the classical learning of John Redman, who had studied in Paris, and sought to emulate him. Both Queens' College (where the influence of Erasmus remained) and St John's fostered Reformist principles which Cheke and Smith embraced.J. Strype, The Life of the Learned Sir Thomas Smith, Kt., D.C.L., New Edition with corrections and additions by the author (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1820), pp. 8-9. During the early 1530s Cheke and Smith studied together privately to restore proper definition to the pronunciation of ancient Greek diphthongs, which by custom had become obscured. The language itself, its cadences and inflexions of meaning, thereby gained new life and the works of the ancient scholars and orators were freshly received and understood. Smith, giving Greek lectures from 1533, around 1535 began to make public trial of these effects, and soon gained a following. Smith's student John Poynet, succeeding his tutor, maintained the new pronunciation in his lectures: both Cheke and Smith began to coach students in their method, and the Plutus of Aristophanes was acted at St. John's in the new manner.Strype, The Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 8-14. After Poynet as Greek Reader came Roger Ascham,For Ascham's letters to Cheke, see J.A. Giles, The Whole Works of Roger Ascham, Vol. I Part I: Life, &c.;, and Letters (John Russell Smith, London 1865), passim. Cheke's student, who read Isocrates, at first disputing but afterwards coming round fully to the innovations, which also won the approval of John Redman. The broadening and reinvigorating of classical antique literacy and scholarship, preserved through the mediaeval philosophical schools, opened also the biblical and patristic uses of ancient Greek language to fresh interpretations through the exercise of private thought and study, and to new perspectives of Athens, Rome and Byzantium. = Academic manoeuvres = John Cheke inscribed the names on a famous series of portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger. Through the mediation of Matthew Parker, Cheke obtained the support of Anne Boleyn for his student William Bill to continue his studies.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 8-9. After a year as Master of St John's, and as University Vice- Chancellor, George Day was appointed by King Henry to be Provost of King's College in 1538, Smith having become University Orator in 1537 in succession to him.'Day, George', in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.ii (Cambridge University Press, 1922) p. 22. In 1540, at the King's creation of the Regius Professorships, Smith was made Professor of Law, Cheke Professor of Greek, and John Blythe (of King's College)Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.i, p. 171. Professor of Physick.Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 10-14. Blythe married Alice, one of Cheke's sisters, before 1536, and in 1541 William Cecil (afterwards Lord Burleigh), Cheke's distinguished student, married Mary Cheke, another.Metcalfe, Visitations of Essex; Rylands, Visitation of Hampshire. (Mary Cecil died two years later, leaving Cecil with a son, Thomas Cecil.) In 1542 one \\"Mistress Cheke\\" was still resident in the Cheke home at Market Hill, Cambridge.Will of William Sabyn, Sergeant at the arms of Ipswich, Suffolk (PCC 1543, Spert quire). In June 1542 Bishop Gardiner, a discerning and intransigent man, as Chancellor of the University issued his Edict to all who recognized his authority that the sounds customarily used for the pronunciation of Greek or Latin should not be changed by anyone, and gave a list of them with phonetic explanations. He pronounced severe and potentially exclusionist penalties at all levels of the academic hierarchy for those who contravened this ruling, and further wrote to the Vice-Chancellor requiring that his edict be observed.J. Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials: Relating Chiefly to Religion and the Reformation of it, 3 Vols (John Wyat, London 1721), I, Appendix of records and originals, No. CXVI, pp. 326-27. Cheke, as one of the principal targets of Gardiner's disapproval, entered into a correspondence of seven letters with him,De Pronuntiatione Graecae potissimum linguae disputationes cum Stephano Vuintoniensi episcopo, septem contrariis epistolis comprehensae (N. Episcopium iuniorem, Basel 1555). Reprint ed. R.C. Alston, Collection of facsimile reprints, No. 2, Scholar Press (1968). but the Bishop remained inflexible.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 15-19. However the seeds of his method had been sown, and took root. At that time the letters remained unpublished. In that year Cheke was incorporated M.A. at the University of Oxford, being made a canon of King Henry VIII's College.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, pp. 166-170. In 1544 he succeeded Smith as Public Orator in the University of Cambridge.Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.i, p. 328. Day, consecrated Bishop of Chichester in 1543, remained Provost of King's.Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.ii, p. 22. At this time Cheke prepared his Latin translation (dedicated to the King) of the De Apparatu Bellico of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, often sharing and talking over his work with Roger Ascham.R. Ascham, 'Toxophilus, the Schole of Shootinge contayned in two bookes' (orig. In aedibus Edouardi Whytchurch, London 1545), in W.A. Wright (ed.), Roger Ascham: English Works (Cambridge University Press 1904), pp. vii- xx, 1-119, at pp. 45-46. Thomas Hoby was then one of his pupils.E. Powell (ed.), The Travels and Life of Sir Thomas Hoby, Kt., of Bisham Abbey, written by himself. 1547‚Äì1564 (Royal Historical Society, London 1902), pp. x-xi. Cheke's reading and thought in the Greek Histories, and his use of them to extract examples of policy and conduct, can be studied in his annotations to print copies (from the Aldine Press) of Herodotus and Thucydides.St. Johns's College, Cambridge, shelfmark Aa.4.48, see J. Harmer, 'Sir John Cheke's Greek Books', Centre for Material Texts (Cambridge, June 2010), website. In 1543 and 1545 his Latin versions of the homilies of St John Chrysostom were published, opening with a letter of dedication to his patron the King. On 10 June 1544Cheke told Girolamo Cardano he was selected on 10 June (see below), but he commenced in July: J.G. Nichols, 'Biographical Memoir of King Edward the Sixth', in Literary Remains of King Edward the Sixth, Roxburghe Club (J.B. Nichols and Son, London 1857), I, p. xxxix. Cheke was appointed tutor to the future King Edward VI of England, as a supplement to his tutor Dr Richard Cox, to teach him \\"of toungues, of the scripture, of philosophie and all liberal sciences\\" (as the Prince wrote in his JournalBritish Library, Cotton MS Nero C.X, fol. 11r.), and commenced his duties at Hampton Court soon afterwards. At the Prince's invitation, the young Henry Hastings shared in his studies.C. Cross, The Puritan Earl. The Life of Henry Hastings, Third Earl of Huntingdon, 1536‚Äì1595 (Macmillan, London 1966), pp. 9-10. Roger Ascham felt strongly Cheke's absence from the University, where his example was so inspirational.Ascham (ed. Wright), Toxophilus, pp. 45-46. Special interest has been found in Cheke's lengthy preface to his Latin translation of Plutarch's De Superstitione,University College, Oxford, MS 171 (in Bodleian Library). prepared as a New Year's gift for the King in 1545 or 1546.J.A.

MacCulloch, Tudor Church Militant: Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation (Penguin UK, 2017), at note 35 (Google). Ascham's pupil William Grindal was, at his recommendation to Cheke, chosen to read Greek to Princess Elizabeth, until his untimely death in 1548.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, p. 9. By that time William Bill was Master of St John's,'Bill, William', Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses I.i, p. 151. and John Redman Master of the newly-founded Trinity College (1546), in which Bill succeeded him in 1551.T.

Cheke married Mary, daughter of Richard Hill (formerly Sergeant of the Wine-cellar to Henry VIII) and now stepdaughter of Sir John Mason. Cheke's religious and scholarly purpose bore fruit in the highest quarters. Gerard Langbaine the elder expressed it thus: > \\"under God M. Cheek was a speciall instrument of the propagation of the > Gospell, & that Religion which we now professe in this Kingdome. For he not > only sowed the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince EDWARD, which > afterwards grew up into a generall Reformation when he came to be King, but > by his meanes the same saveing truth was gently instilled into the Lady > ELIZABETH, by those who by his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of > her younger Studies.\\"G.

Cheke developed a system of phonetic spelling of English which was never much used except by himself.  Edwardian statesman  = Status and compromise = King Edward VI by William Scrots. Royal Collection, Windsor. Upon the accession of Edward to the throne Cheke, now Schoolmaster to the King,Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, p. 32 ff. was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, being allowed an annuity of ¬£100 from the Augmentations in August. On 1 October he was returned to Parliament as a member for Bletchingley, Sussex, probably under the patronage of Sir Thomas Cawarden. He was very soon placed in a compromise by Thomas Seymour (brother of the Duke of Somerset), who had drafted a letter as from the King to the Lords of the Parliament House seeking their approval to separate the offices of Lord Protector and Lord Regent, and to appoint Thomas Seymour himself as Protector. He urged Cheke to pass the letter to the King and to induce him to sign it, which Cheke refused to do, stating that Lord Paget had prohibited any such dealings. At Christmas, Seymour followed this up with a gift of ¬£40 to Cheke, half for himself and half for the King. Seymour approached the King himself without success: Edward took Cheke's advice, and refused to sign it.See Cheke's 'Confession', in P.F. Tytler, England under Edward VI and Mary, 2 vols (Richard Bentley, London 1839), I, pp. 154-55. Thomas Seymour On 1 April 1548 Cheke was chosen by special mandate of the King, overriding university statutes, to replace his former tutor George Day as Provost of King's College. He received by purchase a large grant of lands in London and elsewhere, including the site of the former College of St John the Baptist at Stoke-by- Clare in Suffolk, in October 1548.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, I: 1547‚Äì1548 (London, HMSO 1924), pp. 284-85. Matthew Parker, its dean, had established a school there, and after its superstitious constitution had been dissolved he advised Cheke on its condition and maintenance.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 37-38. The Seymour affair came to a head in January 1548/9, when Thomas Seymour was formally charged with using improper means to influence King Edward, and Cheke became implicated as his likely accomplice. On 11 January Cheke came near to losing his office as schoolmaster to the King. Seymour confessed the gift, but on 20 February Cheke exonerated himself by an honest declaration of his dealings in the matter.Cheke's 'Confession', in England under Edward VI and Mary, I, pp. 154-55. Unfortunately Mistress Cheke offended the Duchess of Somerset in the course of these proceedings, and an apology had to be made.J.G. Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', Archaeologia XXXVIII, Part 1 (1860), pp. 98-127, at p. 100 (Hathi Trust). Nichols amends Strype's chronology. Following Seymour's execution in March Cheke retreated to Cambridge for a time, tending his library and readjusting his circumstances, aware that he had come near to losing his position (as his letter to Peter Osborne indicates).Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', p. 101. Other royal preceptors, Sir Anthony Cooke or Dr. Cox, maintained the young King's instruction.Nichols, Memoir of the Life of King Edward the Sixth, pp. xlix-xl.Caelius Curio in his 1555 Epistola Nuncupatoria to Cheke's De Pronuntiatione Graecae, addressing Sir Anthony Cooke, wrote: \\"Vobis enim duobus Regis Eduardi pueritia, literis, moribus, religione instituenda tradita et commissa erat. Vos communibus votis, consilijs, industria, summae ac planae divinae spei Regem formabatis.\\" (at sect. a 4). In the Epistle to his Arte of Logique (published 1551), Thomas Wilson speaks of Cheke and Cooke as \\"your Maiesties teachers and Scholemaisters in all good litterature\\".'Epistle...

The antiquary Francis Blomefield dates to 1550 Cheke's receipt of a 21-year lease of the manor and rectory of Rushworth, Norfolk (a former collegiate estate established by the Gonville family'Colleges: Rushworth', in W. Page (ed.), A History of the County of Norfolk, Vol. 2 (V.C.H., London 1906), pp. 458-60 (British History online, accessed 3 July 2017).), which he re-leased to his brother-in-law George Alyngton of Stoke-by-Clare.F.

In discharge of their Commission, in May‚ÄìJuly 1549 the Bishops Goodrich of Ely and Ridley of Rochester, Sir William Paget and Sir Thomas Smith, John Cheke and two others conducted the King's Visitation of the University of Cambridge to investigate and amend statutes tending towards ignorance and Romish superstition.Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, p. 37. William Bill was now Master of St John's and Vice-Chancellor. On 6 May Cheke delivered the King's statute before the University Senate. Colleges were visited, complaints were heard, investigated and acted upon; two disputations (20 and 25 June) were held in the Philosophy Schools upon the question of the Real Presence in the Sacrament. Their business concluded, the congress broke up on 8 July.J. Lamb, A Collection of Letters, Statutes and Other Documents Illustrative of the History of the University of Cambridge (John W. Parker, London 1838), pp. 109-20. In that year Cheke published his lasting work The Hurt of Sedition, in the aftermath of the suppression of Kett's rebellion.John Cheke, The hurt of sedicion howe greueous it is to a commune welth, (London: Iohn Daye and Wylliam Seres, 1549, ESTC S107791. This made plain his full commitment to the Edwardian reform and its authority. He was chosen one of 8 divines, among 32 Commissioners, to draw up a reform of laws for the governance of the Church. The Latin form of their report, which Cheke prepared with Walter Haddon, remained long unpublished. He returned to London, giving evidence at the examination of Bishop Bonner in September 1549,Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 37-41. and sitting in the Parliamentary third session, towards the close of which he was granted property in Lincolnshire and Suffolk worth ¬£118 a year for his care in the King's instruction.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549‚Äì1551 (HMSO 1925), p. 113. In April 1550, following Somerset's fall, Cheke was given licence to keep 50 retainers.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549‚Äì1551 (HMSO 1925), p. 327. In May he acquired the manor and town of Dunton Wayletts in Essex, and the manors of Preston and Hoo in Sussex, from John Poynet.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549‚Äì1551 (HMSO 1925), p. 187. He obtained for Roger Ascham the role of Secretary to Sir Richard Morison's Embassy to Emperor Charles V.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 48-53. Archbishop Cranmer Archbishop Cranmer reputedly told Cheke that he might be glad all the days of his life to have such a scholar as the Prince, \\"for he hathe more divinitie in his litle fynger, then all we have in al our bodies.\\"John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments online, 1563 edition, Book IV, p. 941. Cheke meanwhile prepared a Latin version of the first Book of Common Prayer, the form in which Peter Martyr read it when consulted over its review by Cranmer. Peter Martyr doubted if the bishops would approve it, but Cheke foreknew the King's determination to implement it. In October 1550 his friend Martin Bucer, Cambridge Regius Professor of Divinity (who was indebted to Cheke for some favour offered by the King towards his countryman Johann Sleidan), presented him with the draft manuscript of his De Regno Christi (which remained unpublished until 1557).Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 54-56.M.

At that time he was appointed to a weighty Commission to inquire into, amend and punish heresies, renewed in the following year.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549‚Äì1551 (HMSO 1925), p. 347; IV: 1550‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), p. 355. Martin Bucer died in February. In May 1551 Cheke's annuity was cancelled, and in its place he received an enhanced grant of Stoke-by-Clare with its former lands and dependencies in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Huntingdon, etc, with other properties, worth ¬£192 per annum, for his industry in teaching the King.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 182-83.

Martin Bucer Shortly thereafter Cheke took part in two important private disputations upon the Real Presence, one at Cecil's house and the second at Sir Richard Morison's, held as a preparation for the review of the Prayer Book to be conducted in 1552. Among the auditors were Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir Anthony Cooke, Lord Russell and Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and the debate lay between Cheke, Cecil, Edmund Grindal and others, against the presence, and John Feckenham, Dr Yong and others upholding it. The matter of the debates was printed by John Strype.Strype, The Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 69-86. The Commission for examination of ecclesiastical laws, as required by Act of Parliament, was issued on 12 February.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), p. 354. At this time Cheke, who had the books and papers of Martin Bucer, was attempting to build up the royal Library, and at the death of his friend and admirerSee Leland's appreciation of Cheke in his Encomia Illustrium Virorum, in T. Hearne (ed.), Joannis Lelandi Antiquarii De Rebus Britannicis Collectanea (Editio altera) 6 vols. (Gul et Jo. Richardson, London 1770), V, p. 148. John Leland the antiquary in April 1552 acquired his materials for the same purpose. Girolamo Cardano Having suffered a severe inflammation of the lungs in May 1552, he held a further disputation in Cambridge upon the doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell, with Christopher Carlile, before joining a royal progress. In July 1552 he was granted a special licence to shoot at certain fowl and deer with crossbow or hand- gun;Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 260-61. in August he was created Chamberlain of the Receipt of the King's Exchequer, in the place of Anthony Wingfield, deceased, with a lifetime authority to appoint its officers (he entered office on 12 September 1552), and was also awarded the wardship and marriage of the heir of Sir Thomas Barnardiston.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 266, 404. In mid-September he received from Archbishop Cranmer the Forty- two Articles prepared for the revision of the Prayer-Book with the instruction to discuss them with Cecil and to set them in order. Being approved by the Convocation they were published in 1553: in the same period Cheke had apparently prepared the Latin translation of Cranmer's Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of 1550, and this too was published in 1553. During 1552 he was visited in London by Girolamo Cardano, who lodged with him.Cardano was returning from Edinburgh where he had attended John Hamilton, see H. Morley, Jerome Cardan. The Life of Girolamo Cardano, of Milan, physician, 2 vols (Chapman and Hall, London 1854), II, pp. 132-34 (Internet Archive). Cheke was, like others of his time, somewhat given to judicial astrology. John Dee claimed that Cheke had declared his 'good liking' of him to William Cecil.'The Compendious Rehearsall of John Dee His Dutifull Declaracion', Chapter III, in J. Crossley (ed.), Autobiographical Tracts of Dr Dee Chetham Miscellanies (Chetham Society, 1851), p. 9. (Internet archive) At least two horoscopes of Cheke's birth exist, one by Sir Thomas White and one by Cardano. Cardano's observations on Cheke were published in his De Genituris Liber.Hieronymi Cardani In Ptolemaei Pelusiensis IIII De Astrorum Iudiciis libros commentaria: cum eiusdem De Genituris libro (Henrich Petri, Lugduni 1555). See Cardano's horoscope and commentary upon Cheke in the 1554 edition, pp. 420-22, and in the 1578 edition, pp. 619-22 of these works from the HenricPetrini printshop. (In Latin) Cheke gave him some exact dates concerning events in his life, and Cardano described him as a slender, manly figure with fine skin of good colour, well-set and sharp eyes, of noble bearing, handsome and hirsute.Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', pp. 104-05. He told Cheke that in his last days he would have power, but severe dangers and anxieties: he foresaw for him both priestly and legislative powers; many short but fruitful journeys; he would be in all things professional, grave, liberal, wise and humane, a glory of the English people. = Apotheosis = Lady Jane Grey (the Streatham Portrait) Cheke was returned again for the Parliament of March 1553, and was at about that time a Clerk of the Privy Council. In May 1553 he was further rewarded for his services to the King's education both in childhood and in youth,\\"servicii... tam in pubertate nostra bonis literis erudiend' et instruend', quam ab incunabilis nobis multipliciter diligenterque prestit' et impens'.\\" by the grant of the manor of Clare, Suffolk and the fees of various possessions of the Honour of Clare in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, worth ¬£100 per annum.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, V: 1547‚Äì1553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 92-93. As the King's health declined and the question of succession became imminent, on 2 June 1553 Cheke was sworn as one of the principal Secretaries of State and took his place in the Privy Council.

Roger Ascham wrote from Brussels to congratulate Cheke on future hopes for the King's reign, but too late. The King died on 6 July and Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed Queen on the 10th. Cheke remained as her Secretary of State and was loyal to her to the last. The Council received a letter from Mary dated 9 July, from Kenninghall in Norfolk, stating her claim to the throne and demanding their loyalty. Sir John Cheke composed the reply of the same date, signed by the Lords of the Council, informing her of Jane's rightful succession, of the witnessed and sealed deeds declaring the late King's will, and of their duty to her.John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments online, 1570 edition, Book X, pp. 1605-06.

In the spring of 1556 he visited Brussels to make a rendezvous with his wife, and, under promise of safe conduct, to meet with Lord Paget and Sir John Mason, his wife's stepfather. In the return journey, between Brussels and Antwerp, he and Sir Peter Carew were seized on 15 May 1556, by order of Philip II of Spain, and returned unceremoniously to England, where they were imprisoned in the Tower.

Cheke wrote to the Queen expressing his willingness to obey her laws.H. Ellis, Original Letters of Eminent Literary Men of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Camden Society XXIII (John Bowyer Nichols & Son, London 1843), p. 19 (Google). Feckenham attempted to intercede for him, but nothing less than a full recantation, in prescribed terms, was acceptable to Mary. The fates of so many, of John Bradford, Rowland Taylor, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer stood newly before him. In early September 1556 he wrote a submission to the Queen which Her Majesty approved, though he was made to write it out again for having failed to mention King Philip: Feckenham sent him some notes on the real presence.Third Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts (By Command, Eyre & Spottiswoode, London 1872), Appendix: Papers of Sir Henry Bedingfield, p. 239 (head and foot of 1st col.).

Kett was the fourth son of Thomas Kett, of Forncett, Norfolk and his wife Margery. He is thought to have been a tanner, but he certainly held the manor of Wymondham in Norfolk. With his brother William he led the men of Wymondham in their quarrel with a certain Flowerden, and having thus come into prominence, he headed the men of Norfolk when they rose in rebellion in 1549 owing to the hardships inflicted by the extensive enclosures of common lands and by the general policy of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector. A feast held at Wymondham in July 1549 developed into a riot and gave the signal for the outbreak. Leading his followers to Norwich, Kett formed a camp on Mousehold Heath, where he is said to have commanded 16,000 men, introduced a regular system of discipline, administered justice and blockaded the city. He refused the royal offer of an amnesty on the grounds that innocent and just men had no need of pardon, and on 1 August 1549 attacked and took possession of Norwich. John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, marched against the rebels, and after his offer of pardon had been rejected he forced his way into the city, driving its defenders before him. Then, strengthened by the arrival of some foreign mercenaries, he attacked the main body of the rebels at Dussindale on 27 August. Kett's men were easily routed by the trained soldiery, and Robert and William Kett were seized and taken to London, where they were condemned to death for treason. On 7 December 1549 Robert was executed at Norwich, and his body was hanged on the top of the castle, while that of William was hanged on the church tower at Wymondham.

He succeeded Rev. Eleazer Mather, and later married his widow around 1670. Stoddard significantly liberalized church policy while promoting more power for the clergy, decrying drinking and extravagance, and urging the preaching of hellfire and the Judgment. The major religious leader of what was then the frontier, he was known as the \\"Puritan Pope of the Connecticut River valley\\" and was concerned with the lives (and the souls) of second-generation Puritans. The well-known theologian Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was his grandson, the son of Solomon's daughter, Esther Stoddard Edwards. Stoddard was the first librarian at Harvard University and the first person in American history known by that title. Religious leader Stoddard was an influential religious leader in colonial New England, and was the grandfather of the prominent theologian Rev. Jonathan Edwards. For 55 years, Stoddard occupied an unparalleled position in the Connecticut River Valley region of Massachusetts. His theology was not widely accepted in Boston, but was popular on the frontier. Opponents sometimes referred to him as \\"Pope\\" Stoddard, rhetorically placing him in the locally detested camp of the Roman Catholic Church. Yet what started as an insult from Increase Mather changed as his presbyterian influences over Congregational church government grew.Christensen, Pope and Persuader, p.2 Stoddard insisted that the sacrament of the Lord's Supper should be available to all who lived outwardly pious lives and had a good reputation in the community, even if they weren't full members of the church. This was his attempt to save his church from a \\"dying religion\\", and was the cause of great theological controversy in 18th century New England (see also Halfway Covenant). Although in acknowledging his grandfather as a \\"sort of deity\\", Edwards minimised his influence over Northampton, being dismissive of the oracle who had caused great wounds and split the church.Claghorn, Works of Jonathan Edwards, pp. 381-82, 385; Christensen, pg. 3 Nevertheless, years later Timothy Dwight would assess his impact as more profound than any other clergyman over a thirty-year period.Barbara Miller Solomon, ed. Timothy Dwight, \\"Travels in New England...\\" Early life Solomon Stoddard was born in Boston on September 26, 1643 to Anthony Stoddard, a wealthy Boston merchant, and Mary Downing (sister of Sir George Downing (after whom Downing Street in London is named), niece to Governor John Winthrop). He was baptized on October 1 at the First Church, Boston. As such, he was born into the highest stratum of aristocratic New England, but his mother died suddenly in June 1647, when he was still an infant.A Report of the Record Commissioners, Roxbury Land and Church Records, Boston: Rockwell and Churchill, (1884), p.43; Harry Gerald Swanhart, p.18. He attended Cambridge Grammar School, probably the best one in New England \\"to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for Universities\\",The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts [1648], Cambridge: Harvard, (1929), ed.

Going up in 1658 he aimed to \\"lead an honest, sober and Godly life,\\" permitted to speak only Latin, \\"diligently avoid being inoffensive in word or gesture.\\" It was the rigid disciplinary world of the Puritan Theocracy. Except for a weak beer, alcohol was forbidden as was tobacco. The \\"poenal laws\\" included expulsion for blasphemy and \\"prophanation of the Lords Day Ordinances\\".Morison, Harvard College in the 17th century, p.93; H.G.Swanhart (1961), p.36 He graduated BA from this \\"elite gathering\\" at Harvard College in July 1662. The MA during the next three years was 'Puritan casuistry' becoming an expert in a systematic study of theology adhering to the fundamentals of Holy Scripture. Rational theology was not pure Calvinism, but divined from Covenant; it resembled philosophy offering a distilled thesis of disputation. A Fellow and Tutor of Harvard Corporation for a year, he was then chosen in March 1667, to be the \\"first American librarian known to history by that title\\" when he was appointed \\"Library keeper\\", and Library Laws were enacted specifying that he should keep the Library \\"duly swept\\" and the books \\"clean and orderly.\\" The following is found in the records of Harvard College: > March 27, 1667, \\"Mr Solomon Stoddard was chosen Library keeper.\\" \\"For the > rectifying of ye Library & Rules for the Library Keeper\\", sixteen \\"orders > were made.\\" \\"No person resident in the College, except an Overseer\\", and \\"no > Schollar in the College, under a Senior\\", could borrow a book, and \\"no one > under master of Art (unless it be a fellow) ... without the allowance of the > President.\\" It was there that he studied the British Presbyterian history with a maverick perspective on order from chaos.Christensen, pp.10-11. To improve his health, Stoddard went to Barbados and served as a chaplain to Governor Daniel Searle from 1667-69. But he soon felt the need to return to New England. As he prepared to depart from Boston for a position in England, he received a call from Northampton Church to stand in for the recently deceased Eleazar Mather, brother of Increase Mather. He accepted the offer, and relocated to Northampton, which in 1670 was on the frontier. Within a few months, Stoddard had married Mather's widow Esther (n√©e Esther, daughter of Rev. John Warham, of Windsor, CT; ca. 1644 - February 10, 1736), moved into his house, and took over his pulpit to become Northampton's second minister. He held the post for 55 years, during which time he and Esther produced thirteen children: John, Solomon, Samuel, Solomon, Anthony (d.infant), Anthony, Aaron, Israel, Mary, Christian, Sarah, Esther, Hannah. Stoddard was pastor of a group ministry of churches at Dorchester, Roxbury, and Springfield as well as Northampton, purchased from the Indians in 1653. Although well versed in the Latin and Hebrew of the Boston Puritan elite, he preferred to use the common language of the frontier in his sermons. A sense of the frontier life may be gleaned from his proposal in 1703 to use dogs \\"to hunt Indians as they do Bears\\", the argument being that dogs would catch many an Indian who would be too light of foot for the townsmen. This was not considered inhumane, for the Indians, in Stoddard's view, \\"act like wolves and are to be dealt with as wolves.\\" Three years later. Massachusetts passed an act for the raising of dogs to better secure the frontier borders. Half-way Covenant Stoddard is credited with propounding the Half-way Covenant, at Northampton on 18 April 1661.Church Record Book MS., Church of Christ Congregational, Northampton MA.; H G Swanhart (1929), p.50. while young Elezear Mather was the pastor. It represented a reaffirmation of the Communion rules that accompanied a decline of piety in the Congregational church. Stoddard's interest was to insure the growth of church congregations in a colony of second-generation pilgrims who were increasingly interested in the political and economic life of the frontier, as opposed to the pure idealism of their immigrant parents. Stoddard taught that people who had grown up in the church and were not scandalous in behavior could receive communion as a means of grace; and have their children baptized, despite the fact that the Puritan tradition had previously required prospective members of the church to proclaim a spiritual \\"conversion\\".Cotton Mather, First Principles...App., p.5 Eleazer Mather opposed the Covenant as contrariwise to the Cambridge Platform of 1648, voted against the innovations of Synod of 1662. When in 1669, Mather died, the Northampton Church declared: \\"to rest contented with that share and portion of privilege belonging to them that are only in a state of Education in Christ's House...and have their children baptized.\\"H G Swanhart (1929), p.54 That was the position when Stoddard took over the congregation. At a meeting on August 1670, Solomon was promised 20 acres of land, but then offered ¬£100 instead.Northampton Town and Church Records; Judd MSS, Forbes Library, Northampton.; Swanhart, p.57 And eventually setting on four acres to build a house, to be funded by a Ministers Rate of 2s 6d. Stoddard was ordained as pastor of Northampton on the strength of a Letter of Recommendation (Feb 7, 1672) from Rev John Strong, regional convenor of the Congregational Church in neighbouring towns of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Subscribing to the Doctrine of Faith, the Half-Way Covenant was put in place was an essential prerequisite to installment. Mather's orthodox Puritanism had witnessed declining numbers, yet Stoddard was able to revitalise the church through liberal reforms. The Northampton Church was in danger of extinction unless additional members were admitted on a \\"half-way\\" basis, explains Harry Swanhart.H G Swanhart (1961), Solomon Stoddard Stoddard's decision to admit all but the \\"scandalous\\" to the church attracted the ire and rancour of the Mathers from the Massachusetts Bay area. For his case, Stoddard turned to the Northampton Town Meeting, abandoning the old Theocracy, but making the \\"communion of saints\\" subject to civilian political control.H G Swanhart (1929), pp.66-7 In September 1675, he implored Increase Mather to speak with the Governor to \\"care for a Reformation...especially mention oppression, that Intollerable Pride in Cloathes and hair, the tolleration of so many taverns, especially in Boston,\\" he wrote from Northampton. Mather eventually came to realise that children were being left without discipline, and so it was axiomatic to support the Synod \\"to bring them under the yoke of Christ,\\" even if it proved an impossibility.Cotton Mather, Parentator: Memoirs of Remarkables the Life and Death of the Ever Memorable Dr Increase Mather (Boston, MA., 1724), p.53; A Discourse Concerning the Subject of Baptisme, and The First Principles of New England, Concerning the Subject of Baptisme and Communion of the Churches (Cambridge: Samuel Green, 1675), pp.31-2 Congregationalism and Stoddard Stoddard's Congregationalism would \\"Whole-way ruin all in a little time\\", admonished Mather in \\"The Danger of Apostacy\\".Increase Mather, The Danger of Apostacy..., p.117. In theology, Stoddard contradicted nearly every standard belief of his Puritan colleagues. Puritan theology at the time stressed a strict doctrine of salvation by repentance. Stoddard believed that everyone should experience God's glory for himself, whether through Nature or Scripture. When one sees this glory for himself, Stoddard preached that one's will is automatically affected. He explained that \\"the gloriousness of God has a commanding power on the heart\\". Membership without conversion should come experientially rather than through any set process or education.Swanhart (1929), p.118 Mather countered this belief by stating that, although a Harvard education may assist in the pulpit on Sunday mornings, the sermon is useless unless the minister has experienced God's saving grace.Mather warned in \\"Danger of Apostacy\\", Preface that when men follow their own inventions they \\"go a whoring from the Lord.\\" Stoddard's concepts of theology were not widely accepted either by fellow clergy or laymen in New England. As he believed the ministry was key to bringing people closer to the Lord God Almighty, his main goal was conversion of the hearts of sinners. The only source of salvation was God's Word, especially as related through the sermon. If a community continued to remain unconverted, then either the preacher himself was unconverted, or he needed to modify his sermons to better address the unconverted. This called for a revision in church policy. \\"We fear the dangers ahead\\", averred Edward Taylor of Westfield, whose group, jealous of the improving church-going numbers in Northampton recommended a plan for the adoption of a \\"Church State.\\"Letters to Stoddard in 1673, \\"The Notebook of Edward Taylor of Westfield, MA, MS., Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS) Stoddard called presbyterian like councils to discuss and debate innovations in policy: he wanted to develop the \\"Instituted Church\\" in order to preserve purity among ministers.Thomas and Virginia Davis, Edward Taylor versus Solomon Stoddard, p.63; Solomon Stoddard, Guide to Christ (Boston, 1714), intro. Each church would be instructed through a national church, which determined the proper qualifications for ministers. The redemption of the sinner's soul was to be the evangelical purpose of this church. His ideas, at least in this respect, gained few adherents. Stoddard's position was expressed through debates with his in-laws Cotton and Increase Mather. As leader of one of Boston's primary churches, Cotton Mather wielded influence during Stoddard's lifetime. Mather's arguments could not hold sway: Congregationalism eventually adopted Stoddard's stance on communion, despite initial fears of \\"New England's apostasy.\\"James A.Goulding, \\"The Controversy Between Solomon Stoddard and the Mathers: Western versus Eastern Massachusetts Congregationalism\\" (PhD diss., Claremont University, 1971), p.412, 505. Mather remained a formidable opponent. Another contrast between Stoddard and the other Puritan leaders of his time was his belief in the strict dichotomy between the converted (or regenerate) and the unconverted. Stoddard rejected the Puritan claim that no one could discern whether he was saved. Like his own conversion experience, he believed that a person would know when he had been converted, because predestination elected whom God saved and those who were unregenerate. This belief led to the communion controversy: Because of his conversion experience, Solomon stressed the importance of an open communion which would be used as a converting ordinance. In 1677 all members of the community who were instructed in Christian doctrine, made a public profession of faith; and living decent lives, could participate in communion. Stoddard explained that there was no biblical justification for allowing only sinners to take communion. Businessman and administrator During King Philip's War Stoddard, already a man of stature in his community, played an outstanding part in organizing defence against the Indian invasions that fell on the townspeople \\"like wolves and are to be dealt withall as wolves\\".Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS) Collections, 4th series, vol.II, pp.235-7.; H G Swanhart, (1929) PhD , p.81. Later at the ambush of Dewey's Hole, Stoddard was almost killed by Indians. The effect was that he began his pastorate feeling all hostiles should be hunted down and killed. But by 1723 he had undergone a complete transformation, becoming the Indians greatest defender, advocating their conversion to Christianity. In the civil world he maintained a good personal friendship with Judge Samuel Sewall, one of Boston's eminent men.\\"Question Whether God is not Angry...(Boston: Benjamin Green, Aug 9th, 1723) He informed the Governor Gurdon Saltonstall of \\"this Excellent Divine, respecting the Indians.\\"Letters of Samuel Sewall, 6th series, 2, p.140. \\"I congratulate\\", Sewall told his friend, \\"the unparalleled constancy of Serviceableness, which God has honoured you...\\"Letters, op cit, p.162; Swanhart, pp.335-6. In 1701 his step-daughter Eunice Mather was carried off and never seen again. This event had a profound impact upon such a religious man. He wrote copiously to Increase Mather and the Governor warning of impending doom \\"for our preservation...that which the Lord ad delivered.\\"Trumbull, vol.1, p.270. Stoddard was a major contributor to the definitive history of the events: A Briefe History of the War with the Indians in New England.this was reprinted in 1864 by S G Drake, History of King Phillip's War, Boston, MA. he rose to be assumed the public spokesman of his community to Boston. He proposed road-building to improve trade. In 1700 he managed to transfer the ownership of lands to the Township of Northampton, which was granted by petition in 1701.Massachusetts Bay Records, vol.V, p.226; H G Swanhart (1929), p.80 Stoddard's Ecclesiology Raised in an orthodox Reformed context, today Stoddard is remembered mostly for his introduction of the Halfway Covenant in Northampton. By the mid-seventeenth century Puritan New England's first American-born children had come of age, but most children of this second generation were not presenting themselves for full membership in the church. Stoddard introduced the practice of \\"halfway covenanting\\" or \\"owning the covenant\\" in the Northampton church, which permitted adult children who had not formally joined the church to become \\"halfway members.\\" Halfway membership made is possible to affiliate more closely with the church without making a public statement of faith and conversion. The objective of the practice was to allow the adult children of the first generation of settlers, who were committed to Christianity but unsure of their own conversions, to bring their own young children for baptism in the church. Puritans typically reserved the sacrament of baptism only for adult converts and the children of full members.E. Brooks Holifield, Theology in America (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005). Later years Stoddard's change in the sacraments produced little increase in the number of communicants. Nevertheless, he was able to propose two motions to the Northampton Church in 1690: first, to abolish the public profession of faith and second, to appoint the Lord's Supper as a converting ordinance. The first passed by a majority and as a result the population of Northampton doubled from 500 to 1000 in twenty years. The second motion was opposed by the elders of the church, the motion was denied, although the younger people supported it. In 1725, his congregation decided to bring in an assistant, choosing his grandson Jonathan Edwards. Stoddard had a major influence on his grandson and was succeeded by him as the pastor of the church at Northampton. Edwards later repudiated his views, becoming the most famous and fiery orator of the Great Awakening of 1735-1745. The Great Awakening was to some extent a reaction to the failure of The Halfway Covenant to strengthen the church. But Stoddard's influence persisted in Northampton. Edwards' views eventually displeased his parishioners, and he was dismissed from the pulpit. Stoddard may have been too liberal for his grandson Jonathan Edwards, but he was lampooned for prudishness concerning petticoats in an anonymous pamphlet attributedThe Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 1: Journalist, 1706-1730, J.A. Leo Lemay, pg. 178; to Benjamin Franklin. Stoddard published a pamphlet in 1722 entitled \\"Answer to Some Cases of Conscience\\" in which he argued that the newly fashionable hoop petticoats were \\"Contrary to the Light of Nature\\" and that \\"Hooped Petticoats have something of Nakedness\\". Franklin's satirical response was entitled \\"Hoop-Petticoats Arraigned and Condemned, by the Light of Nature, and Law of God\\". Ultimately, Stoddard's power seems to derive more from his personality, political influence, and preaching ability, than from the force of his ideas. One man describes Stoddard with a poem: Works * The Safety of Appearing at the day of Judgment: In the righteousness of Christ, Opened and Applied (1687) * The Tryal of Assurance, set forth in a Sermon; Preached at Boston upon a Lecture Day, July 7, 1698 (Boston, 1698) * The Doctrine of the Instituted Churches (Boston, 1700) * The Way for a People to Live long inn the Land that God hath given them...(Boston: Benjamin Eliot, 1703) * The Sufficiency of One Good Sign, to prove a man to be in a State of Life; cleared up and applied in a sermon preached at Boston, May 30, 1703 (Boston: Benjamin Eliot, 1703) * The Inexcusableness of Neglecting the Worship of the Lords Supper (Boston, 1708) * An Appeal to the Learned.

The historical Pomo territory in Northern California was large, bordered by the Pacific Coast to the west, extending inland to Clear Lake, and mainly between Cleone and Duncans Point. One small group, the Northeastern Pomo of the Stonyford vicinity of Colusa County, was separated from the core Pomo area by lands inhabited by Yuki and Wintuan speakers.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 379 n.68 It originally meant \\"those who live at red earth hole\\" and was once the name of a village in southern Potter Valley near the present-day community of Pomo.. It may have referred to local deposits of the red mineral magnesite, used for red beads, or to the reddish earth and clay, such as hematite, mined in the area.McClendon and Oswalt 1978:277. In the Northern Pomo dialect, -pomo or -poma was used as a suffix after the names of places, to mean a subgroup of people of the place.McClendon and Oswalt 1978:277; Handbook of American Indians, 1906. By 1877 (possibly beginning with Powers), the use of Pomo had been extended in English to mean the entire people known today as the Pomo. The Pomo had 20 chiefs at the same time. Culture The people called Pomo were originally linked by location, language, and cultural expression. They were not socially or politically linked as one large unified group. Instead, they lived in small groups or bands, linked by geography, lineage and marriage. Traditionally they relied upon fishing, hunting and gathering for their food. =History= The Pomo Indian cultures are several ethnolinguistic groups that make up a single language family in Northern California. Their historic territory extended from the Pacific Coast between approximately Cleone and Duncans Point to Clear Lake. The Pomo Indians preferred to live in small groups which are typically called \\"bands\\". These bands were linked by geography, lineage, and marriage. The Pomo cultures originally encompassed hundreds of independent communities. Like many other Native groups, the Pomo Indian of Northern California relied upon fishing, hunting, and gathering for their daily food supply. They ate salmon, wild greens, gnats, mushrooms, berries, grasshoppers, rabbits, rats, and squirrels. Acorns were the most important staple in their diet. The division of labor in Pomo Indian communities typically involved gathering and preparation of plant- based foods by women, while men were hunters and fishers. The Pomo Indian culture is famed for its tradition of intricate basketry. A particularly valued basket type incorporates bird feathers into design of the basket's weave. Some of their most culturally important dances are \\"Ghost Dance\\" and \\"Far South\\". During a \\"Ghost Dance\\" ceremony, they believed that the dead were recognized. And a \\"Far South\\" dance was celebrated as the rite of passage for children to the tribe.The Pomo Nation. Tribes of Native America. The Pomoan languages became severely endangered after European-American colonization of their native territory. Contacts with Russians, the Spanish, and Euro- Americans have impacted these languages, and many are no longer spoken due to language shift to English. There are about twelve Pomo language varieties that are still in use by Pomo people. Pomo, also known as Pomoan or less commonly Kulanapan, is a language family that includes seven distinct and mutually unintelligible languages, including Northern Pomo, Northeastern Pomo, Eastern Pomo, Southeastern Pomo, Central Pomo, Southern Pomo, and Kashaya. John Wesley Powell classified the language family as Kulanapan in 1891, using the name first introduced by George Gibbs in 1853. This name for the language family is derived from the name of one Eastern Pomo village on the south shore of Clear Lake.Powell 1891:87-88. Powers (1877) was the first to refer to this entire language family with the name \\"Pomo\\", and the geographic names that have been used to refer to the seven individual Pomoan languages (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) were introduced by Barrett (1908). =Religion= Doctor's Headdress (guk-tsu-shua), Pomo (Native American), 1906-1907, Brooklyn Museum Clear Lake painted by Jules Tavernier in 1878 A Pomo roundhouse today The Pomo people participated in shamanism; one form this took was the Kuksu religion, which was held by people in Central and Northern California. It included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world, and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.Kroeber, Alfred. The Religion of the Indians of California, 1907, Vol. 4 #6, sections titled \\"Shamanism\\", \\"Public Ceremonies\\", \\"Ceremonial Structures and Paraphernalia\\", and \\"Mythology and Beliefs\\".The Kuksu Cult paraphrased from Kroeber. The Pomo believed in a supernatural being, the Kuksu or Guksu (depending on their dialect), who lived in the south and who came during ceremonies to heal their illnesses. Medicine men dressed up as Kuksu, their interpretation of a healer spirit. A later shamanistic movement was the \\"Messiah Cult\\", introduced by the Wintun people. It was practiced through 1900. This cult believed in prophets who had dreams, \\"waking visions\\" and revelations from \\"presiding spirits\\", and \\"virtually formed a priesthood\\". The prophets earned much respect and status among the people.Barrett 1917: 398, 440-441. =Traditional narratives= The record of Pomo myths, legends, tales, and histories is extensive. The body of narratives is classed within the Central California cultural pattern. The Pomo had a strong mythology of creation and world order. It includes the personification of the Kuksu or Guksu healer spirit, spirits from six cardinal directions, and the Coyote as their ancestor and creator god.Barrett 1917:397-441; Curtis, Edward S. The Creation and Coyote Creates Sun and Moon =Prehistory= According to some linguistic theories, the Pomo people descend from the Hokan-speaking people . One theory places the ancestral community from which the Pomoan languages and cultures are descended in the Sonoma County, California region . This area was where coastal redwood forests met with interior valleys with mixed woodlands. In this hypothesis, about 7000 BCE, a Hokan-speaking people migrated into the valley and mountain regions around Clear Lake, and their language evolved into Proto-Pomo. The lake was rich in resources. About 4000 BCE to 5000 BCE, some of the proto-Pomo migrated into the Russian River Valley and north to present- day Ukiah. Their language diverged into western, southern, central and northern Pomo . Another people, possibly Yukian speakers, lived first in the Russian River Valley and the Lake Sonoma area. The Pomo slowly displaced them and took over these places.Stewart 1985:13-15. Recently, analysis of archaeological evidence has suggested that the indigenous historical economy observed by the Spanish at their arrival in the Pomo lands of central California may have first developed during the Mostin Culture period (8500-6300 BP) in the Clear Lake Basin. This was an economy that was based on women processing acorns by mortar and pestle.White et al 2002:345-351. Tolay Lake site Over 1,000 prehistoric charmstones and numerous arrowheads have been unearthed at Tolay Lake, in southern Sonoma County. These are attributed to both Pomo and Coast Miwok people. As a sacred site, the lake was a ceremonial gathering and healing place.Tolay Lake Park: Natural and Cultural History , County of Sonoma Regional Parks Department: Tolay Lake Regional Park, August 20, 2007. Lake Sonoma sites *At \\"the broken bridge site\\", researchers used radiocarbon dating of artifacts to determine it was inhabited about 3280 BCE, the oldest human-inhabited site in the valley. They consider it part of Skaggs Phase (3000 BCE‚Äî500 BCE).Stewart 1985:53-56. *\\"Oregon Oak Place\\" was dated at 1843 BCE. The surveyors suggested that, compared to the lower river valleys, this remote area was more sparsely settled before the Pomo people arrived. A Pomo Indian in a tule boat, circa 1924. Both of these Skaggs Phase-sites contained millstones and handstones for grinding seeds. The villages may have been used for hunting or temporary camps. Obsidian was used rarely, and it came from Mt. Konocti in present-day Lake County. There were no petroglyphs. The population lived only along major creeks. \\"The Dry Creek Phase\\" lasted from 500 BCE to 1300 CE. During this phase, the indigenous people settled the lands more extensively and permanently. Archaeologists believe a Pomo group took over the lands from the earlier peoples in this phase. They created 14 additional sites in the Warm Springs and Upper Dry Creek areas. Bowl mortars and pestles appeared in this phase, probably used by women to pound acorns (as opposed to the milling stones used for seeds). The sites were more permanent and lifeways \\"more complex\\". Decorative beads and ornaments were made in this phase, and half the artifacts were made of obsidian. Steatite or soapstone objects were found, which must have been imported into the region through trade, as the rock does not exist locally. Relatively soft and easy to carve, soapstone was used to make beads, pendants and mortars. Trade was on a large scale beyond the region. The largest and only substantial steatite mine in California existed on Catalina Island, one of the Channel Islands off the coast of what is now Los Angeles. The existence of steatite in Pomo and Northern California native sites is a strong indicator of the size and complexity of native California trade networks.Stewart 1985:56-59. The next phase, named the \\"Smith Phase\\" after the Pomo consultants, lasted from 1300 CE to the mid-19th century. Researchers mapped 30 sites in this era showing a gradual transition and intensification of trends. The bow and arrow appeared as the main technological advancement. Manufacturing of shell beads, with accompanying production of drills to make holes for stringing and sewing, was important. Drills were found in high numbers. Numerous clamshell beads, a major currency among the Indians of Central California, were also found, indicating a vast trade network.Stewart 1985:59. =Post contact= A Pomo Dancer (Kal-si-wa, Rosa Peters) by Grace Hudson In 1800 there were estimated to be 10,000 to 18,000 Pomo in total among 70 tribes speaking seven Pomo languages.Clear Lake's First People. (pdf) Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake. Retrieved 27 Feb 2009. The way of life of the Pomo changed with the arrival of Russians at Fort Ross (1812 to 1841) on the Pacific coastline, and Spanish missionaries and European-American colonists coming in from the south and east. The Pomo native to the coastline and Fort Ross were known as the Kashaya. They interacted and traded with the Russians. The Spanish missionaries moved many of the southern Pomo from the Santa Rosa Plain to Mission San Rafael, at present-day San Rafael, between 1821 and 1828. Only a few Pomo speakers moved to Mission Sonoma, the other Franciscan mission, located on the north side of San Francisco Bay. The Pomo who remained in the present-day Santa Rosa area of Sonoma County were often called Cainameros in regional history books from the time of Spanish and Mexican occupation. In the Russian River Valley, a missionary baptized the Makahmo Pomo people of the Cloverdale area. Many Pomo left the valley because of this. One such group fled to the Upper Dry Creek Area. The archeology surveyors of the Lake Sonoma region believe that European and Euro-American encroachment was the reason why Pomo villages became more centralized; the people retreated to the remote valley to band together for defense and mutual support. The Pomo suffered from the infectious diseases brought by the Euro-American migrants, including measles and smallpox. They did not have immunity to such diseases and fatalities were high. In 1837 a deadly epidemic of smallpox, originating in settlements at Fort Ross, caused numerous deaths of native people in the Sonoma and Napa regions.Silliman 2004 The Russian River Valley was settled in 1850 by the 49ers, and the Lake Sonoma Valley was homesteaded out. The US government forced many Pomo on to reservations so that the European-Americans could homestead the former Pomo lands. Some Pomo took jobs as ranch laborers; others lived in refugee villages. On 15 May 1850, after tensions and raids by a band in the area, the 1st Dragoons US Cavalry attacked a different group of Indians as punishment. They slaughtered between 60 and 400 people, mostly women and children of the Clear Lake Pomo and neighboring tribes, on an island in Clear Lake.Larson, Elizabeth and Harold LaBonte. \\"Bloody Island atrocity remembered at Saturday ceremony\\" , Lake County News. 13 May 2007 (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) The event became known as the Bloody Island Massacre. One ghost town in the Lake Sonoma Valley excavations was identified as Amacha, built for 100 people but hardly used. Elder natives of the region remember their grandfathers hid at Amacha in the mid-1850s, trying to evade the oncoming immigrants. They tell that one day soldiers took all the people in the village to government lands and burned the village houses.Stewart 1985:59-60 From 1891 to 1935, starting with National Thorn, the artist Grace Hudson painted over 600 portraits, mainly of Pomo individuals living near her in the Ukiah area. Her style was sympathetic and poignant, as she portrayed domestic native scenes that would have been fast disappearing in that time. Basket weaving tradition Girl's Coiled Dowry or Puberty Basket (kol-chu or ti-ri-bu-ku), late 19th century, Brooklyn Museum Pomo basket on display, ca.1900 Pomo basket (collected in 1905) in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin =In the past= Women traditionally wove Pomo baskets with great care and technique. The three different techniques of Pomo basket weaving are plaiting, coiling, and twining.Tony Phillips. Mendocino Coast History, 2014. One drying method was wrapping maiden fern in blue clay and placing underground for several days. This prevented fading in the sun or when cooking mush. Pomo baskets made by Pomo Indian women of Northern California are recognized worldwide for their exquisite appearance, range of technique, fineness of weave, and diversity of form and use. While women mostly made baskets for cooking, storing food, and religious ceremonies, Pomo men also made baskets for fishing weirs, bird traps, and baby baskets. There are many different designs that are woven into the baskets that signify different cultural meanings. For example, the Dau is a pattern woven into a basket by creating a small change in the stitching to create a small opening between two stitches. The Dau is the design that is also called the Spirit Door. This Spirit Door allows good spirits to come and circulate inside of the basket while the good or bad spirits are released.Phillips, Tony. (2014) \\"Mendocino Coast History- The Pomo\\" Retrieved from http://www.mendorailhistory.org/1_redwoods/pomo.htm Making the baskets required great skill and knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving baskets changed with the seasons and years, so did the materials used for the baskets. The Pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pileated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With the feathers, 30-50 to every inch, beads were fastened to the basket's border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets. The materials used to make the baskets‚Äîincluding but not limited to, swamp canes, saguaro cactuses, rye grass, black ash, willow shoots, sedge roots, the bark of redbud, the root of bulrush, and the root of the gray pine‚Äîwere harvested annually.Sonoma Webmasters (2014) \\"Dry Creek Rancheria- The Pomo\\" Retrieved from: http://drycreekrancheria.com/ After being picked, the materials are dried, cleaned, split, soaked, and dyed. Sometimes the materials are also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry. Although baskets were made for decorating homes and as gifts, they were centrally used in Pomo daily life as well. Basket weaving is considered sacred to the Pomo tribe and baskets were produced for a variety of purposes. Pomo children were cradled in baskets, acorns (a major food staple to the Pomo) were harvested in great conical burden baskets, and food was stored, cooked, and served in baskets‚Äîsome even being watertight. There were even \\"baskets\\" that were made as boats to be pushed by men to carry women across rivers. A commercial market developed in the latter part of the 19th century developed for authentic baskets, and it lasted from about 1876 to the 1930s.* Two Pomo people who capitalized on this market were William Ralganal Benson and his wife, Mary Knight Benson and the Bensons may have been the first California Indians who supported themselves solely by crafting and selling their baskets to collectors and museums. Within this time period in addition to basket weaving, the Pomo also manufactured elaborate jewelry made from abalone and clamshells. Assembled during the winter, during the summer the Pomo would travel from various sites along the coast where they would fish and gather all of their materials needed to create their jewelry. The Pomo Indians would create stunning, beautiful, and intricate forms of jewelry that were worn during celebrations and rituals, and even given as gifts. Both of these traditions of creation and culture have slowly dispersed and have become less common over the history of the tribe but more evident in today's culture. =Cross-cultural impacts= European and Mexican impact In the 1800s, The Pomo Indian entered a busy market with some European people. One of their most wanted items was Pomo Indian fur. The Pomo Indian mostly traded fur with Russian people. The Russian missionaries began preaching and converting people.Giese, P. (1997, June 7). The California Pomo People, Brief History -- Native American Art. Pritzker, Barry M. (2014). Pomo. In The American Mosaic: The American Indian Experience. Article. Richerson, P., & Richerson, S. (n.d.). Bloody Island. Bioregion UC Davis. Web. Then the Spanish missionaries came and did the same thing (Pritzker, par. 15). As a result, many Pomo Indian members died due to the spread of smallpox and measles (King, 626). In the 1830s and 1840s, the Californian Mexicans, who tried to turn them into slaves, attacked the Pomo Indians if they decided not to cooperate with their demands. =The United States' marches to Round Valley= Members of the Round Valley Indian Tribe retrace a forced 1863 relocation to Covelo, California Like many other Native groups, the Pomo Indians were also attacked and pressured by the U.S. government. The Pomo were a part of the relocation known as \\"Marches to Round Valley\\" in 1856, which was conducted by the U.S. federal government. By using bullwhips and guns, white settlers demanded relocation to reservations of the Pomo Indian. The justification given was that to protect their culture, the Pomo Indians had to be removed from their ancestral land. During this time period, two settlers named Andrew Kelsey and Charles Stone enslaved many Pomo people in order to work as cowboys on their ranch.Richerson, P., & Richerson, S. (nd). Bloody Island. Bioregion UC Davis. Web. Smith-Ferri, S. (1998). The development of the commercial market for Pomo Indian. Expedition, 40(1), 15. They forced the Pomo Indians to work in very intense and unorthodox conditions, and sexually abused the Pomo women. The Pomo men were forced to work in harsh conditions and were not given any respect by the settlers. Eventually, the Pomo Indians got sick of the disrespect and horrid practices of Stone and Kelsey, so they rebelled. The Pomo men set up a sneak attack and killed both Stone and Kelsey. Because of the deaths of Kelsey and Stone, United States lieutenant J. W. Davidson and captain Nathaniel Lyon sent an army to retaliate against the Pomo people. This resulted in an event called the Bloody Island Massacre of 1850, in Clear Lake.Richerson, P., & Richerson, S. (nd). Bloody Island. Bioregion UC Davis. Web. Smith-Ferri, S. (1998). The development of the commercial market for Pomo Indian. Expedition, 40(1), 15. This resulted in dozens of Pomo Indians being killed. Richerson & Richerson stated that before the European conquests there was an estimated 3,000 Pomo Indians that lived at Clear Lake; after all of the death, disease, and killings, there were only about 400 Pomo Indians left. =United States Indian reservations ‚Äì A false sense of hope= Shortly after the massacre, in 1851‚Äì1852, four Indian reservations were opened up by the United States government in California; the Pomo Indians saw it as a way to retain certain aspects of their cultural heritage. =A time for rebuilding= Even though most of their original land was taken over, this was the first turning point for the Pomo people. They had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of, and even though they had to settle on poor, isolated land, they finally got to make a stride towards tradition and basket weaving. From 1852-1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them. Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.Pritzker, Barry M. (2014). Pomo. In The American Mosaic: The American Indian Experience. Article. The Pomo Indians did not have enough money to buy land. The Pomo men decided to work for ranchers and the woman went back to making baskets. The \\"white\\" people loved the baskets, especially the designer, feathered ones, which led to a basketry movement. Finally, in 1878, the Pomo Indians bought their first piece of land in California. Paula Giese noted, \\"In 1878, a group of Northern Pomo people bought 7 acres in Coyote Valley. In 1880, another Northern Pomo group bought 100 acres along Ackerman Creek (now known as Pinoleville)\\" (1996, par. 30). In 1881, Yokaya Rancheria was financed by central Pomo people. Once the Pomo Indians had bought the land, it was time to make money. Baskets were in so much demand at this point, even though they were once used for trade and bartering with other tribes and people, they now became the Pomo people's way to make money and build their newly found empires. It was the women, who had held the basket weaving tradition, which made a huge change for the Pomo people. The baskets were wanted all over California; it was a piece of art that traders wanted. Grandmothers and daughters taught other Pomo women, who had lost the tradition of basket weaving, how to make the all-powerful baskets. Basket weaving turned into an art and lifestyle that helped the Pomo people prosper. Basket weaving is not something that many people know how to craft, and even in today's society; the hand-made Pomo baskets are something that is truly valuable and collectable.King, J. C. H. (1999). Pomo Indian basket weavers. their baskets and the art market. American Anthropologist, 101(3), 619-627. Book. =Basket weaving today= Fully feathered basket curated at the Jesse Peter Multicultural Museum, Santa Rosa CollegePomo basket weaving is still valued and honored today, not only by the Pomo Indians themselves, but also by amateur enthusiasts, buyers for curio dealers, and scientific collectors. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria are a federally recognized American Indian tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians. During the past 30 years, the appreciation for American Indian art has been on the rise, and the art has become in demand ‚Äì specifically Pomo Indian basketry. Dr. Joallyn Archambault, director of the American Indian Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History says: \\"Since the 1880s, when Pomo baskets first became sought after, the Pomo have changed their lifestyles enormously.\\" Pomo today live normal modern lifestyles, but the basket weavers are still heralded and praised within the community for their artistic ability and skill.Harney, T. (19, April 92). Beauty of pomo Indian baskets endures; their value continues to rise : Native culture. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-19/local/me-1027_1_pomo-baskets One of those basket weavers is Julia F. Parker. She is a master weaver, having woven under Lucy Telles. Her childhood was rough, constantly moving around until boarding school after her parents‚Äô death at 6. Lucy had taught Julia because of her perceived interest in preserving Indian culture and specifically basketry. Julia Parker became cultural demonstrator after Lucy Telles death in 1956. She continued in her studies and later studied Pomo basketry with Pomo master weaver Elsie Allen (1899‚Äì1990) at Ukiah and several others. Julia belongs to the Miwok Pomo and Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. Many of her baskets are in museums in Yosemite, Mono Lake and other museums; she even presented her baskets to the Queen of England. The materials for baskets were sedge root, willow shoots and roots, bulrush or blackroot, redbud shoots, sometimes bracken fern and a variety of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. They were, after all, living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.Parulis, John. \\"Bright Path Video.\\" The Spiritual Practice of Pomo Basketweaving. Version 1. BP Video, 31 Oct. 2006. Web. 27 Apr. 2014. http://www.brightpathvideo.com/pdf/Pomo Today, new Pomo baskets might sell for as much as $1,000, and the more historical ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival. Today you will see rare baskets being sold for the prices mentioned above. Due to the time and preparation necessary to weave these pieces of art; basket weavers today have more requests than they can fulfill, and many customers wait months before receiving orders. The rarity of the baskets and the skill are required in making them in what makes them valuable. The demand is greater than the supply, and collectors facilitate a high demand for these artistically made baskets. Population In 1770 there were about 8,000 Pomo people; in 1851 population was estimated between 3,500 and 5,000; and in 1880 estimated at 1450.Cook 1976:236-245. The 1910 Census reported 777 Pomo, but that is probably low. Anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber estimated 1,200 in the same year.Kroeber According to the 1930 census there were 1,143. In 1990, the census showed 4,900. According to the 2010 United States Census, there are 10,308 Pomo people in the United States. Of these, 8,578 reside in California.Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 - 2010 Census American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File. U.S. Census Bureau. Villages and communities =Federally recognized tribes= The United States acknowledges many groups of native people of the United States as \\"federally recognized tribes\\", classifying them as \\"domestic dependent nations\\" under the jurisdiction of the federal government, but with some autonomy from their respective states, including California. Many other self- identified Native American groups are not federally recognized. Since the late 20th century, some states have begun to give formal recognition to tribes in varying ways. The Pomo groups presently recognized by the United States are based in Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino counties. They include the following tribes: California Indians and Their Reservations.

Selected as a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor in her adolescence, she gave birth to a son, Zaichun, in 1856. After the Xianfeng Emperor's death in 1861, the young boy became the Tongzhi Emperor, and she became the Empress Dowager. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency, which she shared with Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control over the dynasty when she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, contrary to the traditional rules of succession of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644. Cixi supervised the Tongzhi Restoration, a series of moderate reforms that helped the regime survive until 1911. Although Cixi refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological and military reforms and the Self- Strengthening Movement as a means of limited Westernization to preserve her own power and the dynasty. In regards to the Hundred Days' Reforms of 1898, she feared that sudden implementation would disrupt Manchu rule, and that the Japanese and other foreign powers would take advantage of the ensuing weakness. She not only engineered a putsch that enabled her to take over as regent, but also placed the Guangxu Emperor under virtual house arrest for supporting said reformers, and is reputed to have poisoned him. Additionally, she publicly executed the main reformers, an act which extinguished the momentum for China's modernization while fueling public disfavor that would ultimately end her dynasty's rule. After the Boxer Rebellion led to invasion by Allied armies, Cixi backed the Boxer groups and declared war on the invaders to preserve her own power and the dynasty. The ensuing defeat was a stunning humiliation. When Cixi returned to Beijing from Xi'an, where she had taken the emperor, she became friendly to foreigners in the capital and began to implement fiscal and institutional reforms aimed to turn China into a constitutional monarchy while simultaneously continuing the practice of corruption in ways such as selling titles and embezzling funds originally earmarked for building a new imperial navy, channeling it into vanity projects such as the Marble Boat, an architectural folly that is ironically \\"moored\\" on Lake Kunming. The death of both Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor in November 1908 left the court in hands of Manchu conservatives, a child, Puyi, on the throne, and a deeply dissatisfied, divided society. Historians both in China and abroad have debated her contentious legacy. The general consensus is that she was a ruthless despot whose reactionary, self-interested policies were an attempt to prolong her own power and that of the ailing Qing dynasty, but instead ultimately led to its humiliation and utter downfall in the Wuchang Uprising. However, some revisionists claim that Nationalist and Communist revolutionaries scapegoated her for trying her utmost regarding problems beyond salvage, lauding her maintenance of political order as well as some effective, if belated reforms such as the replacement of the ancient examination system by institutions such as the newly built Peking University. Life =Birth= The future Empress Dowager Cixi was born on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month in the 15th year of the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (29 November 1835). Her father was Huizheng (), a member of the Bordered Blue Banner who held the title of a third class duke (). Palace archives show that Huizheng was working in Beijing during the year of Lady Yehe Nara's birth, an indication that she was born in Beijing. The file records the location of her childhood home: Pichai Hutong, Xisipailou, Beijing () and Pewter Lane, Xila Hutong () Information listed on a red sheet (File No. 1247) in the \\"Miscellaneous Pieces of the Palace\\" (a Qing dynasty documentation package retrieved from the First Historical Archives of China) She had a sister named Wanzhen and a brother named Guixiang. =Xianfeng era= Consort Dowager Kangci, foster mother of the Xianfeng Emperor. She hosted the selection of the Xianfeng Emperor's consorts in 1851, in which Cixi participated as a potential candidate. In 1851, Cixi participated in the selection for wives to the Xianfeng Emperor alongside 60 other candidates. Cixi was one of the few candidates chosen to stay. Among the other chosen candidates were Noble Lady Li of the Tatara clan (later Consort Li) and Concubine Zhen of the Niohuru clan (later the Xianfeng Emperor's empress consort). On 26 June 1852, she entered the Forbidden City and was placed in the sixth rank of consorts, styled \\"Noble Lady Lan\\". The Pavilion of Beautiful Scenery, where Cixi gave birth to the Tongzhi Emperor On 28 February 1854, Cixi was elevated to the fifth rank of consorts and granted the title \\"Concubine Yi\\". In 1855, Cixi became pregnant, and on 27 April 1856, she gave birth to the crown prince Zaichun, the Xianfeng Emperor's first and only surviving son. On the same day, she was elevated to the fourth rank of consorts as \\"Consort Yi\\".Laidler, Keith (2003), \\"The Last Empress\\" (p. 58), John Wiley & Sons Inc., . In 1857, when her son reached his first birthday, Cixi was elevated to the third rank of consorts as \\"Noble Consort Yi\\". This rank placed her second only to the Empress Niohuru among the women within the Xianfeng Emperor's harem. Unlike many of the other Manchu women in the imperial household, Cixi was known for her ability to read and write Chinese. This skill granted her numerous opportunities to help the ailing emperor in the governing of the Chinese state on a daily basis. On various occasions, the Xianfeng Emperor had Cixi read palace memorials for him and leave instructions on the memorials according to his will. As a result, Cixi became well-informed about state affairs and the art of governing from the ailing emperor.56.com =Tongzhi era= In September 1860, during the closing stages of the Second Opium War, the British diplomatic envoy Harry Parkes was arrested along with other hostages, who were tortured and executed. In retaliation, British and French troops under the command of Lord Elgin attacked Beijing, and by the following month they had burned the Old Summer Palace to the ground. The Xianfeng Emperor and his entourage, including Cixi, fled Beijing to Rehe Province (around present-day Chengde, Hebei).Immanual Hsu (1985), The Rise of Modern China (pg. 215). On hearing the news of the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, the Xianfeng Emperor, who was already showing signs of dementia, fell into a depression. He turned heavily to alcohol and drugs and became seriously ill.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 44 He summoned eight of his most prestigious ministers, headed by Sushun, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, and named them the \\"Eight Regent Ministers\\" to direct and support the future emperor. The Xianfeng Emperor died on 22 August 1861 at the Chengde Mountain Resort in Rehe Province. The Xianfeng Emperor's heir, the son of Noble Consort Yi (Empress Dowager Cixi), was only five years old. It is commonly assumed that on his deathbed, the Xianfeng Emperor summoned his Empress and Noble Consort Yi and gave each of them a stamp. He hoped that when his son ascended the throne, the Empress and Noble Consort Yi would cooperate in harmony and help the young emperor to grow and mature together. This may also have been done as a check on the power of the eight regents. There is no evidence for this incident, however, and it is unlikely that the emperor ever would have intended Noble Consort Yi to wield political power. It is possible that the seal, allegedly given as a symbol for the child, was really just a present for Noble Consort Yi herself. Informal seals numbered in the thousands and were not considered political accouterments, rather objects of art commissioned for pleasure by emperors to stamp on items such as paintings, or given as presents to the concubines.[Sui Lijuan: Carrying out the Coup. CCTV-10 Series on Cixi, Ep. 4] Upon the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, his Empress was elevated to the status of empress dowager. Although her official title was \\"Empress Dowager Ci'an\\", she was popularly known as the \\"East Empress Dowager\\" because she lived in the eastern Zhongcui Palace. Noble Consort Yi was also elevated to \\"Empress Dowager Cixi\\". She was popularly known as the \\"West Empress Dowager\\" (Ë•øÂ§™Âêé) because she lived inside the western Chuxiu Palace. Xinyou Coup: Ousting Sushun Portrait of Empress Dowager Ci'an (co-regent with Cixi), with whom Cixi staged the Xinyou Coup. By the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a shrewd political strategist. In Rehe Province, while waiting for an astrologically auspicious time to transport the emperor's coffin back to Beijing, Cixi conspired with court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. At that time, Cixi's position as the lower-ranked empress dowager had no intrinsic political power attached to it. In addition, her son, the young emperor, was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures, including the late emperor's principal wife, Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning empress dowagers, with powers exceeding the eight regents; the two had long been close friends since Cixi first came to the imperial household.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 45 Tensions grew between the two Empresses Dowager and the eight regents, who were led by Sushun. The regents did not appreciate Cixi's interference in political affairs, and their frequent confrontations with the Empresses Dowager left Empress Dowager Ci'an frustrated. Ci'an often refused to come to court audiences, leaving Cixi to deal with the ministers alone. Secretly, Cixi had begun gathering the support of talented ministers, soldiers, and others who were ostracized by the eight regents for personal or political reasons. Among them was Prince Gong, who had been excluded from power, yet harboured great ambitions, and Prince Chun, the sixth and seventh brothers of the Xianfeng Emperor, respectively. While Cixi aligned herself with the two princes, a memorial came from Shandong asking for her to \\"listen to politics behind the curtains,\\" i.e., to assume power as de facto ruler. The same memorial also asked Prince Gong to enter the political arena as a principal \\"aide to the Emperor\\". When the Xianfeng Emperor's funeral procession left for Beijing, Cixi took advantage of her alliances with Princes Gong and Chun. She and the boy emperor returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the eight regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased emperor's procession. Cixi's early return to Beijing meant that she had more time to plan with Prince Gong and ensure that the power base of the eight regents was divided between Sushun and his allies, Zaiyuan and Duanhua. In order to remove them from power, history was rewritten: the regents were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the \\"barbarians\\" that had caused the Xianfeng Emperor to flee to Rehe Province \\"greatly against his will\\", among other charges. To display her high moral standards, Cixi executed only three of the eight regents. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as slow slicing (\\"death by a thousand cuts\\"), but Cixi declined the suggestion and ordered that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two also marked for execution, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, were given pieces of white silk for them to hang themselves with. In addition, Cixi refused outright the idea of executing the family members of the regents, as would be done in accordance with imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing imperial tradition also dictated that women and princes were never to engage in politics. In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the only empress dowager in the Qing dynasty to assume the role of regent, following a practice known as \\"ruling from behind the curtains\\" () in Chinese. This coup is historically known as the Xinyou Coup because it took place in the xinyou year, the name of the year 1861 in the Chinese sexagenary cycle. Ruling behind the curtain =New era= In November 1861, a few days following the Xinyou Coup, Cixi was quick to reward Prince Gong for his help. He was appointed Prince-Regent and his eldest daughter was made a first rank princess, a title usually bestowed only on the Empress's first-born daughter. However, Cixi avoided giving Prince Gong the absolute political power that princes such as Dorgon exercised during the Shunzhi Emperor's reign. As one of the first acts of \\"ruling behind the curtain\\", Cixi, nominally along with Ci'an, issued two imperial edicts on behalf of the boy emperor. The first stated that the two Empresses Dowager were to be the sole decision-makers \\"without interference,\\" and the second changed the emperor's regnal title from Qixiang (; \\"auspicious\\") to Tongzhi (; \\"collective stability\\"). Despite being designated as the sole decision-makers, both Ci'an and Cixi were forced to rely on the Grand Council and a complex series of procedures in order to deal with affairs of state. When state documents came in, they were to be first forwarded to the Empresses Dowager, then referred back to Prince Gong and the Grand Council. Having discussed the matters, Prince Gong and his colleagues would seek the instruction of the Empresses Dowager at audiences and imperial orders would be drawn up accordingly, with drafts having to be approved by the Empresses Dowager before edicts were issued. The most important role of the Empresses Dowager during the regency was to apply their seals to edicts, a merely mechanical role in a complex bureaucracy. =Cleaning up the bureaucracy= Cixi's ascendancy came at a time of internal chaos and foreign challenges. The deleterious effects of the Second Opium War were still in effect, and the Taiping Rebellion continued its seemingly unstoppable advance through China's south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with corruption. 1861 happened to be the year of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, and she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the Bureaucratic Affairs Department (ÂêèÈÉ®). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military shilang who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang, who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city. A number of reforms were implemented, such as the development of the Zongli Yamen, an official foreign ministry to deal with international affairs, the restoration of regional armies and regional strongmen, modernization of railroads, factories, and arsenals, an increase of industrial and commercial productivity, and the institution of a period of peace that allowed China time to modernize. Another significant challenge Cixi faced was the increasingly decrepit state of the Manchu elites. Since the beginning of Qing rule over China in 1644, most major positions at court had been held by Manchus. Cixi, again in a reversal of imperial tradition, entrusted the country's most powerful military unit against the Taiping rebels into the hands of a Han Chinese, Zeng Guofan. Additionally, in the next three years, Cixi appointed Han Chinese officials as governors in all southern Chinese provinces, raising alarm bells in the court, traditionally protective of Manchu dominance. Regarding the reforms of the Tongzhi Restoration, Mary C. Wright claims that \\"Not only a dynasty but also a civilization which appeared to have collapsed was revived to last for another sixty years by the extraordinary efforts of extraordinary men in the 1860s.\\" John K. Fairbank wrote, \\"That the Qing managed to survive both domestic and international attacks is due largely to the policy and leadership changes known as the Qing Restoration.\\" =Taiping victory and Prince Gong= 222x222px Under the command of Zeng Guofan, the victorious Xiang Army defeated the Taiping rebel army in a hard-fought battle at Tianjing (present-day Nanjing) in July 1864. Zeng was rewarded with the title of \\"Marquess Yiyong, First Class\\", while his brother Zeng Guoquan, along with Li Hongzhang, Zuo Zongtang and other Han Chinese officers who fought against the Taiping rebels, were rewarded with auspicious decorations and titles. With the Taiping rebel threat receding, Cixi focused her attention on new internal threats to her power. Of special concern was the position of Prince Gong, who was Prince-Regent in the imperial court. Prince Gong gathered under his command the support of all outstanding Han Chinese armies. In addition, Prince Gong controlled daily court affairs as the head of the Grand Council and the Zongli Yamen (the de facto foreign affairs ministry). With his increasing stature, Prince Gong was considered a threat to Cixi and her power. Although Prince Gong was rewarded for his conduct and recommendation of Zeng Guofan before the Taiping rebels' defeat, Cixi was quick to move after Cai Shouqi, a minor scribe-official, filed a memorial accusing Prince Gong of corruption and showing disrespect to the emperor. Having built up a powerful base and a network of allies at court, Prince Gong considered the accusations insignificant. Cixi, however, took the memorial as a stepping stone to Prince Gong's removal. In April 1865, under the pretext that Prince Gong had \\"improper court conduct before the two empresses,\\" among a series of other charges, the prince was dismissed from all his offices and appointments, but was allowed to retain his status as a noble.Ê∏ÖÂè≤Á®øÔºöÊÅ≠Âø†Ë¶™ÁéãÂ•ïË®¢ÔºåÂÆ£ÂÆóÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠Â≠ê The dismissal surprised the nobility and court officials and brought about numerous petitions for his return. Prince Gong's brothers, Prince Dun and Prince Chun, both sought their brother's reinstatement. Prince Gong himself, in an audience with the two empresses, burst into tears.Ê∏ÖÂè≤Á®øÔºöÊÅ≠Âø†Ë¶™ÁéãÂ•ïË®¢ÂÇ≥Ë®òËºâÔºö\\"ÁéãÂÖ•Ë¨ùÔºåÁóõÂì≠ÂºïÂíé\\"„ÄÇ Bowing to popular pressure, Cixi allowed Prince Gong to return to his position as the head of the Zongli Yamen, but rid him of his title of Prince-Regent. Prince Gong would never return to political prominence again, and neither would the liberal and pro-reform policies of his time. Prince Gong's demotion revealed Cixi's iron grip on politics, and her lack of willingness to give up absolute power to anyone ‚Äì not even Prince Gong, her most important ally in the Xinyou Coup. =Foreign influence= Princess Rongshou (center seated), Prince Gong's daughter. As a way to show gratitude to the prince, Cixi adopted his daughter and elevated her to a first rank princess (the highest rank for imperial princesses). China's defeat in the Second Opium War of 1856‚Äì60 was a wake-up call for the Qing Dynasty. Naval and land military strategies were outdated, both on land and sea and in terms of weaponry. As she was forced to acknowledge that China's agricultural-based economy could not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi decided China would learn from the Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions; Cixi not only supported their endeavors, but also decreed the opening of the School of Combined Learning in 1862, a school for foreign languages in Beijing. The School of Combined Learning offered the latest Western knowledge in topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the United States for studies. Cixi's reforms were quickly met with impediments. The Chinese military institutions were in desperate need of reform. Cixi's solution, under the advice of officials at court, was to purchase seven British warships. But wary of threats to imperial power, she ultimately rejected the new British warships when they arrived manned with British sailors. Scholars sometimes attribute the failure of Cixi's attempts at reforms to her conservative attitude and old methods of thinking, and contend that Cixi would learn only so much from the foreigners, provided it did not infringe upon her own power. Under the pretext that a railway was too loud and would \\"disturb the emperors' tombs\\", Cixi forbade its construction. When construction went ahead anyway in 1877 on Li Hongzhang's recommendation, Cixi asked that they be pulled by horse-drawn carts.[Professor Sui Lijuang: Lecture Room Series on Cixi, Episode 9] Cixi was especially alarmed at the liberal thinking of people who had studied abroad, and noted that it posed a new threat to her power. In 1881, Cixi put a halt to the policy of sending children abroad to study and withdrew her formerly open attitude towards foreigners. Marriage of the Tongzhi Emperor phoenixes emerging from the surface represent the empress. The Walters Art Museum In 1872, the Tongzhi Emperor turned 17. Under the guidance of the Empress Dowager Ci'an, he was married to the Jiashun Empress. The empress's grandfather, Prince Zheng, was one of the eight regents ousted from power in the Xinyou Coup of 1861. He had been Cixi's rival during the coup and was ordered to commit suicide after Cixi's victory. As a consequence, there were tensions between Cixi and the empress, and this was often a source of irritation for Cixi. Moreover, the empress's zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a goat. According to Cixi's belief, it was a warning from the gods that she would eventually fall prey to the empress. Portrait of Empress Xiaozheyi, also known as the Jiashun Empress and \\"Lady Arute\\", who had the approval of Empress Dowager Ci'an but never Cixi's. It is widely speculated that the Empress was pregnant with the Tongzhi Emperor's child and that Cixi orchestrated the empress's demise. As the principal consort of the Tongzhi Emperor, the Jiashun Empress was well received by both the emperor and Empress Dowager Ci'an. Her personal consultants once warned her to be more agreeable and docile to Cixi, as Cixi was truly the one in power. The empress replied, \\"I am a principal consort, having been carried through the front gate with pomp and circumstance, as mandated by our ancestors. Empress Dowager Cixi was a concubine, and entered our household through a side gate.\\" Since the very beginning of his marriage, the Tongzhi Emperor proceeded to spend most of his time with his empress at the expense of his four concubines, including the Imperial Noble Consort Shushen, who was Cixi's preferred candidate for the Tongzhi Emperor's empress consort. As hostility grew between Cixi and the Jiashun Empress, Cixi suggested the couple spend more time on studies and ordered palace eunuchs to spy on the Tongzhi Emperor. After her warning was ignored, Cixi ordered the couple to separate, and the Tongzhi Emperor purportedly spent several months following Cixi's order in isolation at Qianqing Palace. =The Tongzhi Emperor's deficiencies in ruling= The Tongzhi Emperor received a rigorous education from four famous teachers of Cixi's own choosing: Li Hongzao, Qi Junzao, Weng Xincun, and Woren. This group was later joined by Weng Xincun's son, Weng Tonghe; the emperor's governor, also selected by Cixi, was Mianyu. The imperial teachers instructed the emperor in the classics and various old texts for which the emperor displayed little or no interest. Despite, or perhaps because of, the pressure and stress put upon the young emperor, he despised learning for the majority of his life. According to Weng Tonghe's diary, the emperor could not read a memorandum in full sentences by the age of 16. Worried about her son's inability to learn, Cixi only pressured him more. When he was given personal rule in November 1873 at the age of 18 (four years behind the usual custom), the Tongzhi Emperor proved to be an incompetent ruler. Portrait of the Tongzhi Emperor doing his coursework. Cixi's high expectations of him may have contributed to his strong distaste for learning. The Tongzhi Emperor made two important policy decisions during his short stint of rule, which lasted from 1873 to 1875. First, he decreed that the Summer Palace, destroyed by the English and French in the Second Opium War, would be completely rebuilt under the pretext that it was a gift to Cixi and Ci'an. Historians also suggest that it was an attempt to drive Cixi from the Forbidden City so that he could rule without interference in policy or his private affairs. The imperial treasury was almost depleted at the time from internal strife and foreign wars, and as a result, the Tongzhi Emperor asked the Board of Finance to forage for the necessary funds. In addition, he encouraged members of the nobility and high officials to donate funds from their personal resources. Once construction began, the emperor checked its progress on a monthly basis, and would often spend days away from court, indulging himself in pleasures outside of the Forbidden City. Uneasy about the Tongzhi Emperor's neglect of national affairs, the emperor's uncles Prince Gong and Prince Chun, along with other senior court officials, submitted a joint memorandum asking the emperor to cease the construction of the Summer Palace, among other recommendations. The Tongzhi Emperor, unwilling to submit to criticism, issued an imperial edict in August 1874 to strip Prince Gong of his princely title and demote him to the status of a commoner. Two days later, Prince Dun, Prince Chun, Prince Fu, Jingshou, Prince Qing, Wenxiang, Baojun, and Grand Councilors Shen Guifen and Li Hongzao were all to be stripped of their respective titles and jobs. Upon witnessing the mayhem unfold from behind the scenes, Cixi and Ci'an made an unprecedented appearance at court directly censuring the emperor for his wrongful actions and asked him to withdraw the edict; Cixi said that \\"without Prince Gong, the situation today would not exist for you and me.\\"„ÄäÊ∏ÖÂæ∑ÂÆóÂØ¶ÈåÑ„Äã Feeling a grand sense of loss at court and unable to assert his authority, the Tongzhi Emperor physically weakened. The physicians claimed that the emperor had smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, the emperor died on January 14, 1875; the Jiashun Empress followed suit in March. By 1875, Cixi was back onto the helm of imperial power. =Guangxu era= New challenges and illness Empress Dowager Cixi (front middle) poses with her court attendants and the Guangxu Emperor's empress (second from left), who was also her niece Empress Dowager Cixi holds hands with the fourth daughter of Prince Qing (to her left) and chief palace eunuch Li Lianying (to her right). The lady standing in the background is Consort Jin (later Dowager Consort Duankang). The Tongzhi Emperor died without a male heir, a circumstance that created an unprecedented succession crisis in the dynastic line. Members of the generation above were considered unfit, as they could not, by definition, be the successor of their nephew. Therefore, the new emperor had to be from a generation below or the same generation as the Tongzhi Emperor. After considerable disagreement between the two Empresses Dowager, Zaitian, the four-year-old firstborn son of Prince Chun and Cixi's sister, was to become the new emperor. 1875 was declared the first year of the Guangxu era; Guangxu was the new emperor's regnal name and it means \\"glorious succession\\". Zaitian was taken from home and for the remainder of his life would be cut completely off from his family. While addressing Ci'an conventionally as huang e'niang (\\"Empress Mother\\"), Zaitian was forced to address Cixi as qin baba (\\"Dear Father\\"), in order to enforce an image that she was the fatherly figure in the household. The Guangxu Emperor began his education when he was aged five, taught by the imperial tutor Weng Tonghe, with whom he would develop a lasting bond. Shortly after the accession of the Guangxu Emperor, Cixi fell severely ill.Executive Documents Printed By Order of the House of Representatives 1875-'76, pg. 288, retrieved July 24th, 2013 http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/FRUS.FRUS187475 This rendered her largely inaccessible to her young nephew and had the result of leaving Ci'an to attend to most of the affairs of state. The sudden death of Ci'an in April 1881 brought Cixi a new challenge. Ci'an had taken little interest in running state affairs, but was the decision-maker in most family affairs. As the consort of the Xianfeng Emperor, she took seniority over Cixi, despite being two years her junior. Rumors began circulating at court to the effect that Cixi had poisoned Ci'an, perhaps as a result of a possible conflict between Cixi and Ci'an over either the execution of the eunuch An Dehai in 1869 or a possible will from the late Xianfeng Emperor that was issued exclusively to Ci'an.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 49 Because of a lack of evidence, however, historians are reluctant to believe that Ci'an was poisoned by Cixi, but instead choose to believe that the cause of death was a sudden stroke, as validated by traditional Chinese medicine. In the years between 1881 and 1883, Cixi resorted to written communication only with her ministers.Kwong, pg. 25 The young Guangxu Emperor reportedly was forced to conduct some audiences alone, without Cixi to assist him.Kwong, pg. 54 The once fierce and determined Prince Gong, frustrated by Cixi's iron grip on power, did little to question Cixi on state affairs, and supported Manchu involvement in the Sino-French War of 1884‚Äì1885. Cixi used China's loss in the war as a pretext for getting rid of Prince Gong and other important decision- makers in the Grand Council in 1885. She downgraded Prince Gong to \\"advisor\\" and elevated the more easily influenced Prince Chun. When it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her adopted son, Emperor Guangxu, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan's victories over China has often been falsely rumored to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy's defeat by embezzling funds from the navy in order to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, extensive research by Chinese historians revealed that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy's decline. In actuality, China's defeat was caused by Emperor Guangxu's lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on. The Guangxu Emperor's accession Consort Zhen, the Guangxu Emperor's most beloved consort, was initially liked, but eventually hated by Cixi. The Guangxu Emperor technically gained the right to rule at the age of 16 in 1887 after Cixi issued an edict to arrange a ceremony to mark his accession. Because of her prestige and power, however, court officials voiced their opposition to the Guangxu Emperor's personal rule, citing the emperor's youth as the main reason. Prince Chun and Weng Tonghe, each with a different motive, requested that the Guangxu Emperor's accession be postponed until a later date. Cixi, with her reputed reluctance, accepted the \\"advice\\" by legitimizing her continued rule through a new legal document that allowed her to \\"aid\\" the Guangxu Emperor in his rule indefinitely. The Guangxu Emperor slowly began to take on more responsibilities in spite of Cixi's prolonged regency. In 1886, he attended his first field plowing ceremony and began commenting on imperial state documents. By 1887, he began to rule under Cixi's supervision. The Guangxu Emperor married and took up the reins of power in 1889. By that year, the emperor was already 18, older than the conventional marriage age for emperors. Prior to his wedding, a large fire engulfed the Gate of Supreme Harmony at the Forbidden City. This event followed a trend of recent natural disasters that were considered alarming by many observers. According to traditional Chinese political theory, such incidents were taken as a warning of the imminent loss of the \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" by current rulers. For his empress, Empress Dowager Cixi chose the Guangxu Emperor's cousin Jingfen, who would become Empress Longyu. Besides her close relation to the emperor himself, she was also Cixi's niece. Cixi in addition selected two concubines for the Guangxu Emperor who were sisters, Consorts Jin and Zhen. The Guangxu Emperor eventually would prefer to spend more time with Consort Zhen, neglecting his Empress, much to Cixi's dismay. In 1894, Cixi degraded Consort Zhen, citing intervention in political affairs as the main reason. According to some reports, she even had her flogged.Kwong, pg. 60 Consort Jin had also been implicated in Consort Zhen's reported influence peddling and also apparently suffered a similar punishment. A cousin of theirs, Zhirui, was banished from the capital to a military outpost.Kwong, pg. 61 \\"Retirement\\" On March 5, 1889, Cixi retired from her second regency, but nonetheless served as the effective head of the imperial family.Kwong, pg. 29 Many officials felt and showed more loyalty to the empress dowager than they did to the emperor,Kwong, pg. 38 owing in part to her seniority and in part to her personalized cultivation of court favorites, many of whom would be given gifts of her artwork and invitations to join her at the theater for opera and acrobatics.Kwong, pg. 32 In spite of her residence for a period of time at the Summer Palace, which had been constructed with the official intention of providing her a suitable place to live after retiring from political affairs, Cixi continued to influence the decisions and actions of the Guangxu Emperor even after he began his formal rule at age 19. Along with an entourage of court officials, the Guangxu Emperor would pay visits to her every second or third day at which major political decisions would be made. Weng Tonghe observed that while the emperor dealt with day-to-day administration, the Grand Councilors would give their advice in more complex cases, and in the most complex cases of all, the advice of Cixi was sought.Kwong, pg. 26-27 In 1894, the First Sino-Japanese War broke out at the instigation of Japan which used the war as a pretext to annex Taiwan from Qing China. Of note, the Japanese annexation of Taiwan followed Japanese annexation of the RyuKyu island Kingdom in 1874 and was followed by Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. During this period, Cixi was continuously called upon to arbitrate policy-making, and the emperor was sometimes even bypassed in decision-making processes.Kwong, pg. 27 Cixi eventually was given copies of the secret palace memorials as well, a practice that was carried on until 1898, when it became unnecessary.Kwong, pg. 27-28 In November 1894, Cixi celebrated her 60th birthday. Borrowing from the plans used for the celebrations of the 70th and 80th birthdays of Empress Xiaoshengxian (the Qianlong Emperor's mother), plans included a triumphal progress along the decorated road between the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, decorations for the Beijing city gates and monumental archways, free theatrical performances, remission of punishments and the restoration of degraded officials.Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States (1893) Denby to Gresham, pg. 240-241; retrieved August 13th, 2013 http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/FRUS.FRUS189394v01 However, the war between China and Japan forced the empress dowager to cancel the lavish celebrations she had planned and settle for a much smaller commemoration that was held in the Forbidden City. Hundred Days' Reform Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor holding court, drawing by Katharine Carl After coming to the throne, the Guangxu Emperor became more reform-minded. After a humiliating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894, during which the Chinese Beiyang Fleet was virtually destroyed by the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Qing government faced unprecedented challenges internally and abroad, with its very existence at stake. Under the influence of reformist-officials Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the Guangxu Emperor believed that by learning from constitutional monarchies such as Japan and Germany, China would become politically and economically powerful. In June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor launched the Hundred Days' Reform aimed at sweeping political, legal and social changes and issued edicts for China's modernization. These abrupt reforms, however, came without building support either at court or in the bureaucracy. Cixi, concerned that they would diminish her power as an absolute monarch, stepped in to prevent them from going further. Some government and military officials warned Cixi that the ming-shi (reformation bureau) had been geared toward conspiracy. Allegations of treason against the emperor, as well as suspected Japanese influence within the reform movement, led Cixi to resume the role of regent and resume control at the court. The Manchu general Ronglu on 21 September 1898, took the Emperor to Ocean Terrace, a small palace on an island in the middle of Zhongnanhai linked to the rest of the Forbidden City only by a controlled causeway. Cixi followed this action with an edict that proclaimed the Guangxu Emperor's total disgrace and unfitness to be emperor. The Guangxu Emperor's reign effectively came to an end. According to research by Professor Lei Chia-sheng (Èõ∑ÂÆ∂ËÅñ),Lei Chia-shengÈõ∑ÂÆ∂ËÅñ, Liwan kuanglan: Wuxu zhengbian xintan ÂäõÊåΩÁãÇÁÄæÔºöÊàäÊàåÊîøËÆäÊñ∞Êé¢ [Containing the furious waves: a new view of the 1898 coup], Taipei: Wanjuan lou Ëê¨Âç∑Ê®ì, 2004. during the Hundred Days' Reform, former Japanese Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi arrived in China on 11 September 1898. Almost at the same time, British missionary Timothy Richard was invited to Beijing by the reformist Kang Youwei. Richard suggested that China should hand over some political power to It≈ç in order to help push the reforms further.Timothy Richard, Forty-five years in China, Ch. 12. On 18 September, Richard convinced Kang to adopt a plan by which China would join a federation composed of China, Japan, the United States, and England. This suggestion did not reflect the policies of the countries concerned. It was Richard's (and perhaps It≈ç's) trick to convince China to hand over national rights. Kang nonetheless asked fellow reformers Yang Shenxiu (Ê•äÊ∑±ÁßÄ) and Song Bolu (ÂÆã‰ºØÈ≠Ø) to report this plan to the Guangxu Emperor.Kang Youwei Â∫∑ÊúâÁÇ∫, Kang Nanhai ziding nianpu Â∫∑ÂçóÊµ∑Ëá™Ë®ÇÂπ¥Ë≠ú [Chronicle of Kang Youwei's Life, by Kang Youwei], Taipei: Wenhai chubanshe ÊñáÊµ∑Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, p. 67.

British diplomat Frederick Bourne claimed in his own report that Kang was a dreamer who had been seduced by Timothy Richard's sweet words. Bourne thought Richard was a plotter.British Foreign Office files (F.O.) 17/1718, 26 September 1898. The British and U.S. governments were unaware of the \\"federation\\" plot, which seems to have been Richard's personal idea. Because Richard's partner It≈ç Hirobumi had been Prime Minister of Japan, the Japanese government might have known about Richard's plan, but there is no evidence to this effect. A crisis over the issue of abdication emerged. Bowing to increasing pressure from the West and general civil discontent, Cixi did not forcibly remove the Guangxu Emperor from the throne, although she attempted to have Pujun, a boy of 14 who was from a close branch of the imperial family, installed as crown prince. The Guangxu era nominally continued until his death in 1908, but the emperor lost all respect, power, and privileges, including his freedom of movement. Most of his supporters, including his political mentor Kang Youwei, fled into exile, and the six prominent reformers including Tan Sitong and Kang's younger brother, were publicly beheaded. Kang continued to work for a constitutional monarchy while in exile, remaining loyal to the Guangxu Emperor and hoping eventually to restore him to power. His efforts would prove to be in vain. Boxer Rebellion Empress Dowager Cixi and women of the American legation. Holding her hand is Sarah Conger, the wife of U.S. Ambassador Edwin H. Conger. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in northern China. To preserve her own power and the dynasty, Cixi threw her support to these anti-foreign bands by making an official announcement of her support for the movement and a formal declaration of war on the Western powers. The general Ronglu deliberately sabotaged the performance of the imperial army during the rebellion. Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops (the \\"Kansu Braves\\") were able and eager to destroy the foreign military forces in the legations, but Ronglu stopped them from doing so. The Manchu prince Zaiyi was xenophobic and friendly with Dong Fuxiang. Zaiyi wanted artillery for Dong's troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from destroying the legations. When artillery was finally supplied to the imperial army and Boxers, it was only done so in limited amounts; Ronglu deliberately held back the rest of them. The Chinese forces defeated the small 2,000 man Western relief force at the Battle of Langfang, but lost several decisive battles, including the Battle of Beicang, and the entire imperial court was forced to retreat as the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing. Due to the fact that moderates at the Qing imperial court tried to appease the foreigners by moving the Muslim Kansu Braves out of their way, the allied army was able to march into Beijing and seize the capital. During the war, Cixi displayed concern about China's situation and foreign aggression, saying, \\"Perhaps their magic is not to be relied upon; but can we not rely on the hearts and minds of the people? Today China is extremely weak. We have only the people's hearts and minds to depend upon. If we cast them aside and lose the people's hearts, what can we use to sustain the country?\\" The Chinese people were almost unanimous in their support for the Boxers due to the Western Allied invasion. When Cixi received an ultimatum demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, she defiantly stated before the Grand Council, \\"Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?\\" It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the Beijing Field Force, which began the siege. Cixi stated that \\"I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily in 1860. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come\\", and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided \\"great benefits\\" to China. During the Battle of Beijing, the entire imperial court, including Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor, fled Beijing and evacuated to Xi'an as the allied forces invaded the city. After the fall of Beijing, the Eight-Nation Alliance negotiated a treaty with the Qing government, sending messengers to the empress dowager in Xi'an. Included in the terms of the agreement was a guarantee that China would not have to give up any further territories to foreign powers. Many of Cixi's advisers in the imperial court insisted that the war against the foreigners be continued. They recommended that Dong Fuxiang be given responsibility to continue the war effort. Cixi, however, had no intentions of relinquishing power, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce and stop the war, at least after she was assured of her continued reign when the war was concluded. The Western powers needed a government strong enough to suppress further anti- foreign movements, but too weak to act on its own; they supported the continuation of the Qing dynasty, rather than allowing it to be overthrown. Cixi turned once more to Li Hongzhang to negotiate. Li agreed to sign the Boxer Protocol, which stipulated the presence of an international military force in Beijing and the payment of ¬£67 million (almost $333 million) in war reparations. The United States used its share of the war indemnity to fund the creation of China's prestigious Tsinghua University. The Guangxu Emperor and Cixi did not return to Beijing from Xi'an until roughly 18 months after their flight.Jaques Gernet, A History of Chinese Civilization (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, second edition 1982): 604. Return to Beijing and reforms Empress Dowager Cixi, by Katharine Carl, 1904, commissioned by the Empress Dowager Cixi for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis World's Fair) and later given to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, transferred to the Smithsonian Museum of American Art collections and later the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. In January 1902, Cixi, the Guangxu Emperor, the empress and the rest of the court made a ceremonious return to Beijing. At the railhead at Chengtingfu, Cixi and the court boarded a 21-car train to convey them the rest of the way to the capital. In Beijing, many of the legation women turned out to watch the procession from the Beijing railway station to the Forbidden City, and for the first time, commoners were permitted to watch as well. Once back in the palace, Cixi implemented sweeping political reforms. High officials were dispatched to Japan and Europe to gather facts and draw up plans for sweeping administrative reforms in law, education, government structure, and social policy, many of which were modeled on the reforms of the Meiji Restoration. The abolition of the examination system in 1905 was only the most visible of these sweeping reforms. Ironically, Cixi sponsored the implementation of the New Policies, a reform program some view as more radical than the one proposed by the reformers she had beheaded in 1898.Douglas Reynolds, China, 1898‚Äì1912: The Xinzheng Revolution and Japan (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993). passim. In an attempt to woo foreigners, Cixi also invited the wives of the diplomatic corps to a tea in the Forbidden City soon after her return, and in time, would hold summer garden parties for the foreign community at the Summer Palace. In 1903, she acquiesced to the request of Sarah Conger, wife of Edwin H. Conger, the U.S. Ambassador to China, to have her portrait painted by American artist Katharine Carl for the St. Louis World's Fair. Between 1903 and 1905, Cixi had a Western-educated lady-in-waiting by the name of Yu Deling, along with her sister and mother, serve at her court. Yu Deling, fluent in English and French, as well as Chinese, often served as translator at meetings with the wives of the diplomatic corps. In 1903, Cixi allowed a young aristocratic photographer named Xunling, a brother of Yu Deling, to take elaborately staged shots of her and her court. They were designed to convey imperial authority, aesthetic refinement, and religious piety. As the only photographic series taken of Cixi ‚Äì the supreme leader of China for more than 45 years ‚Äì it represents a unique convergence of Qing court pictorial traditions, modern photographic techniques, and Western standards of artistic portraiture. The rare glass plates have been blown up into full-size images, included in the exhibition \\"The Empress Dowager\\" at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. =Xuantong era= Entrance to the burial chamber in Cixi's tomb Empress Dowager Cixi died in the Hall of Graceful Bird at the Middle Sea () of Zhongnanhai, Beijing, on 15 November 1908, after having installed Puyi as the new emperor on 14 November 1908. Her death came only a day after the death of the Guangxu Emperor. Radicals greeted the news with scorn. The anarchist Wu Zhihui, who had leveled some of the most vitriol at Cixi in life, wrote from exile in Paris of the \\"vixen empress and vermin emperor\\" that \\"their lingering stench makes me vomit.\\"Christopher Rea, The Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China (Oakland, CA: University of California Press, 2015), p. 99. On 4 November 2008, forensic tests concluded that the Guangxu Emperor died from acute arsenic poisoning. China Daily quoted an historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi may have known of her imminent death and may have worried that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death. It was reported in November 2008 that the level of arsenic in his remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people. Memorial tower of the tomb of Empress Dowager Cixi Empress Dowager Cixi was interred in the Eastern Qing tombs, east of Beijing, in the Eastern Ding Mausoleum (), along with Empress Dowager Ci'an. Empress Dowager Ci'an lies in the Puxiangyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (; lit. \\"Tomb East of the Ding Mausoleum in the Broad Valley of Good Omen\\"), while Empress Dowager Cixi built herself the much larger Putuoyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (; lit. \\"Tomb East of the Ding Mausoleum in the Putuo Valley\\"). The Ding Mausoleum (lit. \\"Tomb of Quietude\\"), where the Xianfeng Emperor is buried, is located west of the Dingdongling. The Putuo Valley owes its name to Mount Putuo, one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China. Empress Dowager Cixi, unsatisfied with her tomb, ordered its destruction and reconstruction in 1895. The new tomb was a complex of temples, gates, and pavilions, covered with gold leaf, and with gold and gilded-bronze ornaments hanging from the beams and the eaves. In July 1928, Cixi's tomb was plundered by the warlord Sun Dianying and his army as part of the looting of the Eastern Mausoleum. They methodically stripped the complex of its precious ornaments, then dynamited the entrance to the burial chamber, opened Cixi's coffin, threw her corpse (said to have been found intact) on the ground, and stole the jewels contained in the coffin. They also took the massive pearl that had been placed in the empress dowager's mouth to protect her corpse from decomposing (in accordance with Chinese tradition). After 1949, the complex of Empress Dowager Cixi's tomb was restored by the Chinese government. Appraisal Photograph of Cixi The mainstream view of Empress Dowager Cixi as a devious despot who contributed in no small part to China's slide into corruption, anarchy, and revolution is subject to nuance. Cixi used her power to accumulate vast quantities of money, bullion, antiques and jewelry, using the revenues of the state as her own.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 51 The long-time China journalist Jasper Becker recalled that \\"every visitor to the Summer Palace is shown the beautiful lakeside pavilion in the shape of an elegant marble pleasure boat and told how Cixi spent funds destined for the imperial navy on such extravagant fripperies‚Äîwhich ultimately led to Japan's victory over China in 1895 and the loss of Taiwan\\".Jasper Becker, \\"The Empress Dowager was a Moderniser, Not a Minx. But Does China Care?, The Spectator, October 12, 2013 Yet even after the violent anti-foreign Boxer movement and equally violent foreign reprisal, the initial foreign accounts of Cixi emphasized her warmth and friendliness. Katharine Carl oil portrait painted for exhibit at St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 This was perhaps because Cixi took the initiative and invited several women to spend time with her in the Forbidden City. Katharine Carl, an American painter, was called to China in 1903 to paint Cixi's portrait for the St. Louis Exposition. In her With the Empress Dowager. Carl portrays Cixi as a kind and considerate woman for her station. Cixi, though shrewd, had great presence, charm, and graceful movements resulting in \\"an unusually attractive personality\\". Carl wrote of the empress dowager's love of dogs and of flowers, as well as boating, Chinese opera and her Chinese water pipes and European cigarettes. Cixi also commissioned the well-known portraitist, Hubert Vos to produce a series of oil portraits. The publication of China Under The Empress Dowager (1910) by J. O. P. Bland and Edmund Backhouse contributed to Cixi's reputation with the inclusion of some gossip, much of which came from palace eunuchs. Their portrait included contradictory elements, writes one recent study, \\"on the one hand... imperious, manipulative, and lascivious\\" and on the other \\"ingenuous, politically shrewd, and conscientious...\\" Backhouse and Bland told their readers that \\"to summarize her essence simply, she a woman and an Oriental\\". Backhouse was later found to have forged some of the source materials used in this work.H. R. Trevor-Roper, Hermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse (New York: Knopf, 1977) The vivid writing and lascivious details of their account provided material for many of the books over the following decades, including Chinese fiction and histories that drew on a 1914 translation. In the People's Republic after 1949, the image of the Manchu Empress was contentious. She was sometimes praised for her anti-imperialist role in the Boxer Uprising yet was reviled as a member of the \\"feudalist regime\\". When Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing was arrested in 1976 for abuse of power, an exhibit at the Palace Museum put Cixi's luxurious goods on display to tru to frame Jiang as a continuation of Cixi. By the mid-1970s, views among some scholars changed in her favor. Sue Fawn Chung's doctoral dissertation at University of California, Berkeley was the first study in English to use court documents rather than popular histories and hearsay. Her seminal 1979 article titled \\"The Much Maligned Empress Dowager\\" opened with the sentence \\"Clio, the Muse of History, has not been kind\\" to Cixi. Traditional historians in China, Chung claimed, \\"always have been prejudiced against feminine influence in court\\", and historians have long taken the word of Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and other Chinese, who opposed the Empress Dowager. Luke Kwong, in his analysis of the Hundred Days' Reform, claimed that many of the allegations of Empress Dowager Cixi being power-hungry and immoral could not be verified, instead portraying her as a relatively insecure woman, concerned about her legitimacy and haunted by her relatively humble origins in the palace.Kwong pg. 31-32 Chinese historians have traditionally held a negative prejudice of female members of court. The Empress Dowager was also a more conservative leader, which was not common for a female leader of those times. She went on to claim that this resulted in Empress Dowager Cixi being portrayed in a one- sided, negative and narrow view where she was called names such as ‚Äúshe dragon‚Äù or the ‚Äúusurper of a throne‚Äù and viewed as either a tyrant or incompetent. Despite this, writers such as Jung Chang have criticized this narrative and have written works such as Chang's Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China in order to offer an opposing view. In recent decades, claims Pamela Kyle Crossley, a historian of the dynasty, some historians in the West have developed \\"truisms\\" in the representation of Cixi: \\"that she has been obscured by misogyny and orientalist stereotyping, as well as the anti-Manchu sentiment running through Chinese nationalist narratives\\". Crossley felt that Cixi appealed to feminists as a powerful leader and to Chinese patriots as a defender of China, claiming that in the 1960s and 1970s, Cixi was one of \\"a small collection of 'powerful' women newly discovered\\" and now \\"she appears in the vanguard of stubborn Chinese opposition to foreign arrogance and encroachment\\". Several popular, Western-authored biographies have since appeared. Sterling Seagrave's Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China claims Cixi was a woman stuck between the xenophobic faction of Manchu nobility and more moderate influences. The empress dowager, Seagrave claims, did not crave power but simply acted to balance these influences and protect the Qing dynasty as best she could. In 2013, Jung Chang's biography, Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China, claims Cixi was the most capable ruler and administrator that China could have had at the time. However, Pamela Kyle Crossley criticized Chang's claims, writing in the London Review of Books that Chang's claims \\"seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what we know was actually going in China\\". Although Crossley was sympathetic to restoring women's place in Chinese history, she found \\"rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense\\".

It provides the upper tier of local government, below which are district councils, and town and parish councils. The county council has 78 elected councillors, and is based in the county town of Winchester. Whilst they are part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire, Southampton and Portsmouth are unitary authorities, and therefore are not part of Hampshire County Council, with powers instead held by their respective councils. Hampshire County Council has been controlled by the Conservative Party since 1997.  History  The county council was formed in 1889, governing the administrative county of Hampshire. Alongside Christchurch, in 1974 Bournemouth was split into Dorset, as well as a number of minor border changes. Whilst they are now part of a unitary authority alongside Poole, they remain in the ceremonial county of Dorset. In the same reorganisation, the various boroughs, urban districts and rural districts in Hampshire were reorganised into thirteen districts for the purposes of local government, forming the lower tier below the county council. In 1997 Southampton and Portsmouth were split off into respective unitary authorities under the 1992 Local Government Act, and are therefore no longer part of Hampshire County Council and hold their own elections for their own councils, although they remain part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire. Since then there have been several attempts made at a form of devolution deal for Hampshire (and sometimes the Isle of Wight, historically part of Hampshire) as a whole, but have no so far been successful. From 1973 Hampshire County Council has either been under no overall control or Conservative control, with the council currently having been under Conservative control since 1997. Generally the Liberal Democrats have been the largest opposition, with the Labour Party, UKIP, and Community Campaign (Hart) also having representation alongside independents. The most recent election in 2017 saw the Conservatives increase their majority, taking 56 of 78 seats. The next elections are due to take place in 2021, alongside the delayed district elections. Responsibilities The council is responsible for public services such as: *Highway management *Waste disposal *Children's services (including supporting schools, families and young people) *Social care *Libraries *Discovery Centres *Country parks *Public Health, Local government Districts of Hampshire. Southampton (8) and Portsmouth (12) in yellow are unitary authorities Hampshire is divided into thirteen districts, with eleven of them lying within Hampshire County Council.

The incumbent Conservatives (majority since 1997) increased their majority from 45 to 56, over a two thirds majority, whilst the Liberal Democrats, the second largest party, won two new seats, increasing their seats to 19.The Liberal Democrats performed best around Winchester, and Eastleigh, whilst the Conservatives performed well across rural areas. Labour and UKIP meanwhile both lost seats, with Labour losing two of their four seats in Basingstoke, whilst UKIP lost all representation across the County. Community Campaign (Hart) managed to retain their only seat, Church Crookham & Ewshot, while also standing in a second county seat for the first time in Fleet Town, where they came second place after the Conservatives, who won with a majority of 508. The Green Party also increased their vote share, but failed to gain representation. The sole independent incumbent, in Lymington, lost their seat.

Winston Graham was the author's pseudonym until he changed his name by deed poll from Grime to Graham on 7 May 1947. Biography Graham was born in Victoria Park, Manchester, on 30 June 1908. As a child, Winston contracted pneumonia, and on medical advice was educated at a local day school rather than Manchester Grammar School which his father had in mind for him. Graham's father, Albert Grime, was a prosperous tea importer and grocer, but became incapacitated by a stroke. When he was 17 years old, Winston moved to Perranporth, Cornwall, where he lived for 34 years. He had wanted to be a writer from an early age and, following the death of his father, he was supported by his mother while he wrote novels at home in longhand and attempted to get them published. In September 1939, Graham married Jean Williamson, having first met her in 1926 when she was 13 years old. She often helped Graham with ideas for his books, and the character of Demelza, in his Poldark series, was based in part on her. Graham's daughter said, ‚ÄúFather was the author but my mother helped with the details because she was very observant. She saw everything and remembered it all.\\" Jean died in 1992. During his youth, Graham was a keen tennis player and recorded in his diaries how many sets he played each day. He lived in Perranporth from October 1925 until January 1960, then briefly, during the summer of 1960, in the south of France before finally settling in East Sussex. He was a member of the Society of Authors from 1945, chairman of the Society's Management Committee from 1967 to 1969 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1983, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Graham died on 10 July 2003 at the age of 95, at his house, Abbotswood, East Sussex. His autobiography, Memoirs of a Private Man, was published in September of that year. Remembrances and legacy The Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro, Cornwall had an exhibition devoted to his life and works (Poldark's Cornwall: The Life and Times of Winston Graham) from mid-June to mid-September 2008 to celebrate the centenary of his birth, coinciding with re-publication of the Poldark novels by Pan Macmillan. Additionally, the Winston Graham Historical Prize was initiated as part of the Centenary Celebrations, funded by a legacy from the author and supported by Pan Macmillan. It is awarded for a work of unpublished fiction, preferably with an association with Cornwall. Details can be obtained from the Royal Cornwall Museum. The majority of Winston Graham's manuscripts and papers have been donated to the Royal Institution of Cornwall by his son Andrew Graham and daughter Rosamund Barteau. Further papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University and elsewhere. Literary career First Edition UK cover of Graham's 1961 novel Marnie Graham's first novel The House with the Stained Glass Windows was published in 1934. His first Poldark novel, Ross Poldark, was published in 1945 and was succeeded by 11 further titles, the last of which, Bella Poldark, was published in 2002. The series was set in Cornwall, especially in and near Perranporth where Graham lived for more than three decades (1925‚Äì1960). In the 1941 spy thriller Night Journey, set mostly in Mussolini's Italy, the protagonist feels that Britain was likely to lose the war but is determined to go on fighting against all the odds - which was likely Graham's own feeling at the time. Graham was also an accomplished author of suspense novels and, during the course of his life, wrote 30 novels (in addition to the 12 Poldark books) as well as a volume of short stories (The Japanese Girl, 1971) and three non-fiction works. Other than the Poldark novels, Graham's most successful works were Marnie, a suspense thriller published in 1961 and The Walking Stick, published in 1967. In 1955, Graham's novel The Little Walls won the Crime Writers' Association's first Crime Novel of the Year Award (then called The Crossed Red Herrings Award, later The Gold Dagger). In 1972 Graham published \\"The Spanish Armadas\\", a factual account of the sixteenth-century Anglo-Spanish conflict. (The plural \\"Armadas\\" refers to a lesser-known second attempt by Philip II of Spain to conquer England in 1598, which Graham argued was better planned and organised than the famous one of 1588, but was foiled by a fierce storm scattering the Spanish ships and sinking many of them.) The same is also the subject of a historical novel, The Grove of Eagles, set in Elizabethan Cornwall and also depicting the foundation and growth of Falmouth. Graham wrote at least four plays, three of which - Seven Suspected, Values and Shadow Play (renamed Circumstantial Evidence) - were produced, with the latter professionally produced at Salisbury in 1978 and at Guildford, Richmond and Brighton in 1979. According to Graham, it \\"missed London by a hair\\". Seven Suspected was first performed in Perranporth on 30 May 1933 with both the author and his wife-to- be Jean in the cast. Values was a one-act play performed by seven members of Perranporth Women's Institute at a Truro drama festival in 1936. Graham's books have been translated into 29 languages. His autobiography Memoirs of a Private Man was published by Macmillan in September 2003, two months after his death. Television and film adaptations of works The first seven Poldark novels were adapted as a BBC television series broadcast in the UK between 1975 and 1977, which garnered audiences of about 14 million viewers. The series was so successful that some vicars rescheduled or cancelled church services rather than have them clash with the broadcast of Poldark episodes. Graham disliked early episodes of Poldark so much (because of the portrayal of Demelza as promiscuous and 'loose') that he tried to have the series cancelled, but could do nothing about it. The Poldark novels have been adapted for television on two other occasions. Graham's novel Marnie (1961), a thriller, was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1964, with Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery in the lead roles. Marnie (1961) was also adapted as a play by Sean O'Connor in 2001 and an opera written by Nico Muhly which premiered in November, 2017. Both the play and the opera retained the novel's British setting and bleak ending. Five of Graham's other books have been filmed: * Take My Life (1947 film co-scripted by Graham and subsequently novelised) *Night Without Stars (1951 film, scripted by Graham, based on the 1950 novel), *Fortune Is a Woman (1957 film released in the United States as She Played With Fire; based on the 1952 book Fortune Is a Woman), *S√≥cio de Alcova (1962 Brazil) / Carnival of Crime (1964 US), based on the book The Sleeping Partner (1956). * The Walking Stick (1970 film based on the 1967 novel).

He was a Member of the Order of Canada. Early life The son of Andrew Horwood and Vina Maidment, Horwood was born in St. John's, Newfoundland. He experienced a love of literature from a young age and while still an adolescent had already decided on a literary career. He pursued this goal despite the objections of his parents, with whom he did not get along, drawing more inspiration from the life of his paternal grandfather, John Horwood, a sea captain. He was educated at Prince of Wales Collegiate and worked at various labouring jobs for a number of years, which eventually led him to become a labour organizer. Around the same time, he and his brother Charlie founded a literary magazine called Protocol. Beginning in 1948 he worked closely with Joey Smallwood in the campaign to bring Newfoundland into Confederation. From 1949 to 1951, he was a member of the Newfoundland House of Assembly, sitting as the member for Labrador for Smallwood's Liberals. After leaving politics he started writing a political column for the Evening Telegram newspaper. Though he supported Smallwood at first, by the mid-1950s he had become one of the premier's harshest critics. Writing career His first book, Tomorrow Will be Sunday, was published in 1966. Though it was a novel, Horwood acknowledged its autobiographical elements. The novel White Eskimo (1972), arguably his best- known work, was inspired in part by Wilfred Grenfell. All told, he wrote more than 20 books, including novels, history, natural history, biography, and autobiography. His contribution to Newfoundland literature does not consist only of the works he produced, but also in the example he provided to young writers at a time when little literature had been produced in the province. However, as his political writing and some of his literature indicates, he did not always hold Newfoundland culture, particularly that of the 'outports' or fishing villages, in high regard. Other activities During the 1960s he became an opponent of industrialization and began to interest himself in various 'counter-cultural' concerns. For a year he ran an alternative school in St. John's, known as \\"Animal Farm\\". Among Horwood's other accomplishments were being a founding member and head of the Writers' Union of Canada, and holding the position of writer-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario and University of Waterloo. Later life In 1980, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for his \\"contributions to Canadian literature\\". He lived his last twenty-five years in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. He and his wife Cornelia (Corky), whom he married in 1972, had two children, Andrew and Leah. He died of cancer at the age of 82 in Halifax.

He served as Mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ambassador to Germany and United States Assistant Secretary of State. Biography Uhl was born in the township of Rush, New York, the son of David M. and Catherine (De Garmo) Uhl. The family moved to a farm near Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1844. Uhl graduated from the University of Michigan in 1862 and received an M.A. degree from the same institution in 1863.

The story is used to teach children the value of optimism and hard work. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". A 1949 recording of the story was inducted to the National Recording Registry in 2009. Background The story's signature phrases such as \\"I think I can\\" first occurred in print in a 1902 article in a Swedish journal. An early published version of the story, \\"Story of the Engine That Thought It Could\\", appeared in the New-York Tribune on April 8, 1906, as part of a sermon by the Rev. Charles S. Wing. A brief version of the tale appeared under the title Thinking One Can in 1906, in Wellspring for Young People, a Sunday school publication. This version reappeared in a 1910 book, Foundation Stones of Success. Another version was published under the name \\"The Pony Engine\\" in the Kindergarten Review in 1910, written by Mary C. Jacobs. A different version with the same title appeared in a magazine for children in 1916 under the name of Mabel C. Bragg, a teacher, but she \\"took no credit for originating the story\\". The story first appeared in print with the title The Little Engine That Could in 1920, collected in Volume I of My Book House, which is a set of books sold in the U.S. by door- to-door salespersons. The Book House version began, \\"Once there was a Train- of-Cars; she was flying across the country with a load of Christmas toys for the children who lived on the other side of the mountain.\\" The story was labeled The Little Engine The Original Tale from 1920 By Olive Beaupre Miller, John Kurtz-Simon and Shcuster \\"As told by Olive Beaupr√© Miller\\"; the first edition gave credit to Bragg, but subsequent editions did not as Miller subsequently concluded that \\"the story belonged to the realm of folk literature\\". Miller was the founding editor and publisher of The Book House for Children, a company based in Chicago. The best known incarnation of the story The Little Engine That Could was written by \\"Watty Piper\\", a pen name of Arnold Munk, who was the owner of the publishing firm Platt & Munk. Arnold Munk (1888-1957) was born in Hungary, and as a child, moved with his family to the United States, settling in Chicago. Later he moved to New York. Platt & Munk's offices were at 200 Fifth Avenue until 1957 when Arnold Munk died. Arnold Munk used the name Watty Piper as both an author of children's books and as the editor of many of the books that Platt & Munk published. He personally hired Lois Lenski to illustrate the book. This retelling of the tale The Pony Engine appeared in 1930, with a title page that stated: \\"Retold by Watty Piper from The Pony Engine by Mabel C. Bragg's copyrighted by George H. Doran and Co.\\" In 1954, Platt & Munk published another version of The Little Engine That Could, with slightly revised language and new, more colorful illustrations by George and Doris Hauman.Cullinan, Bernice E., and Diane Goetz Person. The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature. Continuum International Publishing Group, August 1, 2003. Pg. 634 Although there had been many previous editions of this classic story, \\"It was the work of George and Doris Hauman that earned The Little Engine the title of being worthy to sit on the same shelf as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\" A 1976 rework featured art by Ruth Sanderson received a lot of attention at the time of its release, in part because the art reflected \\"the stereotypes of masculine strength and feminine weakness in vogue when it was written\\". Plot In the tale, a long train must be pulled over a high mountain after its engine breaks down. Larger engines, treated anthropomorphically, are asked to pull the train; for various reasons they refuse. The request is sent to a small engine, who agrees to try. The engine succeeds in pulling the train over the mountain while repeating its motto: \\"I-think-I-can\\". The story of the little engine has been told and retold many times. The underlying theme is the same ‚Äî a stranded train is unable to find an engine willing to take it on over difficult terrain to its destination. Only the little blue engine is willing to try and, while repeating the mantra \\"I think I can, I think I can\\", overcomes a seemingly impossible task. An early version goes as follows: > A little railroad engine was employed about a station yard for such work as > it was built for, pulling a few cars on and off the switches. One morning it > was waiting for the next call when a long train of freight-cars asked a > large engine in the roundhouse to take it over the hill. \\"I can't; that is > too much a pull for me\\", said the great engine built for hard work. Then the > train asked another engine, and another, only to hear excuses and be > refused. In desperation, the train asked the little switch engine to draw it > up the grade and down on the other side. \\"I think I can\\", puffed the little > locomotive, and put itself in front of the great heavy train. As it went on > the little engine kept bravely puffing faster and faster, \\"I think I can, I > think I can, I think I can.\\" > > As it neared the top of the grade, which had so discouraged the larger > engines, it went more slowly. However, it still kept saying, \\"I‚Äîthink‚ÄîI‚Äîcan, > I‚Äîthink‚ÄîI‚Äîcan.\\" It reached the top by drawing on bravery and then went on > down the grade, congratulating itself by saying, \\"I thought I could, I > thought I could.\\" A Disney version of the story was published in 1976: The story begins with a toy-filled train pulled by a small red engine on its way to a town on the other side of a mountain but the engine shortly breaks down upon reaching the mountain. The toy clown flags down other engines to help them: a shiny yellow passenger engine, a big black freight engine, and a rusty old engine. The shiny passenger engine and big freight engine both refuse to help them and the rusty old engine is too tired and must rest. Finally, a little blue engine arrives. Although she is simply a switcher engine and has never been over the mountain, she agrees to help pull the train. In the end, she was able to successfully reach the top of the mountain before slowly heading down towards the town. Versions Later versions would revamp the story to have a more specific appeal for children ‚Äì the stranded train is recast as a train of good food and anthropomorphic toys for the children across the mountain, thus in saving the train the little engine seems to be working for the benefit of the child reader, making the successful deed all the more triumphant. In these versions another character appeared and remained a key part of the story hereafter ‚Äì the clown ringleader of the toys who attempts to find help with several locomotives but is rebuffed. The number of engines in the story also eventually became standard across the tellings: The happy locomotive on the toy train who breaks down and cannot go on, the pompous passenger engine who considers himself too grand for the task, the powerful freight engine who views himself as too important, and the elderly engine who lacks either the strength or determination to help the toys. The little blue engine always appears last and, although perhaps reluctant (some editions have the engine clarify her role as a switcher not suited for excursions), always rises to the occasion and saves the day for the children over the mountain. Each engine is defined by its appearance or function and is not given a name or personality beyond its role on the railroad. It is only in the 1991 film adaption that the engines' personalities are expanded on, including the granting of names: Farnsworth (the express engine), Pete (the freight engine), Georgia (the friendly engine of the toy train), Jebediah (the elderly engine) and Tillie, the titular \\"little engine that could\\". The clown was also named \\"Rollo\\" and a sixth engine character, Doc, appeared briefly to recover the broken-down Georgia and thus tie up the hanging story-thread of what happened to the failed engine of the toy train, which all other versions leave unaddressed. Films The tale with its easy-to-grasp moral has become a classic children's story and was adapted in January 1991 as a 30-minute animated film produced in Wales and co-financed in Wales and the United States. The film named the famous little engine Tillie and expanded the narrative into a larger story of self-discovery. In March 2011, the story was adapted as a 3-D film named The Little Engine That Could, produced by Universal Studios and featuring the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Jamie Lee Curtis, Alyson Stoner, and Corbin Bleu.The Little Engine That Could (2011)- Behind the Voice Actors  \\"Little Engine\\" toys and Rail Tours  A full-size replica of the Little Engine That Could made an annual circuit around the United States. Arranged through Rail Events, Inc., a number of tourist and museum railroad operations hosted the \\"I Think I Can\\" Rail Tour. The replica was constructed in 2005 by the Strasburg Rail Road in southeast Pennsylvania who also constructed the Thomas The Tank Engine replicas that tour the United States. The last tour was in 2008. In 2009, the replica only appeared at the Texas State Railroad. In 2011, the website for the tour said that there would be dates announced for 2011, but dates were never posted and the message was still present in 2012 until it went offline. The last time the train ever operated was on September 16, 2012 As of 2015, the replica is owned by the Great Smokey Mountains Railroad, and has since been repainted and currently displayed at the depot. Reasons for why the tour stopped are unknown. American toy company Whittle Shortline produces wooden toy trains of The Little Engine That Could as a domestic alternative to Thomas the Tank Engine.

Hudson River, 2. East River, 3. Long Island Sound, 4. Newark Bay, 5. Upper New York Bay, 6. Lower New York Bay, 7. Jamaica Bay, 8. Atlantic Ocean Jamaica Bay is an estuary on the southern portion of the western tip of Long Island, in the U.S. state of New York. The estuary is partially man-made, and partially natural. The bay connects with Lower New York Bay to the west, through Rockaway Inlet, and is the westernmost of the coastal lagoons on the south shore of Long Island. Politically, it is primarily divided between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, with a small part touching Nassau County. The bay contains numerous marshy islands. It was known as Grassy Bay as late as the 1940s. Jamaica Bay is located adjacent to the confluence of the New York Bight and New York Bay, and is at the turning point of the primarily east-west oriented coastline of southern New England and Long Island and the north-south oriented coastline of the mid-Atlantic coast. Etymology The name derives from the nearby town of Jamaica, which in turn derives from Yameco, a corruption of a word for \\"beaver\\" in the Lenape language spoken by the Native Americans who lived in the area at the time of first European contact. The liquid \\"y\\" sound of English is spelled with a \\"j\\" in Dutch, the language of the first people to write about the area; the English conquerors retained this Dutch spelling, but, after repeated reading and speaking of \\"Jamaica\\", slowly replaced the liquid sound with the hard \\"j\\" of the English pronunciation of the name today.Major Mark Park, accessed December 16, 2006 (In the Caribbean, the aboriginal Arawaks named their island Xaymaca, \\"land of wood and water\\", and the \\"x\\" spelling in Spanish was in time transformed to the hard \\"j\\" of the modern English name, \\"Jamaica\\".)  Ecology  The location of Jamaica Bay combined with the rich food resources found there make it a regionally important fish, wildlife, and plant habitat complex. This geographic location acts to concentrate marine and estuarine species migrating between the New York Bight portion of the North Atlantic, and the Hudson River and Raritan River estuary. Shorebirds, raptors, waterfowl, land birds, and various migratory insects are concentrated by the coastlines in both directions. These migratory species are further concentrated by the surrounding urban development into the remaining open space and open water of Jamaica Bay. Jamaica Bay and nearby Breezy Point support seasonal or year-round populations of over 330 species of special emphasis and listed species, incorporating 48 species of fish and 120 species of birds. Geography Jamaica Bay from the northwest (2013) Jamaica Bay is a saline to brackish, eutrophic (nutrient-rich) estuary covering about , with a mean depth of , a semidiurnal tidal range averaging , and a residence time of about three weeks. The bay communicates with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean via Rockaway Inlet, a high current area that is wide at its narrowest point, with an average depth of . Measurements taken during recent surveys in Jamaica Bay indicate average yearly ranges for temperature of , salinity of 20.5 to 26 parts per thousand, dissolved oxygen of 3.5 to 18.5 milligrams/liter, and pH of 6.8 to 9. Loadings of nutrients and organic matter into the bay from sewage treatment plants and runoff result in phytoplankton blooms and high suspended-solid concentrations which, in turn, result in turbid water and low bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations. Jamaica Bay is in the southern portion of the New York metropolitan area, and the uplands around the bay, as well as much of the Rockaway barrier beach, are dominated by urban residential, commercial, and industrial development. The bay itself has been disturbed by dredging, filling, and development. About of the original of wetlands in the bay have been filled in, mostly around the perimeter of the bay. Extensive areas of the bay have been dredged for navigation channels and to provide fill for the airports and other construction projects. This includes John F. Kennedy International Airport (commonly known as JFK Airport) on the northeastern side of the bay, as well as the historic and now-defunct Floyd Bennett Field on the western side. The center of the bay is dominated by subtidal open water and extensive low-lying islands with areas of salt marsh, intertidal flats, and uplands important for colonial nesting waterbirds. The average mean low tide exposes of mudflat, of low salt marsh dominated by low marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), and of high marsh dominated by high marsh cordgrass (Spartina patens). The extensive intertidal areas are rich in food resources, including a variety of benthic invertebrates and macroalgae dominated by sea lettuce (Ulva latuca). These rich food resources attract a variety of fish, shorebirds, and waterfowl. In addition, two freshwater impoundments were created on Rulers Bar Hassock in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge; the smaller freshwater West Pond is kept as open water, and the larger slightly brackish East Pond is controlled to expose mudflats. Some of the islands in the bay have upland communities, including grasslands consisting of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempivirens); scrub-shrub containing bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica), beach plum (Prunus maritima), sumac (Rhus spp.), and poison ivy (Toxidendron radicans); developing woodland consisting of hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), willow (Salix spp.), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima); and beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) dune. Species introduced in the refuge to attract wildlife include autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii), and Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii). History =Historic seaport proposal= Plumb Beach, Brooklyn IND Rockaway Line subway train crossing Jamaica Bay, 1973. Photo by Arthur Tress. Some modifications to Jamaica Bay were conducted in the early 20th century as a result of a never- realized plan to develop Jamaica Bay as a seaport. As early as 1886, the U.S. Engineering Department (now Army Corps of Engineers) had created plans to dredge Rockaway Inlet in preparation for constructing a large seaport in Jamaica Bay. These plans were scrapped because there was not enough commercial traffic to justify the construction of the seaport. Over the next two decades, commercial activity in New York City increased. New proposals for the Jamaica Bay seaport emerged in the 1900s. By 1905, the value of the city's manufacturing sector was assessed at $1.5 billion, a figure cited by supporters of the Jamaica Bay project. In 1910, developers unveiled a plan to convert Jamaica Bay to a seaport district as part of the New York State Barge Canal project, which would connect Hudson River to the Great Lakes by way of a new canal in upstate New York. The new seaport would convert existing inland creeks into barge canals with lengths of up to , and the area of the bay was to be dredged. An aggregate of marshlands in the bay would be converted to land that could be built upon, while residential communities would be built on Long Island for port workers. Railroads would be built to collect cargo from these ports, and a canal would extend northward across Long Island to the Long Island Sound. The project began in 1911, despite doubts about the feasibility of the project. Some engineers believed that shifting sand dunes and the tides in Jamaica Bay might make it impossible to construct the seaport district. The next year, developers began dredging ports within Jamaica Bay in order to make it navigable for the large vessels that were supposed to use the bay. Significant progress on the dredging had been completed by 1918, and the city allowed the construction of several piers. However, only one pier was built near Barren Island. The pier, which was built in order to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast and was wide. A total of six such piers were planned for this area. In June 1918, a municipally owned pier was opened at Mill Basin. At the time, there were proposals to fill in between Mill and Barren Islands so 14 more piers could be built. With the United States' entry into World War I, the project was abandoned. The plans were revived by 1927. At the time, the docklands were expected to gain a connection to the Long Island Rail Road. Planners wanted to create a spur of the Bay Ridge Branch south to Flatlands, with two branches to Canarsie and Mill Basin. A connection to Staten Island would be built via the planned Staten Island Tunnel, which would in turn allow freight to be delivered and shipped to the rest of the continental United States. By 1928, the Barren Island Airport was being constructed on the bay's west shore, and advocates for the seaport project were pushing the city to construct the docklands simultaneously. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offered to build the new railroad link for $2 million and lease it to the city. In 1930, the city approved of a report recommending the acquisition of a right-of-way for a proposed LIRR branch to Paerdegat Basin. The railroad would connect to the New York Connecting Railroad, which would then connect to the national railroad system at large. Dredging Paerdegat Basin was a key part of the plan, as it would allow easier access for ships headed to Canarsie. As part of the updated proposal, two artificial islands for shipping operations would be built in Jamaica Bay. In January 1931, the New York City Board of Estimate approved a plan to build railroads on both sides of Paerdegat Basin, connecting the LIRR to Canarsie Pier to the east and to Floyd Bennett Field to the west. By that time, the city had spent $10 million, and the federal government $2 million, toward improving the bay for a proposed seaport district. Supporters of the new proposal included Mayor Jimmy Walker, President of Aldermen Fiorello La Guardia, City Comptroller Charles Berry, and Brooklyn's and Queens' borough presidents. New Jersey opposed the Jamaica Bay project, since it wanted to build the competing Port of Newark. There was enough federal money for both projects, though. However, Robert Moses, the New York City Parks Commissioner at the time, was critical of the seaport project. He instead proposed a series of parks and parkways around New York City, including Belt Parkway along the northern and western shores of Jamaica Bay. Under Moses's leadership, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation moved to convert much of the Jamaica Bay area into a city park. In 1949, the New York City Board of Estimate approved Moses's proposal, ending all plans for the seaport project. The only thing that was completed was the dredging of Paerdegat Basin to a depth. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the city-owned land around the basin was sold off to private developers. =Incidents= On March 1, 1962, American Airlines Flight 1 a Boeing 707, crashed on takeoff from JFK Airport after its rudder jammed. It crashed into Pumpkin Patch Channel, a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay that is part of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. All 95 people on board were killed, including 87 passengers and 8 crew members. (Navigate: Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934-1965)‚Üí 1962‚Üí American Airlines) Environmental conditions Jamaica Bay seen from Belt Parkway The salt marshes of Jamaica Bay offer prime habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Most of the waters and marshes have been protected since 1972 as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Though much improved, pollution is still a problem, and after once enjoying a worldwide reputation for oysters and supporting a vigorous fishing industry the area has been closed to shellfishing since the early 20th century as one result. The marshlands are also fast diminishing. As of Spring 2003, marshland is being lost at the rate of approximately per year. The reasons for this loss are still unclear, but one hypothesis is that the loss is the result of rising sea levels. To test this, in the hope of preventing further losses, the National Park Service plans to dredge a small area of the bay in order to build up the soil in about of marsh. Opponents are concerned that the dredging may be harmful, perhaps leading to greater loss of marshland than the area saved. Other scientists suggest that the of nitrogen pouring into the bay every day, 92 percent from four sewage treatment plants ringing the bay, may be partly to blame. They hypothesize that the high levels of nitrogen may stimulate the growth of sea lettuce, smothering other plants. The excess energy may also cause smooth cordgrass to reallocate energy from its roots to its shoots, making it harder for marsh soil to hold together.Benotti, Mark J., Michael Abbene, and Stephen A. Terracciano. \\"Nitrogen Loading in Jamaica Bay, Long Island, New York: Predevelopment to 2005.\\" United States Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5051.

Ownership and protection status World Trade Center seen from Jamaica Bay The majority of land and water within this complex is publicly owned by the United States federal government, and the city of New York. Most of Jamaica Bay proper and portions of the uplands and barrier beach are part of the Gateway National Recreation Area's Jamaica Bay Unit. Administered by the National Park Service, the Jamaica Bay Unit includes the of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, as well as Breezy Point Tip, Fort Tilden, Jacob Riis Park and Floyd Bennett Field. There are two State Parks at Jamaica Bay, Shirley Chisholm, and Bayswater Point. There are several city parks within the bay complex, including Marine Park, Spring Creek Park and Rockaway Community Park, and numerous smaller parcels of city-owned land such as Tribute Park and Sunset Cove at Broad Channel. Portions of the wetlands and uplands are part of JFK Airport, owned by the city of New York and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Occasionally the airport becomes a route of migration of some wildlife species disrupting the traffic. Small areas in the upland buffer around the bay and on the Rockaway Peninsula remain in private residential or commercial ownership. Jamaica Bay has been designated and mapped as an otherwise protected beach unit pursuant to the federal Coastal Barrier Resources Act, prohibiting incompatible federal financial assistance or flood insurance within the unit. The New York State Natural Heritage Program, in conjunction with The Nature Conservancy, recognizes two Priority Sites for Biodiversity within the Jamaica Bay and Breezy Point habitat complex: Breezy Point (B2 ‚Äì very high biodiversity significance) and Fountain Avenue Landfill (B3 ‚Äì high biodiversity significance). Jamaica Bay and Breezy Point have been designated as Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitats by the New York State Department of State, and the bay up to the high tide line was designated as a Critical Environmental Area by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Jamaica Bay was also designated as one of three special natural waterfront areas by the New York City Department of City Planning. A comprehensive watershed management plan for the bay was completed in 1993 by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in order to better protect and restore habitats and improve water quality. Wetlands are regulated in New York under the state's Freshwater Wetlands Act of 1975 and Tidal Wetlands Act of 1977. These statutes are in addition to federal regulation under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and various Executive Orders.

Description Bird watching has always been a popular activity at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, June 1973. Photo by Arthur Tress. Conservation sign circa 1973 Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge consists of several islands in Jamaica Bay, located in both Brooklyn and Queens. The Queens portion is located near John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was built upon a portion of the wetlands in Jamaica Bay. In April 1942, the City of New York started placing hydraulic fill over the marshy tidelands of the area. JFK International Airport is now the sixth busiest airport in the United States, and the aviation traffic may pose some serious noise pollutant threats to the surrounding environment. The refuge provides habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, both marine and terrestrial. It is a prime location for viewing birds and bird migrations, diamondback terrapin egg-laying and horseshoe crab mating and egg laying. The primary diet of the diamondback terrapins include fish, snails, worms, clams, crabs and marsh plants, many of which are abundant in these particular marshlands. Ospreys are currently being captured, tagged and studied in the Wildlife Refuge to help scientists better understand the birds' habits. Small mammals such as eastern gray squirrels and raccoon are also present in the area. The recently increased raccoon population, however, has developed a taste for diamondback terrapin eggs, and many nests are often destroyed only 24 hours after being laid. The extent of the refuge is mostly open water, but includes upland shoreline and islands with salt marsh, dunes, brackish ponds, woodland and fields. It is the only \\"wildlife refuge\\" in the National Park System. Originally created and managed by New York City as a wildlife refuge, the term was retained by Gateway when the site was transferred in 1972. Usually, federal wildlife refuges are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Features created under city ownership include two large freshwater ponds. A visitor center with a parking lot provides free permits to walk the trails.Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge New York Harbor Parks The two main trails go around the East Pond and the West Pond.

Background Seamus Mallon was born in the largely Protestant village of Markethill to Jane (n√©e O'Flaherty) and Francis Mallon, and was educated at the Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School in Newry and St Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh. He came from a family of republicans, and his father was a former IRA man who had fought in the Irish Civil War. As a career he (like his father) chose teaching, and became headmaster of St James's Primary School in Markethill. Mallon was also involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), playing Gaelic football for Armagh. He first played club football for Middletown during the 1950s then with Keady Dwyers, Queen's University and Crossmaglen Rangers. He was also involved in amateur drama and wrote a play which won an All-Ireland amateur drama play award. Introduction to politics During the 1960s, he was involved in the civil rights movement, especially in his native Armagh. He first got involved in the 1960s when trying to help a man and his family secure a council house, but being told by a local unionist councillor that ‚ÄúNo Catholic pig or his litter will get a house here as long as I am here.‚ÄùIn 1979, when John Hume went from being deputy leader of the SDLP (under Gerry Fitt) to leader, Mallon became deputy leader. He was elected to the first power-sharing Assembly in 1973, and to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975 representing Armagh. Between May and December 1982 Mallon was appointed by the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey to the Republic's upper house, Seanad √âireann. Mallon was a strong advocate of non-violent nationalism, and opposed political violence. In an interview with √âilis O'Hanlon Mallon recalled seeing his own close friend's dead body after being murdered by loyalists and having witnessed two RUC members bleeding to death after being murdered in an IRA ambush in Markethill. 1982 Assembly and Westminster In 1982, Mallon was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, set up as part of then-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Prior's rolling devolution. However, due to his membership of the Seanad he was, following a challenge by Unionist politicians, disqualified. Under legislation of the time, no elected member of a British parliament or regional assembly could serve in a parliament outside the United Kingdom or Commonwealth without losing their British seat. That restriction was removed with regard to the Oireachtas by the Disqualifications Act 2000. In 1986, he was elected to Westminster as an MP for Newry and Armagh, a seat he held until 2005. He won the seat in a by-election to replace Jim Nicholson, who had resigned his seat in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, along with all the other Northern Irish unionist MPs. Nicholson was the only MP to fail to be re-elected. Peace process and 1998 Assembly Mallon was elected to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in 1994. He was a member of the SDLP team at the all-party negotiations (the 'Stormont talks') that opened in Belfast in June 1996. He has frequently been quoted as saying that the Good Friday Agreement, which resulted from the talks in 1998, was \\"Sunningdale for slow learners\\". The Good Friday Agreement led to the setting up of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which was elected in June 1998, with a power-sharing Executive. Mallon was elected as member for Newry and Armagh, and in December 1999 became Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, serving alongside Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble. Mallon remained a strong opponent of IRA violence, and was also in favour of police reform in Northern Ireland. Retirement He retired in 2001, along with John Hume, from the leadership of the SDLP. Mark Durkan replaced both, Hume as leader and Mallon as Deputy First Minister, when the Northern Ireland Executive was re- established following a suspension. Mallon did not contest his seat in the Stormont Assembly in the 2003 elections, and stood down at the 2005 Westminster election. Dominic Bradley was nominated to contest the seat Mallon vacated, however failed to re-capture the seat as Conor Murphy of Sinn F√©in won. Mallon was conferred with the freedom of Drogheda in 2018. His autobiography, A Shared Home Place, written with Andy Pollak, was published in 2019. Personal life During his time in politics, Mallon lived in his hometown of Markethill, in a house with bulletproof windows installed. Mallon was a lifelong smoker and drinker who suffered from heart problems throughout his life, having his first heart attack in 1980. Mallon's wife Gertrude (n√©e Cush) died in October 2016. Their daughter √ìrla is married with one child. Mallon had retired to his second home in Donegal for a while, but when his wife's health began to fail he moved back to Markethill to care for her, and continued to live in Markethill after her death. Mallon died at his home in Markethill on 24 January 2020, aged 83. He had been treated for cancer before his death. SDLP Stormont leader, Nichola Mallon (no relation) paid tribute to Seamus Mallon in the Assembly; describing him as \\"a man of peace\\" and \\"an Irish political giant\\". Many world leaders paid tribute to Mallon after his passing. Former US president Bill Clinton paid tribute by saying ‚ÄúSeamus never wavered from his vision for a shared future where neighbors of all faiths could live in dignity, or from the belief he shared with John Hume and the entire S.D.L.P. that nonviolence was the only way to reach that goal.‚Äù References External links * Category:1936 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Armagh inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Crossmaglen Rangers Gaelic footballers Category:Independent members of Seanad √âireann Category:Irish sportsperson-politicians Category:Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly 1973‚Äì1974 Category:Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention Category:Members of the Northern Ireland Forum Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Newry and Armagh (since 1983) Category:Members of the 16th Seanad Category:Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive (since 1999) Category:Nominated members of Seanad √âireann Category:Northern Ireland MPAs 1982‚Äì1986 Category:Northern Ireland MLAs 1998‚Äì2003 Category:People educated at Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School Category:People educated at St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh Category:People of The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:Politicians from County Armagh Category:Social Democratic and Labour Party MLAs Category:Social Democratic and Labour Party MPs (UK) Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 Category:UK MPs 1987‚Äì1992 Category:UK MPs 1992‚Äì1997 Category:UK MPs 1997‚Äì2001 Category:UK MPs 2001‚Äì2005 ","title":"Seamus Mallon"},{"id":"264838","text":"A boil is a localized accumulation of pus in the skin, resulting from infection of the hair follicle.

Washington is located geographically at an equal distance from the centres of Newcastle, Durham and Sunderland, hence it has close ties to all three cities. Washington was designated a new town in 1964 and became part of the City of Sunderland in 1974. It expanded dramatically, by the creation of new villages and the absorption of areas of Chester-le-Street, to house overspill population from surrounding cities. At the 2011 census, Washington had a population of 67,085, compared to 53,388 in 2001.  Name  Early references appear around 1096 in Old English as Wasindone. The etymological origin is disputed and there are several proposed theories for how the name \\"Washington\\" came about. Early interpretations included Wasindone (people of the hill by the stream, 1096), or Wassyngtona (settlement of Wassa's people, 1183). = \\"Hw√¶sa origin\\" = The origins of the name Washington are not fully known. The most supported theory (especially amongst local historians) is that Washington is derived from Anglo-Saxon Hw√¶singat≈´n, which roughly means \\"estate of the descendants (family) of Hw√¶sa\\". Hw√¶sa (usually rendered Wassa or Wossa in modern English) is an Old English name meaning \\"wheat sheaf\\", the Swedish House of Vasa being a more famous cognate. Due to the evolution of English grammar, modern English lacks the Germanic grammatical features that permeated Anglo-Saxon English. This adds an air of confusion for most in regards to the name Hw√¶singat≈´n. It is essentially composed of three main (albeit grammatically altered) elements: *\\"Hw√¶sa\\" ‚Äì most likely the name of a local Anglo-Saxon chieftain or farmer. *\\"ing\\" ‚Äì a Germanic component that has lost its original context in English: ing means roughly \\"[derived] of/from\\". In the name Hw√¶singat≈´n, \\"ing\\" is conjugated to \\"inga\\" in accordance with the genitive plural declension of OE. *\\"t≈´n\\" ‚Äì root of the modern English \\"town\\", and is a cognate of German Zaun (fence), Dutch tuin (garden) and Icelandic t√∫n (paddock). The word means \\"fenced off estate\\" or more accurately \\"estate with defined boundaries\\". The combined elements (with all correct conjugations in place) therefore create the name Hw√¶singat≈´n with a full and technical meaning of \\"the estate of the descendants of Hw√¶sa\\". Washington in 1973 However, there has been no evidence found of any chieftain/land owner/farmer in the area by the name of Hw√¶sa, although any such records from the time would likely have been long lost by now. Although this is by no means the definite theory of origin, most scholars and historians (especially local) agree that it is the most likely. = \\"Washing origin\\" = Another of the popular origin theories is that Washington is in fact derived from the Old English verb wascan and the noun d≈´n meaning \\"hill\\"; thus making the name Wascand≈´n, meaning \\"washing hill\\". This theory likely originates from the proximity of the river Wear to the actual Anglo- Saxon hall at the time (most likely where Washington Old Hall stands today). This idea is not backed by linguistic evidence. Combining the two Old English words \\"wascan\\" and \\"d≈´n\\" would actually have meant \\"washed hill\\" and not \\"washing hill\\". Also, the Old English \\"d≈´n\\" meant a range of gently rolling hills, as evidenced by the naming of the North and South Downs in southern England. = George Washington connection = Plaque in Durham Cathedral's cloisters for John Washington, who was Prior there. William de Wessyngton was a forebear of George Washington, the first President of the United States, after whom the US capital, a state and many other places in the United States are named. Though George Washington's great-grandfather John Washington left for Virginia from Northamptonshire, Washington Old Hall was the family home of George Washington's ancestors. The present structure incorporates small parts of the medieval home in which they lived. American Independence Day is marked each year by a ceremony at Washington Old Hall.  History  = Old Hall = The Old Hall may have been built by William de Hertburn, who moved to the area in 1183. As was the custom, he took the name of his new estates, and became William de Wessyngton. By 1539, when the family moved to Sulgrave Manor in Northamptonshire, the spelling \\"Washington\\" had been adopted. The present Hall is an early 17th-century small English manor house of sandstone. Only the foundations and the arches between the Kitchen and the Great Hall remain of the original house. =Dame Margaret's Hall= Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell and his wife Margaret, grand-parents of Gertrude Bell, lived in Washington New Hall on The Avenue. After Margaret's death in 1871, Sir Isaac set up an orphanage in the house, named Dame Margaret Home in his late wife's honour. It later became a Barnardo's home until World War II. After the war, it was taken over by the National Coal Board as a training centre. It is now a private residence. = Building the New Town = The Galleries shopping centre is the town's main commercial centre. Washington's design was developed through the New Towns concept aiming to achieve sustainable socio-economic growth. The new town is divided into small self-sufficient \\"villages\\". It was originally also divided into the 15 numbered districts, a fate that confused many visitors to the area. These numbered districts have gradually been removed as well as increased, and now road signs indicate the villages' names instead of district number. Washington's villages are called: *Donwell *Usworth (originally Great Usworth) *Concord *Sulgrave *Albany *Glebe *Barmston *Biddick *Washington Village (the original village and location of the Old Hall) *Columbia *Blackfell *Oxclose *Ayton *Lambton *Fatfield *Harraton *Rickleton Mount Pleasant was also added to the list of numbered districts (14), despite being out of the Town \\"boundary line\\" of the River Wear and having a DH4 Postcode (Houghton le Spring); however, it does hold a Washington dialling code starting 0191 415/416/417. Built on industry, Washington contains several industrial estates, named after famous local engineers, such as Parsons, Armstrong, Stephenson, Crowther, Pattinson, Swan and Emerson. A lot of the land that makes up the town was purchased from the Lambton family, Earls of Durham who own the estate of the same name, which includes their ancestral home, Lambton Castle. In 1970, Washington hosted the English Schools Athletic Association (ESAA) annual National Championships, attended by the then Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. On 15 November 1977, the very first SavaCentre hypermarket (a venture between Sainsbury's and British Home Stores) opened at The Galleries. By 2005, however, it had been rebranded as a traditional Sainsbury's as the SavaCentre brand was phased out. The former Court House on Liberty Green has now been converted into private residences.  Industry  View of Washington 'F' Pit, May 1965 Historically, Washington was heavily involved in the coal industry with a number of pits. One of these in the Albany district of Washington is preserved as the 'F' Pit Museum (pits in Washington were named alphabetically e.g. the 'F' Pit). A number of the old communities of Washington grew up around the pits (e.g. the modern area of Usworth partly grew up around the Usworth mine and the area was known as Usworth Colliery (and still is to some of the older generation). In support of the mines, there was a series of wagonways and later railway lines to transport the coal. The wagonways took coal to Staithes on the River Wear, where it could be loaded onto barges to be taken to the oceangoing vessels at Sunderland. Washington was also involved in the chemical industry and the Washington Chemical Works was a major employer in the 19th century. This later became the Cape/Newalls Works, which produced insulation. The Pattinson Town area of Washington grew up around the chemical works. This area is now Pattinson industrial estate and Teal Farm housing estate. Currently, Washington's main industries include textiles, electronics, car assembly, chemicals and electrical goods. The Nissan automotive plant is a major employer. Nissan is the largest private-sector employer in the City of Sunderland. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the American tyre production giant, opened a new factory in Washington in 1968. However, it closed on 5 July 2006 with the loss of 585 jobs.  Visitor attractions  The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust nature reserve and the Washington 'F' Pit mining museum are within the town. The Washington Arts Centre is a converted farm building. The Centre includes an exhibition gallery, community theatre, artist studios and a recording studio. The North East Aircraft Museum occupies part of the old RAF Usworth base. The Nissan plant takes up much of the rest. The municipal airport previously run from the site was closed to make way for the Nissan plant.

Washington is part of the Washington and Sunderland West parliamentary constituency and is represented in the House of Commons by Sharon Hodgson of the Labour Party.  Transport  Washington is located on the mothballed Leamside line and, until the mid-1960s, had regular passenger services to Sunderland, Teesside and Newcastle upon Tyne, via Pelaw Junction. Freight services continued until 1991 and the line is currently out of use, with all major infrastructure extant. Washington is therefore one of the largest towns in Britain without an operational railway station (see Dudley, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Gosport). In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies called for funding for the reopening of this station as part of a ¬£500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations. There is a major bus station situated at The Galleries, and another at Concord in the north of Washington. The primary provider of transport (buses) in the area is Go North East, with local services as well as connections to Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, and many other towns and cities in the region. Major roads run through Washington: the A182, the A1231 (Sunderland Highway) and the A195 all connect to the A1(M) motorway (which acts as the western boundary of Washington proper) or its feeder, the A194. Washington Services is situated between Junctions 64 and 65 of the A1(M), and incorporate a Travelodge.

The screenplay by Jay Presson Allen was based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Winston Graham. The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery. The music was composed by Bernard Herrmann, his last of seven critically acclaimed film scores for Hitchcock. Marnie also marked the end of Hitchcock's collaborations with cinematographer Robert Burks (his 12th film for Hitchcock) and editor George Tomasini (who died later in the year). Plot Marian Holland charmed Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel), head of a tax consulting company, into hiring her without references. Some months later, she steals nearly $10,000 from the company safe and flees. Changing her appearance and identity, Marian, whose real name is Margaret \\"Marnie\\" Edgar (Tippi Hedren), travels to Virginia where she stables a horse named Forio. She then visits her invalid mother, Bernice (Louise Latham), whom she supports financially, in Baltimore. Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), a wealthy widower who owns a publishing company in Philadelphia, meets with Strutt on business. He learns about the robbery and recalls Marnie from a previous visit. Some months later, Marnie, posing as Mary Taylor, happens to apply to Mark's company and is hired after he recognizes her. While working weekend overtime with Mark, Marnie has a panic attack during a thunderstorm. Mark comforts then kisses her. They begin seeing each other socially. It is learned that Marnie suffers from bad dreams and the color red can trigger an extreme emotional reaction. Soon after, Marnie steals money from Mark's company and again flees. Mark tracks her to the stable where she keeps Forio. Unexpectedly, he blackmails her into marrying him, much to the chagrin of Mark's former sister-in-law, Lil (Diane Baker), who is in love with Mark. Lil grows suspicious when she discovers Mark has spent a considerable sum since marrying Marnie. On their honeymoon cruise, Marnie is repulsed by any physical intimacy. Mark initially respects her wishes, but then rapes her. The next morning, she attempts to drown herself in the ship's swimming pool, but Mark saves her. Lil tips off Mark that Marnie's mother is still alive and living in Baltimore. Mark hires a private detective to investigate. Meanwhile, Lil overhears Mark telling Marnie that he has \\"paid off Strutt\\" on her behalf. Lil mischievously invites Strutt and his wife to a large party at the Rutland mansion. Strutt recognizes Marnie, but Mark persuades him to say nothing. When Marnie later admits to additional robberies, Mark works to reimburse her victims in exchange for dropping charges. Mark brings Forio to their estate, pleasing Marnie. During a fox hunt, Forio bolts. After a wild gallop, Forio misses a jump and breaks a leg, and lies on the ground screaming in pain. Marnie frantically runs to a nearby house and manages to obtain a gun and shoots her horse. Crazed with grief, Marnie goes home where she finds the key to Mark's office. She then goes to the office, opens the safe, and finds herself unable to take the money she wants to steal, even after Mark arrives and \\"urges\\" her to take it. Mark forcibly takes Marnie to Baltimore to confront her mother and extract the truth about Marnie's past. They arrive in a thunderstorm. As it is revealed that Bernice was a prostitute, Marnie's long-suppressed memories resurface: when she was a small child, one of Bernice's clients, (Bruce Dern) tried to calm a frightened Marnie during a thunderstorm. Seeing him touch Marnie and believing he was trying to molest her, Bernice attacked him. As the man fended her off, she fell and injured her leg, leaving her disabled. Marnie, frightened and attempting to protect her mother, fatally struck the man in the head with a fireplace poker. Bernice told police that she herself killed the man and prayed Marnie would forget the event. She had become pregnant as a young, unmarried girl, and says she has always loved Marnie. Understanding the reason behind her behavior, Marnie asks for Mark's help. He promises to help her. They leave holding each other closely.

Production = Development and writing = Alfred Hitchcock began developing the film adaptation of Winston Graham's novel Marnie in 1961. He commissioned Joseph Stefano, the screenwriter of Hitchcock's recently released Psycho, to work on the script. Stefano made extensive notes and wrote a 161-page treatment. The director's first choice to play the title role, Grace Kelly, by then Princess Grace of Monaco, withdrew from the project when the citizens of Monaco objected to her appearing in a film, especially as a sexually disturbed thief. Also, when Kelly married Prince Rainier in 1956, she had not fulfilled her contract with MGM, which could have prevented her from working for another studio. As a consequence of Kelly's departure from the film, Hitchcock put it aside to work on The Birds (1963). After completing The Birds, Hitchcock returned to the Winston Graham adaptation. Evan Hunter, who had written the screenplay for The Birds, developed Marnie with Hitchcock, and wrote several drafts. Hunter was unhappy with the rape scene in the original novel, as he felt the audience would lose sympathy for the male lead. The director, however, was enthusiastic about the scene, describing to Hunter how he intended to film it. > Hitch held up his hands the way directors do when they're framing a shot. > Palms out, fingers together, thumbs extended and touching to form a perfect > square. Moving his hands toward my face, like a camera coming in for a close > shot, he said, \\"Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on > her face\\". Hunter wrote a draft containing the rape scene but also wrote an additional, substitute sequence, which he pleaded with Hitchcock to use instead. Hunter was dismissed from the project on 1 May 1963. His replacement, Jay Presson Allen, later told him that \\"you just got bothered by the scene that was his reason for making the movie. You just wrote your ticket back to New York.\\" Just as Hunter had been unaware of Stefano's earlier work on Marnie, Presson Allen was not informed that she was the third writer to work on the adaptation. = Casting = According to royal biographer Craig Brown, Hitchcock offered Princess Grace the title role in March 1962, and she accepted; but in Monaco, the reaction to the announcement was categorically negative. \\"Monegasques did not like the idea of their princess being filmed kissing another man,\\" Brown wrote. \\"Little did they know that Hitchcock also had plans for him to rape her.\\" Grace's announcement that she would donate her $800,000 fee to Monaco charities did nothing to appease the critics, and she dropped out of the project in June 1962. Following the news of Kelly's unavailability, the role of Marnie became a sought-after commission in Hollywood. Before Marilyn Monroe died, of probable suicide, in 1962, she expressed interest in playing the title character. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting idea,‚Äù Hitchcock admitted in an evasive manner to Variety Army Archerd. In his book Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie, Tony Lee Moral revealed that a studio executive at Paramount Pictures suggested actress Lee Remick to Hitchcock for the title role. Hitchcock also considered two other actresses who were, like Hedren, under his personal contract, Vera Miles and Claire Griswold, wife of director/actor Sydney Pollack. Eva Marie Saint, star of Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959), and Susan Hampshire unsuccessfully pursued the role as well. In the end, Hitchcock opted to use Tippi Hedren, a one-time model he had seen in a commercial for a diet drink in 1961, then cast successfully in The Birds. According to Hedren, he offered her the role of Marnie during filming of The Birds. Hedren told writer Moral that she was \\"amazed\\" that Hitchcock would offer her this \\"incredible role\\", calling it a \\"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\\". In 2005, more than 40 years after the film's release, Hedren declared in an interview that Marnie was her favorite of the two films that she made with Hitchcock, because of the intriguing, complex, challenging character that she played. Male lead Sean Connery had been worried that being under contract to Eon Productions for both James Bond and non-Bond films would limit his career and turned down every non-Bond film that Eon offered him. When asked what he wanted to do, Connery replied that he wanted to work with Alfred Hitchcock, which Eon arranged through their contacts. Connery also shocked many people at the time by asking to see a script; something Connery did because he was worried about being typecast as a spy and he did not want to do a variation of North by Northwest or Notorious. When told by Hitchcock's agent that Cary Grant did not ask to see even one of Hitchcock's scripts Connery replied, \\"I'm not Cary Grant.\\" Hitchcock and Connery got on well during filming. Connery also said that he was happy with the film \\"with certain reservations.\\" Marnie became a milestone for several reasons. It was the last time a \\"Hitchcock blonde\\" would have a central role in one of his films. It was also the final occasion when he would work with several of his key team members: director of photography Robert Burks, who died in 1968; editor George Tomasini, who died soon after Marnie's release, and music composer Bernard Herrmann, who was fired during Hitchcock's next film, Torn Curtain (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a more contemporary \\"pop\\" tune for the film. Marnie continues to have its admirers. Actress Catherine Deneuve indicated that she would have loved to have played Marnie. Actress Naomi Watts dressed up as Hedren's Marnie (whose outfits were by Edith Head) for the March 2008 issue of Vanity Fair magazine.Vanity Fair photograph Although they played mother and daughter, Latham (42) was only eight years older than Hedren (34). In the script, the mother character was only 15 years older than the daughter character. = Filming = In a making- of documentary for the DVD release, unit manager Hilton A. Green explains that shooting had been scheduled to begin on November 25, 1963, but had to be postponed because the nation was in mourning for John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated three days before. = Music = Hitchcock had noticed a strong similarity between Herrmann's score for Joy in the Morning and Marnie and believed that Herrmann was repeating himself. Herrmann's music for Marnie included excerpts in his special album for Decca Records. Lyrics were written to Herrmann's theme that were to be sung by Nat King Cole. Herrmann's later score for Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968) also repeats the main theme in Marnie, although slightly altered in its harmony. Theatrical trailer. Reception Contemporary reviews were mixed. Eugene Archer of The New York Times wrote a lukewarm assessment, calling it \\"at once a fascinating study of a sexual relationship and the master's most disappointing film in years.\\" Archer's main criticisms were \\"an inexplicably amateurish script\\" and the casting of \\"relative newcomers\\" Hedren and Connery in roles that \\"cry for the talents of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.\\" A review in Variety wrote that the opening was slow, but once it got going Hitchcock's story \\"generally keeps the action fairly fast-paced‚Äîprovided audience can overlook certain puzzling aspects, such as why the lady became a thief‚Äîand gets strong performances from his two stars and other cast members.\\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"As a story it seems naggingly improbable and, as drama, a nightmare from which the spectator constantly pulls away, struggling to wake up in a less disordered universe. No question, though, that it is at least fitfully effective.\\" Edith Oliver of The New Yorker called the film \\"an idiotic and trashy movie with two terrible performances in the leading roles, and I had quite a good time watching it. There is something bracing about Hitchcock at work, even when he is at his worst.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film \\"opens quite brilliantly,\\" but that \\"things get out of hand\\" after the marriage, \\"with both leading players floundering badly as Hitchcock piles up his demands on them.\\" The review suggested that \\"the trouble seems to be that the film falls between the two stools of straight suspense (what is Marnie's secret?) and the full-dress character study that would only have been possible with a more experienced actress.\\" Marnie currently holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"A coolly constructed mystery revolving around a character who's inscrutable to a fault, Marnie finds Hitchcock luring audiences deeper into the dark.\\" The film was a moderate box office success; it grossed $7 million in theatres on a budget of $3 million. In North America, it earned estimated rentals of $3,250,000.\\"Big Rental Pictures of 1964\\", Variety, 6 January 1965, p. 39. Please note this figure is rentals accruing to distributors, not total gross. Marnie was the 22nd highest-grossing film of 1964. In a making-of documentary on the DVD, Robin Wood, author of Hitchcock's Films Revisited, discusses the special effects of the film as having their roots in German Expressionism: > [Hitchcock] worked in German studios at first, in the silent period. Very > early on when he started making films, he saw Fritz Lang's German silent > films; he was enormously influenced by that, and Marnie is basically an > expressionist film in many ways. Things like scarlet suffusions over the > screen, back-projection and backdrops, artificial-looking > thunderstorms‚Äîthese are expressionist devices and one has to accept them. If > one doesn't accept them then one doesn't understand and can't possibly like > Hitchcock. In the 2012 Sight & Sound poll of the greatest films ever made, Marnie received nine total votes‚Äîsix (out of 846) from critics and three (out of 358) from directors. Marnie has been described as a neo-noir film by some authors.

After World War II, its factories in socialist states were nationalized, while its branches in capitalist states remained family-owned. It is now based in Lausanne, Switzerland. The principal subsidiaries are Bata Europe (based in Zl√≠n), Bata North America (based in Toronto), Bata Asia- Pacific-Africa (based in Singapore) and Bata Latin America (based in Mexico). A family-owned business, the company is organized into three business units: Bata, Bata Industrials (safety shoes) and AW Lab (sports style). The company is the world's leading shoemaker by volume, and it has a retail presence of over 5,300 shops in more than 70 countries and production facilities in 18 countries. Origins and history =Foundation= The T. & A. Ba≈•a Shoe Company was founded on 24 August 1894 in the Moravian town of Zl√≠n, Austria- Hungary (today in the Czech Republic), by Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a (), his brother Anton√≠n and his sister Anna, whose family had been cobblers for generations. The company employed 10 full-time employees with a fixed work schedule and a regular weekly wage. Tom√°≈°, Anton√≠n and Anna Ba≈•a In the summer of 1895, Tom√°≈° was facing financial difficulties. To overcome these setbacks, he decided to sew shoes from canvas instead of leather. This type of shoe became very popular and helped the company grow to 50 employees. Four years later, Ba≈•a installed its first steam-driven machines, beginning a period of rapid modernisation. In 1904, Tom√°≈° read a newspaper article about some machines being made in America. Therefore, he took three workers and journeyed to Lynn, a shoemaking city outside Boston, in order to study and understand the American system of mass production. After six months he returned to Zl√≠n and he introduced mechanized production techniques that allowed the Ba≈•a Shoe Company to become one of the first mass producers of shoes in Europe. Its first mass product, the ‚ÄúBa≈•ovky,‚Äù was a leather and textile shoe for working people that was notable for its simplicity, style, light weight and affordable price. Its success helped fuel the company‚Äôs growth. After Anton√≠n's death in 1908, Tom√°≈° brought two of his younger brothers, Jan and Bohu≈°, into the business. Initial export sales and the first ever sales agencies began in Germany in 1909, followed by the Balkans and the Middle East. Ba≈•a shoes were considered to be excellent quality, and were available in more styles than had ever been offered before. By 1912, Ba≈•a was employing 600+ full-time workers, plus another several hundred who worked out of their homes in neighbouring villages. =World War I= In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, the company had a significant development due to military orders. From 1914 to 1918 the number of Ba≈•a‚Äôs employees increased ten times. The company opened its own stores in Zl√≠n, Prague, Liberec, Vienna and Pilsen, among other towns. In the global economic slump that followed World War I, the newly created country of Czechoslovakia was particularly hard hit. With its currency devalued by 75%, demand for products dropped, production was cut back, and unemployment was at an all-time high. Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a responded to the crisis by cutting the price of Bata shoes in half. The company‚Äôs workers agreed to a temporary 40 percent reduction in wages; in turn, Ba≈•a provided food, clothing, and other necessities at half-price. He also introduced one of the first profit-sharing initiatives, transforming all employees into associates with a shared interest in the company's success (today's equivalent of performance-based incentives and stock options). =Shoemaker to the world= Consumer response to the price drop was dramatic. While most competitors were forced to close because of the crisis in demand between 1923 and 1925, Ba≈•a was expanding as demand for the inexpensive shoes grew rapidly. The Ba≈•a Shoe Company increased production and hired more workers. Zl√≠n became a veritable factory town, a \\"Ba≈•aville\\" covering several hectares. On the site were grouped tanneries, a brickyard, a chemical factory, a mechanical equipment plant and repair shop, workshops for the production of rubber, a paper pulp and cardboard factory (for production of packaging), a fabric factory (for lining for shoes and socks), a shoe-shine factory, a power plant and farming activities to cover food and energy needs. Workers, \\"Ba≈•amen\\", and their families had at their disposal all the necessary everyday life services, including housing, shops, schools, and hospital. =Foreign growth= Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a Lockheed 10 Electra executive aircraft operated before the Second World War by Ba≈•a in Europe Ba≈•a also began to build towns and factories outside of Czechoslovakia (Poland, Latvia, Romania, Switzerland, France) and to diversify into such industries as tanning (1915), the energy industry (1917), agriculture (1917), forestry (1918), newspaper publishing (1918), brick manufacturing (1918), wood processing (1919), the rubber industry (1923), the construction industry (1924), railway and air transport (1924), book publishing (1926), the film industry (1927), food processing (1927), chemical production (1928), tyre manufacturing (1930), insurance (1930), textile production (1931), motor transport (1930), sea transport (1932), and coal mining (1932), airplane manufacturing (1934), synthetic fibre production (1935), and river transport (1938). In 1923 the company boasted 112 branches. In 1924, Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a displayed his business acumen by calculating how much turnover he needed to make with his annual plan, weekly plans and daily plans. Ba≈•a utilized four types of wages ‚Äì fixed rate, individual order based rate, collective task rate and profit contribution rate. He also set what became known as Ba≈•a prices: numbers ending with a nine rather than with a whole number. His business skyrocketed. Soon Ba≈•a found himself the fourth richest person in Czechoslovakia. From 1926 to 1928 the business blossomed as productivity rose 75 percent and the number of employees increased by 35 percent. In 1927 production lines were installed, and the company had its own hospital. By the end of 1928, the company‚Äôs head factory was composed of 30 buildings. Bat'a then created educational organizations such as the Ba≈•a School of Work and introduced the five-day work week. In 1930 he established a shoe museum that maps shoe production from the earliest times to the contemporary age throughout the world. By 1931 there were factories in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland and in other countries. In 1932, at the age of 56, Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a died in a plane crash during take off under bad weather conditions at Zl√≠n Airport. Control of the company was passed to his half-brother, Jan, and his son, Thomas John Ba≈•a, who would go on to lead the company for much of the twentieth century guided by the founder's moral testament: the Ba≈•a Shoe company was to be treated not as a source of private wealth, but as a public trust, a means of improving living standards within the community and providing customers with good value for their money. Promise was made to pursue the entrepreneurial, social and humanitarian ideals of their father. The Ba≈•a company was apparently the first big enterprise to systematically utilise aircraft for company purposes, including rapid transport of personnel on businesslike delivery of maintenance men and spares to a location where needed, originating the practice of business flying. =Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a= At the time of Tom√°≈°'s death, the Ba≈•a company employed 16,560 people, maintained 1,645 shops and 25 enterprises. Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a, following the plans laid down by Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a before his death, expanded the company more than six times its original size throughout Czechoslovakia and the world. Plants in Britain, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Kenya, Canada and the United States followed in the decade. In India, Batanagar was settled near Calcutta and accounted from the late 1930s nearly 7500 Ba≈•amen. The Ba≈•a model fitted anywhere, creating, for example, canteens for vegetarians in India. In exchange, the demands on workers were as strong as in Europe: \\"Be courageous. The best in the world is not good enough for us. Loyalty gives us prosperity & happiness. Work is a moral necessity!\\" Bata India was incorporated as Bata Shoe Company Pvt. Ltd in 1931 and went on to become Bata India Ltd. in 1973. The Batanagar factory was the first Indian shoe manufacturing unit to receive the ISO 9001 certification in 1993. As of 1934, the firm owned 300 stores in North America (after World War II, many of theses stores were rebranded with the \\"Barrett Shoes\\" trademark), a thousand in Asia, more than 4,000 in Europe. In 1938, the Group employed just over 65,000 people worldwide, including 36% outside Czechoslovakia and had stakes in the tanning, agriculture, newspaper publishing, railway and air transport, textile production, coal mining and aviation realms. =Bata-villes= Company policy initiated under Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a was to set up villages around the factories for the workers and to supply schools and welfare. These villages include Batadorp in the Netherlands, Ba≈•ovany (present-day Partiz√°nske) and Svit in Slovakia, Ba≈•ov (now Bah≈à√°k, part of Otrokovice) in the Czech Republic, Borovo-Bata (now Borovo Naselje, part of Vukovar in Croatia then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Bata Park in M√∂hlin, Switzerland, Bataville in Lorraine, France, Batawa (Ontario) in Canada, Batatuba (S√£o Paulo), Bataypor√£ and Bataguassu (Mato Grosso do Sul) in Brazil. East Tilbury in Essex, England, Batapur in Pakistan and Batanagar and Bataganj in India. There was also a factory in Belcamp, Maryland, USA, northeast of Baltimore on U.S. Route 40 in Harford County. The British \\"Bata-ville\\" in East Tilbury inspired the documentary film Bata-ville: We Are Not Afraid of the Future. =World War II= Just before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Ba≈•a helped re-post his Jewish employees to branches of his firm all over the world. Germany occupied the remaining part of pre-war Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939; Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a then spent a short time in jail but was then able to leave the country with his family. Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a stayed in America from 1939‚Äì1940, but when the USA entered the war, he felt it would be safer for his co-workers and their families back in occupied Czechoslovakia if he left the United States. He was put on British and US black lists for doing business with the Axis powers, and in 1941 he emigrated to Brazil. After the war ended, the Czechoslovak authorities tried Ba≈•a as a traitor, saying he had failed to support the anti-Nazi resistance. In 1947 he was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison. The company's Czechoslovak assets were also seized by the state ‚Äì several months before the communists came to power. He tried to save as much as possible of the business, submitting to the plans of Germany as well as financially supporting the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile led by Edvard Bene≈°. In occupied Europe, a Bata shoe factory was connected to the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau.Dwork, Deborah; van Pelt, Robert Jan, Holocaust: A History, W.W.Norton & Company, Inc., 2002. The first slave labour efforts in Auschwitz involved the Bata shoe factory.Engle Schafft, Gretchen, From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich, University of Illinois Press, 2004. In 1942 a small camp was established to support the former Bata shoe factory (now under German administration and renamed \\"Schlesische Schuh-Werke Ottmuth, A.G\\") at Che≈Çmek with Jewish slave labourers.Dwork, Deborah; van Pelt, Robert Jan, Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present, New York: W.W. Norton and Company Inc. The prisoners, mostly from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, were tasked to clean the ponds from which the plant drew the water it needed.Auschwitz sub-camps- Chelmek Also slave workers from the ghetto of Radom were forced to work at the Bata factory for a soup a day.Jewish Workers of the Bata Shoe Company in Radom, Poland = Post-war = Bata International Centre was the global headquarters during its entire existence (1965-2004)300x300px Tom√°≈°'s son Thomas J. Bata, manager of the buying department of the British Bata Company, was unable to return until after the war. He was sent to Canada by his uncle Jan, to become the Vice President of the Bata Import and Export Company of Canada, which was founded in a company town named Batawa, opened in 1939. Foreign subsidiaries were separated from the parent company, and ownership of plants in Bohemia and Moravia was transferred to another member of the family. After World War II, governments in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Yugoslavia confiscated and nationalized Bata factories, stripping Bata of its Eastern European assets. In 1945, the decision was taken that Bata Development Limited in Great Britain would become the service headquarters of the Bata Shoe Organisation. Now based in the West, Thomas J. Bata, along with many Czechoslovakian expatriates, began to rebuild the business. From its new base, the company gradually rebuilt itself, expanding into new markets throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Rather than organizing these new operations in a highly centralized structure, Bata established a confederation of autonomous units that could be more responsive to new markets in developing countries. Between 1946 and 1960, 25 new factories were built and 1,700 company shops were opened. In 1962, the company had production and sales activities in 79 countries. In 1964, Bata moved their headquarters to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1965 they were moved again, into an ultra-modern building, the Bata International Centre. The building, located on Wynford Drive, in suburban North York, Ontario, Canada, was designed by architect John B. Parkin. In 1979, the Bata family established the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation to operate an international centre for footwear research and house of a collection that was started by Sonja Bata, Thomas' wife, in the 1940s. As she travelled the world on business with her husband, she gradually built up a collection of traditional footwear from the areas she was visiting. Bata was one of the official sponsors of the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico. Bata also sponsored 2014 Electronic Sports World Cup. =Czechoslovakia after 1989= After the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, Thomas J. Ba≈•a arrived as soon as December 1989. The Czechoslovak government offered him the opportunity to invest in the ailing government-owned Svit shoe company. Since companies nationalised before 1948 were not returned to their original owners, the state continued to own Svit and privatised it during voucher privatisation in Czechoslovakia. Svit's failure to compete in the free market led to decline, and in 2000 Svit went bankrupt. =Present= After the global economic changes of the 1990s, the company closed a number of its factories in developed countries and focused on expanding retail business. Bata moved out of Canada in several steps. In 2000, it closed its Batawa factory, then in 2001, it closed its Bata retail stores, retaining its \\"Athletes World\\" retail chain. In 2004, the Bata headquarters were moved to Lausanne, Switzerland and leadership was transferred to Thomas G. Bata, grandson of Tom√°≈°. The notable Bata headquarters building in Toronto was vacated and eventually demolished to much controversy. In 2007, the Athletes World chain was sold, ending Bata retail operations in Canada. As of 2013, Bata maintains the headquarters for its \\"Power\\" brand of footwear in Toronto. The Bata Shoe Museum, founded by Sonja Bata, and operated by a charitable foundation, is also located in Toronto. Although no longer chairman of the company, the elder Bata remained active in its operations and carried business cards listing his title as ‚Äúchief shoe salesman.‚Äù On 1 September 2008 Thomas John Bata (Tom√°≈° Jan Ba≈•a) died at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto at the age of 93. Bata estimates that it serves more than 1 million customers per day, employing over 30,000 people,About Bata bata.com, March 5, 2013. operates more than 5,300 shops, manages 23 production facilities and a retail presence in over 70 countries across the five continents. Bata has a strong presence in countries including India where it has been present since 1931. Bata India has five factories and two tanneries. The Mokameh Ghat tannery in Bihar (1952) is the second largest in Asia. The business is organised in five regions: Africa (with regional office based in Nairobi), Asia Pacific (with regional office based in Singapore), Latin America (with regional office based in Santiago de Chile), South Asia (with regional office based in New Delhi) and Europe/Developed Markets (with regional office based in Zl√≠n). In April 2019, the consumer forum in India fined Bata Rs 9000 (approx US$129) for asking a customer to pay Rs 3 extra for a paper bag. The customer approached the forum citing deficiency in services seeking a refund of Rs 3. The forum observed that it was the brand's responsibility to provide consumers with eco-friendly bags without charging them for it.

The Nemean Games ( or ŒùŒ≠ŒºŒµŒπŒ±) were one of the four Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece, and were held at Nemea every two years (or every third). With the Isthmian Games, the Nemean Games were held both the year before and the year after the Ancient Olympic Games and the Pythian Games in the third year of the Olympiad cycle. Like the Olympic Games, they were held in honour of Zeus. They were said to have been founded by Heracles after he defeated the Nemean Lion; another myth said that they originated as the funeral games of a child named Opheltes. However, they are known to have existed only since the 6th century BC (from 573 BC, or earlier). The winners received a wreath of wild celery leaves from the city of Argos. History The various legends concerning its origin are related in the argumenta of the Scholiasts to the Nemea of Pindar, with which may be compared Pausanias,Pausanias, ii. 15. ¬ß2, etc. and Apollodorus.Apollodorus, iii. 6. ¬ß4 All these legends, however, agree in stating that the Nemean Games were originally instituted by the Seven against Thebes in commemoration of the death of Opheltes, later called Archemorus. When the Seven arrived at Nemea, and were very thirsty, they met Hypsipile, who was carrying Opheltes (Greek: ·ΩàœÜŒ≠ŒªœÑŒ∑œÇ), the child of the priest of Zeus and of Eurydice. While she showed the heroes the way to the nearest well, she left the child behind lying in a meadow, which during her absence was killed by a dragon. When the Seven on their return saw the accident, they slew the dragon and instituted funeral games to be held every third year. Other legends attribute the institution of the Nemean Games to Heracles, after he had slain the Nemean Lion. The alternative tradition was that he had either revived the ancient games, or at least introduced the alteration by which they were from this time celebrated in honor of Zeus. Pindar stated that the games were afterward celebrated in honor of Zeus.Pindar, Nem. iii. 114, etc. Initially the games were warlike in character, and only warriors and their sons were allowed to take part in them. Later on, however, they were thrown open to all the Greeks. The games took place in a grove between Cleonae and Phlius.Strabo, viii. The various events, according to Apollodorus,Apollodorus, iii. 6 were horse-racing, running in armour in the stadium,Pausanias, ii. 15. ¬ß2 wrestling, chariot racing and discus, boxing, spear-throwing and archery, as well as musical contests.Pausanias, viii. 50. ¬ß3; Plutarch, Philop. 11. The prize given to the victors was originally a wreath of olive branches, but afterwards a wreath of green celery. The location of the Nemean Games varied at different times among Cleonae, Corinth, and Argos. They were sometimes called the Cleonaean Games after the first location. The judges who awarded the prizes were dressed in black robes, and an instance of their justice, when the Argives presided, is recorded by Pausanias.Pausanias, viii. 40. ¬ß3 Regarding the time of year the Nemean Games were celebrated, the Scholiast on PindarScholiast on Pindar, Argum. ad Nem. merely states that they were held on the 12th of the month of Panemos, though in another passage he makes a statement which contradicts this assertion. PausaniasPausanias, ii. 15. ¬ß2 speaks of winter Nemean Games, and distinguishes them from others which were held in summer. It seems that for a time the celebration of the Nemean Games was neglected, and that they were revived in Olympiad 51.4 (573 BC), from which time Eusebius dates the first Nemead. Henceforth they were for a long time celebrated regularly twice in every Olympiad, both at the start of every second Olympic year in the winter, and soon after the start of every fourth Olympic year in the summer. About the time of the Battle of Marathon it became customary in Argolis to reckon according to Nemeads. The Hellenistic Stadion (with a vaulted entrance tunnel dated to about 320 BC, according to Stephen G. Miller, 2001, pp. 90‚Äì93) has recently been discovered. The Games, under Macedonian control, returned to Nemea at the end of the 4th century BC. In 208 BC Philip of Macedonia was honored by the Argives with the presidency at the Nemean games,Livy, xxvii. 30, etc.; Polybius, x. 26 and Quintius Flamininus proclaimed at the Nemean Games the freedom of the Argives.Livy, xxxiv. 41; Polybius, x. 26. The emperor Hadrian restored the horse-racing of boys at the Nemean Games, which had fallen into disuse. But after his time they do not seem to have been much longer celebrated, as they are no longer mentioned by any of the writers of the subsequent period. The program of the Nemean Games = The Gymnic Part = The participants to these parts competed in the nude. * The Stadion - A foot race which was about 178 meters at Nemea. * The Diaulos - Twice the Stadion foot race, about 355 meters at Nemea. * The Hippios - Twice the Diaulos foot race, about 710 meters at Nemea.Evidence suggests this race wasn't held always. * The Dolichos - A long distance running race. The exact length of this race is uncertain; it could have been 7, 10, 20 or 24 times round the stadium.See J. J√ºthner, Die athletische Leibes√ºbungen der Griechen (1968) for a discussion of the classical sources. * The Hoplitodromos - A Diaulos foot race with the competitors wearing helmets, a bronze covered hoplon and initially metal greaves. * The Pyx - A boxing-like game. In order to protect themselves and to do more damage the opponents bound their hands and wrists with long leather strips. The first to be knocked out or to acknowledge defeat would lose. * The Pankration - A blend of boxing and wrestling with very few rules. Again, the first to be knocked out or to acknowledge defeat would lose. * The Pale - Wrestling from an upright position. The goal was to throw the opponent on the ground three times. * The Pentathlon - This pentathlon consisted of the stadion, a game of wrestling or pale, javelin-throwing, discus-throwing and long-jump. =The equestrian part= Taking place in a hippodrome, these were the only games where women could take part,After the Romans conquered Greece, women could no longer participate. not because they were allowed to ride, but because it was the owner of a horse or chariot - rather than the rider or charioteer - who was considered the victor. This even allowed cities to participate by funding equestrian teams. So far no ancient hippodrome has been recovered, so the given lengths are assumptions. * The Tethrippon chariots, with four horses racing a distance of 8400 meters or 5.25 miles. * The Synoris chariots, with two horses racing a distance of 5600 meters or 3.5 miles. * The K√©lƒìs, a horseback race over a distance of 4200 meters or 2.5 miles. Modern Nemean Games Reenactment The Society for the Revival of the Nemean Games was founded in 1994, after more than 20 years of archaeological excavation at Nemea. The contemporary games are more of a reenactment than an actual sporting event, held every four years since 1996, are a form of popular education in history, as well as a counter to the commercialism of the modern Olympics. Races are organized according to age and gender, open to international participation. No medals are awarded, only crowns of palm branches and wild celery. In 2008, some 600 people clad in tunics raced barefoot in the ruins of the ancient stadium on June 21. Two races were staged for the runners aged from 10 to 80, one of and the other of . The most striking feature of this attempt was the revival of the Hoplitodromos race. The last Nemead was held on 11th and 12 June 2016.

Although the global oil supply only decreased by approximately four percent, the oil markets reaction raised the price of crude oil drastically over the next 12 months, more than doubling it to $39.50 per barrel. The spike in price caused fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations similar to the 1973 oil crisis. In 1980, following the onset of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, oil production in Iran fell drastically. Iraq's oil production also dropped significantly, triggering economic recessions worldwide. Oil prices did not return to pre-crisis levels until the mid-1980s. Oil prices after 1980 began a steady decline over the next 20 years, except for a brief uptick during the Gulf War, which then reached a 60% fall-off in the 1990s. Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela's major oil exporters expanded their production during this time. The Soviet Union became the largest oil producer in the world, and oil from the North Sea and Alaska flooded the market. Iran In November 1978, a strike consisting of 37,000 workers at Iran's nationalized oil refineries reduced production from per day to about . Foreign workers left the country. On January 16, 1979, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, Farah Pahlavi, left Iran at the behest of Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar, who sought to calm the situation. After the departure of the Shah, Ayatollah Khomeini became the new leader of Iran. Effects =Other OPEC members= Fluctuations of OPEC net oil export revenues since 1972 The rise in oil prices benefited a few members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), who made record-numbers in profits. Under the new Iranian government, oil exports later resumed but production was inconsistent and at a lower volume, further raising prices. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations, under the presidency of Mana Al Otaiba, increased production to offset most of the decline, and by early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was roughly four percent. The war between Iran and Iraq in 1980 caused a further 10 percent drop in worldwide production and OPEC production was surpassed by other exporters such as the United States as its member nations were divided amongst themselves. Saudi Arabia, a \\"swing producer,\\" tried to gain back the market share after 1985, increasing production and causing downward pressure on prices, making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable. =United States= Line at a gas station in Maryland, United States, June 15, 1979. The oil crisis had a mixed impact on the United States. Some regions of the country are oil-producing regions, and other regions are oil-consuming. Richard Nixon imposed price controls on domestic oil. Gasoline controls were repealed, but controls on domestic US oil remained. The Jimmy Carter administration began a phased deregulation of oil prices on April 5, 1979, when the average price of crude oil was US$15.85 per barrel (). Starting with the Iranian revolution, the price of crude oil rose to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months (it is all-time highest real price until March 3, 2008.) Deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed U.S. oil output to rise sharply from the large Prudhoe Bay fields, while oil imports fell sharply. Although not directly related, the near-disaster at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979, also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability.Timeline of the accident at Three Mile Island, The Patriot-News [Central Pennsylvania], March 22, 2009. This is only indirectly related but is an additional source of anxiety about energy policy. Due to memories of the oil shortage in 1973, motorists soon began panic buying, and long lines appeared at gas stations, as they had six years earlier. The average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters (about 0.5‚Äì0.8 gallons) of gasoline an hour while idling, and it was estimated that Americans wasted up to of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at gas stations.Gas coupon printed but not issued during the 1979 energy crisis The amount of oil sold in the United States in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the previous year. A telephone poll of 1,600 American adults conducted by the Associated Press and NBC News and released in early May 1979 found that only 37 percent of Americans thought the energy shortages were real, nine percent were not sure, and 54 percent thought the energy shortages were a hoax. Many politicians proposed gas rationing. One such proponent was Harry Hughes, Governor of Maryland, who proposed odd-even rationing (only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day), as was used during the 1973 Oil Crisis. Several states implemented odd-even gas rationing, including California, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, and Texas. Coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis. On July 15, 1979, President Carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his \\"Crisis of Confidence\\" speech (sometimes known as the \\"malaise\\" speech). In the speech, Carter encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy. He had already installed water tank heating solar panels on the roof of the White House and a wood-burning stove in the living quarters. However, the panels were removed in 1986, reportedly for roof maintenance, during the administration of his successor, Ronald Reagan. Carter's speech argued the oil crisis was \\"the moral equivalent of war\\". In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries seized the American Embassy, and Carter imposed an embargo on Iranian oil. In January 1980, he issued the Carter Doctrine, declaring: \\"An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States.\\" Additionally, as part of his administration's efforts at deregulation, Carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the Richard Nixon administration before the 1973 crisis. Carter agreed to remove price controls in phases. They were finally dismantled in 1981 under Reagan. Carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies. While the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to $6 a barrel, the world market price was $30. In 1980, the U.S. Government established the Synthetic Fuels Corporation to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels. When the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980, the oil- producing areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows. According to one study, individuals who were between the ages of 15 and 18 during the 1979 oil crisis were substantially less likely to use cars once they were in their mid-30s. =Other oil-consuming nations= In response to the high oil prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. National governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels but, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount. Consequently, OPEC's market share reduced from 50 percent in 1979 to 29 percent in 1985. =Automobile fuel economy= At the time, Detroit's \\"Big Three\\" automakers (Ford, Chrysler, GM) were marketing downsized full-sized automobiles like the Chevrolet Caprice, the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and the Dodge St. Regis which met the CAFE fuel economy mandates passed in 1978. Detroit's response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen Rabbit was the Chevrolet Citation and the Ford Fairmont. Ford replaced the Ford Pinto with the Ford Escort and Chrysler, on the verge of bankruptcy, introduced the Dodge Aries K. GM was having unfavorable market reactions to the citation and introduced the Chevrolet Corsica and Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 which did sell better. GM also replaced the Chevrolet Monza, introducing the 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier which was better received. Ford experienced a similar market rejection of the Fairmont and introduced the front-wheel-drive Ford Tempo in 1984. Detroit was not well prepared for the sudden rise in fuel prices, and imported brands (primarily the Asian models, which were mass-marketed and had a lower manufacturing cost as opposed to British and West German brands. Moreover, the rising value of the Deutsche Mark and English Pound resulted in the transition to the rise of Japanese manufacturers as they were able to export their product from Japan at a lower cost, resulting in profitable gains despite accusations of price dumping) were now more widely available in North America and developing a loyal customer base. A year after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Japanese manufacturers surpassed Detroit's production totals, becoming first in the world. Japanese exports would later displace the automotive market once dominated by lower-tier European manufacturers (Renault, Fiat, Opel, Peugeot, MG, Triumph, Citroen). Some would declare bankruptcy (e.g. Triumph, Simca) or withdraw from the U.S. market, especially in the wake of grey market automobiles or the inability of the vehicle to meet DOT requirements (from emission requirements to automotive lighting). Many imported brands utilized fuel-saving technologies such as fuel injection and multi-valve engines over the common use of carburetors. Nonetheless, overall fuel economy increased, which was one factor leading to the subsequent 1980s oil glut.

He also served as Britain's principal delegate to the United Nations immediately after World War II and as Attorney General for England and Wales.  Early life  Hartley William Shawcross was born in Giessen, Germany, to British parents, John and Hilda Constance (Asser) Shawcross, while his father was teaching English at Giessen University. He attended Dulwich College, the London School of Economics and the University of Geneva and read for the Bar at Gray's Inn, where he won first-class honours. Career Shawcross interviewed on CBS-TV's Longines Chronoscope (1954) He joined the Labour Party at a young age and served as Member of Parliament for St Helens, Lancashire from 1945 to 1958, being appointed to be Attorney General in 1945 until 1951. It was in 1946 when debating the repeal of laws against trade unions in the House of Commons that Shawcross allegedly said \\"We are the masters now\\",This is the wording usually quoted, and is attested by eyewitness Lord Bruce in a New Statesman article, but it is still a matter of dispute. For full details see Wikiquote, Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross. a phrase that came to haunt him. He was knighted in 1945 upon his appointment as Attorney-General and named Chief Prosecutor for the United Kingdom at the Nuremberg Trials. = Nuremberg Trials = Shawcross's advocacy before the Nuremberg Trial was passionate. His most famous line was: \\"There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer to his own conscience\\". He avoided the crusading style of American, Soviet and French prosecutors. Shawcross's opening speech, which lasted two days, the 26 and 27 July 1946, sought to undermine any belief that the Nuremberg Trials were victor's justice (an exacted vengeance against defeated foes). Instead, he focused on the rule of law and demonstrated that the laws that the defendants had broken, expressed in international treaties and agreements, were those to which prewar Germany had been a party. In his closing speech, he ridiculed any notion that any of the defendants could have remained ignorant of the thousands of Germans exterminated because they were old or mentally ill. He used the same argument for the millions of other people \\"annihilated in the gas chambers or by shooting\\" and maintained that each of the 22 defendants was a party to \\"common murder in its most ruthless forms\\". =Attorney-General and UN Factotum= As Attorney-General, he prosecuted William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw- Haw\\") and John Amery for treason, Klaus Fuchs and Alan Nunn May for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and John George Haigh, known as 'the acid bath murderer'. From 1945 to 1949, he was Britain's principal delegate to the United Nations and was involved in the official adoption of the UN flag in 1946, but he was recalled in 1948 to lead for the government's interest at the Lynskey tribunal. In 1951, he briefly served as President of the Board of Trade until the Labour government's defeat in the election of that year. Shawcross left his name to a Parliamentary principle, in a defense of his conduct regarding an illegal strike, that the Attorney-General \\"is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter\\" of whether or not to establish criminal proceedings. =Return to opposition= Shawcross ended his law career in 1951, the same year as the defeat of the second Attlee ministry. He was expected to become a Tory, earning him the nickname \\"Sir Shortly Floorcross\\" but instead he remained true to his Labour roots. During the committal hearing for the suspected serial killer doctor John Bodkin Adams in January 1957, he was seen dining with the defendant's suspected lover, Sir Roland Gwynne (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929‚Äì31), and Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, at a hotel in Lewes. The meeting added to concerns that the Adams trial was the subject of concerted judicial and political interference. Shawcross resigned from Parliament in 1958, saying he was tired of party politics. =Elevation= Shawcross was made one of Britain's first life peers on 14 February 1959 as Baron Shawcross, of Friston in the County of Sussex, and sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. = Defending press freedom = In 1961 he was appointed the chairman of the second Royal Commission on the Press. In 1967 he became one of the directors of The Times responsible for ensuring its editorial independence. He resigned on being appointed chairman of the Press Council in 1974. From 1974 to 1978 he was chairman of the Press Council and is described as \\"forthright in his condemnation both of journalists who committed excesses and of proprietors who profited from them\\" and as a \\"doughty defender of press freedom\\". Later years In October 1974 he poured scorn on a Labour Party pamphlet that recommended the application of \\"internal democracy\\" to editorial policy, saying \\"This means that... there would be some sort of committee consisting at the best of a mixture of van drivers, press operators, electricians and the rest, with no doubt a few journalists, but more probably composed of trade union officials, to deal with editorial policy.\\" In the 1974 New Year Honours Lord Shawcross was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). Philanthropy and awards In 1957, he was among a group of eminent British lawyers who founded JUSTICE, the human rights and law reform organisation and he became its first chairman, a position he held until 1972. He was instrumental in the foundation of the University of Sussex and served as chancellor of the university from 1965-85. He was the President of the charity Attend (then National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1962‚Äì72.  Personal life  Lord Shawcross was married three times. His first wife Alberta Rosita Shyvers (m. 24 May 1924) suffered from multiple sclerosis and committed suicide on 30 December 1943. His second wife Joan Winifred Mather (m. 21 September 1944) died in a riding accident on the Sussex Downs on 26 January 1974. His second wife gave birth to two sons, the author and historian William Shawcross and Hume Shawcross, and a daughter, Dr Joanna Shawcross. At the age of 95 he married Susanne Monique (n√©e Jansen), formerly wife of Gerald B. Huiskamp,Burke's Peerage 1999, vol. 2, p. 2594 on 18 April 1997 in Gibraltar. He died at home at Cowbeech, East Sussex, at the age of 101. Lady Shawcross died on 2 March 2013. From 1947 to 1960 he was the owner of Vanity V, a 12-metre class racing yacht designed by William Fife to the Third International Rule, built in 1936, which he kept at his home in Cornwall. A later skipper of the boat, John Crill, recalls being told that Lord Shawcross, \\"when the election was due in about 1951, had Vanity V repainted with a vast 'Vote Labour' banner all the way along her topsides\\".

were held. As with the Nemean Games, the Isthmian Games were held both the year before and the year after the Olympic Games (the second and fourth years of an Olympiad), while the Pythian Games were held in the third year of the Olympiad cycle.  Origin  The Games were reputed to have originated as funeral games for Melicertes (also known as Palaemon), instituted by Sisyphus, legendary founder and king of Corinth, who discovered the dead body and buried it subsequently on the Isthmus.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.4.3; Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.1.3, 1.44.8. It is likely that Pindar already described this version of the origin of the games (in a fragment of the Isthian odes). For more information, see E.R. Gebhard & M.W. Dickie, Melikertes-Palaimon, Hero of the Isthmian Games .‚Äú‚Ä¶ the Isthmia lament Melicertes ‚Ä¶‚Äù (‚Ä¶ ŒúŒµŒªŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÅœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ·ΩÄŒ¥œçœÅŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œÑ·Ω∞ ·ººœÉŒ∏ŒºŒπŒ± ‚Ä¶: Eusebius, Preparation for the Gospel 2.6 (= Clemens, Protrepticus 2.34.1). In Roman times, Melicertes was worshipped in the region.Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.1.3, 2.2.1. Theseus, legendary king of Athens, expanded Melicertes' funeral games from a closed nightly rite into fully-fledged athletic-games event which was dedicated to Poseidon, open to all Greeks, and was at a suitable level of advancement and popularity to rival those in Olympia, which were founded by Heracles.Plutarch, Life of Theseus 25.4‚Äì5. Theseus arranged with the Corinthians for any Athenian visitors to the Isthmian games to be granted the privilege of front seats (prohedria, Ancient Greek œÄœÅŒøŒµŒ¥œÅŒØŒ±).Plutarch, Life of Theseus 25.4‚Äì5. Another version states that Kypselos, tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BC, returned to the Games their old splendour. Solinus, Wonders of the World 7.14. If we are to accept the traditional date of the first Olympic Games (776 BC), we can say that the first Isthmian Games would have been held in 582 BC.According to Solinus, the Isthmian Games were constituted in the 49th Olympiad (Solinus, Wonders of the World 7.14). The 49th Olympiad began in 584 BC. The Olympic Games took place in July/August; the Isthmian Games in April/May of the second year of the Olympiad. The second year of the 49th Olympiad was from July/August 583 to July/August 582 BC. The date 582 BC is accepted by historically-derived documents, for instance, Der neue Pauly (under Isthmia). At least until the 5th century BC (Pindar's time) the winners of the Isthmian games received a wreath of celery;Ancient Greek œÉŒ≠ŒªŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ: Pindar, Isthmian Odes 2.16, 8.64. later, the wreath was altered such that it consisted of pine leaves.‚ÄúAt the Isthmus the pine, and at Nemea celery became the prize to commemorate the sufferings of Palaemon and Archemorus.‚Äù (Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.48.2).‚ÄúAs he was marching up an ascent, from the top of which they expected to have a view of the army and of the strength of the enemy, there met him by chance a train of mules loaded with parsley; which his soldiers conceived to be an ominous occurrence or ill- boding token, because this is the herb with which we not infrequently adorn the sepulchres of the dead; and there is a proverb derived from the custom, used of one who is dangerously sick, that he has need of nothing but parsley. So to ease their minds, and free them from any superstitious thoughts or forebodings of evil, Timoleon halted, and concluded an address suitable to the occasion, by saying, that a garland of triumph was here luckily brought them, and had fallen into their hands of its own accord, as an anticipation of victory: the same with which the Corinthians crown the victors in the Isthmian games, accounting chaplets of parsley the sacred wreath proper to their country; parsley being at that time still the emblem of victory at the Isthmian, as it is now at the Nemean sports; and it is not so very long ago that the pine first began to be used in its place.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äù (Plutarch, Life of Timoleon).Todo: Oscar Broneer, ‚ÄòThe Isthmian victory crown‚Äô, American Journal of Archaeology 66 (1962), pp.259‚Äì263. Victors could also be honored with a statuePausanias, Description of Greece 2.1.7. None of the statues have survived. or an ode. Besides these prizes of honor, the city of Athens awarded victorious Athenians with an extra 100 drachmas.From Solon (638‚Äì558 BC) onwards, for he laid it down that ‚Äúthe victor in the Isthmian games was to be paid a hundred drachmas, and the Olympic victor five hundred‚Äù (Plutarch, Live of Solon 23.3). According to Diogenes La√´rtius, Solon ‚Äúdiminished the honours paid to Athletes who were victorious in the games, fixing the prize for a victor at Olympia at five hundred drachmae, and for one who conquered at the Isthmian games at one hundred‚Äù (Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives of Philosophers 1.55: Solon ; Greek). For comparison: the daily wage for a skilled worked was approximately 1 drachma. Victors in the Isthmian games were not included in those athletes that were entitled to free meals in the [Prytaneion] (IG I3 131). History Flaminius restoring Liberty to Greece at the Isthmian Games. From 228 BC or 229 BC onwards the Romans were allowed to take part in the games.Polybius, Histories 2.12.8. The Games of 196 BC were used by Titus Quinctius Flamininus to proclaim the freedom of the Greek states from Macedonian hegemony.Polybius, Histories 18.46. Compare Appian's account: Since the games' inception, Corinth had always been in control of them. When Corinth was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC, the Isthmian games continued,Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.2.1. but were now administered by Sicyon. Corinth was rebuilt by Caesar in 44 BC.Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.1.2. Corinth recovered ownership of the Games at some point between 7 BC and AD 3.

Stadion or stade () was an ancient running event, part of the Ancient Olympic Games and the other Panhellenic Games. It was one of the five major Pentathlon events. It was the premier event of the gymnikos agon (Œ≥œÖŒºŒΩŒπŒ∫·Ω∏œÇ ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ \\"nude competition\\"). History From the years 776 to 724 BC, the stadion was the only event that took place at the Olympic Games. The victor gave his name to the entire four-year Olympiad, which has allowed scholars to know the names of nearly every ancient Olympic stadion winner. The stadion was named after the building in which it took place, also called the stadion. This word became stadium in Latin, which became the English word stadium. The race also gave its name to the unit of length, the stadion. There were other types of running events, but the stadion was the most prestigious; the winner was often considered to be the winner of an entire Games. Though a separate event, the stadion was also part of the ancient Pentathlon. At the Olympic Games, the stadion (building) was big enough for 20 competitors, and the race was a sprint, but the original stadion track in Olympia measures approximately . The race began with a trumpet blow, with officials (the ·ºÄŒ≥œâŒΩŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ±Œπ agonothetai) at the starting blocks to make sure there were no false starts. There were also officials at the end to decide on a winner and to make sure no one had cheated. If the officials decided there was a tie, the race would be re-run. Runners started the race from a standing position, probably with their arms stretched out in front of them, instead of starting in a crouch like modern runners. They ran naked on a packed earth track. By the fifth century, the track was marked by a stone- starting line, the balbis. Advancements in this stone starting block led to it having a set of double grooves ( apart) in which the runner placed his toes. The design of these grooves were intended to give the runner leverage for his start.Miller, p. 35 The winner of the stadion in the first Olympic Games was Coroebus of Elis.

Hansel and Gretel, older brother and younger sister, are young children abandoned or lost in the forest, where they fall into the hands of a cannibalistic witch living in a house made of gingerbread, cake, confection, sweets, and many other treats and pastries. The witch intends to fatten the children before eventually eating them, but Gretel outwits the witch and kills her. The two children then escape with their lives and return home with the witch's treasure. \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" is a tale of Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther type 327A. It also includes an episode of type 1121 ('Burning the Witch in Her Own Oven'). The tale has been adapted to various media, most notably the opera (1893) by Engelbert Humperdinck.  Origin  = Sources = Although Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm credited \\"various tales from Hesse\\" (the region where they lived) as their source, scholars have argued that the brothers heard the story in 1809 from the family of Wilhelm's friend and future wife, Dortchen Wild, and partly from other sources.; ; ; A handwritten note in the Grimms' personal copy of the first edition reveals that in 1813 Wild contributed to the children's verse answer to the witch, \\"The wind, the wind,/ The heavenly child,\\" which rhymes in German: \\"Der Wind, der Wind,/ Das himmlische Kind.\\" According to folklorist Jack Zipes, the tale emerged in the Late Middle Ages (1250‚Äì1500). Later, close written variants like Martin Montanus' Gartengesellschaft (1590) began to appear. Scholar Christine Goldberg argues that the episode of the paths marked with stones and crumbs, already found in the French \\"Finette Cendron\\" and \\"Hop-o'-My-Thumb\\" (1697), represents \\"an elaboration of the motif of the thread that Ariadne gives Theseus to use to get out of the Minoan labyrinth\\". A house made of confectionery is also found in a 14th-century manuscript about the Land of Cockayne. = Editions = Sculpture of Hansel on the duck by Ignatius Taschner. M√§rchenbrunnen, Berlin. From the pre- publication manuscript of 1810 (Das Br√ºderchen und das Schwesterchen) to the sixth edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen in 1850, the Brothers Grimm have made several alterations to the story, which progressively gained in length, psychological motivation, and visual imagery, but also became more Christian in tone, shifting the blame for abandonment from a mother to a stepmother associated with the witch. In the original edition of the tale, the woodcutter's wife is the children's biological mother, tr. \\"Hansel and Gretel (The Complete First Edition)\\", pp. 43‚Äì48; tr., pp. 122‚Äì126; but she was also called \\"stepmother\\" from the 4th edition (1840). The Brothers Grimm indeed introduced the word \\"stepmother\\", but retained \\"mother\\" in some passages. Even their final version in the 7th edition (1857) remains unclear about her role, for it refers to the woodcutter's wife twice as \\"the mother\\" and once as \\"the stepmother\\". The sequence where the duck helps them across the river is also a later addition. In some later versions, the mother died from unknown causes, left the family, or remained with the husband at the end of the story. In the 1810 pre-publication manuscript, the children were called \\"Little Brother\\" and \\"Little Sister\\", then named H√§nsel and Gretel in the first edition (1812). Wilhelm Grimm also adulterated the text with Alsatian dialects, \\"re- appropriated\\" from August Str√∂ber's Alsatian version (1842) in order to give the tale a more \\"folksy\\" tone. Goldberg notes that although \\"there is no doubt that the Grimms' H√§nsel und Gretel was pieced together, it was, however, pieced together from traditional elements,\\" and its previous narrators themselves had been \\"piecing this little tale together with other traditional motifs for centuries.\\" For instance, the duck helping the children cross the river may be the remnant of an old traditional motif in the folktale complex that was reintroduced by the Grimms in later editions. Plot Hansel and Gretel meeting the witch, by Alexander Zick.The story is set in medieval Germany. Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a great famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's wife (originally the children's mother but in revised editions she is their stepmother) decides to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves, so that she and her husband do not starve to death, as the children eat too much. The woodcutter opposes the plan but finally, and reluctantly, submits to his wife's scheme. They are unaware that in the children's bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them. The next day, the family walk deep into the woods and Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then they followed the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's rage. Once again provisions become scarce and the mother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there to die. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the doors locked and find it impossible to escape. Illustration by Ludwig Richter, 1842 The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs for them to follow home. However, after they are once again abandoned, they find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After days of wandering, they follow a beautiful white bird to a clearing in the woods, and discover a large cottage built of gingerbread, cakes, candy and with window panes of clear sugar. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the rooftop of the house, when the door opens and a \\"very old woman\\" emerges and lures the children inside with the promise of soft beds and delicious food. They enter without realizing that their hostess is a bloodthirsty witch who built the gingerbread house to waylay children to cook and eat them. The next morning, the witch locks Hansel in an iron cage in the garden and forces Gretel into becoming a slave. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but when she tries to touch him to see how fat he has become, Hansel cleverly offers a bone he found in the cage (presumably a bone from the witch's previous captive) and the witch feels it, thinking it to be his finger. Due to her blindness, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, \\"be he fat or lean\\". She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and asks her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what the witch means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the witch into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, and leaves \\"The ungodly witch to be burned in ashes\\". Gretel frees Hansel from the cage and the pair discover a vase full of treasure, including precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife died from some unknown cause. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.  Variants  Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie indicate that \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" belongs to a group of European tales especially popular in the Baltic regions, about children outwitting ogres into whose hands they have involuntarily fallen. = ATU 327A tales = \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" is the prototype for the fairy tales of the type Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther (ATU) 327A. In particular, Gretel's pretense of not understanding how to test the oven (\\"Show Me How\\") is characteristic of 327A, although it also appears traditionally in other sub-types of ATU 327. As argued by Stith Thompson, the simplicity of the tale may explain its spread into several traditions all over the world. A closely similar version is \\"Finette Cendron\\", published by Marie-Catherine d‚ÄôAulnoy in 1697, which depicts an impoverished king and queen deliberately losing their three daughters three times in the wilderness. The cleverest of the girls, Finette, initially manages to bring them home with a trail of thread, then a trail of ashes, but her peas are eaten by pigeons during the third journey. The little girls then go to the mansion of a hag, who lives with her husband the ogre. Finette heats the oven and asks the ogre to test it with his tongue, so that he falls in and is incinerated. Thereafter, Finette cuts off the hag's head. The sisters remain in the ogre's house, and the rest of the tale relates the story of \\"Cinderella\\". In the Russian Vasilisa the Beautiful, the stepmother likewise sends her hated stepdaughter into the forest to borrow a light from her sister, who turns out to be Baba Yaga, a cannibalistic witch. Besides highlighting the endangerment of children (as well as their own cleverness), the tales have in common a preoccupation with eating and with hurting children: The mother or stepmother wants to avoid hunger, and the witch lures children to eat her house of candy so that she can then eat them. In a variant from Flanders, The Sugar-Candy House, siblings Jan and Jannette get lost in the woods and sight a hut made of confectionary in the distance. WHen they approach, a giant wolf named Garon jumps out of the window and chases them to a river bank. Sister and brother ask a pair of ducks to help them cross the river and escape the wolf. Garon threatened the ducks to carry him over, to no avail; he then tries to cross by swimming. He sinks and surfaces three times, but disappears in the water in the fourth try. The story seems to contain the \\"child/wind\\" rhyming scheme of the German tale.Bossch√®re, Jean de. Folk tales of Flanders. New York: Dodd, Mead. 1918. pp. 91-94. In a Swedish fairy tale, La Cabane au Toit de Fromage (\\"The Hut with the Roof made of Cheese\\"), the brother is the hero who deceives the witch and locks her up in the oven.Guerber, H√©l√®ne Adeline. Contes et l√©gendes. 1ere partie. New York, Cincinnati [etc.] American book company. 1895. pp. 64-67. Other folk tales of ATU 327A type include is the French \\"The Lost Children\\", published by Antoinette Bon in 1887, or the Moravian \\"Old Grule\\", edited by Maria Kosch in 1899. = The Children and the Ogre (ATU 327) = Structural comparisons can also be made with other tales of ATU 327 type (\\"The Children and the Ogre\\"), which is not a simple fairy tale type but rather a \\"folktale complex with interconnected subdivisions\\" depicting a child (or children) falling under the power of an ogre, then escaping by their clever tricks. In ATU 327B (\\"The Brothers and the Ogre\\"), a group of siblings come to an ogre's house who intends to kill them in their beds, but the youngest of the children exchange the visitors with the ogre's offspring, and the villain kills his own children by mistake. They are chased by the ogre, but the siblings eventually manage to come back home safely. Stith Thompson points the great similarity of the tales types ATU 327A and ATU 327B that \\"it is quite impossible to disentangle the two tales\\". ATU 327C (\\"The Devil [Witch] Carries the Hero Home in a Sack\\") depicts a witch or an ogre catching a boy in a sack. As the villain's daughter is preparing to kill him, the boy asks her to show him how he should arrange himself; when she does so, he kills her. Later on, he kills the witch and goes back home with her treasure. In ATU 327D (\\"The Kiddlekaddlekar\\"), children are discovered by an ogre in his house. He intends to hang them, but the girl pretends not to understand how to do it, so the ogre hangs himself to show her. He promises his kiddlekaddlekar (a magic cart) and treasure in exchange of his liberation; they do so, but the ogre chases them. The children eventually manage to kill him and escape safely. In ATU 327F (\\"The Witch and the Fisher Boy\\"), a witch lures a boy and catch him. When the witch's daughter tries to bake the child, he pushes her in the oven. The witch then returns home and eats her own daughter. She eventually tries to fell the tree in which the boy is hiding, but birds fly away with him. = Further comparisons = The initial episode, which depicts children deliberately lost in the forest by their unloving parents, can be compared with many previous stories: Montanus's \\"The Little Earth-Cow\\" (1557), Basile's \\"Ninnillo and Nennella\\" (1635), Madame d'Aulnoy's \\"Finette Cendron\\" (1697), or Perrault's \\"Hop-o'-My-Thumb\\" (1697). The motif of the trail that fails to lead the protagonists back home is also common to \\"Ninnillo and Nennella\\", \\"Finette Cendron\\" and \\"Hop-o'-My-Thumb\\", and the Brothers Grimm identified the latter as a parallel story. Finally, ATU 327 tales share a similar structure with ATU 313 (\\"Sweetheart Roland\\", \\"The Foundling\\", \\"Okerlo\\") in that one or more protagonists (specifically children in ATU 327) come into the domain of a malevolent supernatural figure and escape from it. Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, commenting on his reconstructed proto-form of the tale (Johnnie and Grizzle), noticed the \\"contamination\\" of the tale with the story of The Master Maid, later classified as ATU 313. ATU 327A tales are also often combined with stories of ATU 450 (\\"Little Brother and Sister\\"), in which children run away from an abusive stepmother.  Analysis  According to folklorist Jack Zipes, the tale celebrates the symbolic order of the patriarchal home, seen as a haven protected from the dangerous characters that threaten the lives of children outside, while it systematically denigrates the adult female characters, which are seemingly intertwined between each other. The mother or stepmother indeed dies just after the children kill the witch, suggesting that they may metaphorically be the same woman. Zipes also argues that the importance of the tale in the European oral and literary tradition may be explained by the theme of child abandonment and abuse. Due to famines and lack of birth control, it was common in medieval Europe to abandon unwanted children in front of churches or in the forest. The death of the mother during childbirth sometimes led to tensions after remarriage, and Zipes proposes that it may have played a role in the emergence of the motif of the hostile stepmother. Linguist and folklorist Edward Vajda has proposed that these stories represent the remnant of a coming-of-age, rite-of-passage tale extant in Proto-Indo-European society. Psychologist Bruno Bettelheim argues that the main motif is about dependence, oral greed, and destructive desires that children must learn to overcome, after they arrive home \\"purged of their oral fixations\\". Others have stressed the satisfying psychological effects of the children vanquishing the witch or realizing the death of their wicked stepmother.  Cultural legacy  Staatsoper Wien 2015 =Stage and musical theater= The fairy tale enjoyed a multitude of adaptations for the stage, among them the opera H√§nsel und Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck‚Äîone of the most performed operas. It is principally based upon the Grimm's version, although it omits the deliberate abandonment of the children. A contemporary reimagining of the story, M√°tti Kovler's musical fairytale Ami & Tami, was produced in Israel and the United States and subsequently released as a symphonic album. = Literature = Several writers have drawn inspiration from the tale, such as Robert Coover in \\"The Gingerbread House\\" (Pricks and Descants, 1970), Anne Sexton in Transformations (1971), Garrison Keillor in \\"My Grandmother, My Self in Happy to Be Here\\" (1982), and Emma Donoghue in \\"A Tale of the Cottage\\" (Kissing the Witch, 1997). =Film= Elements from the story were used in the 1994 horror film Wes Craven's New Nightmare for its climax. In 2012 German Broadcaster RBB released \\"H√§nsel und Gretel\\" as part of its series Der rbb macht Familienzeit. The most recent adaption of the fairy tale is Gretel & Hansel, a 2020 American horror film directed by Oz Perkins. =Computer programming = Hansel and Gretel's trail of breadcrumbs inspired the name of the navigation element \\"breadcrumbs\\" that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.

Background and education Bryce was born in Arthur Street in Belfast, County Antrim, in Ulster, Ireland, the son of Margaret, daughter of James Young of Whiteabbey, and James Bryce, LLD, from near Coleraine, County Londonderry. The first eight years of his life were spent residing at his grandfather's Whiteabbey residence, often playing for hours on the tranquil picturesque shoreline. John Annan Bryce was his younger brother. He was educated under his uncle Reuben John Bryce at the Belfast Academy,Fisher, H. A. L. (1927) James Bryce: Viscount Bryce of Dechmont, O.M., Vol. 2, London resp. New York. p. 13 Glasgow High School, the University of Glasgow, the University of Heidelberg and Trinity College, Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1862 and was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, in 1867. His days as a student at the University of Heidelberg gave him a long-life admiration of German historical and legal scholarship. He became a believer in \\"Teutonic freedom\\", an ill-defined concept that was held to bind the German Empire, Britain and the United States together. For him, the United States, the British Empire and Germany were \\"natural friends\\". Academic career Bryce was admitted to the Bar and practised law in London for a few years but was soon called back to Oxford to become Regius Professor of Civil Law, a position he held from 1870 to 1893. From 1870 to 1875 he was also Professor of Jurisprudence at Owens College, Manchester. His reputation as an historian had been made as early as 1864 by his work on the Holy Roman Empire. In 1872 Bryce travelled to Iceland to see the land of the Icelandic sagas, as he was a great admirer of Nj√°ls saga. In 1876 he ventured through the Russian empire to Mount Ararat, climbed above the tree line and found a piece of hand-hewn timber, long and thick. He agreed that the evidence fit the Armenian Church's belief that it was from Noah's Ark and offered no other explanations.James Bryce In 1872 Bryce, a proponent of higher education, particularly for women, joined the Central Committee of the National Union for Improving the Education of Women of All Classes (NUIEWC). Member of Parliament James Bryce c1895 The Rt. Hon. James Bryce and Prof. Goldwin Smith 1907. In 1880 Bryce, an ardent Liberal in politics, was elected to the House of Commons as member for the constituency of Tower Hamlets in London. In 1885 he was returned for South Aberdeen and he was re-elected there on succeeding occasions. He remained a Member of Parliament until 1907. Bryce's intellectual distinction and political industry made him a valuable member of the Liberal Party. As early as the late 1860s he served as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education. In 1885 he was made Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under William Ewart Gladstone but had to leave office after the Liberals were defeated in the general election later that year. In 1892 he joined Gladstone's last cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. In 1894 Bryce was appointed President of the Board of Trade in the new cabinet of Lord Rosebery, but had to leave this office, along with the whole Liberal cabinet, the following year. The Liberals remained out of office for the next ten years. In 1897, after a visit to South Africa, Bryce published a volume of Impressions of that country that had considerable influence in Liberal circles when the Second Boer War was being discussed. He devoted significant sections of the book to the recent history of South Africa, various social and economic details about the country, and his experiences while travelling with his party. The \\"still radical\\" Bryce was made Chief Secretary for Ireland in Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman's cabinet in 1905 and remained in office throughout 1906. Bryce was critical of many of the social reforms proposed by this Liberal Government, including old-age pensions, the Trade Disputes Act and the redistributive \\"People's Budget,\\" which he regarded as making unwarranted concessions to socialism. Ambassador to the United States 1911 - The Right Hon. James Bryce (far left) beside Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn the Governor-General of Canada (also wearing top hat) In February 1907 Bryce was appointed British Ambassador to the United States. He held this office until 1913, and was very efficient in strengthening Anglo-American ties and friendship. He made many personal friends among American politicians, such as President Theodore Roosevelt. The German ambassador in Washington, Graf Heinrich von Bernstorff, later stated how relieved he felt that Bryce was not his competitor for American sympathies during the First World War, even though Bernstorff helped to keep the United States from declaring war until 1917. Robert Baden-Powell, William Taft and James Bryce at the White House in 1912 Bryce quickly became well known in America for his book The American Commonwealth (1888), a thorough examination of the institutions of the United States from the point of view of a historian and constitutional lawyer. Bryce painstakingly reproduced the travels of Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote Democracy in America (1835‚Äì1840). Tocqueville had emphasised the egalitarianism of early-19th-century America, but Bryce was dismayed to find vast inequality: \\"Sixty years ago, there were no great fortunes in America, few large fortunes, no poverty. Now there is some poverty ... and a greater number of gigantic fortunes than in any other country of the world\\" and \\"As respects education ... the profusion of‚Ä¶elementary schools tends to raise the mass to a higher point than in Europe ... [but] there is an increasing class that has studied at the best universities. It appears that equality has diminished [in this regard] and will diminish further.\\"James, Viscount Bryce, The American Commonwealth, p. 746 The work was heavily used in academia, partly as a result of Bryce's close friendships with men such as James B. Angell, President of the University of Michigan and successively Charles W. Eliot and Abbott Lawrence Lowell at Harvard. The work also became a key medium for certain Americans to popularise a view of American history as distinctively Anglo-Saxon. Peerage In 1914, after his retirement as Ambassador and his return to Britain, Bryce was raised to the peerage as Viscount Bryce of Dechmount in the County of Lanark. Thus he became a member of the House of Lords, the powers of which had been curtailed by the Parliament Act 1911. The First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War Bryce was commissioned by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to write what became known as The Bryce Report, in which he described German atrocities in Belgium. The report was published in 1915 and was damning of German behaviour against civilians.Keith G. Robbins, \\"Lord Bryce and the First World War.\\" Historical Journal 10#2 (1967): 255-78. online. Bryce's account was confirmed by Vernon Lyman Kellogg, then Director of the American Commission for Relief in Belgium, who told the New York Times that the German military had enslaved hundreds of thousands of Belgian workers, and abused and maimed many of them in the process. Bryce strongly condemned the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, mainly in the year 1915. Bryce was the first person to speak on the subject in the House of Lords, in July 1915. Later, with the assistance of the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, he produced a documentary record of the massacres, published as a Blue Book by the British government in 1916. In 1921 Bryce wrote that the Armenian genocide had also claimed half of the population of Assyrians in the Ottoman Empire and similar cruelties were perpetrated upon them.Travis, Hannibal. \\"Genocide in the Middle East: The Ottoman Empire, Iraq, and Sudan.\\" Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2010, 2007, pp. 237‚Äì77, 293‚Äì294.Travis, Hannibal. \\"'Native Christians Massacred': The Ottoman Genocide of the Assyrians During World War I .\\" Genocide Studies and Prevention, Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2006, pp. 327‚Äì371. Retrieved 2 February 2010. Later life During the last years of his life Bryce served as a judge at the International Court in The Hague, supported the establishment of the League of Nations and published a book, Modern Democracy (1921), in which he was rather critical of post-war democracy. Honours and other public appointments Bryce received numerous academic honours from home and foreign universities. In September 1901, he received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College, and in October 1902 he received an honorary degree (LLD) from the University of St Andrews. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1894. In earlier life, he was a notable mountain climber, ascending Mount Ararat in 1876, and published a volume on Transcaucasia and Ararat in 1877; in 1899 to 1901, he was the president of the Alpine Club. From his Caucasian journey, he brought back a deep distrust of Ottoman rule in Asia Minor and a distinct sympathy for the Armenian people.On Bryce‚Ä≤s engagement with the Armenian question before the genocide, see Oded Steinberg, James Bryce and the Origins of the Armenian Question, Journal of Levantine Studies 5, No 2 (Winter 2015), p. 13‚Äì33. In 1882, Bryce established the National Liberal Club, whose members, in its first three decades, included fellow founder Prime Minister Gladstone, George Bernard Shaw, David Lloyd George, H. H. Asquith and many other prominent Liberal candidates and MP's such as Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. In April 1882 Bryce was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1907, he was made a Member of the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the King's death, Bryce arranged his Washington Memorial Service. At the time of Bryce's memorial service at Westminster Abbey, his wife, Elizabeth, received condolences from King George V, who \\"regarded Lord Bryce as an old friend and trusted counsellor to whom I could always turn.\\" Queen Victoria had said that Bryce was \\"one of the best informed men on all subjects I have ever met\\". From 1907 through 1908, Bryce served as the president of the American Political Science Association. He was the fourth person to hold this office.http://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/Leadership- Governance/APSA-Presidents-1903-to-PresentHe was president of the British Academy from 1913 to 1917. In 2013, the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque dedicated to him, near his birthplace in Belfast. Personal life Memorial to Viscount Bryce, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh Bryce married Elizabeth Marion, daughter of Thomas Ashton and sister of Lord Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde, in 1889. They had no children. Bryce died on 22 January 1922, aged 83, in Sidmouth, Devon, on the last of his lifelong travels. The viscountcy died with him. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. There is a large monument to Viscount Bryce in the southwest section of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh, facing north at the west end of the central east‚Äìwest avenue. It is presumed that his ashes are buried there. There is a bust of Viscount Bryce in Trinity Church on Broadway, near Wall Street. A similar bust is in the U.S. Capitol Building and there is a commemorative Bryce Park in Washington DC. Lady Bryce died in December 1939 and is buried under the Bryce monument in Edinburgh. In 1965 the James Bryce Chair of Government was endowed at the University of Glasgow. \\"Government\\" was changed to \\"Politics\\" in 1970.

Server farms often consist of thousands of computers which require a large amount of power to run and to keep cool. At the optimum performance level, a server farm has enormous costs (both financial and environmental) associated with it. Server farms often have backup servers, which can take over the function of primary servers in the event of a primary-server failure. Server farms are typically collocated with the network switches and/or routers which enable communication between the different parts of the cluster and the users of the cluster. Server farmers typically mount the computers, routers, power supplies, and related electronics on 19-inch racks in a server room or data center. Applications Server farms are commonly used for cluster computing. Many modern supercomputers comprise giant server farms of high-speed processors connected by either Gigabit Ethernet or custom interconnects such as Infiniband or Myrinet. Web hosting is a common use of a server farm; such a system is sometimes collectively referred to as a web farm. Other uses of server farms include scientific simulations (such as computational fluid dynamics) and the rendering of 3D computer generated imagery (see render farm). Server farms are increasingly being used instead of or in addition to mainframe computers by large enterprises, although server farms do not yet reach the same reliability levels as mainframes. Because of the sheer number of computers in large server farms, the failure of an individual machine is a commonplace event, and the management of large server farms needs to take this into account by providing support for redundancy, automatic failover, and rapid reconfiguration of the server cluster. Performance The performance of the largest server farms (thousands of processors and up) is typically limited by the performance of the data center's cooling systems and the total electricity cost rather than by the performance of the processors. Computers in server farms run 24/7 and consume large amounts of electricity, and for this reason, the critical design parameter for both large and continuous systems tends to be performance per watt rather than cost of peak performance or (peak performance / (unit * initial cost)). Also, for high availability systems that must run 24/7 (unlike supercomputers that can be power-cycled to demand, and also tend to run at much higher utilizations), there is more attention placed on power saving features such as variable clock-speed and the ability to turn off both computer parts, processor parts, and entire computers (WoL and virtualization) according to demand without bringing down services. The network connecting the servers in a server farm is also an essential factor in the overall performance especially when running applications that process massive volumes of data. =Performance per watt= The EEMBC EnergyBench, SPECpower, and the Transaction Processing Performance Council TPC-Energy are benchmarks designed to predict performance per watt in a server farm. The power used by each rack of equipment can be measured at the power distribution unit. Some servers include power tracking hardware so the people running the server farm can measure the power used by each server. The power used by the entire server farm may be reported in terms of power usage effectiveness or data center infrastructure efficiency. According to some estimates, for every 100 watts spent on running the servers, roughly another 50 watts is needed to cool them. For this reason, the siting of a Server Farm can be as important as processor selection in achieving power efficiency. Iceland, which has a cold climate all year as well as cheap and carbon-neutral geothermal electricity supply, is building its first major server farm hosting site. Fibre optic cables are being laid from Iceland to North America and Europe to enable companies there to locate their servers in Iceland. Other countries with favorable conditions, such as Canada, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, are trying to attract cloud computing data centers. In these countries, heat from the servers can be cheaply vented or used to help heat buildings, thus reducing the energy consumption of conventional heaters.

He worked for The New Republic from 1995 to 1998, where he served as an associate editor, until it was revealed that many of his published articles were fabrications. An internal investigation by The New Republic determined that the majority of stories he wrote either contained false information or were entirely fictional. Glass later acknowledged that he had repaid over $200,000 to The New Republic and other publications for his earlier fabrications.Discredited journalist Stephen Glass reveals $200,000 repayments to 4 magazines - The Chronicle Following the journalism scandal, Glass pursued a career in law. Although he earned a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center and passed the bar exam in New York and California, he was unable to become a licensed attorney in either state over concerns derived from his scandal. Glass instead found work as a paralegal at the law firm Carpenter, Zuckerman & Rowley, serving as the director of special projects and trial team coordinator. Glass made a brief return to writing when he fictionalized his own story in his 2003 novel The Fabulist. The same year, the scandal was dramatized in the film Shattered Glass, which was based on a Vanity Fair article of the same name and starred Hayden Christensen as Glass. Personal life and education Glass grew up in a Jewish family in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, and attended Highland Park High School.Handbook of Frauds, Scams, and Swindles: Failures of Ethics in Leadership - Google Books He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania as University Scholar, where he was an executive editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian. His colleagues at The Daily Pennsylvanian included Sabrina Erdely who later also became involved in a fabricated story scandal owing to her Rolling Stone article \\"A Rape on Campus\\".The Pennsylvania Gazette: Through a Glass Darkly (2/4) Glass later graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center with a Juris Doctor degree and was named John M. Olin Fellow in law and economics. He was married to lawyer and author Julie Hilden, who died in 2018.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=188512424 The New Republic After his 1994 graduation from Penn, Glass joined The New Republic in 1995 as an editorial assistant. Soon thereafter, the 23-year-old Glass advanced to writing features. While employed full-time at TNR, he also wrote for other magazines including Policy Review, George, Rolling Stone, and Harper's and contributed to Public Radio International's (PRI) weekly hour- long program This American Life, hosted by Ira Glass (no relation to Stephen). Although Glass enjoyed loyalty from The New Republic staff, his reporting repeatedly drew outraged rebuttals from the subjects of his articles, eroding his credibility and leading to private skepticism from insiders at the magazine. The magazine's majority owner and editor-in-chief, Martin Peretz, later said that his wife had told him that she did not find Glass's stories credible and had stopped reading them. In December 1996, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) was the target of a hostile article by Glass called \\"Hazardous to Your Mental Health.\\" CSPI wrote a letter to the editor and issued a press release pointing out numerous inaccuracies and distortions, and hinting at possible plagiarism. The organization Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) accused Glass of falsehoods in his March 1997 article \\"Don't You D.A.R.E.\\" In May 1997, Joe Galli of the College Republican National Committee accused Glass of fabrications in \\"Spring Breakdown\\", his lurid tale of drinking and debauchery at the 1997 Conservative Political Action Conference. A June 1997 article called \\"Peddling Poppy\\" about a Hofstra University conference on George H. W. Bush drew a letter from Hofstra reciting errors in the story. The New Republic defended Glass and editor Michael Kelly demanded CSPI apologize to him. On May 18, 1998 The New Republic published a story by Glass (by then an associate editor) entitled \\"Hack Heaven,\\" purportedly telling the story of a 15-year-old hacker who had penetrated a company's computer network, then been hired by that company as a security consultant. The article opened as follows: Adam Penenberg, a reporter with Forbes magazine, became suspicious when he found zero search engine results for \\"Jukt Micronics,\\" found that \\"Jukt Micronics\\" had just a single phone line, and saw that its website was extremely amateurish. Challenged, Glass claimed to have been duped by \\"Restil.\\" Glass took Charles Lane, then lead editor of The New Republic, to the Bethesda, Maryland hotel at which Restil had purportedly met with the Jukt executives; Lane discovered that on the day of the claimed meeting the hotel's conference room had been closed and the restaurant where the hackers supposedly ate dinner afterwards closes in the early afternoon. Lane dialed a Palo Alto number provided by Glass and spoke with a man who identified himself as a Jukt executive; however, when he realized that the \\"executive\\" was actually Glass' brother, who attended Stanford University in Palo Alto, he fired Glass. Lane later said: =Aftermath= The New Republic subsequently determined that at least 27 of the 41 articles Glass wrote for the magazine contained fabricated material. Some of the 27, such as \\"Don't You D.A.R.E.\\", contained real reporting interwoven with fabricated quotations and incidents, while others, including \\"Hack Heaven,\\" were completely made up. In the process of creating the \\"Hack Heaven\\" article, Glass had gone to especially elaborate lengths to thwart the discovery of his deception by TNRs fact checkers: creating a website and voice mail account for Jukt Micronics; fabricating notes of story gathering; having fake business cards printed; and even composing editions of a fake computer hacker community newsletter. As for the balance of the 41 stories, Lane, in an interview given for the 2005 DVD edition of Shattered Glass, said, \\"In fact, I'd bet lots of the stuff in those other 14 is fake too. ... It's not like we're vouching for those 14, that they're true. They're probably not either.\\" Rolling Stone, George, and Harper's also re-examined his contributions. Rolling Stone and Harper's found the material generally accurate yet maintained they had no way of verifying information because Glass had cited anonymous sources. George discovered that at least three of the stories Glass wrote for it contained fabrications. Specifically, Glass fabricated quotations in a profile piece and apologized to the article's subject, Vernon Jordan, an adviser to then-President Bill Clinton. A court filing for Glass's application to the California bar gave an updated count on his journalism career: 36 of his stories at The New Republic were said to be fabricated in part or in whole, along with three articles for George, two articles for Rolling Stone, and one for Policy Review. Glass had contributed a story to an October 1997 episode of the NPR program This American Life about an internship at George Washington's former plantation, and another to a December 1997 episode about time he spent as a telephone psychic. The program subsequently removed both segments from the Archives section of its website \\"because of questions about [their] truthfulness\\". Later work After journalism, Glass earned a J.D. degree at Georgetown University Law Center. He then passed the New York State bar examination in 2000, but the Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him on its moral fitness test, citing ethics concerns related to his journalistic malpractice. He later abandoned his efforts to be admitted to the bar in New York. In 2003, Glass published a so-called \\"biographical novel\\", The Fabulist. Glass sat for an interview with the weekly news program 60 Minutes timed to coincide with the release of his book. The New Republic literary editor, Leon Wieseltier, complained, \\"The creep is doing it again. Even when it comes to reckoning with his own sins, he is still incapable of nonfiction. The careerism of his repentance is repulsively consistent with the careerism of his crimes.\\" One reviewer of The Fabulist commented, \\"The irony‚Äîwe must have irony in a tale this tawdry‚Äîis that Mr. Glass is abundantly talented. He's funny and fluent and daring. In a parallel universe, I could imagine him becoming a perfectly respectable novelist‚Äîa prize-winner, perhaps, with a bit of luck.\\" Also in 2003, Glass briefly returned to journalism, writing an article about Canadian marijuana laws for Rolling Stone. On November 7, 2003, Glass participated in a panel discussion on journalistic ethics at George Washington University, along with the editor who had hired him at The New Republic, Andrew Sullivan, who accused Glass of being a \\"serial liar\\" who was using \\"contrition as a career move.\\" A film about the scandal, Shattered Glass, was released in October 2003 and depicted a stylized view of Glass's rise and fall at The New Republic. Written and directed by Billy Ray, it starred Hayden Christensen as Glass, alongside Peter Sarsgaard as Charles Lane, Hank Azaria as Michael Kelly, and Steve Zahn as Adam Penenberg. The film, appearing shortly after The New York Times suffered a similar plagiarism scandal with the discovery of Jayson Blair's fabrications, occasioned critiques of the journalism industry itself by nationally prominent journalists such as Frank Rich and Mark Bowden. Glass was out of the public eye for several years following the release of his novel and the film. In 2007, he was performing with a Los Angeles comedy troupe known as Un-Cabaret, having earlier found employment at a small law firm, apparently as a paralegal. In 2015, Glass again made the news after reportedly sending Harper's Magazine a check for $10,000 ‚Äì what he was paid for the false articles ‚Äì writing in the attached letter that he wanted \\"to make right that part of my many transgressions...I recognize that repaying Harper's will not remedy my wrongdoing, make us even, or undo what I did wrong. That said, I did not deserve the money that Harper's paid me and it should be returned.\\" Unsuccessful California Bar application In 2009, Glass applied to join the State Bar of California. The Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him, finding that he did not satisfy California's moral fitness test because of his history of journalistic deception. Insisting that he had reformed, Glass then petitioned the State Bar Court's hearing department, which found that Glass possessed the necessary \\"good moral character\\" to be admitted as an attorney. The Committee of Bar Examiners sought review in the State Bar's Review Department and filed a Writ of Review, thereby petitioning the California Supreme Court to review the decision. On November 16, 2011, the Supreme Court granted the petition, the first time in 11 years the court had granted review in a moral character case. On January 3, 2012, Glass's attorneys filed papers with the Court arguing that his behavior had been irreproachable for more than 13 years and this was proof that he had reformed. On November 6, 2013, the California Supreme Court heard arguments in Glass's case and ruled unanimously against him in an opinion issued January 27, 2014. The lengthy opinion describes in minute detail the applicant's history, record, the bar's applicable standard of review, the appeal, and its own analysis of how Glass failed to satisfy the court's standards, concluding, \\"On this record, he has not sustained his heavy burden of demonstrating rehabilitation and fitness for the practice of law.\\" Based on this decision, Glass was barred from practicing law in the State of California.

The positioning of a brand is influenced by customer perceptions rather than by those of businesses. For example, a business may feel it sells upmarket products of high quality, but if customers view the products as low quality, it is their views which will influence sales. Typically the position of a company's product, product line, or brand is displayed relative to their competition.Mccarthy, E. J., Mcguiggan, I. R., Perreault, D. W., & Quester, G. P. (2007). Marketing: Creating and delivering value. Australia, Sydney: McGraw-Hill Perceptual maps, also known as market maps, usually have two dimensions but can be multi-dimensional; they can be used to identify gaps in the market and potential partners or merger targets as well as to clarify perceptual problems with a company's product. So, if a business wants to find out where its brand is positioned in the market, it might carry out market research. This will help them to find out how the customers sees their brand in relation to others in the market.  Uses  Perceptual mapping enables companies to better understand their customers: the who, why, where, how and what of their behaviour. If a business is perceived in a manner they find unsatisfactory, further research then identifies what can be done to change that. Perceptual mapping also allows businesses to see what consumers think of other brands, particularly their competitors. Regular uses of the maps can help track preferences, and see changes as they happen. Perceptual mapping can help define market segments, showing clusters of businesses differentiated by key aspects (such as higher class or number of restaurants). Within the clusters found in perceptual maps of entire industries, a business can classify potential partners or possible businesses to merge with, since the clustering of brands signifies the similarity in businesses, meaning they have corresponding attributes. It can also help identify gaps in a market where a new product or service could be introduced. Perceptual maps can also be used to help keep track of how a new product, such as a recently introduced smartphone, is being viewed in a specific market. It is important to see that the way a business is marketing its product is not only successful, but successful in a manner that aligns with the business‚Äôs overarching goal for positioning. Some companies seem to have fallen out of favor with the public, such as Quicken Loans and VW. Perceptual mapping can help elicit the extent of the damage.  Limitations  There are many limitations to perceptual mapping. The largest is the number of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account other relevant variables such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.  Examples  Perceptual maps can have any number of dimensions but the most common is two dimensions. The first perceptual map below shows consumer perceptions of various automobiles on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/affordable. This sample of consumers felt Porsche was the sportiest and classiest of the cars in the study (top right corner). They felt Plymouth was most practical and conservative (bottom left corner). Perceptual map of competing products Cars that are positioned close to each other are seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by the consumer. For example, consumers see Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar. They are close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of a new model will look for an area on the map free from competitors. Some perceptual maps use different-sized circles to indicate the sales volume or market share of the various competing products. Displaying consumers‚Äô perceptions of related products is only half the story. Many perceptual maps also display consumers‚Äô ideal points. These points reflect ideal combinations of the two dimensions as seen by a consumer. The next diagram shows a study of consumers‚Äô ideal points in the alcohol/spirits product space. Each dot represents one respondent's ideal combination of the two dimensions. Areas where there is a cluster of ideal points (such as A) indicate a market segment. Areas without ideal points are sometimes referred to as demand voids. Perceptual map of ideal points and clusters A company considering introducing a new product will look for areas with a high density of ideal points. They will also look for areas without competitive rivals. This is best done by placing both the ideal points and the competing products on the same map. Some maps plot ideal vectors instead of ideal points. The map below displays various aspirin products as seen on the dimensions of effectiveness and gentleness. It also shows two ideal vectors. The slope of the ideal vector indicates the ratio of the two dimensions preferred by those consumers within that segment. This study indicates that there is one segment that is more concerned with effectiveness than harshness, and another segment that is more interested in gentleness than strength. Perceptual map of competing products with ideal vectors  Other types of mapping  = Spidergrams = Spidergrams are an alternative to perceptual mapping that similarly are visual marketing tools; however, spidergrams also request customers to rate attributes. = Multidimensional perceptual maps = Example of a multi-dimensional perceptual map Traditional perceptual maps are built with two visual dimensions (X- and Y-axis). Multidimensional perceptual maps are built with more dimensions visualised as profile charts in small map regions, and then items are mapped to the regions by their similarity to the vectors that represent the region. A common technique to construct this kind of multidimensional perceptual maps is the self-organizing map. This helps pinpoint more variables, allowing for more in-depth research into what influences the consumer. This means that the perceptual map can be applied beyond low-involvement purchases, and also helps with identification of segments in a market. = Intuitive maps = Perceptual maps need not come from a detailed study. There are also intuitive maps (also called judgmental maps or consensus maps) that are created by marketers based on their understanding of their industry. These are limited by not being based on consumer data. When detailed marketing research studies are done methodological problems can arise, but at least the information is coming directly from the consumer. An assortment of statistical procedures can be used to convert the raw data collected in a survey into a perceptual map. Preference regression will produce ideal vectors. Multi dimensional scaling will produce either ideal points or competitor positions. Factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis and logit analysis can also be used. Some techniques are constructed from perceived differences between products, others from perceived similarities, and still others from cross price elasticity of demand data from electronic scanners. Modern techniques Marketers can reveal shoppers' collective perceptual map with increasing precision and detail by aggregating and analysing their data; this is done, for example, in the smartphone and laptop industries. Furthermore, they can be used in non-commercial applications, such as identifying factors involved in dangerous driving.

Sastrugi, or zastrugi, are features formed by erosion of snow by wind. They are found in polar regions, and in snowy, wind-swept areas of temperate regions, such as frozen lakes or mountain ridges. Sastrugi are distinguished by upwind-facing points, resembling anvils, which move downwind as the surface erodes. These points usually lie along ridges perpendicular to the prevailing wind; they are steep on the windward side and sloping to the leeward side. Smaller irregularities of this type are known as ripples (small, ~10 mm high) or wind ridges. Large sastrugi are troublesome to skiers and snowboarders. Traveling on the irregular surface of sastrugi can be very tiring, and can risk breaking equipment‚Äîripples and waves are often undercut and the surface is hard and unforgiving, with constant minor topographic changes between ridge and trough.  Etymology  The words sastrugi and zastrugi are Russian- language plurals; the singular is zastruga. The form sastruga started as the German-language transliteration of the Russian word –∑–∞—Å—Ç—Ä—É–≥–∞ (plural: –∑–∞—Å—Ç—Ä—É–≥–∏).C. Fitzhugh Talman: The singular of ‚Äúsastrugi‚Äù, Monthly Weather Review 43, February 1915, p. 85‚Äì86 A Latin-type analogical singular sastrugus is used in various writings on exploration of the South Pole, including Robert Falcon Scott's expedition's diaries and Ernest Shackleton's The Heart of the Antarctic.  Formation mechanism  Large sastrugi seen in radar image around the south edge (left side) of Lake Vostok in Antarctica (RADARSAT, NASA). White and black colors on sastrugi are not lights and shadows, they demonstrate difference in radioreflectivity of snow deposits on the windward and leeward sides of a sastruga. Under the action of steady wind, free snow particles accumulate and drift like the sand grains in barchan dunes, and the resulting drifting snow shapes are also popularly referred to as barchans. Inuit of Canada call them kalutoqaniq. When winds slacken, the drifted formations consolidate via sublimation and recrystallization. Subsequent winds erode kalutoqaniq into the sculptured forms of sastrugi. Inuit call large sculpturings kaioqlaq and small ripples tumarinyiq. Further erosion may turn kaioqlaq back into drifting kalutoqaniq. An intermediate stage of erosion is mapsuk, an overhanging shape. On the windward side of a ridge, the base erodes faster than the top, producing a shape like an anvil tip pointing upwind.Wonders, William C., Canada's changing North, Mcgill Queens Univ Press, 2003 p. 40  On sea ice  Sastrugi are more likely to form on first-year sea ice than on multiyear ice. First-year ice is smoother than multiyear ice, which allows the wind to pass uniformly over the surface without topographic obstructions. Except during the melt season, snow is dry and light in climates cold enough for sea ice, allowing the snow to be easily blown and create sastrugi parallel to the wind direction. The locations of sastrugi are fixed by March in the northern hemisphere and may be linked to the formation of melt ponds. Melt ponds are more likely to form in the depressions between sastrugi on first-year ice.

The film stars Anne Parillaud as the title character, a teen who robs a pharmacy and murders a policeman. She is sentenced to life in prison, where her captors fake her death, and she is given the choice of becoming an assassin, or being killed. After intense training, she becomes a talented killer. Her career as an assassin goes well until a mission in an embassy goes awry. Plot Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is a nihilistic teenage junkie who commits her life to anarchy, drugs and violence. One night, she participates in the robbery of a pharmacy owned by a friend's parents. The robbery goes awry, erupting into a gunfight with local police, during which her accomplices are killed. Suffering severe withdrawal symptoms, she murders a GIGN officer. Nikita is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder and is sentenced to life in prison. In prison, her captors fake her death, making it appear that she has committed suicide via a tranquilizer overdose. She awakens in a nondescript room, where a well- dressed but hard-looking man named Bob (Tch√©ky Karyo) tells her that, although officially dead and buried, she is in the custody of a shadowy government agency known as \\"the Centre\\" (possibly part of the DGSE). She is given the choice of becoming an assassin, or of actually occupying \\"row 8, plot 30\\", her fake grave.as per the original French version/English subtitles After some resistance, she chooses the former and gradually proves to be a talented killer. She is taught computer skills, martial arts, and firearms. One of her trainers, Amande (Jeanne Moreau), transforms her from a degenerate drug addict to a beautiful femme fatale. Amande implies that she was also rescued and trained by the Centre. Her initial mission, killing a foreign diplomat in a crowded restaurant and escaping back to the Centre from his well-armed bodyguards, doubles as the final test in her training. She graduates and begins life as a sleeper agent in Paris (under the name Marie). She meets Marco (Jean-Hugues Anglade) in a supermarket and the two develop an intimate relationship although he knows nothing of her real profession. Marco is curious about her past and why she has no family or other friends. Nikita then invites Bob to dinner as \\"Uncle Bob\\". Bob tells stories about \\"Marie\\"'s imaginary childhood, then giving the couple tickets for a trip to Venice, purportedly as an engagement gift. Nikita and Marco go on the trip and during their preparation to make love, the phone rings. She thinks it's the room service they just ordered, but it is instructions for her next job. As her room is, not surprisingly, perfectly located to take aim at the target, she goes to the bathroom window, supposedly to take a bath, and as she prepares the rifle, Marco is attempting to talk to her through the door. The instructions on whom to shoot take longer than expected and she can't answer him. She finally gets the instructions and takes out her target. She is barely able to conceal the rifle before Marco walks in, against her wishes. By then, she is distraught because she has ignored and hurt him due to her job. Still, her career as an assassin goes well until a document-theft mission in an embassy goes awry. The Centre sends in Victor \\"The Cleaner\\" (Jean Reno), a ruthless operative, to salvage the mission and destroy all the evidence of the foul-up. When one of the operatives turns on Victor and is killed by him, Nikita is forced to take his place. They make it most of the way through the mission when it goes bad. The gate is closed and Victor takes on a bunch of guards before being fatally wounded, but drives them to safety before succumbing to his wounds. Marco reveals that he has discovered Nikita's secret life, and, concerned over how her activities are affecting her psychologically, persuades her to disappear. Upon discovering that she abandoned the Centre, Bob goes to their apartment where he meets with Marco. Bob says she can't be out of danger because she still has the documents, after which Marco hands them over. They agree that they will both miss her. Cast Anne Parillaud stars as Nikita, a young female assassin * Anne Parillaud as Nikita * Jean-Hugues Anglade as Marco * Tch√©ky Karyo as Bob * Jeanne Moreau as Amande * Jean Reno as Victor \\"The Cleaner\\" * Jacques Boudet as The Chemist * Philippe Leroy as Grossman Production Based on the success of Le Grand Bleu, Gaumont agreed to finance Nikita without even having seen a script. Nikita cost 39 million francs to make, and was a co-production between Besson's own company Les Films du Loup, Gaumont, and Cecchi Gori Group Tiger Cinematographica. Release Nikita premiered in Paris at the Grand Rex on 21 February 1990. On its first week in Paris, the film had 113,900 spectators. By the year 2000, the film had 828,867 spectators in Paris. Following the premiere, the film went on tour in France to 15 towns with Besson to promote it and enter discussion with the audience after the screenings. Other cast and crew members on the tour included √âric Serra, Anne Parillaud, Jean-Hugues Anglade and occasionally Tch√©ky Karyo. The film had 3,787,845 spectators in France by 2000. It was the fourth highest-grossing film in France for 1990, but was not as popular as Besson's previous film The Big Blue (1988). After Nikita's release in France, it was released in over 95 countries. Gaumont handled the sales of distribution rights separately, distribution rights were sold to Columbia Pictures and the remake rights were sold to Warner Bros.. Nikita was shown in Montreal, Canada in 1990. The film was very popular in Montreal, where distributor Didier Farre noted that the film was only beaten by Bird on a Wire and Back to the Future Part III in June 1990. In Britain, the film became the highest weekly box office ever for a French film and was also popular in the box office in Italy and Japan. It was released in the United States in 1991. The film had a six-month theatrical run in the United States where it reached an audience of 1.15 million. By the end of the year, the film was the third highest grossing French film production in the United States. Besson felt that the film was inappropriately promoted in the United States, proposing that \\"Nikita is an action film but was released in American art houses. The Big Blue has the same problem, released in the United States as an intellectual work, and attracting the wrong audience.\\" Reception In France, the popular press reception to the film was mixed. Monthly film journals were more favourable while the more serious journals were predominantly negative. Reviews from Le Nouvel Observateur, Lib√©ration, Le Figaro and Le Journal du Dimanche gave the film positive reviews, where they all appreciated Besson's film noir styled film and were surprised at Parillaud's acting in a demanding role. In contrast the film was dismissed in reviews from L'Humanit√©, L'√©v√©nement du jeudi, Le Monde, Le Parisien, and La Croix who found the film resembled a commercial advertisement visually and psychologically had the depth of a comic strip. Speaking of the film's critical reception in France, Besson noted he would not talk to the press, stating that he would want to \\"count on them to help me, to help me evaluate my own work\\", and that the \\"critics should be looking towards the future, but in France, all they want to talk about is the past.\\" Besson went on to state: \\"I don't have much belief in the sincerity of critics, I believe in the sincerity of someone who goes to a film, pays his ticket and comes out saying what he thinks because he has nothing to gain by doing so. The critics defend an ideology, their age, their profession, a lot of things that don't interest me.\\" Paris Critic Marc Esposito of Studio responded to Besson statements, describing Besson as someone who \\"thinks he's a nice guy, and everyone around him is evil. We are all guilty of not adoring Luc Besson.\\" The film received mixed reviews outside France. On Metacritic, the overall score from 14 critics is 56 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". However, on Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 46 reviews. A number of critics, including Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, positively reviewed the film. =Accolades= The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Parillaud won the C√©sar Award for Best Actress and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress in 1991. Aftermath and influence When asked about a follow-up to Nikita, Anne Parillaud spoke about being approached for a sequel, noting her lack of interest stating: \\"If the film was a failure, would you have had anything more to say about her? No. Of course not.\\" =Remake= La Femme Nikita was remade in Hong Kong as the action film Black Cat directed by Stephen Shin in 1991. It was remade again in Hollywood as Point of No Return by John Badham in 1993. This was part of a trend for Hollywood to remake French films in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Daily Variety noted that between 1987 and 1993, Hollywood remade seventeen contemporary French films, all of them released in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The remakes were generally initiated by the French films and often make more money for their directors as an American adaptation than they do as original films in France. =TV series= A TV series based on the film, titled La Femme Nikita, premiered in 1997. It was produced in Canada by Fireworks Entertainment. The developer Joel Surnow, who described himself as \\"devotee of Besson's film\\", has repeatedly stated in interviews that the series is modelled explicitly after the Besson's film and not the American remake, declaring that he had never seen Point of No Return. The premiere episode of the series borrows scenes from Besson's film, with Variety noting that it was a scene-by-scene re-creation of the kitchen restaurant scene. Several lead roles in the series parallel those of the film, with Roy Dupuis as Nikita's trainer Michael, who was called Bob in Besson's film, and Alberta Watson as Madeline, who was similar to a character played by Jeanne Moreau in Besson's version. In 2010, the CW network picked up a new series, Nikita, with Maggie Q as a Nikita who has gone rogue. = Influences = Other films that La Femme Nikita has influenced include The Villainess, a South Korean film from 2017.

The exact years of her birth and death are unclear; a traditional year quoted for her death is 26 October 1252; it is also considered, though, that this was the date of her burial, and that she had actually died in 1251. Biography According to Olaus Petri, she was the daughter of Sune Sik. She was married to Magnus Minnesk√∂ld of Bjelbo, possibly as his second wife. Several of his sons, born or raised by Ingrid Ylva, would come to hold positions of power when grown: Eskil became lawspeaker in Westrogothia, Karl and Bengt both became bishops of Link√∂ping and Birger became Jarl of Sweden, and later had his son elected king. As a widow, in c. 1208‚Äì1210, she most likely managed her estates in Bj√§lbo as the head of the family, due to her sons being minors. She attended the church from her favourite place in the church tower, to which she had once donated a bell; according to tradition, she often lived in this tower during insecure times. In 1234, her son Birger married Princess Ingeborg Eriksdotter of Sweden, and in 1250, he became regent and father of the king. It remains unclear if Ingrid Ylva was still alive at this point, though it is believed that she was. However, she does not seem to have played any part at the royal court, and probably preferred to stay within her estates. She is said to have married again, to an unnamed man with whom she had a son, Elof Vingad Pil, while other sources claim she remained unmarried.  Ingrid Ylva in legend  Ingrid Ylva is known in various legends, and possibly in her time, as a so-called white witch; she was said to be able to master magic, which she used for good purposes and for her family's good fortune. A lot of stories were told about her magical skills. One legend said that once, when Bj√§lbo was subjected to a surprise attack from the enemies of the family, Ingrid Ylva rushed to the top of the church tower, and, from there, she ripped open a pillow full of feathers which spread across the land and turned into knights in armour. These magical stories were far from slander: in the 13th century, the witch trials were hundreds of years in the future, magic was not illegal and the ability to master magic was considered a great and admirable skill; there was a clear separation between white and black magic; and not even black magic was yet connected to the Devil or punishable by death, as it would become later. Her name was widely known long before her son became regent, and her alleged magical skill was highly admired. She was widely regarded for her ability to foretell the future. Legend claims, that on her deathbed she predicted that her line would succeed to the Swedish throne, as long as her head was held high.Christer √ñhman (Swedish): Helgon, b√∂nder och krigare.

Richeza was the daughter of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife, Salomea of Berg. Tradition describes her as unusually beautiful. First marriage The Polish ruler Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth entered in an alliance with King Niels of Denmark against Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania (now in northwestern Poland and northeastern Germany). In order to seal this alliance, a marriage was arranged between Boles≈Çaw III's daughter Richeza with Niels' eldest son, Crown Prince Magnus the Strong. The wedding took place in Ribe around 1127 and was celebrated with pomp and circumstances.Hans Olrik, \\"Richiza\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0165.html Richeza bore her husband two sons: Knud in 1129 and Niels in 1130.Hans Gillingstam: Rikissa [in]: Svenskt biografiskt lexikon band 30, 2000, https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=6754. As one of the heirs of his maternal grandfather King Inge I, Magnus claimed Sweden. He was recognized King of G√∂taland or parts thereof by the Geats (G√∂tar) in c. 1129 after the death of his mother's cousin King Inge II. Then Richeza became Queen consort of Sweden. However, Magnus' rule was not accepted by the Svear, another tribe to the north of the Geats, who vetoed him and elected Ragnvald Knaph√∂vde as the new King. According to the chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Ragnvald was murdered by supporters of Magnus, who then won the realm (\\"imperium\\") as King of Sweden.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike. K√∏benhavn: Asschenfeldt's Stjerneb√∏ger, 1985, II, p. 64. However, there soon appeared another contender for the throne, Sverker I, who had his power base in √ñsterg√∂tland. Richeza and her husband had their base in Denmark rather than Sweden. Alarmed by the popularity and Imperial support of his cousin Knud Lavard, Duke of Schleswig, both Magnus and his father King Niels acted against Knud, who was murdered by Magnus on 7 January 1131. Knud's half-brother Erik rebelled against Niels and Magnus, but was defeated and took refuge in Norway, where he convinced the local nobility and the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III to launch a retaliatory expedition against Niels. Meanwhile, Sverker I finally made the Swedes abandon Magnus in c. 1132, when he was busy with the civil war in Denmark; he then unified the country under his rule.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike. K√∏benhavn: Asschenfeldt's Stjerneb√∏ger, 1985, II, p. 81. Niels was defeated in the Battle of Fotevik (4 June 1134), and also lost his son Magnus who was slain during the battle. Niels escaped to Schleswig, where he was killed by the citizens (25 June 1134). Now a widow, Richeza returned to Poland, apparently leaving her two sons behind in Denmark. Second marriage Once in Poland, Duke Boles≈Çaw III arranged a new marriage for his daughter. On 18 June 1136, Richeza married a member of the Rurikid dynasty, Volodar Glebovich, Prince of Minsk and Hrodno,In some sources he is incorrectly called Prince Vladimir of Novgorod, a non-existent person.Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan who at that time was in exile in the Polish court. The union was made in order to seal the alliance of Minsk and Poland against Denmark and the powerful Monomakh Kievan dynasty. During this marriage, Richeza gave birth to three children: two sons, Vladimir (later Prince of Minsk) and Vasilko (Prince of Logoysk or Lahojsk), and a daughter, Sophia, born ca. 1139/40. Around 1145, the political advantages of the Polish-Minsk union began to disappear after the Monomach dynasty lost its hegemony among the Rurikid ruling branches. Likely this was the cause of the dissolution of the marriage of Richeza and Volodar. Richeza returned again to Poland, this time with her daughter Sophia, but left her two sons behind with her former husband. Volodar never remarried and died around 1186. She moved to Denmark when her son Knud or Canute V was enthroned in 1146. Third marriage In c. 1148, Queen Ulvhild H√•kansdotter, Sverker I's wife and Richeza's old stepmother-in-law, died. Soon afterwards, the widowed King married Richeza, who arrived in Sweden with her daughter Sophia. The King likely married her with support from Richeza's first husband's allies in G√∂taland.Profile in Historiska-personer.nu The union produced one son, Bulizlaus or Burislev, who was named after his Polish maternal grandfather. The chronicles assign Sune Sik Sverkersson as the youngest son of Sverker I, possibly born by Richeza. In 1150, Richeza's oldest son Knud V, King of Jutland, took refuge in Sweden after he was expelled from Denmark by Sweyn III Grathe, King of Zealand. In this way, the marriage with Sverker I give Richeza the opportunity to help her son, and some historians assume that she partially married the Swedish King for this reason. One year later (1151), Knud asked for the help of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Hartwig I, Archbishop of Bremen, but was defeated by Sweyn III's forces. Only after the mediation of the King of the Germans Frederick Barbarossa during the Imperial Diet in Merseburg was there made a settlement between both parties: Knud V renounced his claim and was compensated by lands in Zealand, while Sweyn III was made king of Denmark. After this decision, both Knud V and Valdemar Knudsson (son of Knud Lavard, the enemy of his own father Magnus) rebelled against Sweyn III, who was expelled in 1154: Knud V and Valdemar became co-rulers of Denmark. In 1156 Knud V married Helena, daughter of King Sverker I and his first wife Ulvhild; in consequence, Richeza became the step- mother-in-law of her own son. On Christmas Day of that year, Sverker I was murdered by a servant.Sven Tunberg, Sveriges historia till v√•ra dagar. Andra delen. √Ñldre Medeltiden. Stockholm: P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners F√∂rlag, 1926, p. 45. When Knud V heard about the deed, he went to Sweden in order to console Richeza, but also to bring his half-sister Sophia of Minsk to Denmark to be married to Valdemar, to whom she had been betrothed since 1154. The marriage took place in 1157. On 9 August of that year, King Knud V was killed during a meeting with Valdemar I and Sweyn III. In 1158 Richeza's second son Niels, probably a monk in Esrom Abbey, also died. Death and aftermath Sweden's first Queen Richeza (of two) is thought to be buried at Alvastra Abbey. Richeza is known to have survived Sverker I's death, although the facts of her later life and her date of death are unknown: a legend says that she remarried the stable master who took part in the assassination of Sverker I.Alternatively, late legend has it that the assassin fled to the king in V√§sterg√∂tland (Magnus Henriksson?) but was extradited to the East Geats and boiled alive.

He acted in concert with another pretender Kol, but was defeated and eliminated, according to a much later source in 1169. He is believed either to have been slain by Canute I's men or to have fled to Denmark or Poland some time before 1173. However, medieval Swedish genealogies say that the claimants Kol and Burislev were in fact sons of John, a son of Sverker and Ulvhild.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters √§ldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945. If so, the younger Burislev was given the prestigious name after his grandfather's second marriage without actually being related to Boles≈Çaw III. The only thing we know about Richeza's son Burislev is that his goods were inherited by his uterine sister Sophia of Minsk.

They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. L√º was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China and paramount power. After Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and Regent during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Emperor Qianshao of Han and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao). Less than a year after Emperor Hui's accession to the throne in 194 BC, L√º had Concubine Qi (one of the late Emperor Gaozu's consorts), whom she deeply hated, put to death in a cruel manner. She also had Concubine Qi's son Liu Ruyi poisoned to death. Emperor Hui was shocked by his mother's cruelty and fell sick for a year, and thereafter no longer became involved in state affairs. L√º dominated the political scene for 15 years until her death in 180 BC and actually ruled as Empress regnant of Han dynasty.  Family background and marriage to Liu Bang  L√º Zhi was born in Shanfu County (ÂñÆÁà∂; present-day Shan County, Shandong) during the late Qin Dynasty. Her courtesy name was Exu (). To flee from enemies, her father L√º Wen () brought their family to Pei County, settled there, and became a close friend of the county magistrate. Many influential men in town came to visit L√º Wen. Xiao He, then an assistant of the magistrate, was in charge of the seating arrangement and collection of gifts from guests at a banquet in L√º Wen's house, and he announced \\"Those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins in gifts shall be seated outside the hall.\\" Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), then a minor patrol officer (), went there bringing a single cent and said, \\"I offer 10,000 coins.\\" L√º Wen saw Liu Bang and was impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him. Xiao He told L√º Wen that Liu Bang was not serious, but Liu ignored him and chatted with L√º. L√º Wen said, \\"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I've never seen someone so exceptional like you before.\\" L√º Wen then offered his daughter L√º Zhi's hand in marriage to Liu Bang and they were wed. L√º Zhi bore Liu Bang a daughter (later Princess Yuan of Lu) and a son Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han). Liu Bang later participated in the rebellion against the Qin Dynasty under the insurgent Chu kingdom, nominally ruled by King Huai II. L√º Zhi and her two children remained with her father and family for most of the time during this period.  Life during the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention  A Western Han (202 BC - 8 AD) ceramic statuette of a seated woman and court attendant holding up her robes, from a tomb of Xianyang, Shaanxi province In early 206 BC, after the fall of the Qin Dynasty, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Liu Bang was named \\"King of Han\\" and given the lands in the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan) as his domain. However, Liu Bang's family, including L√º Zhi and her children, remained in Pei County, which was a territory of Xiang Yu's kingdom of Western Chu. Later that year, Liu Bang attacked and seized the Three Qins (three kingdoms covering the Guanzhong region) directly north of his own fief. Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to an earlier promise by Emperor Yi of Chu (previously known as King Huai II of Chu) to appoint whoever conquered Guanzhong first (during the rebellion against the Qin Dynasty) as king of that area. This marked the beginning of a four-year power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, from 206 BC to 202 BC, known as the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention. Xiang Yu initially took no action against Liu Bang's family. In the eighth lunar month, Liu Bang sent his followers Wang Xi () and Xue Ou () to meet Wang Ling () in Nanyang and fetch his family. However Xiang Yu mobilised troops to Yangxia () and prevented the Han forces from advancing. In the summer of 205 BC, Liu Bang took advantage of the situation when Xiang Yu was occupied with suppressing rebellions in the Qi kingdom to attack and capture Western Chu's capital Pengcheng. Xiang Yu immediately withdrew from Qi and launched a counterattack, defeating Liu Bang's forces at Suishui (). L√º Zhi and Liu Bang's family were captured by Chu forces and held hostage. During this period of time, L√º Zhi started an illicit affair with Shen Yiji (), one of Liu Bang's followers who was also held captive together with her. In the autumn of 203 BC, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu came to a temporary reconciliation, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into west and east under their Han and Western Chu domains respectively. As part of their agreement, Xiang Yu released L√º Zhi and Liu Bang's family and returned them to Liu. L√º Zhi was given the title of \\"Queen Consort of Han\\" (). Liu Bang later renounced the truce and attacked Xiang Yu, eventually defeating the latter at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC and unifying China under his rule. Liu Bang proclaimed himself Emperor of China and established the Han Dynasty. He instated L√º Zhi as his empress and their son Liu Ying as crown prince.  As empress and paramount authority L√º Zhi's jade seal, excavated from Xianyang, now in the Shaanxi History Museum. Even after Emperor Gaozu (Liu Bang)'s victory over Xiang Yu, there were still unstable areas in the empire, requiring the new government to launch military campaigns to pacify these regions thereafter. Gaozu placed Empress L√º Zhi and the crown prince Liu Ying (L√º Zhi's son) in charge of the capital Chang'an and making key decisions in court, assisted by the chancellor Xiao He and other ministers. During this time L√º Zhi proved herself to be a competent administrator in domestic affairs, and she quickly established strong working relationships with many of Gaozu's officials, who admired her for her capability and feared her for her ruthlessness, after the war ended and Emperor Gaozu returned, she remained in power and she was always influential in many of the country's affairs. =Roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue= L√º Zhi is known for her roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue, two of Emperor Gaozu's subjects who contributed greatly to the founding of the Han Dynasty, of whose military capabilities both she and her husband had been apprehensive . In 196 BC, Gaozu left the capital Chang'an to suppress a revolt in Julu started by Chen Xi, the Marquis of Yangxia. A year before, Chen Xi met Han Xin before departing from Chang'an for Julu, and it was alleged that Han Xin was involved in the rebellion. L√º Zhi became wary of Han Xin, and after consulting the chancellor Xiao He, she had Xiao summon Han to meet her in Changle Palace. There, the empress had Han Xin taken by surprise, captured and subsequently executed in a torturous manner. L√º Zhi also ordered Han Xin's family and relatives to be put to death as well. When Gaozu was putting down Chen Xi's revolt, he requested reinforcements from Peng Yue but the latter claimed that he was ill and sent his subordinates to assist Gaozu instead. After Chen Xi's rebellion was quelled, Gaozu heard rumours that Peng Yue was plotting against him too, and he had Peng arrested and stripped off his titles. Peng was demoted to the status of a commoner and exiled to the remote Qingyi County (ÈùíË°£Á∏£; in present-day Ya'an, Sichuan). During his journey to Qingyi, Peng Yue encountered L√º Zhi, who wanted to have him killed. He pleaded with her to spare his life and let him return to his hometown in Changyi (ÊòåÈÇë; present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong), and the empress pretended to agree. Peng Yue was brought to Luoyang, where he was subsequently executed on false charges of treason. L√º Zhi ordered Peng Yue's body to be mutilated and had Peng's clan exterminated as well. =Dispute over the succession= In his late years, Emperor Gaozu started favouring one of his younger consorts, Concubine Qi, who bore him a son Liu Ruyi, who was instated as Prince of Zhao in 198 BC, displacing L√º Zhi's son-in-law Zhang Ao (Princess Yuan of Lu's husband). Gaozu had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as crown prince, reasoning that the former was too \\"soft-hearted and weak\\" and that the latter resembled him more. Since L√º Zhi had strong rapport with many ministers, they generally opposed Gaozu's decision but the emperor seemed bent on deposing Liu Ying. L√º Zhi became worried and she approached Zhang Liang for help, and the latter analysed that Gaozu was changing the succession on grounds of favouritism. Zhang Liang invited the \\"Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang\\", a group of four reclusive wise men, to persuade Gaozu to change his decision. The four men promised to assist Liu Ying in future if he became emperor, and Gaozu was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support. Gaozu told Concubine Qi, \\"I wanted to replace (the crown prince). Now I see that he has the support of those four men; he is fully fledged and difficult to unseat. Empress L√º is really in charge!\\"(ÊàëÊ¨≤Êòì‰πãÔºåÂΩºÂõõ‰∫∫Ëºî‰πãÔºåÁæΩÁøºÂ∑≤ÊàêÔºåÈõ£ÂãïÁü£„ÄÇÂëÇÂêéÁúüËÄå‰∏ªÁü£ÔºÅ) Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 55, House of the Marquis of Liu. This marked the end of the dispute over the succession and affirmed Liu Ying's role as crown prince.  As empress dowager and Regent In 195 BC Emperor Gaozu died and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as Emperor Hui of Han. L√º Zhi was honoured by Emperor Hui as empress dowager. She exerted more influence during the reign of her son than she had when she was empress. =Roles in the deaths of Concubine Qi and Liu Ruyi= L√º Zhi did not harm most of Gaozu's other consorts and treated them according to rules and customs of the imperial family. For example, consorts who bore male children that were instated as princes were granted the title of \\"Princess Dowager\\" () in their respective sons' principalities. One exception was Concubine Qi, whom L√º Zhi greatly resented because of the dispute over the succession between Liu Ruyi (Qi's son) and Liu Ying. Liu Ruyi, the Prince of Zhao, was away in his principality, so L√º Zhi targeted Concubine Qi. She had Qi stripped of her position, treated like a convict (head shaved, in stocks, dressed in prison garb) and forced to do hard labour in the form of milling rice. L√º Zhi then summoned Liu Ruyi, who was around the age of 12 then, to Chang'an, intending to kill him together with his mother. However Zhou Chang (), the chancellor in Liu Ruyi's principality, whom L√º Zhi respected because of his stern opposition to Emperor Gaozu's proposal to make Liu Ruyi crown prince, temporarily protected Liu Ruyi from harm by responding to L√º Zhi's order that \\"The Prince of Zhao is ill and unfit for travelling over long distances.\\" L√º Zhi then ordered Zhou Chang to come to the capital, had him detained, and then summoned Liu Ruyi again. Emperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi by intercepting his half brother before the latter entered Chang'an, and kept Liu Ruyi by his side most of the time. L√º Zhi refrained from carrying out her plans for several months because she feared that she might harm Emperor Hui as well. One morning in the winter of 194 BC, Emperor Hui went for a hunting trip and did not bring Liu Ruyi with him because the latter refused to get out of bed. L√º Zhi's chance arrived, so she sent an assassin to force poisoned wine down Liu Ruyi's throat. The young prince was dead by the time Emperor Hui returned. L√º Zhi then had Concubine Qi killed in an inhumane manner: she had Qi's limbs chopped off, eyes gouged out, ears sliced off, forced her to drink a potion that made her mute, and thrown into a latrine. She called Qi a \\"human swine\\" (). Several days later, Emperor Hui was taken to view the \\"human swine\\" and was shocked to learn that it was Concubine Qi. He cried loudly and became ill for a long time. He requested to see his mother and said, \\"This is something done not by a human. As the empress dowager's son, I'll never be able to rule the empire.\\"(Ê≠§Èùû‰∫∫ÊâÄÁÇ∫„ÄÇËá£ÁÇ∫Â§™ÂêéÂ≠êÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çËÉΩÊ≤ªÂ§©‰∏ã„ÄÇ) Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 9, Biography of Empress Dowager L√º. From then onward Emperor Hui indulged himself in carnal pleasures and ignored state affairs. =Treatment of Emperor Gaozu's other sons= Around the winter of 194 BC, Liu Fei, the Prince of Qi, Emperor Gaozu's eldest son born to Lady Cao (), visited Chang'an and he and Emperor Hui attended a banquet hosted by the empress dowager. Emperor Hui honoured Liu Fei as an older half brother and treated the latter respectfully. L√º Zhi felt offended and secretly instructed her servants to pour a cup of poisoned wine for Liu Fei, and then toasted him. Just as Liu Fei was about to drink the wine, Emperor Hui realised his mother's intention and grabbed Liu Fei's cup as if he would drink from it. L√º Zhi immediately jumped up and knocked the cup out of Emperor Hui's hand. Liu Fei then offered to give up an entire commandery from his principality to L√º Zhi's daughter Princess Yuan of Lu, and L√º Zhi accepted and allowed him to leave. L√º Zhi also played a role in the death of another of Gaozu's sons, Liu You, the Prince of Zhao. Liu You married L√º Zhi's niece but was caught having an affair with another woman, so L√º Zhi's niece reported to her aunt that Liu You was plotting a rebellion.Sima Guang. Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 13. L√º Zhi summoned Liu You to Chang'an and had him imprisoned and deprived of food. Liu You was afraid of committing suicide and eventually starved to death, in 181 BC. L√º Zhi then transferred another of Gaozu's sons, Liu Hui, the Prince of Liang, to Zhao, and forced him to marry a daughter of L√º Chan. The L√º clan grabbed the authority of Zhao and oversaw Liu Hui, thus making Liu Hui feel restricted. Princess L√º had a favored concubine of Liu Hui poisoned to death. Liu Hui was distressed and committed suicide in fear in the same year. For the matters above L√º Zhi was criticized for \\"having murdered three princes of Zhao\\". =Marriage proposal from Modu= In 192 BC L√º Zhi received a marriage proposal from the Xiongnu chanyu Modu, who wrote as follows in a letter meant to intimidate and mock her: > I'm a lonesome ruler born in marshes and raised in plains populated by > livestock. I've visited your border numerous times and wanted to tour China. > Your Majesty is now alone and living in solitude. Since both of us are not > happy and have nothing to entertain ourselves, I'm willing to use what I > possess to exchange for what you > lack.(Â≠§ÂÉ®‰πãÂêõÔºåÁîüÊñºÊ≤ÆÊæ§‰πã‰∏≠ÔºåÈï∑ÊñºÂπ≥ÈáéÁâõÈ¶¨‰πãÂüüÔºåÊï∏Ëá≥ÈÇäÂ¢ÉÔºåÈ°òÊ∏∏‰∏≠Âúã„ÄÇÈôõ‰∏ãÁç®Á´ãÔºåÂ≠§ÂÉ®Áç®Â±Ö„ÄÇÂÖ©‰∏ª‰∏çÊ®ÇÔºåÁÑ°‰ª•Ëá™ËôûÔºåÈ°ò‰ª•ÊâÄÊúâÔºåÊòìÂÖ∂ÊâÄÁÑ°„ÄÇ) Ban Gu > et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. L√º Zhi was infuriated at the rude proposition, and in a heated court session, her generals advised her to rally an army and exterminate the Xiongnu immediately. As she was about to declare war, an outspoken attendant named Ji Bu pointed out that the Xiongnu army was much more powerful than the Chinese. At Ji Bu's words, the court immediately fell into a fearful silence.Records of the Grand Historian, v. 100, Burton Watson translation page 249 Rethinking her plans, L√º Zhi rejected Modu's proposition humbly, as follows: > Your Lordship does not forget our land and writes a letter to us, we fear. I > retreat to preserve myself. I'm old and frail, I'm losing hair and teeth, > and I struggle to maintain balance when I move. Your Lordship has heard > wrongly, you shouldn't defile yourself.

Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. =Emperor Hui's marriage to Empress Zhang Yan= In 191 BC, at L√º Zhi's insistence, Emperor Hui married his niece Zhang Yan (Princess Yuan of Lu's daughter) and made her empress. They did not have any children. It was alleged that L√º Zhi told Zhang Yan to adopt eight boys and have their mothers killed. There is uncertainty whether these children were Emperor Hui's; the traditional view is that they were not, while modern historians believe that they were born to his concubines.  As grand empress dowager and Acting Emperor Emperor Hui died in 188 BC and was succeeded by Emperor Qianshao, one of the children Empress Zhang adopted. Now grandmother of the emperor, L√º Zhi retained her title as Empress Dowager and never claimed the title as Grand Empress Dowager. Conventional historians do not consider Emperor Qianshao a true sovereign, so he is usually omitted from the list of emperors of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Gaozu had previously decreed that no non- imperial clan members could become princes (not including the vassal kings), a rule that L√º Zhi herself had a hand in creating. In spite of this, L√º Zhi attempted to install some of her kinsmen as princes. The Right Chancellor Wang Ling () opposed her decision but the Left Chancellor Chen Ping and general Zhou Bo accepted this move. When Wang Ling rebuked Chen Ping and Zhou Bo in private for going against Emperor Gaozu's law, they rationalized that their compliance with the empress dowager's wishes was necessary to protect the empire and the Liu clan. L√º Zhi promoted Wang Ling to the position of Grand Tutor () but the latter claimed that he was ill and declined, so she ordered him to return to his marquisate (Wang Ling held the title of Marquis of Anguo). L√º Zhi then appointed Chen Ping as Right Chancellor and her illicit lover Shen Yiji () as Left Chancellor. L√º Zhi then proceeded to make her kin nobles. Her first step was to install her maternal grandson Zhang Yan (ÂºµÂÅÉ; Princess Yuan of Lu's son, Empress Zhang Yan's brother) as the Prince of Lu. Over the next few years she instated several of her nephews and grandnephews as princes and marquises. In an unprecedented move, in 184 BC, L√º Zhi also granted her younger sister L√º Xu () the title of Marquise of Lingguang, in a separate fief from that of the latter's husband Fan Kuai. Around 184 BC Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not Empress Dowager Zhang Yan's son, and his birth mother was executed by the empress dowager. He remarked that when he grew up he would make Empress Dowager Zhang pay for his mother's death. When L√º Zhi heard about this, she had the young emperor secretly confined in the palace and publicly announced that the emperor was seriously ill and unable to meet anyone. After some time she told the imperial court that Emperor Qianshao was still sick and suffered from psychosis, and was thus incapable of ruling. She then proposed that the emperor be replaced. The court complied with her wish, and Emperor Qianshao was deposed and put to death. He was succeeded by his brother Liu Yi (), who was renamed to Liu Hong (), and was also historically known as Emperor Houshao of Han. Like his predecessor Emperor Qianshao, Liu Hong is generally not regarded as a real monarch, so he is also not included in the list of emperors of the Han Dynasty.  Death  Tomb of Empress L√º in Changling, Xianyang, Shaanxi L√º Zhi died of illness at the age of 61 in 180 BC and was interred in Emperor Gaozu's tomb in Changling (). Near the end of Wang Mang's Xin Dynasty (AD 9 ‚Äì AD 23), L√º Zhi's body was desecrated by Chimei rebels when they raided Gaozu's tomb.(ÁôºÊéòË´∏ÈôµÔºåÂèñÂÖ∂ÂØ∂Ë≤®ÔºåÈÅÇÊ±°Ëæ±ÂëÇÂêéÂ±ç„ÄÇ) Fan Ye. Book of the Later Han, Biography of Liu Xuanzi. Emperor Guangwu, who restored the Han Dynasty in AD 25, posthumously replaced L√º Zhi as \\"Empress Gao\\" in Gaozu's temple with another of Gaozu's concubines, Consort Bo. L√º Zhi was enshrined in a separate temple instead. In the aftermath of L√º Zhi's death, her clan members were overthrown from their positions of power and massacred, in an event historically known as the L√º Clan Disturbance. The masterminds of this coup d'√©tat include ministers who previously served Emperor Gaozu, including Chen Ping, Zhou Bo and Guan Ying. Liu Heng, a son of Gaozu and Consort Bo, was installed on the throne as Emperor Wen of Han. Family * Father: L√º Wen (), sometimes referred to as L√º Gong ().

Bear Bergman, Meg-John Barker, Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders (2017), Palgrave Macmillan, page 43 Non-binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella, since many non-binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex. Another term for non- binary is enby (from the abbreviation NB). Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders (being bigender or trigender); having no gender (agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); being third gender or other-gendered (a category that includes those who do not place a name to their gender). Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation, and non-binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as cisgender people do. Non-binary gender identities are not associated with a specific gender expression, such as androgyny. Non-binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender \\"identities\\" altogether. Some non-binary people are medically treated for gender dysphoria with surgery or hormones, as trans men and women often are.  Definitions and identity  A non-binary pride flag at a parade in Paris reading (\\"My gender is non-binary\\") The term genderqueer originated in queer zines of the 1980s as a precursor to the term non-binary. In addition to being an umbrella term, genderqueer has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who are perceived to transcend or divert from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity. Individuals may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\". Genderqueer is often used to self-identify by people who challenge binary social constructions of gender. The term has also been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity. Androgynous (also androgyne) is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term androgyny is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits. However, not all genderqueer people identify as androgynous. Some genderqueer people identify as a masculine woman or a feminine man or combine genderqueer with another gender option. Being non-binary is not the same as being intersex, and most intersex people identify as either male or female. Some people use enby (from the letters NB) as a short form of non-binary.Vanessa Sheridan, Transgender in the Workplace: The Complete Guide (2018), page 11Sam Hope, Person-Centred Counselling for Trans and Gender Diverse People (2019), page 218 Many references use the term transgender to include genderqueer/non- binary people. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Gender Spectrum use the term gender-expansive to convey \\"a wider, more flexible range of gender identity and/or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system\\".Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Gender Spectrum, Supporting and Caring for our Gender-Expansive Youth, accessed 21 January 2016 Agender people ('a-' meaning \\"without\\"), also called genderless, gender-free, non-gendered, or ungendered, are those who identify as having no gender or being without a gender identity. Although this category includes a broad range of identities which do not conform to traditional gender norms, scholar Finn Enke states that people who identify with any of these positions may not necessarily self- identify as transgender. Agender people have no specific set of pronouns; singular they is typically used, but it is not the default. Neutrois and agender were two of 50 available custom genders on Facebook, which were added on 13 February 2014.Facebook sex changes: which one of 50 genders are you?. The Daily Telegraph. 14 February 2014. Agender is also available as a gender option on OkCupid since 17 November 2014. Bigender, bi-gender, or dual gender is a gender identity that includes any two gender identities and behaviors. Identifying as bigender is typically understood to mean that one identifies as both male and female or moves between masculine gender expression and feminine gender expression, having two distinct gender identities simultaneously or fluctuating between them. This is different from identifying as genderfluid, as those who identify as genderfluid may not go back and forth between any fixed gender identities and may experience an entire range or spectrum of identities over time. The American Psychological Association describes the bigender identity as part of the umbrella of transgender identities. Some bigender individuals express two distinct personas, which may be feminine, masculine, agender, androgyne, or other gender identities; others find that they identify as two genders simultaneously. A 1999 survey conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health observed that, among the transgender community, 3% of those who were assigned male at birth and 8% of those who were assigned female at birth identified as either \\"a transvestite, cross- dresser, drag queen, or a bigendered person\\".Clements, K. San Francisco Department of Public Health, 1999 A 2016 Harris poll conducted on behalf of GLAAD found that 1% of millennials identify as bigender. Demigender is a gender identity of a person identifying partially or mostly with one gender and at the same time with another gender. There are several subcategories of the identity. A demi-boy or demi-man, for example, identifies at least partially with being a boy or a man, no matter the sex and gender they were assigned at birth, while other parts of their identity might be assigned to other genders, genderfluid or no other gender (agender). A demiflux person feels that the stable part of their identity is non-binary. Genderfluid people often express a desire to remain flexible about their gender identity rather than committing to a single definition. They may fluctuate between differing gender expressions over their lifetime, or express multiple aspects of various gender markers at the same time. A genderfluid individual may also identify as bigender shifting between masculine and feminine; or as trigender shifting between these and a third gender. Pangender may be defined as being more than one gender, or it may describe a person who feels they are a member of all genders at the same time. Transfeminine and transmasculine may be used by individuals to describe an aspect of femininity or masculinity within their identity. Transfeminine may be used by individuals who were assigned male at birth but align more closely with femininity, while not necessarily fully identifying as a woman. Transmasculine may be used by individuals who were assigned female at birth but align more closely with masculinity, while not necessarily fully identifying as a man.  History  In 1992, after the publication of Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come by Leslie Feinberg, the term transgender was broadened to become a term for gender variation in general. This is highlighted in 1994, when activist Kate Bornstein wrote \\"All the categories of transgender find a common ground in that they each break one or more of the rules of gender: What we have in common is that we are gender outlaws, every one of us.\\" The term genderqueer came into use during the mid-1990s among political activists. Riki Anne Wilchins is often associated with the word and claims to have coined it. Wikchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of In Your Face to describe anyone who is gender nonconforming. They were also one of the main contributors to the anthology Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary which was published in 2002. Wilchins stated they identify as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography. The internet popularized the term genderqueer, as a wide audience was able to be reached very quickly. In 2008, The New York Times used the word genderqueer. In the 2010s, this term became more popularized as many celebrities publicly identified as gender nonconforming. In 2012, the Intersex & Genderqueer Recognition Project was started to advocate for expanding gender options on official documentation. In 2016, Jamie Shupe was the first person to have a nonbinary gender on official documents in the United States.  Pronouns and titles  Pronoun pin badges from a 2016 art and tech festival Some non-binary/genderqueer people prefer to use gender-neutral pronouns. Usage of singular 'they', 'their' and 'them' is the most common; non-standard pronouns such as ze, sie, hir, co, and ey are sometimes used as well. Some others prefer the conventional gender-specific pronouns 'her' or 'him', prefer to be referred to alternately as 'he' and 'she', or prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all. Many prefer additional neutral language, such as the title 'Mx.' instead of Mr. or Ms.  Legal recognition  In today's society, many non-binary/genderqueer people still use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification ‚Äì such as passports and driver's licenses ‚Äì only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. However, with the increasing acceptance of non- binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as a greater number of governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities. Multiple countries legally recognize non- binary or third gender classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently) include formal legal recognition. In Western societies, Australia may have been the first country to legally recognize a classification of sex outside of 'male' and 'female' on legal documentation, following the recognition of Alex MacFarlane's intersex status in 2003. The wider legal recognition of nonbinary people ‚Äì following the recognition of intersex people in 2003 ‚Äì in Australian law followed between 2010 and 2014, with legal action taken against the New South Wales Government Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages by transgender activist Norrie May-Welby to recognize Norrie's legal gender identity as 'non-specific'. While the United States does not federally recognize a non-binary gender, in 2016 Oregon became the first state to recognize a non-binary gender identity. Following Oregon, in 2017 California passed an act allowing citizens to identify as \\"non-binary\\" on official documents. As of 2019, eight states have passed acts that allow \\"non-binary\\" or \\"X\\" designations on certain identifying documents. One of the main arguments against the inclusion of a third gender identifier in the U.S. is that it would make law enforcement and surveillance harder, however countries that have officially recognized a third gender marker have not reported these issues. In the United States there are no explicit laws to protect non-binary people from discrimination, however it is illegal for an employer to require employees to conform to sex stereotypes.  Discrimination  In the United States, the majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose \\"A gender not listed here\\". The \\"not listed here\\" respondents were nine percentage-points (33 percent) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36 percent compared to 27 percent). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43 percent reported having attempted suicide. The majority of reported discrimination faced by non-binary individuals often includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect. People who are non-binary are also often viewed as partaking in part of a trend and are thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a large form of discrimination faced by non- binary individuals. Misgendering is also a problem that many individuals face, be it intentional or unintentional. In the case of intentional misgendering, transphobia is a driving force. Also, the use of they/them pronouns is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of safe spaces and political correctness, causing push back, and intentional misgendering from some individuals. In the case of unintentional misgendering, it is often expected for the person who is misgendered to console and forgive the person who made the mistake.  Symbols and observances  Anjali Gopalan and Gopi Shankar Madurai inaugurating Asia's first Genderqueer Pride Parade at Madurai with a rainbow and genderqueer flag Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary. The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan. Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of ‚Äì or between ‚Äì male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders. Genderfluid people, who also fall under the genderqueer umbrella, have their own flag as well. Pink represents femininity, white represents lack of gender, purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, black represents all other genders, and blue represents masculinity. Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders. International Non-Binary People's Day is celebrated on 14 July.  Population figures  A 2019 survey of the Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ population in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario called Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary. A 2017 survey of Canadian LGBT+ people called LGBT+ Realities Survey found that 4% of the 1,897 respondents identified as non- binary transgender and 1% identified as non-binary outside of the transgender umbrella. According to The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 35% of the nearly 28,000 transgender respondents to the anonymous online survey identified as non-binary. A 2011 survey conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the UK found that 0.4% of the 10,039 respondents identified as non-binary.

It ceased operations in 2004.  History  The airline was established in December 2002 and started operations on 16 March 2003. Its cheap air fares were based on the fact that the e-tickets were only sold through Internet and phone. The airline claimed a successful beginning, as the passengers who formerly bought bus and train tickets now bought cheaper flights. The president of the company was Peter Sevelius. The flight captains had been employed from Finnair. It had many celebrities as shareholders, such as the rally driver Juha Kankkunen. Its competitors included Finnair, Ryanair and Soder Airlines. In January 2004, faced with the threat of the termination of its plane lease and operating license for unpaid debts, the financially ailing airline cancelled its flights to London and went into debt restructuring. On January 27, 2004, Flying Finn ceased all flights and filed for bankruptcy. Over 20,000 passengers were left without refund. In August 2007, there was speculation by Keskusrikospoliisi (the National Bureau of Investigation) that there are financial irregularities due to the airline accounts, leading to seven former employees being accused of breaking bankruptcy laws.

Originally, it was given to several Finnish middle and long-distance runners. The term was later extended to notable Finnish racing sportsmen. Running The nickname was first used of Hannes Kolehmainen, also known as \\"Smiling Hannes\\", as he took home three gold medals and broke two world records during the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. As Finnish runners started to dominate long-distance running, the nickname was passed on to all successful Finns in the sport, including multi-Olympic gold medalists Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola. Nurmi won three gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Belgium and five at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where he was partnered with Ritola, who ran to four gold medals. Volmari Iso-Hollo, the winner of 3000 m steeplechase at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics, was one of the best-known Finnish runners in the 1930s and also nicknamed the Flying Finn. During his tour of the United States in 1940, Taisto M√§ki‚Äîwho held five world records‚Äîwas regularly referred to as a Flying Finn. The last Flying Finn in running was Lasse Vir√©n, who won the 5000 m and 10,000 m events at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics. Motorsport =Rallying= Timo M√§kinen and Rauno Aaltonen at the 1965 1000 Lakes Rally The nickname was next used to describe the efforts of Finnish rally drivers in the 1960s. Timo M√§kinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Simo Lampinen were among the first drivers referenced as the Flying Finn. In 1968, Castrol released a film called \\"The Flying Finns\\", it featured the 1968 1000 Lakes Rally and concentrated on documenting the duel between M√§kinen and Hannu Mikkola. The term then moved on to the next generations of Finnish rally drivers, and among others, the four-time World Rally Champions Juha Kankkunen and Tommi M√§kinen were often referred to as Flying Finns. =Formula 1= Mika H√§kkinen at the 2000 United States Grand Prix. The first driver to carry the nickname in Formula One was Leo Kinnunen. Kinnunen had the title written on his helmet in 1970, when he won the World Sportscar Championship for Porsche. However, he could not turn his success in sports car racing into a successful F1 career in his underpowered Surtees. In the 1980s the moniker was given to Keke Rosberg, who became the first well-known Finn in the sport, winning the 1982 world championship. Following the success of later Finnish drivers, Rosberg has been described as the \\"original Flying Finn\\". After Rosberg, many Finnish Formula 1 drivers have also been called the \\"Flying Finn\\", including Mika H√§kkinen, who won the drivers' championship in 1998 and 1999, Mika Salo, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, who was drivers' champion in 2007, Heikki Kovalainen, and Valtteri Bottas. =Motorcycles= On two wheels, the most famous Flying Finn was Jarno Saarinen, also known as The Baron, who won the 250cc road racing World Championship as privateer in 1972, and finished a close second to Giacomo Agostini in the 350cc class. Saarinen died the following year, while leading both the 250cc and 500cc championships and after competing for only three years. He remains in motorcycle sport history books for developing a new riding style, which is still predominantly in use today; body hanging off the bike with knee near the ground. During the 1970s, Finnish rider Heikki Mikkola won four motocross world championships and also became known as the Flying Finn. Mika Kallio, who finished second in the 125cc championship in 2005 and 2006, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn. Mauno Hermunen, who has finished third in 2010 and fourth in 2011 in the world supermoto series, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn. Football Shefki Kuqi, who played for Scottish side Hibernian F.C. was nicknamed the \\"Flying Finn\\", owing to a strange but popular goal celebration, throwing himself onto the ground, with his arms outstretched and landing on his chest.

For example, this is the 5 √ó 5 Hilbert matrix: : H = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} & \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} & \\\\frac{1}{8} & \\\\frac{1}{9} \\\\end{bmatrix}. The Hilbert matrix can be regarded as derived from the integral : H_{ij} = \\\\int_0^1 x^{i+j-2} \\\\, dx, that is, as a Gramian matrix for powers of x. It arises in the least squares approximation of arbitrary functions by polynomials. The Hilbert matrices are canonical examples of ill-conditioned matrices, being notoriously difficult to use in numerical computation. For example, the 2-norm condition number of the matrix above is about 4.8. Historical note introduced the Hilbert matrix to study the following question in approximation theory: \\"Assume that , is a real interval. Is it then possible to find a non-zero polynomial P with integral coefficients, such that the integral :\\\\int_{a}^b P(x)^2 dx is smaller than any given bound Œµ > 0, taken arbitrarily small?\\" To answer this question, Hilbert derives an exact formula for the determinant of the Hilbert matrices and investigates their asymptotics. He concludes that the answer to his question is positive if the length of the interval is smaller than 4\\\\. Properties The Hilbert matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The Hilbert matrix is also totally positive (meaning that the determinant of every submatrix is positive). The Hilbert matrix is an example of a Hankel matrix. It is also a specific example of a Cauchy matrix. The determinant can be expressed in closed form, as a special case of the Cauchy determinant. The determinant of the n √ó n Hilbert matrix is : \\\\det(H) = \\\\frac{c_n^4}{c_{2n}}, where : c_n = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i^{n-i} = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i!. Hilbert already mentioned the curious fact that the determinant of the Hilbert matrix is the reciprocal of an integer (see sequence in the OEIS), which also follows from the identity : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(H)} = \\\\frac{c_{2n}}{c_n^4} = n! \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{i=1}^{2n-1} \\\\binom{i}{[i/2]}. Using Stirling's approximation of the factorial, one can establish the following asymptotic result: : \\\\det(H) = a_n\\\\, n^{-1/4}(2\\\\pi)^n \\\\,4^{-n^2}, where an converges to the constant e^{1/4}\\\\, 2^{1/12}\\\\, A^{-3} \\\\approx 0.6450 as n \\\\to \\\\infty, where A is the Glaisher‚ÄìKinkelin constant. The inverse of the Hilbert matrix can be expressed in closed form using binomial coefficients; its entries are : (H^{-1})_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}(i + j - 1) \\\\binom{n + i - 1}{n - j} \\\\binom{n + j - 1}{n - i} \\\\binom{i + j - 2}{i - 1}^2, where n is the order of the matrix. It follows that the entries of the inverse matrix are all integers, and that the signs form a checkerboard pattern, being positive on the principal diagonal. For example, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} & \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{5} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{7} & \\\\frac{1}{8} & \\\\frac{1}{9} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrrrr} 25 & -300 & 1050 & -1400 & 630 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -300 & 4800 & -18900 & 26880 & -12600 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1050 & -18900 & 79380 & -117600 & 56700 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1400 & 26880 & -117600 & 179200 & -88200 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 630 & -12600 & 56700 & -88200 & 44100 \\\\end{array}\\\\right].

Two of these features need to be present for a clinical diagnosis ‚Äî only 30% of patients have all three. French doctor Georges de Morsier first recognized the relation of a rudimentary or absent septum pellucidum with hypoplasia of the optic nerves and chiasm in 1956. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of SOD can be divided into those related to optic nerve underdevelopment, pituitary hormone abnormalities, or mid-line brain abnormalities. Symptoms may vary greatly in their severity. =Optic nerve underdevelopment= About one quarter of people with SOD have significant visual impairment in one or both eyes, as a result of optic nerve underdevelopment. There may also be nystagmus (involuntary eye movements, often side-to-side) or other eye abnormalities. =Pituitary hormone abnormalities= Underdevelopment of the pituitary gland in SOD leads to hypopituitarism, most commonly in the form of growth hormone deficiency. =Mid-line brain abnormalities= In SOD mid-line brain structures, such as the corpus callosum and the septum pellucidum may fail to develop normally, leading to neurological problems such as seizures or development delay. Causes SOD results from an abnormality in the development of the embryonic forebrain at 4-6 weeks of pregnancy. There is no known single cause of SOD, but it is thought that both genetic and environmental factors may be involved. =Genetic= Rare familial recurrence has been reported, suggesting at least one genetic form (HESX1). In addition to HESX1, mutations in OTX2, SOX2 and PAX6 have been implicated in SOD. Genetic abnormalities are identified in fewer than one per cent of patients. =Environmental= There have been suggestions that the use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy may increase the risk of SOD. Diagnosis A diagnosis of SOD is made when at least two of the following triad are present: optic nerve underdevelopment; pituitary hormone abnormalities; or mid-line brain abnormalities. Diagnosis is usually made at birth or during childhood, and a clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI scans. Treatment There is no cure for SOD. Pituitary insufficiency can be treated with hormones. Epidemiology A European survey put the prevalence of SOD at somewhere in the region of 1.9 to 2.5 per 100,000 live births, with the United Kingdom having a particularly high rate and with increased risk for younger mothers. History In 1941 Dr David Reeves at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles described an association between underdevelopment of the optic nerve with an absent septum pellucidum. Fifteen years later French doctor Georges de Morsier reported his theory that the two abnormalities were connected and coined the term septo-optic dysplasia. In 1970 American doctor William Hoyt made the connection between the three features of SOD and named the syndrome after de Morsier.

He was a member of a generation of counterculture scientists and thinkers that included Ram Dass, Werner Erhard and Timothy Leary, all frequent visitors to the Lilly home. He often stirred controversy, especially among mainstream scientists. Lilly conducted high-altitude research during World War II and later trained as a psychoanalyst. He gained renown in the 1950s after developing the isolation tank. He saw the tanks, in which users are isolated from almost all external stimuli, as a means to explore the nature of human consciousness. He later combined that work with his efforts to communicate with dolphins. He began studying how bottlenose dolphins vocalize, establishing centers in the U.S. Virgin Islands and, later, San Francisco to study dolphins. A decade later, he began experimenting with psychedelics, including LSD, often while floating in isolation. His work inspired two Hollywood movies, The Day of the Dolphin (1973) and Altered States (1980). Early life and education Lilly was born to a wealthy family on January 6, 1915, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was Richard Coyle Lilly, president of the First National Bank of St. Paul. His mother was Rachel Lenor Cunningham, whose family owned the Cunningham & Haas Company, a large stockyards company in St. Paul. Lilly had an older brother, Richard Lilly Jr., and a younger brother, David Maher Lilly. A fourth child, Mary Catherine Lilly, died in infancy. Lilly showed an interest in science at an early age. At thirteen years old, he was an avid chemistry hobbyist, supplementing his makeshift basement laboratory with chemicals given to him by a pharmacist friend. Students at his parochial Catholic grade-school called him \\"Einstein Jr.\\" At age 14 he enrolled at St. Paul Academy, a college preparatory academy for boys, where his teachers encouraged him to pursue science further and conduct his experiments in the school laboratory after hours. While at SPA, Lilly also further developed his interest in philosophy. He studied the works of many of the great philosophers, finding himself especially attracted to the subjective idealism of Anglo-Irish theologian and philosopher George Berkeley. Despite his father's wish that he go to an eastern Ivy League university to become a banker, Lilly received a scholarship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, where he studied biology. He was the president of the ski-club, a member of the drama-club and lived in Blacker House.http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2256/1/1938.pdf After his first year, Caltech learned that Lilly was from a wealthy family and cancelled his scholarship, forcing him to go to his father for help. Dick Lilly set up a trust-fund to pay the tuition and eventually became a benefactor of the college. Lilly continued to draw on his family wealth to fund his scientific pursuits throughout his life. In 1934, Lilly read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The pharmacological control methods of Huxley's dystopia and the links between physical chemical processes of the brain and subjective experiences of the mind helped inspire Lilly to give up his study of physics and pursue biology, eventually focusing on neurophysiology. Lilly was engaged to Mary Crouch at the beginning of his junior year at Caltech. Months before their wedding, he took a job with a lumber-company in the Northwest to soothe a bout of \\"nervous exhaustion\\" brought on by the pressures of academia and his upcoming marriage. During this sabbatical he was hospitalized after injuring his foot with an ax while cutting brush. His time in the trauma-ward inspired him to become a doctor of medicine. In 1937, while Lilly was looking for a good medical school, his wealthy and well-connected father arranged a meeting between Lilly and Charles Horace Mayo of the famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Following Mayo's advice, Lilly applied and was accepted to Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he became good friends with Mayo's son, Charles William Mayo. Lilly graduated from Caltech with a Bachelor of Science degree on June 10, 1938, and enrolled at Dartmouth the following September. At Dartmouth, Lilly launched into the study of anatomy, performing dissections on 32 cadavers during his time there. He once stretched out an entire intestinal tract across the length of a room to determine its actual length with certainty. During the summer after his first year at Dartmouth, Lilly returned to Pasadena to participate in an experiment with his former Caltech biochemistry professor Henry Borsook. The purpose of the experiment was to study the creation of glycocyamine, a major source of muscle power in the human body. The experiment involved putting Lilly on a completely protein-free diet while administering measured doses of glycine and arginine, the two amino acids that Borsook hypothesized were involved in the creation of glycocyamine. The experiments pushed Lilly to extreme physical and mental limits; he became increasingly weak and delirious as the weeks went on. The results of the experiment confirmed Borsook's hypothesis and Lilly's name was included among the authors, making it the first published research paper of his career. It was also one of the first instances of a lifelong pattern of experimenting on his own body to the point of endangering his health. After two years at Dartmouth, Lilly decided that he wanted to pursue a career in medical research, rather than therapeutic practice as was standard for Dartmouth medical students at that time. He decided to transfer to the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania which would provide him with better opportunities for conducting research. At the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly met Professor H. Cuthbert Bazett, a protege of British physiologist J. B. S. Haldane. Bazett introduced Lilly to Haldane's view that scientists should never conduct an experiment or procedure on another person that they have not first conducted on themselves, a view Lilly embraced and attempted to exemplify throughout his career. Bazett took a liking to the young, enthusiastic graduate student, and set Lilly up with his own research laboratory. While working under Bazett, Lilly created his first invention, the electrical capacitance diaphragm manometer, a device for measuring blood pressure. While designing the instrument, he received electrical engineering advice from biophysics pioneer Britton Chance. Chance also introduced Lilly to the world of computers, which was still in its infancy. While finishing his degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly enrolled in a class entitled \\"How to Build an Atomic Bomb\\". He and several other students transcribed their notes from the class into a book with the same title. The director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves, attempted to suppress publication of the book, but was unable to because no classified data was used in writing the book. Lilly graduated with a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942. Career overview Lilly was a physician and psychoanalyst. He made contributions in the fields of biophysics, neurophysiology, electronics, computer science, and neuroanatomy. He invented and promoted the use of an isolation tank as a means of sensory deprivation. He also attempted communication between humans and dolphins. Lilly's eclectic career began as a conventional scientist doing research for universities and government. Gradually, however, he began researching unconventional topics. He published 19 books, including The Center of the Cyclone, which describes his own LSD experiences, and Man and Dolphin and The Mind of the Dolphin, which describe his work with dolphins. In the mid 1950s, Lilly began dolphin cognition and communication research, with an intensive period of work through the late 1960s. This period brought many discoveries about dolphin anatomy and brain structure, as well as behavioral and communication observations. Originally researching at Coconut Grove, Florida, Lilly purchased a property in St. Thomas in 1960. The seaside lab was converted into a dolphin-human cohabitation house by purposely flooding part of the building. It was at this facility that Lilly assistant Margaret Howe Lovatt worked with the dolphin Peter in attempts at inter-species communication. In the 1980s Lilly directed a project that attempted to teach dolphins a computer-synthesised language. He designed a future \\"communications laboratory\\" that would be a floating living room where humans and dolphins could chat as equals and develop a common language. In the 1990s Lilly moved to Maui, Hawaii, where he lived most of the remainder of his life. His literary rights and scientific discoveries were owned by Human Software, Inc., while his philanthropic endeavors were owned by the Human Dolphin Foundation. The John C. Lilly Research Institute, Inc. continues to research topics of interest to Lilly and carry on his legacy. = Research = During World War II, Lilly researched the physiology of high- altitude flying and invented instruments for measuring gas pressure. After the war, he trained in psychoanalysis at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began researching the physical structures of the brain and consciousness. In 1951 he published a paper showing how he could display patterns of brain electrical activity on a cathode ray display screen using electrodes he devised specially for insertion into a living brain. Furthermore, Lilly's work on electrical stimulation of the nervous system gave rise to biphasic charge balanced electrical stimulation pulses (later known as \\"Lilly's wave\\" or \\"Lilly's pulses\\"), now an established approach to design of safe electrical stimulation in neuroprosthetics. In the 1960s he sponsored research on Human‚Äìanimal communication with a dolphin. = Development of the isolation tank = Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, and John C. Lilly in 1991 In 1953, Lilly began a job studying neurophysiology with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Corps. At the N.I.M.H. in 1954,Gelb (2007), p. 140 with the aim of isolating a brain from external stimulation, he devised the first isolation tank, a dark soundproof tank of warm salt water in which subjects could float for long periods in sensory isolation. Lilly and a research colleague were the first subjects of this research. What had been known as perceptual isolation or sensory deprivation was reconceptualized as Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (R.E.S.T.). Lilly later studied other large-brained mammals and during the late 1950s he established a facility devoted to fostering human-dolphin communication: the Communication Research Institute on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. During the early 1960s, Lilly and coworkers published several papers reporting that dolphins could mimic human speech patterns. = S.E.T.I. = Lilly was interested in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. In 1961 a group of scientists including Lilly gathered at the Green Bank Observatory to discuss the possibility of using the techniques of radio astronomy to detect evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. They called themselves The Order of the Dolphin after Lilly's work with dolphins. They discussed the Drake equation, used to estimate the number of communicative civilizations in our galaxy. = Exploration of human consciousness = In the early 1960s, Lilly was introduced to psychedelic drugs such as LSD and began a series of experiments in which he ingested a psychedelic drug either in an isolation tank or in the company of dolphins. These events are described in his books Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer, published in 1968, and The Center of the Cyclone, published in 1972. Following advice from Ram Dass, Lilly studied Patanjali's system of yoga (finding I. K. Taimni's Science of Yoga, a modernized interpretation of the Sanskrit text, most suited to his goals). He also paid special attention to self-enquiry meditation advocated by Ramana Maharshi, and reformulated the principles of this exercise with reference to his human biocomputer paradigm (described in Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments and The Center of the Cyclone). Lilly later traveled to Chile and trained with the spiritual leader Oscar Ichazo (whose attitude to metaphysical consciousness exploration Lilly characterized as \\"empirical\\" in his book The Center of the Cyclone). Lilly claimed to have achieved the maximum degree of satori-samƒÅdhi consciousness during his training. Lilly's maxim: \\"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits. However, in the province of the body there are definite limits not to be transcended.\\"John C Lilly ‚Äì The Human Biocomputer (1974) =\\"Solid State Intelligence\\"= Solid State Intelligence (S.S.I.) is a malevolent entity described by Lilly in his 1978 autobiography, The Scientist. According to Lilly, the network of computation-capable solid state systems (electronics) engineered by humans will eventually develop into an autonomous \\"bioform\\". Since the optimal survival conditions for this bioform (low-temperature vacuum) are drastically different from those humans need (room temperature aerial atmosphere and adequate water supply), Lilly predicted (or \\"prophesied\\", based on his ketamine-induced visions) a dramatic conflict between the two forms of intelligence. =Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.)= In 1974, Lilly's research using various psychoactive drugs led him to believe in the existence of a certain hierarchical group of cosmic entities, the lowest of which he later dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.) in an autobiography published jointly with his wife Antonietta (often called Toni). Lilly states that \\"[t]here exists a Cosmic Coincidence Control Center (CCCC) with a Galactic substation called Galactic Coincidence Control (GCC). Within GCC is the Solar System Control Unit (SSCU), within which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO).\\"John C. Lilly The Dyadic Cyclone: The autobiography of a couple. with Antonietta Lilly (1st ed.). Simon and Schuster. (1976) p20 Lilly also wrote that there are nine conditions that should be followed by people who seek to experience coincidence in their own lives: # You must know/assume/simulate our existence in E.C.C.O. # You must be willing to accept our responsibility for control of your coincidences. # You must exert your best capabilities for your survival programs and your own development as an advancing/advanced member of E.C.C.O.'s earthside corps of controlled coincidence workers. You are expected to use your best intelligence in this service. # You are expected to expect the unexpected every minute, every hour of every day and of every night. # You must be able to maintain conscious/thinking/reasoning no matter what events we arrange to happen to you. Some of these events will seem cataclysmic/catastrophic/overwhelming: remember stay aware, no matter what happens/apparently happens to you. # You are in our training program for life: there is no escape from it. We (not you) control the long-term coincidences; you (not we) control the shorter-term coincidences by your own efforts. # Your major mission on earth is to discover/create that which we do to control the long-term coincidence patterns: you are being trained on Earth to do this job. # When your mission on planet Earth is completed, you will no longer be required to remain/return there. # Remember the motto passed to us (from G.C.C. via S.S.C.U.): \\"Cosmic Love is absolutely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not.\\"John C.

Lilly ‚Äì NNDBErowid John Lilly Vault : Obituary ‚Äì Erowid In popular culture Lilly's work with dolphins and the development of the sensory deprivation tank have been referenced in movies, music and television productions. Dolphin Island: A Story of the People of the Sea is a 1963 novel by Arthur C. Clarke set in a strange and fascinating research community where a brilliant professor tries to communicate with dolphins. In the 1972 novel The Listeners, Lilly and the other scientists who were members of the Order of the Dolphin are mentioned as pioneers. In the 1973 movie The Day of the Dolphin, George C. Scott portrayed a Lilly-esque scientist, known to the dolphins as \\"Pa\\", who succeeds in teaching a dolphin to speak elementary English. The 1980 movie Altered States, based on Paddy Chayefsky's novel of the same name, features actor William Hurt regressing to a simian form by ingesting psychoactive substances and then experiencing the effects of prolonged occupation of a sensory deprivation chamber. In 1985, Dale Peterson and early art game designer, John O'Neill consulted Lilly for assistance in developing their Commodore 64 game, The Dolphin's Pearl (later retitled as The Dolphin's Rune). Ed Annunziata, the producer of the 1992 Sega video game Ecco the Dolphin, has stated that he read a lot of Lilly's works. Whether or not any of it served as an inspiration for the game is unknown. Annunziata never directly cited Lilly's works as an inspiration. He has confirmed that Ecco the Dolphin is not named after Lilly's E.C.C.O. Layer 09 of the 1998 Japanese animation series Serial Experiments Lain makes reference to E.C.C.O. and Lilly's work with dolphins. The episode deals with the development of Protocol 7, a modification of The Wired, which is expected to network all humans without need of a device. The result will be that Earth's consciousness will awaken as people become linked nodes in The Wired network. This is compared to Lilly's view that dolphin communication is a form of long-distance networking. Oysterhead's 2001 album, The Grand Pecking Order, includes the song \\"Oz is Ever Floating\\", which includes numerous references to Lilly. On June 15, 2014, comedians Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds published an episode of their podcast The Dollop about Lilly, where they detail his life, research, and drug use.

It was translated into Latin as Systema cosmicumMaurice A. Finocchiaro: Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992, University of California Press, 2007 , () in 1635 by Matthias Bernegger.Journal for the history of astronomy, 2005 The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632. In the Copernican system, the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the Ptolemaic system, everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The Dialogue was published in Florence under a formal license from the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo was found to be \\"vehemently suspect of heresy\\" based on the book, which was then placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822).The Trial of Galileo: A Chronology In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.See Galileo affair for more details, including sources. Overview While writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his Dialogue on the Tides, and when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the tides using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is Dialogue, which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744. This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument. =Structure= The book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman: * Salviati argues for the Copernican position and presents some of Galileo's views directly, calling him the \\"Academician\\" in honor of Galileo's membership in the Accademia dei Lincei. He is named after Galileo's friend Filippo Salviati (1582‚Äì1614). * Sagredo is an intelligent layman who is initially neutral. He is named after Galileo's friend Giovanni Francesco Sagredo (1571‚Äì1620). * Simplicio, a dedicated follower of Ptolemy and Aristotle, presents the traditional views and the arguments against the Copernican position. He is supposedly named after Simplicius of Cilicia, a sixth-century commentator on Aristotle, but it was suspected the name was a double entendre, as the Italian for \\"simple\\" (as in \\"simple minded\\") is \\"semplice\\".Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe (1959), Penguin Books, 1986 edition: , 978014055212X 1990 reprint: , Simplicio is modeled on two contemporary conservative philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe (1565‚Äì1616?), Galileo's opponent, and Cesare Cremonini (1550‚Äì1631), a Paduan colleague who had refused to look through the telescope.Stillman Drake: Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography, Courier Dover Publications, 2003, , page 355 : Cremonini and delle Colombe Colombe was the leader of a group of Florentine opponents of Galileo's, which some of the latter's friends referred to as \\"the pigeon league\\".\\"La legha del pippione\\". \\"Pippione\\" is a pun on Colombe's surname‚Äîwhich is the plural of the Italian word for dove. Galileo's friends, the painter, Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli , his former student, Benedetto Castelli, and a couple of his other correspondents often referred to Colombe as \\"il Colombo\\", which means \\"the Pigeon\\". Galileo himself used this term a couple of times in a letter to Cigoli of October, 1611 (Edizione Nazionale 11:214). The more derisive nickname, \\"il Pippione\\", sometimes used by Cigoli (Edizione Nazionale 11:176, 11:229, 11:476,11:502), is a now archaic Italian word with a triple entendre. Besides meaning \\"young pigeon\\", it is also a jocular term for a testicle, and a Tuscan dialect word for a fool. =Content= The discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of William Gilbert's work on magnetism. Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion. A classic argument against Earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the Earth surface, though it moves, by the Earth's rotation, at about 1700 km/h at the equator. In this category there is a thought experiment in which a man is below decks on a ship and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is just the same whether the ship is moving or not. This is a classic exposition of the Inertial frame of reference and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west. The bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes: * Rebuttals to the objections raised by traditional philosophers; for example, the thought experiment on the ship. * Observations that are incompatible with the Ptolemaic model: the phases of Venus, for instance, which simply could not happen, or the apparent motions of sunspots, which could only be explained in the Ptolemaic or Tychonic systems as resulting from an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation.Drake, (1970, pp.191‚Äì196), Linton (2004, pp. 211‚Äì12), Sharratt (1994, p. 166). This is not true, however, for geocentric systems‚Äîsuch as that proposed by Longomontanus‚Äîin which the Earth rotated. In such systems the apparent motion of sunspots could be accounted for just as easily as in Copernicus's. * Arguments showing that the elegant unified theory of the Heavens that the philosophers held, which was believed to prove that the Earth was stationary, was incorrect; for instance, the mountains of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, and the very existence of sunspots, none of which was part of the old astronomy. Generally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries. Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue. Galileo attempted a fourth class of argument: * Direct physical argument for the Earth's motion, by means of an explanation of tides. As an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the \\"Fourth Day\\" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is‚Äîlike nearly anything having to do with Galileo‚Äîa matter of controversy. On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as \\"cockamamie.\\" On the other hand, Einstein used a rather different description: > It was Galileo's longing for a mechanical proof of the motion of the earth > which misled him into formulating a wrong theory of the tides. The > fascinating arguments in the last conversation would hardly have been > accepted as proof by Galileo, had his temperament not got the better of him. > [Emphasis added](passages omitted), quoting page xvii of Einstein's foreword > in =Omissions= A copy of the Dialogo, Florence edition, located at the Tom Slick rare book collection at Southwest Research Institute, in Texas. The Dialogue does not treat the Tychonic system, which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect. The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system; it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models. Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the Sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth; Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the Earth. The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a stellar parallax, while the Tychonian system predicts none. Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system. Galileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise. A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the Dialogue. For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that Foucault's pendulum apparently provided two centuries later. With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems. Galileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although Johannes Kepler had sent him a copy of his 1609 book, Astronomia nova, in which he proposes elliptical orbits‚Äîcorrectly calculating that of Mars. Prince Federico Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of planetary motion presented in the book as common knowledge; Galileo's Opere, Ed.Naz., XI (Florence 1901) pages 365-367\\"Kepler\\", by Max Caspar, page 137 Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Four and a half decades after Galileo's death, Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity, from which a heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible. Summary Preface: To the Discerning Reader refers to the ban on the \\"Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves\\" and says that the author \\"takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis\\". He introduces the friends Sagredo and Salviati with whom he had had discussions as well as the peripatetic philosopher Simplicio. =Day one= He starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati cannot understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were \\"trifles which later spread among the vulgar\\" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration was not always needed. Salviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of 1572 and 1604 and sunspots, seen through the new telescope. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of a priori arguments. Salviati suggests that he uses his experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that he would change his mind in the present circumstances. Simplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the Sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, \\"it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning.'\\" Experiments with a mirror are used to show that the Moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He refuses to accept that mountains on the Moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the Earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon. Sagredo holds that he considers the Earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the Moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it would not sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works. =Day two= The second day starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. \\"It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself.\\" There is one supreme motion‚Äîthat by which the Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the Earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one. Motion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the Earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement? The movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the Earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions. The great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the Moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the Earth rotates every day, but if the Earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years. In addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the primum mobile and the need for this extra sphere disappears. Actual path of cannonball B is from C to D They consider three main objections to the motion of the Earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the Earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the impetus of the cannon. He also points out that attempting to prove that the Earth does not move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of paralogism (assuming what is to be proved), because if the Earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated). In rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the Moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material does not make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork. In fact, a ball falling from such a height would not fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the Earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to Earth. Calling it gravity does not explain what it is. =Day three= Salviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the novas he has been reading overnight. Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere. Simplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the Earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salviati points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes. The Solar System He points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the Sun not the Earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the Earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the Sun. Mars must also go about the Sun (as well as the Earth) since it is never seen horned, unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest. Sagredo brings up two other common objections. If the Earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend. Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still does not understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well. Salviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the Earth, the unique existence of the Moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the moons of Jupiter, which would appear like Earth's Moon to any Jovian. How retrogression is explained by Copernicus Copernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast epicycles. Mars, above the Sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the Earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the Earth's orbit. Simplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the Earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over- calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the Sun and Moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord. But still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the Sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that \\"it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us\\". Has Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the Earth? Do any of them know how much variation is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away. Sagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the Earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time. =Day four= They are in Sagredo's house in Venice, where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the Earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: daily (diurnal), generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; monthly, seemingly from the Moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and annual, leading to different sizes at the equinoxes. He considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both‚Äîthis happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the Straits of Messina there are very swift currents between Scylla and Charybdis. In the open Mediterranean the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable. Simplicio counters with the peripatetic explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the Moon over the water, though this does not explain the risings when the Moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle. When the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow. So could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards. Consider a point on the Earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. The length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations. The primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the Hellespont and the Aegean the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the Red Sea has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins. Simplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the steady winds from east to west in the oceans in the torrid zone. It seems that the Moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the Moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.

It usually supplements product positioning techniques like multi dimensional scaling or factor analysis and is used to create ideal vectors on perceptual maps. Application Starting with raw data from surveys, researchers apply positioning techniques to determine important dimensions and plot the position of competing products on these dimensions. Next they regress the survey data against the dimensions. The independent variables are the data collected in the survey. The dependent variable is the preference datum. Like all regression methods, the computer fits weights to best predict data. The resultant regression line is referred to as an ideal vector because the slope of the vector is the ratio of the preferences for the two dimensions. If all the data is used in the regression, the program will derive a single equation and hence a single ideal vector. This tends to be a blunt instrument so researchers refine the process with cluster analysis. This creates clusters that reflect market segments. Separate preference regressions are then done on the data within each segment. This provides an ideal vector for each segment. Alternative methods Self-stated importance method is an alternative method in which direct survey data is used to determine the weightings rather than statistical imputations. A third method is conjoint analysis in which an additive method is used.

The titles in the series are The Enchanted Wood (1939), The Magic Faraway Tree (1943), The Folk of the Faraway Tree (1946) and Up the Faraway Tree (1951). The stories take place in an enchanted wood in which a gigantic magical tree grows ‚Äì the eponymous 'Faraway Tree'. The tree is so tall that its topmost branches reach into the clouds and it is wide enough to contain small houses carved into its trunk. The wood and the tree are discovered by three children named Jo, Bessie and Fanny (later updated to Joe, Beth and Frannie), who move into a house nearby. It is then that they went on adventures to the top of the tree. Books The first title of the main trilogy, The Enchanted Wood, was published in 1939, although the Faraway Tree and Moon-Face had already made a brief appearance in 1936 in The Yellow Fairy Book. A picture-strip book, Up the Faraway Tree, was published in 1951. Over the years, the Faraway Tree stories have been illustrated by various artists including Dorothy Wheeler, Rene Cloke, Janet and Anne Grahame Johnstone, and Georgina Hargreaves.The Faraway Tree, The Enid Blyton Society. =The Enchanted Wood= In the first novel in the series, Jo, Bessie and Fanny move to live near a large wood. One day, they go for a walk in the wood and discover it is enchanted. During their walk they stumble across a tree whose branches seem to reach into the clouds. This is the Faraway Tree. When the children climb the Faraway Tree, they discover it is inhabited by different magical people, including Moon-Face, Silky the fairy, The Saucepan Man, Dame Washalot, Mr. Watzisname and the Angry Pixie. They befriend some of these people, in particular Moon-Face and Silky. At the very top of the tree, they discover a ladder which leads them to a magical land. This land is different on each visit, because each place moves on from the top of the tree to make way for a new land. The children are free to come and go, but they must leave before the land moves on, or they will be stuck there until that same land returns to the Faraway Tree. In various chapters, one of the children gets stuck in the land. The lands at the top are sometimes extremely unpleasant ‚Äì for example, the Land of Dame Slap (altered to Dame Snap in revised editions), an aggressive school teacher; and sometimes fantastically enjoyable - notably the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Goodies, the Land of Take-What-You-Want and the Land of Do-As-You-Please. The first land the three children visit is the Roundabout Land, where they give some cake to two rabbits, and the rabbits dig a hole for themselves and the three children. The last land they visit in this book is the Land of Birthdays, where the brownies and the inhabitants of the Faraway Tree celebrate Bessie's birthday. =The Magic Faraway Tree= Rick, the cousin of Joe, Beth and Frannie, come to stay and he joins the secret adventures in the lands of the Faraway Tree. In later revisions, his name is updated to Rick. Dick is not interested at first, but later on he becomes interested and gets into mischief. Together they venture into many new lands and have a lot of fun. For example, in the Land of Medicines, some houses are made of medicines. =The Folk of the Faraway Tree= Connie, a spoilt and stuck-up girl, comes to stay for the summer with the children while her mother, Lizzie, is sick. At first, Connie refuses to believe in the Faraway Tree or the magical folk who live in it, even when the Angry Pixie throws ink at her and when Dame Washalot soaks her. Jo, Bessie and Fanny take her to the lands at the top of the tree and Connie gets a few surprises! The Saucepan Man's mother decides to live in the tree, leaving her job as a baker in Dame Slap's land. She sets up a surprising cake shop in the tree. Characters The main characters are Jo, Bessie and Fanny (updated in recent revisions to Joe, Beth and Frannie), who are three siblings. Fanny is the youngest, Bessie is next in age and Jo is their big brother. They live near the Enchanted Wood and are friends of the residents of the Faraway Tree. Other characters include: * The Angry Pixie, who lives in a house with a tiny window and has a habit of throwing cold water or any liquid at hand over people who dare to peep inside; * The barn owl, who lives in the house next to the Angry Pixie's. He is a friend of Silky's; * Silky the fairy is so named because of her long, golden hair. She is one of the regular companions of the children when they go up the Tree to other worlds; * Mr. Watzisname cannot remember his name. He sleeps and snores all the time. During a particular story at the Land of Secrets, Mr. Watzisname discovers his name, then forgets it almost immediately as it is so long; * Dame Washalot, who spends her time washing her clothes and throwing the dirty wash-water down the tree. If she has no clothes to wash, she washes the dirty laundry of other people and even the leaves of the Faraway Tree; * Moon-Face is so named for his round face that looks like the moon. His house is similarly round and is filled with curved furniture. He is the owner of the slippery-slip, a slide which starts in the middle of his house which lets you slide down to the bottom of the Faraway Tree instead of climbing down. It is used as a means of exiting the tree and has played an important part in some of the adventures, where others have sought control of the tree or their rooms; * The Saucepan Man, who lives with Mr. Watzisname. His name stems from the fact that he is covered all over with saucepans and kettles. Sometimes, he cannot understand what his friends are saying because he is partially deaf, which is further aggravated by all the noise from the pans and kettles which he carries all the time. In the cartoon series, he looks very similar to Horace and Jasper from 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The Saucepan Man also appears in another lesser-known Blyton book, The Book of Brownies (aka Brownie Tales), helping the travellers out of one of their many bouts of trouble on their journey; * The Saucepan Man's mother, who lives with Dame Washalot after The Folk of the Faraway Tree. She runs a cake shop; * Dame Slap, who runs a school for bad pixies which, in some of the adventures, the friends accidentally land in. Her name has been updated in later revisions of the book to Dame Snap. Updates In modern reprints, the names of some of the characters have been changed. Jo has been changed to Joe, the more common spelling for males, and Bessie is now Beth, the former name having fallen out of usage as a nickname for Elizabeth. Fanny and Dick, whose names now carry unfortunate connotations, have been renamed Frannie and Rick. Dame Slap has become Dame Snap, and no longer practises corporal punishment but instead reprimands her students by shouting at them. Entire passages of the original have been rewritten to remove references to fighting. For instance, when the tree is taken over by Goblins in The Enchanted Wood, the Goblins were originally fought off, with descriptions of Mr. Watzisname 'pummelling them as if he were beating carpets' and the Saucepan Man throwing his saucepans at them. These have been replaced with cursory references to 'chasing'. Adaptations =Film= In October 2014, it was announced that the books will be adapted for the cinema for the first time and are being developed for a live action film version by Sam Mendes' production company, Neal Street Productions. =Television= In 1997, stories from the novels were adapted into animated ten-minute episodes for the TV series Enid Blyton's Enchanted Lands, the first series entitled Enchanted Lands: The Magic of the Faraway Tree and the second Enchanted Lands: The Adventures of the Wishing Chair. The voice cast were Roy Hudd, Richard Pearce, Kate Harbour, John Baddeley, Jimmy Hibbert, Janet James and David Holt.

They constitute one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China. They numbered 1,933,510 as of 2010. Names The Bai people hold the colour white in high esteem and call themselves \\"Baipzix\\" (', Baizi, ÁôΩÂ≠ê), \\"Bai'ho\\" (', Baihuo, ÁôΩ‰ºô), \\"Bai yinl\\" (', Baini, ÁôΩÂ∞º) or \\"Miep jiax\\". Bai people literally means 'white people' in Chinese. In 1956, the Chinese authorities named them the Bai nationality according to their preference. Historically, the Bai had also been called Minjia (Ê∞ëÂÆ∂) by the Chinese from the 14th century to 1949. The origin of the name Bai is not clear, but most scholars believe that it has a strong connection to the first state Bai people built in roughly the 3rd century AD. This state, called Baizi Guo (ÁôΩÂ≠êÂúã, State of Bai), was not documented in Chinese orthodox history but was frequently mentioned in the oral history of Yunnan Province. It was believed to be built by the first king, Longyouna (Èæç‰ΩëÈÇ£), who was given the family name \\"Zhang\\" (Âºµ) by Zhuge Liang, the chancellor of the state of Shu Han (221‚Äì263 CE). Zhuge Liang conquered the Dali region at that time and picked up Longyouna and assisted him in building the State of Bai. The State of Bai was located in present-day Midu County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. Location Bai Architecture Bai people live mostly in the provinces of Yunnan (Dali area), and in neighboring Guizhou (Bijie area) and Hunan (Sangzhi area) provinces. Of the 2 million Bai people, eighty percent live in concentrated communities in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province. History The origin of Bai was heavily debated over roughly the past century. Ironically those debates were of the groups of people who were assimilated into Bai, rather than the issue per se. According to archaeological excavations around the Lake Erhai, Bai people were originated in the lake area. The earliest human site was discovered in the early 20th century, which was called the paleolithic Malong relics of Mt. Cangshan (ËãçÂ±±È©¨ÈæôÈÅóÂùÄ), dated circa 4000 bp. The late sites include Haimenkou of Jianchuan (ÂâëÂ∑ùÊµ∑Èó®Âè£, 3000 bp), Baiyangcun of Binchuan (ÂÆæÂ∑ùÁôΩÁæäÊùë, 3500 bp), and Dabona of Xiangyun(Á••‰∫ëÂ§ßÊ≥¢ÈÇ£, 2350 bp). The Bai are mentioned in Tang Dynasty texts as the 'Bo (or Bai) People'. If the Bo transcription is correct then it would mean the earliest mention of the Bai was in the third century BCE in a text called Lushi Chunqi (Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lu Buwei). It was then mentioned again in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian in the first century BCE. The Bai made up one of the tribes who helped establish the Nanzhao Kingdom (649-902). The Dali Kingdom (937-1253) was founded by a Bai named Duan Siping whose family had played major roles in the Nanzhao Kingdom. It's likely that the Bai were one of the elite ethnic groups that ruled and composed the population of the two kingdoms. After the collapse of the Dali kingdom by the Mongols, the Bai never again enjoyed full political independence.  Language  An estimated 1,240,000 (as of 2003) of the Bai speak the Bai language in all its varieties. The origins of the language have been obscured by intensive Chinese influence of an extended period. Different scholars have proposed that it is an early offshoot or sister language of Chinese, or a separate group (though usually still within the Sino-Tibetan family). The Bai call themselves Baizi, Baini, or Baihuo. They have 60 other names, including the Han term Minjia (for the Bai in Dali). In the Tang and Song Dynasty, Bai was written using Chinese characters in a manner similar to the way in which the Man'y≈çgana (‰∏áÂè∂ÂÅáÂêç) were used to write Japanese. A Latin-based writing system was developed in 1957. Religion A tea-serving ceremonial ground. Although most Bai people adhere to a form of Buddhism that traces its history back to the Nanzhao Kingdom, they also have a native religion of Benzhuism: the worship of ngel zex (), local gods and ancestors. Ngel zex could be any heroes in history, the prince of the Nanzhao regime, a hero of folklore or even a tiger (for instance, Laojun Jingdi is a tiger). Most Bai people don't belong to any religion. There are minorities practicing Taoism and Christianity. George Clarke, arrived in 1881, was the first Protestant missionary to Bai population. The recent estimation of Bai Christian population is 50,000. There are a few villages in Yunnan where residents are Muslims, but speak Bai as their first language. These people are officially classified by Chinese authorities as belonging to the Hui nationality and call themselves Bai Hui (\\"Bai-speaking Muslims\\"). They usually say that their ancestors were Hui people, who came to Yunnan as followers of the Mongolian army in the 14th century. (1st edition appeared in 1991)  Culture  =Food= The Bai diet typically comprises sharp, cold and spicy flavours. Cured ham or fish with rice and are common dishes; for some groups based in mountain areas corn is a staple food. =Tea ceremony= The Bai tea ceremony, San Dao Cha ‰∏âÈÅìËå∂ (Three Course Tea), is most popular among the Bai in the Dali area and is a common sight at festivals and marriages. It is both a cultural ceremony and method of honouring a guest. The ceremony is often described in Mandarin as, 'Yiku, ertian, sanhuiwei' ‰∏ÄËã¶‰∫åÁîú‰∏âÂõûÂë≥ (First is bitter, Second is sweet, Third brings reflection (aftertaste)). The first tea course starts with baking the tea leaves in a clay pot over a small flame, shaking the leaves often whilst they bake. When they turn slightly brown and give off a distinct fragrance, heated water is added to the pot. The water should immediately begin bubbling. When the bubbling ceases a small amount of bitterly fragrant, concentrated tea remains. Due to the sound the hot water makes when it enters the clay pot the first course tea was, in previous times, also known as Lei Xiang Cha Èõ∑ÂìçËå∂ (Sound of Thunder Tea). The second course is sweet tea. Pieces of walnut kernel and roasted rushan (‰π≥Êâá, lit. milk fan), a dried cheese specific to the Dali region, are put into a tea cup with brown sugar and other ingredients. Boiling water is added and the tea is then offered to the guest. This tea is sweet without being oily, so the guest can easily drink it. The third tea is made by mixing honey, Sichuan pepper, slices of ginger and cassia together in a china cup with hot Cangshan Xue green tea. The product is a tea that is sweet, coarse and spicy all at once. This Dali specialty has a noticeable aftertaste, which meant it was known as Hui Wei Cha ÂõûÂë≥Ëå∂ (Reflection Tea). The 18 procedures of the tea ceremony are governed by strict etiquette, which follows the principles of etiquette, honesty and beauty. As such, the tea ceremony is considered by some to perfectly embody the hospitable Bai people's current customs. =Fashion= The Bai people, as their name would suggest, favor white clothes and decorations. Women generally wear white dresses, sleeveless jackets of red, blue or black color, embroidered belts, loose trousers, embroidered shoes of white cloth, and jewelry made of gold or silver. Women in Dali traditionally wear a white coat trimmed with a black or purple collar, loose blue trousers; embroidered shoes, silver bracelets and earrings. Unmarried women wear a single pigtail on the top of the head, while married women roll their hair. The men wear white jackets, black-collared coats, and dark loose shorts. Their headwear and costume reflect the Bai symbols: the snow, the moon, the flower, and the wind. The modern Bai are famous for their tie dyes and use them for wall hangings, table decorations, clothing, etc. Many Bai women style their hair in a long braid wrapped in a headcloth. This style is called \\"the phoenix bows its head\\". =Festivals= The grandest festival of the Bai people is the Third Month Fair, held annually at the foot of Mount Cangshan in Dali between the fifteenth and the twentieth day of the third lunar month. Originally it was religious activity to rally and pay homage, but it gradually evolved into a fair including performances of traditional sports and dance, as well as the trade of merchandise from different regions. Another important festival is the Torch Festival, held on the 25th day of the sixth lunar month to wish health and a good harvest. On that evening, the countryside is decorated with banners with auspicious words written upon them. Villagers then light torches in front of their gates and walk around the fields while holding yet more torches in order to catch pests. = Arts = The Bai have a traditional form of theater called Chuichuiqiang. However, this local tradition is endangered just as traditional Bai culture is in general.  Livelihood  = Primary occupations = Most Bai are agriculturalists. They cultivate many crops like rice, wheat, rapeseed, sugar, millet, cotton, cane, corn, and tobacco. However, some Bai also engage in fishing and selling local handicrafts to tourists. = Cormorant fishing = See also: Cormorant fishing ¬ß China Bai fishermen have trained cormorants to fish since the 9th century. Decreases in water quality and the high costs of cormorant training have resulted in recent disuse of the practice, though cormorant fishing is still done by local fishers today for tourists.  Architecture  The Bai architecture is characterized by three buildings forming a U and a fourth wall as a screen. The middle has a courtyard. The houses are usually built out of brick and wood, and the main room is in the middle (opposite the screen wall). The screen wall is built with brick and stone. The house is painted in white with black tile paintings depicting animals and other natural images. The detailing usually is made of clay sculpture, woodcarving, colored drawing, stone inscription, marble screens and dark brink. It produces a very striking and elegant effect.

It was fought between Julius Caesar and an army led by Gnaeus Pompey who had the backing of the majority of the Roman Senate. The battle was a victory for Pompey, albeit not a decisive one. The Battle at Dyrrachium preceded the Battle of Pharsalus which was the decisive turning point in the Civil War leading to a Caesarian victory. Prelude By the end of Julius Caesar's first year as consul he had accumulated a large list of lawsuits. Roman law gave government officials immunity from prosecution but only during their term of office. Once he became a private citizen Caesar knew he would be vulnerable. Instead, as was usual for a consul at the end of his term, Caesar obtained a proconsul position, or governorship, over the territories of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum (modern day Albania), with the later addition of Transalpine Gaul. What was unusual was the length of Caesar's term as proconsul, which was for five years instead of the usual one year. Moreover, prior to the end of his five years as proconsul of Gaul and Illyricum, Caesar assisted his allies Crassus and Pompey in being elected consuls, who in turn extended his pro-consulship for a further five years. At the end of his term as proconsul, having now met the condition that there be a minimum of ten years between elections as consul, Caesar intended to stand for the consulship in absentia, and upon being elected go straight from his proconsular command into the second consulship. In this way, he would maintain his imperium and thereby not be vulnerable to lawsuits. However, the Senate ordered him to resign command of his army. Caesar replied that he would agree to resign his military command only if Pompey followed suit. Offended by Caesar's response, the Senate demanded he immediately disband his army, or be declared an enemy of the people. In 50 BC, at his Proconsular term's expiry, the Senate forbade Caesar's standing for election in absentia for a second consulship and because of this, Caesar thought he would be prosecuted and rendered politically marginalised if he entered Rome without consular immunity or his army. Caesar responded by marching on Rome and he forced the unprepared Pompey and his allies to flee to Greece, starting the Great Roman Civil War.  Civil War  Caesar did not immediately give chase to Pompey and instead consolidated power in Rome and Italy. He had other problems as well; Pompey had left him with no ships to cross the Adriatic, and Spain had begun to mobilize against Caesar. After gathering the remainder of his forces from Transalpine Gaul (modern day France) he marched into Spain and subdued enough of the country so that it wouldn't intervene during his campaign against Pompey. He then turned his full attention to Pompey. Having only assembled half the needed ships, Caesar decided to take seven available legions across the Adriatic, and to then have the ships travel back to Brundisium, (modern-day Brindisi), and transport the remaining legions once they had arrived at Brundisium. Travel across the Adriatic Sea to Greece would ordinarily be tricky, but was made more so given that it was winter. However, this situation did assist Caesar because the Adriatic was sufficiently treacherous to deter the war galleys of Pompey's fleet, commanded by Caesar's former co-consul Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, at Corfu. As it was winter Bibulus was unprepared and Caesar was able to sail through the blockade easily and form a beachhead at Epirus with the first half of his army. Bibulus, however, was able to block Caesar's attempt to sail his reinforcements stuck at Brundisium. Bibulus died while conducting this blockade and no overall naval commander was appointed by Pompey. At some point Lucius Scribonius Libo attempted to make the blockade more secure by seizing the island off Brundisium preventing Caesar's reinforcements from sailing anywhere. However, Libo could not sustain this position because of a lack of water. Caesar's blunder had put him in the worst possible position any army could find itself. His army had no way to resupply from Rome due to the naval blockade, he couldn't resupply locally as Greece was pro-Pompey and closed their gates to Caesar, and his army was only at half strength. So dire was his situation that he made several attempts to discuss peace with Pompey but was refused at every channel. Realizing he was going to have to fight his way out, he attempted another winter blockade run back to Italy to lead his remaining forces to Greece. His luck was not with him and the rough seas and storms forced him back. However, his Master of the Horse Marc Antony fired up his troops and after several attempts evaded Libo's blockade and managed to land at Nympheum (Sh√´ngjin in Albania) with four more legions. It was now a race against time as both Caesar and Pompey rushed to meet Antony. Although Pompey reached Antony first Caesar was right on his heels and Pompey prudently moved his forces to Dyrrachium to prevent becoming caught between the two forces. The Siege At Dyrrachium Pompey held a strong defensive position; his back was guarded by the sea, and at his front there were hills that commanded the immediate area. He established his camp on the top of a rocky outcrop called Petra, overlooking the Egnatian Way and protecting a reasonable anchorage for his ships about five miles to the south of his base.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 194. An assault on Pompey's position was nearly impossible, therefore Caesar ordered men to build earthworks and fortifications to pin Pompey against the sea. His motives for doing so were three-fold: to prevent Pompey from getting fodder for his animals; to render his cavalry ineffective and thus protect his own foraging parties; and to reduce Pompey's standing in the eyes of the foreigners and his own men by putting him on the defensive and making him openly refuse battle.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 194; Caesar, Bello Civili, III 43.3. Pompey responded with earthworks and fortifications of his own; thereby enclosing an area of grazing land as wide as possible and trying to stretch Caesar's lines to its limits. Between these two fortifications a no man's land was created which saw constant skirmishes with little or no gain. Caesar records one battle in particular, fought in mid- June, for the control of the vital hill of Paliama, some three miles south of Pompey's camp.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp. 194‚Äì196; Caesar, Bello Civili, III 45.2‚Äì6. Using archers, slingers and lightly armed infantry supported by catapults, Pompey's men dislodged the Caesarian Ninth Legion from its position, but failed to take full advantage of the withdrawal and their pursuit was halted by an uphill counter-charge by Caesar's legionaries. Caesar held the outlying farmland but it had been picked clean and Pompey, with the sea at his back, was able to be resupplied by ship. However, as the siege wore on, their positions began to change. Pompey found it difficult with the limited land he controlled to create enough fodder for his horses, and other supplies such as fresh water became more and more difficult to maintain. The autumn harvest was approaching and soon Caesar would have enough food to prolong his position. If Pompey's army was not to be destroyed by disease during the summer and lose all its animals, Caesar's siege-works had to be breached. Pompey decided to try and lure Caesar away from the fortifications by means of a false message that some of the inhabitants of Dyrrachium were prepared to betray the town to him, and meanwhile lauch a three-pronged attack against forts in the centre of the siege-line. At two of these forts one cohort under Lucius Minucius Basilus and three cohorts under Gaius Volcatius Tullus put up stiff resistance against five of Pompey's legions until they were relieved by a force of two legions from the main camp under Publius Cornelius Sulla. The Pompeians became cut off on a hill-top between the two lines for five days before Pompey could withdraw them. Caesar reckoned the Pompeian losses at 2,000.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp. 196‚Äì197. At Dyrrachium Caesar only just escaped the ambush Pompey had set for him. He responded by building fortifications to cut off the two approaches to the town and prevented Pompey's horses from grazing in the countryside to the north.Dio, Roman History, XLI. 50. 3‚Äì4. By midsummer, though, Pompey had a fortunate stroke of luck. Two Gallic noblemen were caught stealing the pay from auxiliary cavalry under their command, but managed to escape to Pompey. With these two men on his side, Pompey was able to discover the weakest point in Caesar's wall.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_dyrrhachium.html At the southern end of the circumvallation, where it came close to the sea, Caesar was building a second wall 200 metres south of the main one to protect his defenders from a sea-borne attack from the rear, but it was unfinished and the area between the walls was undefended from the seaward side.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 197. The battle Pompey mounted a frontal attack of six legions against Caesar's line where it joined the sea and where the IX legion was stationed. Pompey also sent some auxiliaries and light infantry to attack by sea. Heavily outnumbering the Caesarian troops and attacking them from the front and the rear, the Pompeian troops broke through the weakened fortifications, causing the Ninth to pull back from the onslaught with heavy losses. Caesar swiftly reinforced the breach with 4,000 men. Twelve cohorts under Mark Antony then counterattacked, re-securing part of the wall and pushing Pompey's disordered forces back. Although Caesar's counterattack was initially successful, Pompey's forces were simply too numerous. During the morning Pompey consolidated his newly-won position by building a camp south of the Caesarian walls and put five of his legions there, he then sent the sixth to occupy a small camp between the walls that had been abandoned by Caesar, and enlarged the defences. Caesar responded by sending 33 cohorts to attack this position. Although the attack was initially successful, the Caesarian troops were outnumbered 2:1 and Pompey's troops fought hard. Pompey sent a large force of infantry and 3,000 cavalry to outflank Caesar's right wing. Caesar first ordered his troops on the right to stand firm, but then saw the danger of being outflanked. He ordered a retreat which soon became a panicked and disordered rout. The counterattack on Pompey's camp disintegrated completely. At first Caesar personally tried to stem the retreat, but the fleeing troops did not stop until they reached their own camps. Pompey refrained from pursuing Caesar's routed forces and this allowed them to regroup. Caesar gives his own losses at about 1,000; Pompey's were presumably less. After the failure of the counterattack and considering the losses incurred, Caesar resolved to give up attempting to besiege Pompey and to change the entire strategy of the campaign.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp. 197‚Äì198; Caesar, Bello Civili, III, 70; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 65.5. Aftermath Pompey ordered a halt, believing that Caesar had been decisively beaten, and also suspecting a trap. Caesar's men regrouped in their camp and Caesar made preparations for a strategic withdraw. According to Plutarch, Caesar remarked on that decision saying, \\"Today the victory had been the enemy's, had there been any one among them to gain it.\\"Plutarch Pompey 65.5, Dryden translation: p. 465. Caesar, by various stratagems, managed to retreat south with the remainder of his army and avoided being caught by the pursuing cavalry of Pompey. He sent some of his cohorts to reinforce the garrisons of Apollonia and Oricum, and propelled the bulk of his remaining troops into Thessaly. The Caesarian general Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus and the Pompeian general Scipio Nasica were both in that country with their respective armies, and both Caesar and Pompey then aimed to link up with their corresponding forces. Upon entering Thessaly, Caesar captured the town of Gomphi and regrouped with Domitius, allowing his men to resupply, rest and then move towards Pharsalus. Pompey linked up with Scipio and then with a force which now numbers nine-and-a-half legions, 7,000 cavalry and numerous light-armed auxiliaries he also reached Pharsalus. Both armies now prepared for the decisive battle which was fought four days later on 9 August 48 BC.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp. 198‚Äì201.

The film presents a fictionalized account of what happened between Jordan's initial retirement from the NBA in 1993 and his 1995 comeback, in which he is enlisted by the Looney Tunes to help them win a basketball match against a group of aliens who intend to enslave them as attractions for their theme park. Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle, and Bill Murray appear in supporting roles, while Billy West, Dee Bradley Baker, and Danny DeVito headline the voice cast. Space Jam was released theatrically in the United States on November 15, 1996 by Warner Bros under their Family Entertainment unit. The film was a box office success, opening at number one at the North American box office and grossing over $230 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing basketball film of all time. A sequel, titled Space Jam: A New Legacy and starring LeBron James, is scheduled for release on July 16, 2021. Plot In 1973, a young Michael Jordan tells his father that he wants to go to The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to play in the championship team, then go to the NBA. A compilation of highlights from Jordan's basketball career, which includes highlights from high school, college, the 1984 and the 1992 Olympics, and the Chicago Bulls, is followed by an excerpt from the 1993 press conference in which Jordan announced his retirement from professional basketball, to pursue a career in baseball, in which Jordan is popular, but less skilled. Meanwhile, in outer space, the amusement park Moron Mountain faces decline. Its owner, Mr. Swackhammer, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to Earth to abduct the Looney Tunes as a new attraction. Upon the Nerdlucks' arrival, Bugs Bunny and the other Looney Tunes take advantage of the Nerdlucks' small stature and challenge them to a game of basketball. Through a documentary of basketball, the Nerdlucks learn that the sport's best players are employed by the NBA, and accept the proposal. After stealing the talents of NBA players Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Nerdlucks transform themselves into the large, muscular, and talented Monstars and easily intimidate the Tunes, prompting Bugs to seek professional aid. While golfing with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and his personal assistant, Stan Podolack, Jordan is suddenly lassoed down a hole and into the Looney Tunes' world. Bugs explains the situation to Jordan, whom hope is placed on as one of the best basketball players in the world. Although reluctant, he agrees to play after a confrontation with the Monstars insults his pride, and organizes the Tunes into a team, the \\"Toon Squad\\". A female rabbit named Lola Bunny, whom Bugs falls in love with, is added to the team thanks to her talents. Jordan sends Bugs and Daffy Duck back to his house to obtain his basketball gear. When they arrive, Bugs and Daffy meet Jordan's dog and kids, and are later seen by Stan, who follows them back to the cartoon world. Meanwhile, the sudden incapacity of the five NBA players leads to worldwide panic that results in the season ending early. The players try to restore their skills through practice, hospitalization, therapy, and prayer, but to no avail. On the day of the match, the Monstars dominate the first half, sinking the Tune Squad's morale. Stan overhears about how the Monstars obtained their talent and informs Jordan. Bugs and Jordan rally the Tune Squad and dominate the third quarter using old-school gags and Acme weaponry. During a timeout, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer: a win by the Toon Squad would require the Monstars returning their stolen talents while a win by the Monstars would allow Swackhammer make Jordan a new attraction for Moron Mountain, for the rest of his life. With ten seconds left in the game, the Toon Squad are down by one point and one player, due to most of them being injured from the Monstars' rough playing, leaving only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy left. Murray unexpectedly arrives and is recruited to fill the spot. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray's help but is pulled back by the Monstars. Remembering advice from Bugs, he uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and dunk the ball, winning the match with a buzzer beater. Seeing the Monstars being reprimanded by Swackhammer, Jordan helps them realize that they only listened to him because they were smaller. The Monstars encase Swackhammer in a missile and send him back to his amusement park. Giving up their stolen talent, the Nerdlucks are recruited into the Looney Tunes ensemble and drop off Jordan at his next baseball game. Later, Jordan visits the incapacitated basketball players and returns their talent, to which the players provoke a reluctant Jordan into participating in a three-on-three match. Two years later in 1995, Jordan returns to the Chicago Bulls to resume his basketball career.

Development  In 1992 and 1993, two Nike ads, \\"Hare Jordan\\" and \\"Aerospace Jordan\\" respectively, aired on television and featured Michael Jordan with the character Bugs Bunny. Directed by Joe Pytka, the production of the 1992 ad was hindered by reluctance from Warner Bros. to allow Nike to modernize Bugs' character, but the commercial success of both ads \\"was a nice bit of research for Warner Bros. to understand that the Bugs character still had relevance and to tie it in with Michael,\\" explained Pytka. This led to the company green- lighting a movie featuring Jordan and Bugs, which came out of a plane meeting between a Nike executive and producer Ivan Reitman. At the same time, Warner Bros. tried to created more \\"adult, sophisticated material\\" in the animated film market that deviated from the formula set by Disney. The project was closed when Jordan retired from basketball in 1993, only to be reopened in 1995 when Jordan returned as a baseball player. Pytka was informed about the project only months before the start of principal photography; in addition to being hired as director, he revised the script, such as a scene involving a home run Jordan does when he returns to Earth that ultimately wasn't filmed. Spike Lee was also interested in helping Pytka with the screenplay, but Warner Bros. blocked him from the project out of dissatisfaction from how he funded Malcolm X (1992). According to Pytka, it was difficult to get most actors involved with Space Jam due to its odd premise: \\"I mean, they‚Äôre going to work with an animated character and an athlete ‚Äî are you serious? They just didn‚Äôt want to do it.\\" Before Wayne Knight was cast as Stan, his initial choices were Michael J. Fox and Chevy Chase, whom he had worked with on Doritos commercials; Warner Bros. rejected both actors. There were also attempts to replace Jordan's character with a more experienced actor, but \\"we couldn‚Äôt find anyone better.\\" The easiest actors to obtain were the NBA players, except for Gheorghe Mure»ôan. The voice casting was very involved, as Reitman was serious about the voice actors for the established Looney Tunes characters being far better than Mel Blanc and not just replications. The casting directors originally planned several voice cameos; however, that didn't work out, and Danny Devito ended up being the only celebrity voice actor in the film, which was for Swackhammer, who was originally planned to be played by Jack Palance. Swackhammer was also planned to be a live-action character until the very final days of development.  Production  = Scale = The Classic Animation faction of Warner Bros., which animated the commercials and was located in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, was originally planned to be the only company responsible for Space Jam. However, after only a week, the animation work was so complicated that Warner Bros. contacted more studios, including reassigning the Feature Animation division in Glendale from working on Quest for Camelot (1998) to Space Jam; ten of Classic Animation's members, including the production's animation director Tony Cervone, were taken out of the faction to become involved all throughout production, and development artists were reassigned to animating jobs, including supervising animator Bruce Woodside, who had little faith in the project: \\"Like so many other animators, I adore the classic Warner Bros. characters, but I really had little hope that tying them to the massive anchor of an apparently doomed marketing scheme could actually give them a successful second life in features.\\" After Cervone was hired as animation director, Jerry Rees contact Bruce W. Smith about being an animation supervisor on the film; Rees was fired by the time Smith joined, and Pykta hired Smith to be another animator. Before January 1996, when animation production was put into overdrive, none of the animators' drafts or concepts for how the film should look met with Reitman's approval; Bill Perkins joined that month as animation art director, and when first arriving at the Sherman Oaks division, \\"we only had around eight months to do about 52 minutes of animation\\" and \\"it was just kind of a little skeleton crew.\\" Cervone highlighted Reitman's role as supervisor: \\"It started off as a string of gags with no structure, and he helped a lot with that.\\" The drafting process involved the animators and artists using the original cartoons as references. Ultimately, they went with Bob Clampett's 1940s style of animation and design due to being wilder than Chuck Jones'. Production of Space Jam totaled around 19 months, with filming taking up ten of them; this was half the time of any other film of its kind according to animation director Bruce W. Smith. The animation was done at a very quick pace by more than 700 workers from 18 studios in London, Canada, California and Ohio, starting January 1996 by the recently joined producers Ron Tippe and Allison Abbate. In trying to track the huge amount work done at the 18 studios, Tippe hung stills of all the shots throughout the Feature Animation faction's hallways, with completed ones marked in red. Features about the film's production, including one from the official website, emphasized its state-of-the art computer technology when it came to its live-action/animation hybrid; \\"this film could have not been made two years ago,\\" claimed Cervone in 1996. Due to its mixture of various art mediums as well as the \\"broad sense of humor and entertainment\\" unique to the Looney Tunes, animation director Bruce W. Smith considered Space Jam an important part of diversifying the animation industry. Space Jam broke the record for amount of composited shots in a featured film, \\"roughly 1,043\\" according to Tippe, as well as a record number of FX shots, with around 1,100 in a single 90-minute film; Independence Day (1996), released the same year, had 700 FX shots within two hours of screen time. Tippe claimed the film would have, at most, \\"multiple characters, multiple levels of effects and, in some cases, up to 70 elements\\" in one shot. = Filming = Space Jam was one of the first-ever productions to be shot on a virtual studio. Jordan filmed in a 360-degree green screen room with motion trackers, playing and acting alongside green-suited NBA players and improv actors taken from the Groundlings Theatre and School around him serving as placement identifiers for the animated characters, with a CGI background replica of a real-life setting chroma keyed in. Although Bill Murray initially came in to only work on the golf course scene, he then wanted to be in the climactic basketball game after Pytka showed him the process of how he directed the live-action/animation scenes. Concept drawings and discussions between the animators and Pytka about how the animation would be incorporated into the live-action shots took place on set during shooting, and re-writes to the script would be done daily. As an experienced commercial and music video director working on a sports film, Pytka took on fast, unlimited camera movements and Dutch angles; this challenged the animators that had to integrate their characters in the shots. To connect the real and animated worlds together, blue-screen shots of miniatures by Vision Crew Unlimited were used; these include a Christo- inspired interpretation of The Forum arena for exterior shots, city rooftops for a transition scene with a wide skyline view of Chicago serving as the chroma-keyed background, and space ship parts initially produced by Boss Film Studios for a Philip Morris advertisement. = Animation =  Tech  Space Jam was one of the earliest animated productions to use digital technology. 2D animation and background layers were first done on paper before being scanned into Silicon Graphics Image files through Cambridge Animation Systems' software Animo; they were then sent to Cinesite via a File Transfer Protocol, for its animators to color and touch upon in Photoshop and composite into the shots. Unlike previous projects that used the Cineon digital film system, Cinesite were working with the quicker Inferno and Flame systems for Space Jam. The Holly render farm utilized for the film consisted of 16 central processing units, four gigabytes of shared memory, and took up one million dollars of the film's budget, \\"on top of which the deskside boxes had 256 megabytes of ram to splurge on whatever scene you needed to create and render,\\" explained Privett. Cinesite had begun developing proprietary software for motion tracking when working on Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995), which involved most of its shots incorporating a digital background; this made the company prepared for Space Jam, which consists of a bunch of moving camera shots with 3D backgrounds to be added. The CGI backgrounds moved around with the motion trackers via Cinesite's proprietary software Ball Buster, which identified the markers through algorithm. To avoid goofs in the visuals as much as possible, Cinesite artists worked on the film by frame instead of viewing each shot as a whole; those, such as Jonathan Privett were dissatisfied with the method, primarily because it put them under much pressure: \\"We much preferred the good old fashioned run-at-24-fps, just-as- the-viewer-sees-it approach.\\"  Backgrounds  The design of the stadium was heavily dictated by that of the film's many characters, and it was such a long process that it went through 94 revisions, explained Cinesite digital effects supervisor Carlos Arguello: \\"Tasmanian Devil was brown so we couldn‚Äôt have a wooden brown upper level, and there were so many colorful characters, and Michael Jordan and everybody had to look good in all the scenes.\\" For scenes that take place in the stadium, shortcuts were made. For crane shots of the crowd of 15,000 people in the final basketball sequence, it was created with live-action extras, cloned animated crowd members, and a few computer- generated characters walking around the aisles in the stadium. When these shots involved camera movements, a few 2D extras were animated to reflect the angle of the camera, but much lighting was added to distract from the crowd, thus minimizing this work. The reflections of the floor on the gym were also \\"fake[d]\\" as raytracing would've meant rendering it for four days per a few frames.  Characters  Abbate suggested the hurried workflow of the animators bled into the character animation, resulting in a quick-witted style the Looney Tunes cartoons are most known for. Although the animators had to work with almost 100 characters, they were the most focused on Bugs and Daffy not only because they were principal characters, but also because they were the most recognizable Warner Bros. characters to general audiences. Sculpting was incorporated the most on Bugs and Lola, including in \\"beauty shots\\" or sequences where Bugs and Lola are together. Perkins conceived the idea of the villains being secondary colors, as the main Looney Tunes were primary colors or brown. There was also a lot of experimentation with motion blur with the 2D characters, especially Tweety; as Simon Eves explained, \\"The workflow was that an artist would track some specific points on the sequence of 2D character-on- black that came from the animation house, and I think it was able to take a basic roto shape as well, and then it would generate an interpolated motion vector field which could be applied as a variable directional blur. The field would deform based on the relative motion of the tracking points on the camera, to produce more accurate blur as the character deformed.\\"  Music  The soundtrack sold enough albums to be certified as 6-times Platinum. It also served as a high point for musical artist R. Kelly, whose song \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" not only was a hit, but earned him two Grammy Awards. Other tracks included a cover of Steve Miller Band's \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" (by Seal), \\"Hit 'Em High (The Monstars' Anthem)\\" (by B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J, and Method Man), \\"Basketball Jones\\" (by Barry White & Chris Rock), \\"Pump up the Jam\\" (by Technotronic), \\"I Turn to You\\" (by All-4-One) and \\"For You I Will\\" (by Monica). The film's title song was performed by the Quad City DJ's. There was also an original scoring soundtrack featured most of James Newton Howard‚Äôs scores from the movie, except the main Merrie Melodies Theme itself.

The film made its cable television premiere on TNT on March 14, 1999, while it made its network television premiere on ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney on November 14, 1999. The film became available on HBO Max on July 1, 2020. Merchandise Space Jam later expanded into a media franchise which includes comics, video games and merchandise. The Space Jam franchise is estimated to have generated in total revenue. This includes a wide variety of merchandise, such as Air Jordans, Bugs Bunny shirts, Happy Meals, Mugsy Bogues jerseys, and Tweety gowns. =Comics= The film was adapted into a graphic novel published by DC Comics through their imprint \\"Warner Bros Reading\\" that published the \\"Looney Tunes\\", \\"Tiny Toon Adventures\\", \\"Animaniacs\\" and \\"Pinky & The Brain\\" monthly comic books. The special issue was written by David Cody Weiss and drawn by Leonardo Batic. =Video games= A licensed pinball game by Sega, a video game for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS by Acclaim, and a handheld LCD game by Tiger Electronics were released based on the film. Reception =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 43% approval rating based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 5.32/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"While it's no slam dunk, Space Jams silly, Looney Toons-laden slapstick and vivid animation will leave younger viewers satisfied ‚Äì though accompanying adults may be more annoyed than entertained.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones strongly criticized Space Jam. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune both gave Space Jam a thumbs up, although Siskel's praise was more reserved. In his review, Ebert gave the film three-and a-half stars and noted, \\"Space Jam is a happy marriage of good ideas‚Äîthree films for the price of one, giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan, crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare. ... the result is delightful, a family movie in the best sense (which means the adults will enjoy it, too).\\" Siskel focused much of his praise on Jordan's performance, saying, \\"He wisely accepted as a first movie a script that builds nicely on his genial personality in an assortment of TV ads. The sound bites are just a little longer.\\" Leonard Maltin also gave the film a positive review (three stars), stating that \\"Jordan is very engaging, the vintage characters perform admirably ... and the computer-generated special effects are a collective knockout.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film for its humor as well as the Looney Tunes' antics and Jordan's acting. Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the film's animation, she later went on to say that the film is a \\"fond tribute to [the Looney Tunes characters'] past.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune complained about some aspects of the movie, stating, \\"...we don't get the co-stars' best stuff. Michael doesn't soar enough. The Looney Tunes don't pulverize us the way they did when Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng or Bob Clampett were in charge.\\" Yet overall, he also liked the film, giving it 3 stars and saying: \\"Is it cute? Yes. Is it a crowd- pleaser? Yup. Is it classic? Nope. (Though it could have been.)\\" TV Guide gave the movie only two stars, calling it a \\"cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Warner Bros. cartoon characters and basketball player Michael Jordan, inspired by a Nike commercial.\\" Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the film 2 1/2 stars, saying, \\"Technical spectacle amounts do nothing without a good story.\\" Veteran Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies director Chuck Jones was critical of the film. In a 1998 interview, he expressed his views that the film was \\"terrible\\" and said, as a man who worked with the characters for almost thirty years, the story was deeply flawed. \\"I can tell you, with the utmost confidence,\\" he said, \\"Porky Pig would never say 'I think I wet myself.'\\" Jones also added that, had the film been more true to the source material, Bugs Bunny would not have enlisted the help of Jordan or the other Looney Tunes characters to defeat the Monstars \\"and moreover, it wouldn't have taken him an hour and a half. Those aliens, whether they were tiny or colossal, would've been dealt with in short order come the seven minute mark.\\" =Accolades= * 1997 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards ** Won: Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures (Diane Warren for the song \\"For You I Will\\") ** Won: Top Box Office Films (James Newton Howard) * 1997 Annie Awards ** Won: Best Individual Achievement: Technical Achievement ** Nomination: Best Animated Feature ** Nomination: Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a Feature Production (Bruce W.

Screen and Warner Bros.) Sequel A sequel to Space Jam was planned as early as 1997. As development began, Space Jam 2 was going to involve a new basketball competition between the Looney Tunes and a new villain named Berserk-O!. Artist Bob Camp was tasked with designing Berserk-O! and his henchmen. Joe Pytka would have returned to direct and Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone signed on as the animation supervisors. However, Jordan did not agree to star in a sequel, and Warner Bros. eventually canceled plans for Space Jam 2. Several potential sequels, including Spy Jam with Jackie Chan, that would end up becoming the basis for Looney Tunes: Back in Action. Race Jam with Jeff Gordon, a golf- centered film with Tiger Woods, and Skate Jam with Tony Hawk were all discussed but never came to be. In February 2014, Warner Bros. officially announced development of a sequel that will star LeBron James. In July 2015, James and his film studio, SpringHill Entertainment, signed a deal with Warner Bros. for television, film and digital content after receiving positive reviews for his role in Trainwreck. By 2016, Justin Lin signed onto the project as director, and co-screenwriter with Andrew Dodge and Alfredo Botello. By August 2018, Lin left the project, and Terence Nance was hired to direct the film. In September 2018, Ryan Coogler was announced as a producer for the film. Filming would take place in California and within a 30 mile radius of Los Angeles. Prior to production, the film received $21.8 million in tax credits as a result of a new tax incentive program from the state. In February 2019, after releasing the official logo with a promotional poster, Space Jam 2 was announced to be scheduled for release on July 16, 2021. Principal photography began on June 25, 2019. On April 30, 2020, James revealed the title for the film would be Space Jam: A New Legacy.  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =  External links * * Page from Warner Bros.

Ace Brigode in 1938. Ace Brigode was born in Illinois. He entered show business as a member of a touring minstrel show. His band began playing professionally in early 1921 as \\"Ace Brigode & His 10 Virginians\\"; a bit later they were renamed \\"Ace Brigode & His 14 Virginians\\"; this name stuck although the band varied between having 9 to 19 members over the years. The band played in the moderately jazz-influenced peppy dance band style called \\"Collegiate Hot\\" that to many people exemplifies the music of the \\"Roaring Twenties\\". The most noted musician who played with Brigode was trombonist Abe Lincoln. Brigode hosted the \\"White Rose Gasoline Show\\" on radio, featuring his band. The band also made gramophone records for various record labels, including OKeh, Edison, Cameo and Path√© Records; their biggest hit was a 1925 version of \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\" for Columbia Records. The band's theme song was \\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\\". Dwight Eisenhower was among the band's fans. Brigode himself played violin and clarinet, but mostly acted as master of ceremonies. The band toured widely around the United States. Brigode kept the band current with newer style arrangements into the early swing music era, before disbanding the group in 1946. After this Ace Brigode worked as promotions manager for Cleveland, Ohio's Chippewa Lake Park, and also did television commercial voice work. Brigode refused to book rock and roll performers into the park because of his dislike for the musical genre. He was survived by his wife, Theresa, sons Robert and Richard, and a daughter, Mrs. James Knott.

The name is of Greek origin, coming from the Greek word (), meaning \\"resurrection\\". It is a popular name in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, where it was the most used name for decades until 2008, when its place was taken by Sophia. It is still heavily used.  Origin  The name Anastasia originated during the early days of Christianity and was given to many Greek girls born in December and around Easter. It was established as the female form (Greek: ) of the male name Anastasius (Greek: Anastasios ), and has the meaning of \\"she/he of the resurrection\\". It is the name of several early saints; including Anastasia of Sirmium, a central saint from the 2nd century who is commemorated during the first Mass on Christmas Dawn each year according to the traditional calendar of the Roman Catholic Church and on December 22 according to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Slavic diminutives include Nastya, Nastia or Nastja (Serbian, Slovenian) as well as various hypocoristics: Nastenka, Nastyusha, Nastyona.  Popularity  Anastasia is a very popular name for girls, especially in Europe, where most names have Christian associations. Anastasia was the most popular name for girls for many years in Russia until 2008, when it was surpassed by the name Sophia. It remains one of the top ten names for Russian girls, as well as for girls in Belarus, Moldova, Serbia, Georgia, and Montenegro.

Common propellants are energetic materials and consist of a fuel like gasoline, jet fuel, rocket fuel, and an oxidizer. Propellants are burned or otherwise decomposed to produce the propellant gas. Other propellants are simply liquids that can readily be vaporized. In rockets and aircraft, propellants are used to produce a gas that can be directed through a nozzle, thereby producing thrust. In rockets, rocket propellant produces an exhaust, and the exhausted material is usually expelled under pressure through a nozzle. The pressure may be from a compressed gas, or a gas produced by a chemical reaction. The exhaust material may be a gas, liquid, plasma, or, before the chemical reaction, a solid, liquid, or gel. In aircraft, the propellant is usually a fuel and is combusted with the air. In firearm ballistics, propellants fill the interior of an ammunition cartridge or the chamber of a gun or cannon, leading to the expulsion of a bullet or shell (gunpowder, smokeless powder, and large gun propellants). Explosive material can be placed in a sealed tube and act as a deflagrant low explosive charge in mining and demolition, to produce a low velocity heave effect (gas pressure blasting). Cold gas propellants may be used to fill an expansible bag or membrane, such as an automotive airbag (gas generator propellants) or in pressurised dispensing systems, such as aerosol sprays, to force a material through a nozzle. Examples of can propellants include nitrous oxide that is dissolved in canned whipped cream, and the dimethyl ether or low-boiling alkane used in hair spray. Rocket propellant may be expelled through an expansion nozzle as a cold gas, that is, without energetic mixing and combustion, to provide small changes in velocity to spacecraft by the use of cold gas thrusters.  Aerosol sprays  In aerosol spray cans, the propellant is simply a pressurized gas in equilibrium with its liquid (at its saturated vapour pressure). As some gas escapes to expel the payload, more liquid evaporates, maintaining an even pressure.  Used to propel solid objects  Technically, the word propellant is the general name for chemicals used to create thrust. For vehicles, the term propellant refers only to chemicals that are stored within the vehicle prior to use, and excludes atmospheric gas or other material that may be collected in operation. To attain a useful density for storage, most propellants are either solid or liquid. =Ballistics and pyrotechnics= In ballistics and pyrotechnics, a propellant is a generic name for chemicals used for propelling projectiles from guns and other firearms. Solid propellants are usually made from low-explosive materials, but may include high-explosive chemical ingredients that are diluted and burned in a controlled way (deflagration) rather than detonation. The controlled burning of the propellant composition usually produces thrust by gas pressure and can accelerate a projectile, rocket, or other vehicle. In this sense, common or well-known propellants include, for firearms, artillery, and solid-propellant rockets: *Gun propellants, such as: **Gunpowder (black powder) **Nitrocellulose-based powders **Cordite **Ballistite **Smokeless powders Rocket propellants = Solid propellant = *Composite propellants made from a solid oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate, a synthetic rubber such as HTPB, PBAN, or Polyurethane (or energetic polymers such as polyglycidyl nitrate or polyvinyl nitrate for extra energy), optional high-explosive fuels (again, for extra energy) such as RDX or nitroglycerin, and usually a powdered metal fuel such as aluminum. *Some amateur propellants use potassium nitrate, combined with sugar, epoxy, or other fuels and binder compounds. *Potassium perchlorate has been used as an oxidizer, paired with asphalt, epoxy, and other binders. Propellants that explode in operation are of little practical use currently, although there have been experiments with Pulse Detonation Engines. Also the newly synthesized bishomocubane based compounds are under consideration in the research stage as both solid and liquid propellants of the future.  Grain  Solid propellants are used in forms called grains. A grain is any individual particle of propellant regardless of the size or shape. The shape and size of a propellant grain determines the burn time, amount of gas, and rate produced from the burning propellant and, as a consequence, thrust vs time profile. There are three types of burns that can be achieved with different grains. ; Progressive burn: Usually a grain with multiple perforations or a star cut in the center providing a lot of surface area. ; Degressive burn: Usually a solid grain in the shape of a cylinder or sphere. ; Neutral burn: Usually a single perforation; as outside surface decreases the inside surface increases at the same rate.  Composition  There are four different types of solid propellant compositions: ; Single-based propellant: A single based propellant has nitrocellulose as its chief explosives ingredient. Stabilizers and other additives are used to control the chemical stability and enhance the propellant's properties. ; Double-based propellant: Double-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose with nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives added. Stabilizers and other additives are also used. Nitroglycerin reduces smoke and increases the energy output. Double-based propellants are used in small arms, cannons, mortars and rockets. ; Triple-based propellant: Triple-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives. Triple-based propellants are used in cannons. ; Composite: Composites contain do not utilize nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, nitroguanidine or any other organic nitrate as the primary constituent. Composites usually consist of a fuel such as metallic aluminum, a combustible binder such as synthetic rubber or HTPB, and an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate. Composite propellants are used in large rocket motors. In some applications, such as the US SLBM Trident II missile, nitroglycerin is added to the aluminum and ammonium perchlorate composite as an energetic plasticizer. = Liquid propellant = In rockets, three main liquid bipropellant combinations are used: cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen, cryogenic oxygen and a hydrocarbon, and storable propellants. ; Cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen combination system: Used in upper stages and sometimes in booster stages of space launch systems.This is a nontoxic combination. This gives high specific impulse and is ideal for high-velocity missions ; Cryogenic oxygen-hydrocarbon propellant system: Used for many booster stages of space launch vehicles as well as a smaller number of second stages. This combination of fuel/oxidizer has high density and hence allows for a more compact booster design. ; Storable propellant combinations: Used in almost all bipropellant low-thrust, auxiliary or reaction control rocket engines, as well as in some in large rocket engines for first and second stages of ballistic missiles. They are instant-starting and suitable for long- term storage. Propellant combinations used for liquid propellant rockets include: * Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen * Liquid oxygen and kerosene or RP-1 * Liquid oxygen and ethanol * Liquid oxygen and methane * Hydrogen peroxide and mentioned above alcohol or RP-1 * Red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) and kerosene or RP-1 * RFNA and Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) * Dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH, MMH, and/or hydrazine Common monopropellant used for liquid rocket engines include: * Hydrogen peroxide * Hydrazine * Red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) See also *Fuel *Propellant depot *Spacecraft propulsion *Specific impulse References Bibliography * External links *Rocket Propellants *Rocket propulsion elements, Sutton,George.P, Biblarz,Oscar 7th Ed *Understanding and Predicting Gun Barrel Erosion - Weapons Systems Division Defence Science and Technology Organisation by Ian A.

He supposedly gives true answers of things past, present and to come, divinity, and the creation of the world; he also confers dignities and prelacies, and the favour of friends and foes. Orobas is faithful to the conjurer, does not permit that any spirit tempts him, and never deceives anyone. He is depicted as a horse that changes into a man under the conjurer's request. The name could come from the Latin 'orobias', a type of incense. In popular culture Orobas is Monster in My Pocket #78; there, he is described as an \\"oracle\\" rather than a demon. Orobas is the name of a Dragon Knight in the video game Divinity 2: Ego Draconis. He was the ruler of a very successful area named The Orobas Fjords, and was viewed as a god by some. Orobas is referenced in the DVD extras of the horror film Lovely Molly as the likely agent of the film's main character's demonic possession. Orobas appears in the Megami Tensei video game series, as a demon that can be summoned by the player. Orobas is an optional fight in Shadow Hearts: Covenant. He is fought at the end of the Neam Ruins side area and Anastasia can learn her final spell \\"Euthanasia\\" by snapping his photo. In this game, Orobas appears as a regal looking man with the lower body of a gigantic flying insect.

A salt marsh or saltmarsh, also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal ecosystem in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs.Adam, P (1990). Saltmarsh Ecology. Cambridge University Press. New York.Woodroffe, CD (2002). Coasts: form, process and evolution. Cambridge University Press. New York. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection.

Commonly these shorelines consist of mud or sand flats (known also as tidal flats or abbreviated to mudflats) which are nourished with sediment from inflowing rivers and streams.Chapman, V. J. (1974). Salt marshes and salt deserts of the world. Phyllis Claire Chapman, Germany. These typically include sheltered environments such as embankments, estuaries and the leeward side of barrier islands and spits. In the tropics and sub-tropics they are replaced by mangroves; an area that differs from a salt marsh in that instead of herbaceous plants, they are dominated by salt-tolerant trees. Most salt marshes have a low topography with low elevations but a vast wide area, making them hugely popular for human populations.Bromberg-Gedan, K., Silliman, B. R., and Bertness, M. D. (2009). \\"Centuries of human driven change in salt marsh ecosystems\\", Annual Review of Marine Science, 1: 117‚Äì141. Salt marshes are located among different landforms based on their physical and geomorphological settings. Such marsh landforms include deltaic marshes, estuarine, back- barrier, open coast, embayments and drowned-valley marshes. Deltaic marshes are associated with large rivers where many occur in Southern Europe such as the Camargue, France in the Rh√¥ne delta or the Ebro delta in Spain. They are also extensive within the rivers of the Mississippi Delta in the United States. In New Zealand, most salt marshes occur at the head of estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation.Te Ara ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of New Zealand (2005‚Äì2010). \\"Plants of the Estuary\\". Retrieved 15 March 2010 Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland, the Manawatu Estuary, and the Avon Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch. Back-barrier marshes are sensitive to the reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed. They are common along much of the eastern coast of the United States and the Frisian Islands. Large, shallow coastal embayments can hold salt marshes with examples including Morecambe Bay and Portsmouth in Britain and the Bay of Fundy in North America. Salt marshes are sometimes included in lagoons, and the difference is not very marked; the Venetian Lagoon in Italy, for example, is made up of these sorts of animals and or living organisms belonging to this ecosystem. They have a big impact on the biodiversity of the area. Salt marsh ecology involves complex food webs which include primary producers (vascular plants, macroalgae, diatoms, epiphytes, and phytoplankton), primary consumers (zooplankton, macrozoa, molluscs, insects), and secondary consumers.Vernberg, F. J. 1993. Salt-Marsh Processes: A Review. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 12:2167‚Äì2195. The low physical energy and high grasses provide a refuge for animals. Many marine fish use salt marshes as nursery grounds for their young before they move to open waters. Birds may raise their young among the high grasses, because the marsh provides both sanctuary from predators and abundant food sources which include fish trapped in pools, insects, shellfish, and worms.Scott, D. B., J. Frail-Gauthier, and P. J. Mudie. 2014. Coastal wetlands of the world: geology, ecology, distribution and applications. Cambridge University Press, New York  Worldwide occurrence  Saltmarshes across 99 countries (essentially worldwide) were mapped by Mcowen et al. 2017. A total of 5,495,089 hectares of mapped saltmarsh across 43 countries and territories are represented in a Geographic Information Systems polygon shapefile. This estimate is at the relatively low end of previous estimates (2.2‚Äì40 Mha). The most extensive saltmarshes worldwide are found outside the tropics, notably including the low-lying, ice-free coasts, bays and estuaries of the North Atlantic which are well represented in their global polygon dataset. Formation The formation begins as tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate and duration of tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface.Pethick, J. (1984). An introduction to coastal geomorphology. Edward Arnold, London. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined with the development of suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contactGinsburg, R. N., and Lowenstam, H. A. (1958). \\"The influence of marine bottom communities on the depositional environment of sediments\\". The Journal of Geology, 66: (3), 310‚Äì318. which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments.Aspden, R. J., Vardy, S. and Paterson, D. M. (2004). Salt marsh microbial ecology: microbes, benthic mats and sediment movement. In Fagherazzi, S., Marani, M. and Blum, L. K. (Eds), The Ecogeomorphology of Tidal Marshes (pp. 115‚Äì136). American Geophysical Union, Washington, DC. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g., Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment.Bird, E. (2008). Coastal geomorphology: an introduction. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, West Sussex, England. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops. Tidal flooding and vegetation zonation An Atlantic coastal salt marsh in Connecticut. Coastal salt marshes can be distinguished from terrestrial habitats by the daily tidal flow that occurs and continuously floods the area. It is an important process in delivering sediments, nutrients and plant water supply to the marsh. At higher elevations in the upper marsh zone, there is much less tidal inflow, resulting in lower salinity levels. Soil salinity in the lower marsh zone is fairly constant due to everyday annual tidal flow. However, in the upper marsh, variability in salinity is shown as a result of less frequent flooding and climate variations. Rainfall can reduce salinity and evapotranspiration can increase levels during dry periods. As a result, there are microhabitats populated by different species of flora and fauna dependent on their physiological abilities. The flora of a salt marsh is differentiated into levels according to the plants' individual tolerance of salinity and water table levels. Vegetation found at the water must be able to survive high salt concentrations, periodical submersion, and a certain amount of water movement, while plants further inland in the marsh can sometimes experience dry, low- nutrient conditions. It has been found that the upper marsh zones limit species through competition and the lack of habitat protection, while lower marsh zones are determined through the ability of plants to tolerate physiological stresses such as salinity, water submergence and low oxygen levels.Bertness, MD, Ewanchuk, PJ, Silliman, BR (2002). \\"Anthropogenic modification of New England salt marsh landscapes\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 99(3): 1395‚Äì1398.Rand, TA (2000). Seed Dispersal, Habitat Suitability and the Distribution of Halophytes across a Salt Marsh Tidal Gradient. Journal of Ecology 88(4): 608‚Äì621. Marine Park Salt Marsh Nature Center in Brooklyn, New York The New England salt marsh is subject to strong tidal influences and shows distinct patterns of zonation. In low marsh areas with high tidal flooding, a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora dominate, then heading landwards, zones of the salt hay, Spartina patens, black rush, Juncus gerardii and the shrub Iva frutescens are seen respectively. These species all have different tolerances that make the different zones along the marsh best suited for each individual. Plant species diversity is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt marsh plants are glassworts (Salicornia spp.) and the cordgrass (Spartina spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They are often the first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (Limonium spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species. Salt marshes are quite photosynthetically active and are extremely productive habitats. They serve as depositories for a large amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the halophytic plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and decompose to become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds. Sediment trapping, accretion, and the role of tidal creeks Bloody Marsh in Georgia, USA The factors and processes that influence the rate and spatial distribution of sediment accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. Sediment deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the sediment to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the sediment flakes off at low tide. The amount of sediment adhering to salt marsh species is dependent on the type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the sediment supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species.Li, H. and Yang, S. L. (2000). \\"Trapping effect of tidal marsh vegetation on suspended sediment, Yangtze Delta\\". Journal of Coastal Research, 25: (4), 915‚Äì924 For example, in a study of the Eastern Chongming Island and Jiuduansha Island tidal marshes at the mouth of the Yangtze River, China, the amount of sediment adhering to the species Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Scirpus mariqueter decreased with distance from the highest levels of suspended sediment concentrations (found at the marsh edge bordering tidal creeks or the mudflats); decreased with those species at the highest elevations, which experienced the lowest frequency and depth of tidal inundations; and increased with increasing plant biomass. Spartina alterniflora, which had the most sediment adhering to it, may contribute >10% of the total marsh surface sediment accretion by this process. Salt marsh species also facilitate sediment accretion by decreasing current velocities and encouraging sediment to settle out of suspension. Current velocities can be reduced as the stems of tall marsh species induce hydraulic drag, with the effect of minimising re-suspension of sediment and encouraging deposition.Shi, Z., Hamilton, L. J. and Wolanski, E. (2000). \\"Near-bed currents and suspended sediment transport in saltmarsh canopies\\". Journal of Coastal Research, 16: (3), 908‚Äì914. Measured concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column have been shown to decrease from the open water or tidal creeks adjacent to the marsh edge, to the marsh interior,Reed, D. J., Spencer, T., Murray, A. L., French, J. R. and Leonard, L. (1999). \\"Marsh surface sediment deposition and the role of tidal creeks: implications for created and managed coastal marshes\\". Journal of Coastal Conservation, 5: (1), 81‚Äì90. probably as a result of direct settling to the marsh surface by the influence of the marsh canopy. Inundation and sediment deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks which are a common feature of salt marshes.Wood, N. and Hine, A. C. (2007). \\"Spatial trends in marsh sediment deposition within a microtidal creek system, Wacasassa Bay, Florida\\". Journal of Coastal Research, 23: (4), 823‚Äì833. Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, as well as to drain water, and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and can thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota. Salt marshes do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface although salt marshes with this morphology seem to be rarely studied. The elevation of marsh species is important; those species at lower elevations experience longer and more frequent tidal floods and therefore have the opportunity for more sediment deposition to occur.Cahoon, D. R., White, D. A. and Lynch, J. C. (2011). \\"Sediment infilling and wetland formation dynamics in an active crevasse splay of the Mississippi River delta\\". Geomorphology, 131: 57‚Äì68. Species at higher elevations can benefit from a greater chance of inundation at the highest tides when increased water depths and marsh surface flows can penetrate into the marsh interior. Human impacts Spartina alterniflora (Saltmarsh Cordgrass). Native to the eastern seaboard of the United States. Considered a noxious weed in the Pacific Northwest The coast is a highly attractive natural feature to humans through its beauty, resources, and accessibility. As of 2002, over half of the world's population was estimated to being living within 60 km of the coastal shoreline, making coastlines highly vulnerable to human impacts from daily activities that put pressure on these surrounding natural environments. In the past, salt marshes were perceived as coastal 'wastelands,' causing considerable loss and change of these ecosystems through land reclamation for agriculture, urban development, salt production and recreation.Hinde, HP (1954). \\"The Vertical Distribution of Salt Marsh Phanerogams in Relation to Tide Levels\\". Ecological Monographs 24(2): 209‚Äì225.King, SE, Lester, JN (1995). \\"The Value of Salt Marsh as a Sea Defence\\". Marine Pollution Bulletin 30(3): 180‚Äì189. The indirect effects of human activities such as nitrogen loading also play a major role in the salt marsh area. Salt marshes can suffer from dieback in the high marsh and die-off in the low marsh. =Land reclamation= Reclamation of land for agriculture by converting marshland to upland was historically a common practice. Dikes were often built to allow for this shift in land change and to provide flood protection further inland. In recent times intertidal flats have also been reclaimed.Long, S. P. and Mason, C. F. (1983). Saltmarsh ecology. Blackie & Son Ltd, Glasgow. For centuries, livestock such as sheep and cattle grazed on the highly fertile salt marsh land.Andresen, H, Bakker, JP, Brongers, M, Heydemann, B, Irmler, U (1990). \\"Long-term changes to salt marsh communities by cattle grazing\\". Vegetatio 89: 137‚Äì148. Land reclamation for agriculture has resulted in many changes such as shifts in vegetation structure, sedimentation, salinity, water flow, biodiversity loss and high nutrient inputs. There have been many attempts made to eradicate these problems for example, in New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina anglica was introduced from England into the Manawatu River mouth in 1913 to try and reclaim the estuary land for farming. A shift in structure from bare tidal flat to pastureland resulted from increased sedimentation and the cordgrass extended out into other estuaries around New Zealand. Native plants and animals struggled to survive as non-natives out competed them. Efforts are now being made to remove these cordgrass species, as the damages are slowly being recognized. In the Blyth estuary in Suffolk in eastern England, the mid-estuary reclamations (Angel and Bulcamp marshes) that were abandoned in the 1940s have been replaced by tidal flats with compacted soils from agricultural use overlain with a thin veneer of mud. Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60‚Äì75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted agricultural soils acting as an aquiclude.French, J. R. and Burningham, H. (2003). \\"Tidal marsh sedimentation versus sea-level rise: a southeast England estuarine perspective\\", Proceedings Coastal Sediments, 1‚Äì13. Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline interstitial water by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish.Boorman, L., Hazelden, J., and Boorman, M. (2002). \\"New salt marshes for old ‚Äì salt marsh creation and management\\". The Changing Coast, EUROCAST/EUCC, EUROCOAST Littoral 2002: Porto, Portugal; 35‚Äì45. The vegetation structure, species richness, and plant community composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.Angus, G. and Wolters, M. (2008). \\"The natural regeneration of salt marsh on formerly reclaimed land\\". Applied Vegetation Science, 11: 335‚Äì344. =Upstream agriculture= Cultivation of land upstream from the salt marsh can introduce increased silt inputs and raise the rate of primary sediment accretion on the tidal flats, so that pioneer species can spread further onto the flats and grow rapidly upwards out of the level of tidal inundation. As a result, marsh surfaces in this regime may have an extensive cliff at their seaward edge.Ranwell, D. S. (1972). Ecology of salt marshes and sand dunes. Chapman and Hall Ltd, London. At the Plum Island estuary, Massachusetts (U.S.A), stratigraphic cores revealed that during the 18th and 19th century the marsh prograded over subtidal and mudflat environments to increase in area from 6 km2 to 9 km2 after European settlers deforested the land upstream and increased the rate of sediment supply.Kirwan, M. L., Murray, A. B., Donnelly, J. P. and Corbett, D. (2011). \\"Rapid wetland expansion during European settlement and its implication for marsh survival under modern sediment delivery rates\\". Geological Society of America, 39: (5), 507‚Äì510. =Urban development and nitrogen loading= Chaetomorpha linum is a common marine algae found in the salt marsh. The conversion of marshland to upland for agriculture has in the past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem and the sediment in salt marshes may entrain this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species. Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services. They are highly productive ecosystems, and when net productivity is measured in g m‚àí2 yr‚àí1 they are equalled only by tropical rainforests. Additionally, they can help reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion. De- naturalisation of the landward boundaries of salt marshes from urban or industrial encroachment can have negative effects. In the Avon-Heathcote estuary/Ihutai, New Zealand, species abundance and the physical properties of the surrounding margins were strongly linked, and the majority of salt marsh was found to be living along areas with natural margins in the Avon and Heathcote river outlets; conversely, artificial margins contained little marsh vegetation and restricted landward retreat.Jupp, K. (2007). Establishing a physical and biological basis for salt marsh restoration and management in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary. Christchurch, University of Canterbury. The remaining marshes surrounding these urban areas are also under immense pressure from the human population as human-induced nitrogen enrichment enters these habitats. Nitrogen loading through human-use indirectly affects salt marshes causing shifts in vegetation structure and the invasion of non-native species. Human impacts such as sewage, urban run-off, agricultural and industrial wastes are running into the marshes from nearby sources. Salt marshes are nitrogen limitedLangis, R, Zalejko, M, Zedler, JB (1991). \\"Nitrogen Assessments in a Constructed and a Natural Salt Marsh of San Diego Bay\\". Ecological Applications 1(1): 40‚Äì51. and with an increasing level of nutrients entering the system from anthropogenic effects, the plant species associated with salt marshes are being restructured through change in competition. For example, the New England salt marsh is experiencing a shift in vegetation structure where S. alterniflora is spreading from the lower marsh where it predominately resides up into the upper marsh zone. Additionally, in the same marshes, the reed Phragmites australis has been invading the area expanding to lower marshes and becoming a dominant species. P. australis is an aggressive halophyte that can invade disturbed areas in large numbers outcompeting native plants.Chambers, RM, Meyerson, LA, Saltonstall, K (1999). \\"Expansion of Phragmites australis into tidal wetlands of North America\\". Aquatic Botany 64: 261‚Äì273.Warren, RS, Fell, PE, Rozsa, R, Brawley, AH, Orsted, AC, Olson, ET, Swamy, V, Niering, WA (2002). \\"Salt Marsh Restoration in Connecticut: 20 years of Science and Management\\". Restoration Ecology 10(3): 497‚Äì513. This loss in biodiversity is not only seen in flora assemblages but also in many animals such as insects and birds as their habitat and food resources are altered. =Sea level rise= Due to the melting of Arctic sea ice and thermal expansion of the oceans, as a result of global warming, sea levels have begun to rise. As with all coastlines, this rise in water levels is predicted to negatively affect salt marshes, by flooding and eroding them. The sea level rise causes more open water zones within the salt marsh. These zones cause erosion along their edges, further eroding the marsh into open water until the whole marsh disintegrates. While salt marshes are susceptible to threats concerning sea level rise, they are also an extremely dynamic coastal ecosystem. Salt marshes may in fact have the capability to keep pace with a rising sea level, by 2100, mean sea level could see increases between 0.6m to 1.1m. Marshes are susceptible to both erosion and accretion, which play a role in a what is called a bio-geomorphic feedback. Salt marsh vegetation captures sediment to stay in the system which in turn allows for the plants to grow better and thus the plants are better at trapping sediment and accumulate more organic matter. This positive feedback loop potentially allows for salt marsh bed level rates to keep pace with rising sea level rates. However, this feedback is also dependent on other factors like productivity of the vegetation, sediment supply, land subsidence, biomass accumulation, and magnitude and frequency of storms. In a study published by √ú. S. N. Best in 2018, they found that bioaccumulation was the number one factor in a salt marsh's ability to keep up with SLR rates. The salt marsh's resilience depends upon its increase in bed level rate being greater than that of sea levels increasing rate, otherwise the marsh will be overtaken and drowned. Biomass accumulation can be measured in the form of above-ground organic biomass accumulation, and below-ground inorganic accumulation by means of sediment trapping and sediment settling from suspension. Salt marsh vegetation helps to increase sediment settling because it slows current velocities, disrupts turbulent eddies, and helps to dissipate wave energy. Marsh plant species are known for the tolerance of increased salt exposure due to the common inundation of marshlands. These types of plants are called halophytes. Halophytes are a crucial part of salt marsh biodiversity and their potential to adjust to elevated sea levels. With elevated sea levels, salt marsh vegetation would likely be more exposed to more frequent inundation rates and they must be adaptable or tolerant of the consequential increased salinity levels and anaerobic conditions. There is a common elevation (above the sea level) limit for these plants to survive, where anywhere below the optimal line would lead to anoxic soils due to constant submergence and too high above this line would mean harmful soil salinity levels due to the high rate of evapotranspiration as a result of decreased submergence. Along with the vertical accretion of sediment and biomass, the accommodation space for marsh land growth must also be considered. Accommodation space is the land available for additional sediments to accumulate and marsh vegetation to colonize laterally. This lateral accommodation space is often limited by anthropogenic structures such as coastal roads, sea walls, and other forms of development of coastal lands. A study by Lisa M. Schile, published in 2014, found that across a range of sea level rise rates, marshlands with high plant productivity were resistant against sea level rises but all reached a pinnacle point where accommodation space was necessary for continued survival. The presence of accommodation space allows for new mid/high habitat to form, and for marshes to escape complete inundation. =Mosquito control= Earlier in the 20th century, it was believed that draining salt marshes would help reduce mosquito populations, such as Aedes taeniorhynchus, the black salt marsh mosquito. In many locations, particularly in the northeastern United States, residents and local and state agencies dug straight-lined ditches deep into the marsh flats. The end result, however, was a depletion of killifish habitat. The killifish is a mosquito predator, so the loss of habitat actually led to higher mosquito populations, and adversely affected wading birds that preyed on the killifish. These ditches can still be seen, despite some efforts to refill the ditches.\\"Rhode Island Habitat Restoration\\", University of Rhode Island: Crab herbivory and bioturbation Crabs, such as the tunnelling mud crab Helice crassa of New Zealand shown here, fills a special niche in salt marsh ecosystems. Increased nitrogen uptake by marsh species into their leaves can prompt greater rates of length-specific leaf growth, and increase the herbivory rates of crabs. The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata frequents SW Atlantic salt marshes where high density populations can be found among populations of the marsh species Spartina densiflora and Sarcocornia perennis. In Mar Chiquita lagoon, north of Mar del Plata, Argentina, Neohelice granulata herbivory increased as a likely response to the increased nutrient value of the leaves of fertilised Spartina densiflora plots, compared to non-fertilised plots. Regardless of whether the plots were fertilised or not, grazing by Neohelice granulata also reduced the length specific leaf growth rates of the leaves in summer, while increasing their length-specific senescence rates. This may have been assisted by the increased fungal effectiveness on the wounds left by the crabs.Alberti, J., Cebrian, J., Casariego, A. M., Canepuccia, A., Escapa, M. and Iribarne, O. (2011). \\"Effects of nutrient enrichment and crab herbivory on a SW Atlantic salt marsh\\" productivity. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 405: 99‚Äì104. The salt marshes of Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA), are experiencing creek bank die-offs of Spartina spp. (cordgrass) that has been attributed to herbivory by the crab Sesarma reticulatum. At 12 surveyed Cape Cod salt marsh sites, 10% ‚Äì 90% of creek banks experienced die-off of cordgrass in association with a highly denuded substrate and high density of crab burrows. Populations of Sesarma reticulatum are increasing, possibly as a result of the degradation of the coastal food web in the region.Holdredge, C., Bertness, M. D. and Altieri, A. H. (2008). \\"Role of crab herbivory in die-off of New England salt marshes\\". Conservation Biology, 23: (3), 672‚Äì679. The bare areas left by the intense grazing of cordgrass by Sesarma reticulatum at Cape Cod are suitable for occupation by another burrowing crab, Uca pugnax, which are not known to consume live macrophytes. The intense bioturbation of salt marsh sediments from this crab's burrowing activity has been shown to dramatically reduce the success of Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda maritima seed germination and established seedling survival, either by burial or exposure of seeds, or uprooting or burial of established seedlings.Smith, S. M. and Tyrrell, M. C. (2012). \\"Effects of mud fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) on the recruitment of halophyte seedlings in salt marsh dieback areas of Cape Cod\\" (Massachusetts, USA). Ecological Research, 27: 233‚Äì237. However, bioturbation by crabs may also have a positive effect. In New Zealand, the tunnelling mud crab Helice crassa has been given the stately name of an 'ecosystem engineer' for its ability to construct new habitats and alter the access of nutrients to other species. Their burrows provide an avenue for the transport of dissolved oxygen in the burrow water through the oxic sediment of the burrow walls and into the surrounding anoxic sediment, which creates the perfect habitat for special nitrogen cycling bacteria. These nitrate reducing (denitrifying) bacteria quickly consume the dissolved oxygen entering into the burrow walls to create the oxic mud layer that is thinner than that at the mud surface. This allows a more direct diffusion path for the export of nitrogen (in the form of gaseous nitrogen (N2)) into the flushing tidal water.Vopel, K. and Hancock, N. (2005). \\"Marine ecosystems: more than just a crab hole\\". Water & Atmosphere, 13: (3), 18‚Äì19. Restoration and management Glasswort (Salicornia spp.) a species endemic to the high marsh zone. The perception of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging that they are one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds. They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats.Broome, SW, Seneca, ED, Woodhouse, WW (1988). \\"Tidal Marsh Restoration\\". Aquatic Botany 32: 1‚Äì22. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the Habitats Directive respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through managed retreat or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China are still to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed. Bakker et al. (1997)Bakker, JP, Esselink, P, Van Der Wal, R, Dijkema, KS (1997). 'Options for restoration and management of coastal salt marshes in Europe,' in Urbanska, KM, Webb, NR, Edwards, PJ (eds), Restoration Ecology and Sustainable Development. Cambridge University Press, UK. p. 286-322. suggests two options available for restoring salt marshes. The first is to abandon all human interference and leave the salt marsh to complete its natural development. These types of restoration projects are often unsuccessful as vegetation tends to struggle to revert to its original structure and the natural tidal cycles are shifted due to land changes. The second option suggested by Bakker et al. (1997) is to restore the destroyed habitat into its natural state either at the original site or as a replacement at a different site. Under natural conditions, recovery can take 2‚Äì10 years or even longer depending on the nature and degree of the disturbance and the relative maturity of the marsh involved. Marshes in their pioneer stages of development will recover more rapidly than mature marshes as they are often first to colonize the land. It is important to note, that restoration can often be sped up through the replanting of native vegetation. Common reed (Phragmites australis) an invasive species in degraded marshes in the northeastern United States. This last approach is often the most practiced and generally more successful than allowing the area to naturally recover on its own. The salt marshes in the state of Connecticut in the United States have long been an area lost to fill and dredging. As of 1969, the Tidal Wetland Act was introduced that ceased this practice, but despite the introduction of the act, the system was still degrading due to alterations in tidal flow. One area in Connecticut is the marshes on Barn Island. These marshes were diked then impounded with salt and brackish marsh during 1946‚Äì1966. As a result, the marsh shifted to a freshwater state and became dominated by the invasive species P. australis, Typha angustifolia and T. latifolia that have little ecological connection to the area. By 1980, a restoration programme was put in place that has now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re- establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery can depend on the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna. Although much effort has gone into restoring salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once a better understanding of these processes is acquired, and not just locally, but over a global scale, then more sound and practical management and restoration efforts can be implemented to preserve these valuable marshes and restore them to their original state. While humans are situated along coastlines, there will always be the possibility of human- induced disturbances despite the number of restoration efforts we plan to implement. Dredging, pipelines for offshore petroleum resources, highway construction, accidental toxic spills or just plain carelessness are examples that will for some time now and into the future be the major influences of salt marsh degradation. Atlantic ribbed mussel, found in the low marsh In addition to restoring and managing salt marsh systems based on scientific principles, the opportunity should be taken to educate public audiences of their importance biologically and their purpose as serving as a natural buffer for flood protection. Because salt marshes are often located next to urban areas, they are likely to receive more visitors than remote wetlands. By physically seeing the marsh, people are more likely to take notice and be more aware of the environment around them. An example of public involvement occurred at the Famosa Slough State Marine Conservation Area in San Diego, where a \\"friends\\" group worked for over a decade in trying to prevent the area from being developed.Callaway, JC, Zedler, JB (2004). \\"Restoration of urban salt marshes: Lessons from southern California\\". Urban Ecosystems 7: 107‚Äì124. Eventually, the 5 hectare site was bought by the City and the group worked together to restore the area. The project involved removing invasive species and replanting with natives, along with public talks to other locals, frequent bird walks and clean-up events. Research methods There is a diverse range and combination of methodologies employed to understand the hydrological dynamics in salt marshes and their ability to trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.

Under these conditions water becomes a fluid with unique properties that can be used to advantage in the destruction of hazardous wastes such as PCBs. The fluid has a density between that of water vapor and liquid at standard conditions, and exhibits high gas-like diffusion rates along with high liquid-like collision rates. In addition, the behavior of water as a solvent is altered (in comparison to that of subcritical liquid water) - it behaves much less like a polar solvent. As a result, the solubility behavior is \\"reversed\\" so that chlorinated hydrocarbons become soluble in the water, allowing single-phase reaction of aqueous waste with a dissolved oxidizer. The reversed solubility also causes salts to precipitate out of solution, meaning they can be treated using conventional methods for solid-waste residuals. Efficient oxidation reactions occur at low temperature (400-650 ¬∞C) with reduced NOx production. SCWO can be classified as green chemistry or as a Clean Technology. The elevated pressures and temperatures required for SCWO are routinely encountered in industrial applications such as petroleum refining and chemical synthesis. A unique addition to the world of supercritical water (SCW) oxidation is generating high-pressure flames inside the SCW medium. The pioneer works on high-pressure Supercritical Water Flames were carried out by professor EU Franck at the German University of Karlsruhe in the late 80s. The works were mainly aimed at anticipating conditions which would cause spontaneous generation of non-desirable flames in the flameless SCW oxidation process. These flames would cause instabilities to the system and its components. ETH Zurich pursued the investigation of hydrothermal flames in continuously operated reactors. The rising needs for waste treatment and destruction methods motivated a Japanese Group in the Ebara Corporation to explore SCW flames as an environmental tool. Research on hydrothermal flames has also begun at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. The supercritical fluids reactor (SFR) at Sandia National Laboratories' Combustion Research Facility (CRF), 1995. High-pressure, high-temperature optical cell.  Basic Research  Basic research on supercritical water oxidation was undertaken in the 1990s at Sandia National Laboratory's Combustion Research Facility (CRF), in Livermore, CA. Originally proposed as a hazardous waste destruction technology in response to the Kyoto protocol, multiple waste streams were studied by Steven F. Rice and Russ Hanush, and hydrothermal (supercritical water) flames were investigated by Richard R. Steeper and Jason D. Aiken. Among the waste streams studied were military dyes and pyrotechnics, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidizing agent, and Eric Croiset was tasked with detailed measurements of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at supercritical water conditions. There were major engineering challenges associated with the deposition of salts and chemical corrosion in these supercritical water reactors, and Anthony Lajeunesse led the team investigating these issues. To address these issues Lajeunesse designed a transpiring wall reactor which introduced a pressure differential through the walls of an inner sleeve filled with pores to continuously rinse the inner walls of the reactor with fresh water. Russ Hanush was charged with the construction and operation of the supercritical fluids reactor (SFR) used for these studies. Among its design intricacies were the inconel 625 alloy necessary for operation at such extreme temperatures and pressures, and the design of the high-pressure, high-temperature optical cells used for photometric access to the reacting flows which incorporated 24 carat gold pressure seals and sapphire windows. Commercial applications Several companies in the United States are now working to commercialize supercritical reactors to destroy hazardous wastes. Widespread commercial application of SCWO technology requires a reactor design capable of resisting fouling and corrosion under supercritical conditions. In Japan a number of commercial SCWO applications exist, among them one unit for treatment of halogenated waste built by Organo. In Korea two commercial size units have been built by Hanwha. In Europe, Chematur Engineering AB of Sweden commercialized the SCWO technology for treatment of spent chemical catalysts to recover the precious metal, the AquaCat process. The unit has been built for Johnson Matthey in the UK. It is the only commercial SCWO unit in Europe and with its capacity of 3000l/h it is the largest SCWO unit in the world. Chematur's Super Critical Fluids technology was acquired by SCFI Group (Cork, Ireland) who are actively commercializing the Aqua Critox SCWO process for treatment of sludge, e.g. de- inking sludge and sewage sludge. Many long duration trials on these applications have been made and thanks to the high destruction efficiency of 99.9%+ the solid residue after the SCWO process is well suited for recycling ‚Äì in the case of de-inking sludge as paper filler and in the case of sewage sludge as phosphorus and coagulant. SCFI Group operate a 250l/h Aqua Critox demonstration plant in Cork, Ireland. Turbosystems Engineering (California, USA) is actively commercializing their patented transpiring wall SCWO reactor (\\"TWR\\") with a focus on renewable energy applications.

C. Wells (2000) Longman Pronunciation Dictionary. Harlow, Essex: Pearson, p. 478. is the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California and seat of the Municipality of Mexicali. The City of Mexicali has a population of 689,775, according to the 2010 census, while the population of the entire metropolitan area reaches 936,826; making the city and metropolitan area the second most populous in Baja California. The city maintains a highly educated and skilled population, as it has modernized and become an important population center in the desert region. Mexicali's economy has been historically based on agricultural products, and they remain a large sector of the economy. However, its economy has gradually gone from being agricultural to include industry, mainly maquiladoras‚Äîduty-free factories in which parts from the United States are imported, assembled, and then returned to the United States as finished products. International companies including Honeywell, GKN Aerospace, Kellogg's, Gulfstream, UTC Aerospace Systems, SunPower, Rockwell Collins, LG Electronics, National Oilwell Varco, Mitsubishi, Autolite, Nestl√©, Coca-Cola, Robert Bosch, and Goodrich Corporation have built maquiladora plants in the city. Mexicali became the national center for the aerospace industry in Mexico when Rockwell Collins established an operation there in 1966. Rockwell Collins is the oldest company under the maquiladora program nationwide. Founded on March 14, 1903, Mexicali is situated on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border adjacent to its sister city Calexico, California, with which it forms a dual- state, international population center, Calexico‚ÄìMexicali.  History  =Early history= The Spaniards arrived in the area after crossing the Sonoran Desert's \\"Camino del Diablo\\" or Devil's Road. This led to the evangelization of the area by Catholic missionaries and also to the reduction of native populations in the region. Nowadays, indigenous Cocopah people still inhabit a small government-protected corner of the Colorado River delta near the junction of the Hardy and the Colorado. The Cocopah mostly work on agricultural ejidos or fishing. The early European presence in this area was limited to Anza's and subsequent Spanish expeditions across the Colorado Desert and subsequent travelers on the Sonora Road opened by them. Also the presence of the Jesuits who attempted to establish a mission in what is now Fort Yuma. They left after a revolt by the Yuma in 1781. After this, the Spanish had little to do with the northeastern corner of the Baja California Peninsula, perceiving it as an untamable, flood-prone desert delta. Later in the 1820s, the Mexican authorities reopened the Sonoran Road and restored peaceful relations with the Yuma People.George William Beattie, \\"Reopened the Anza Road\\", The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 2, No. 1. (Mar., 1933), pp. 52‚Äì71 The Sonoran Road provided a route for American fur trappers, and later American troops of Kearny and Cooke passing through the area during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The annexation of most of Alta California soon was followed by the California Gold Rush that saw a flood of gold seekers from Mexico on the Sonora Road, especially from Sonora, and from the United States via the Southern Emigrant Trail. Herds of cattle and sheep were driven into California across this desert trail also. This route became a U.S. Mail and stagecoach route in 1857 when the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and in 1858 Butterfield Overland Mail route passed along the Alamo and New Rivers and established stations there including its New River Station in the vicinity of a Laguna along the New River in what is now Colonia Hidalgo, Mexicali in 1858. This mail route remained in use until 1877 when the Southern Pacific Railroad came to Yuma making it obsolete. =Late 19th century= In the mid-19th century, a geologist working for the Southern Pacific Railroad came to the delta area, discovering what the native Yumans had known for centuries: that the thick river sediment deposits made the area prime farming land. These sediments extended far to the west of the river itself, accumulating in a shallow basin below the Sierra de Cucap√°. However, from this time period until the 1880s, the area was almost completely unpopulated, mostly due to its harsh climate. In 1888, the federal government granted a large part of northern Baja state, including Mexicali, to Guillermo Andrade, with the purpose of colonizing the area on the recently created border with the United States. However, around 1900, the only area with any real population, aside from the Cocopah, were concentrated in Los Algodones, to the east of Mexicali. =20th century= In 1900, the U.S.-based California Development Company received permission from the government of D√≠az to cut a canal through the delta's Arroyo Alamo, to link the dry basin with the Colorado River. To attract farmers to the area, the developers named it the \\"Imperial Valley\\". In 1903, the first 500 farmers arrived; by late 1904, 405 km¬≤ (100,000 acres) of valley were irrigated, with 10,000 people settled on the land harvesting cotton, fruits, and vegetables. The concentration of small housing units that straddled the border was called Calexico on the U.S. side and Mexicali on the Mexican side. Led by Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, one company controlled 800,000 hectares of land in northern Baja California by 1905, and began to build the irrigation system for the Valley. However, instead of using Mexican labor to dig the ditches, Chandler brought in thousands of Chinese laborers. Mexicali became culturally Chinese influenced. The Mexican side was named Mexicali (a portmanteau composed of \\"Mexico\\" and \\"California\\") by Coronel Agust√≠n Sanguin√©z. Initially the area belonged to the municipality of Ensenada. The town of Mexicali was officially created on 14 March 1903 when Manuel Vizcarra was named as the town's first authority and Assistant Judge (juez auxiliar). On January 29, 1911, Mexicali was briefly \\"liberated\\" by the Liberal Party of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Mayor Baltazar Avil√©z declared the municipality of Mexicali on November 4, 1914 and called for elections to creation of the first ayuntamiento or municipality, which was then headed by Francisco L. Montejano. Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Downtown Mexicali Mexicali, seen from the International Space Station, is situated south of the Mexico‚ÄìUS border In the 20th century, the Colorado Riverland Company, a U.S.-based company, was dedicated to renting Mexican land to farmers; however, these farmers were almost always foreigners, such as Chinese, East Indians and Japanese. Mexicans were employed only as seasonal laborers. This situation led to the agrarian conflict known as the \\"\\" (Assault on the Lands) in 1937. in which Mexican land was taken by Mexicans. Agricultural production continued to increase during the 20th century. Cotton became the most important crop and helped develop the textile industry. In the early 1950s, the Mexicali Valley became the biggest cotton-producing zone in the country and in the 1960s, production reached more than half a million parcels a year. Currently, the Valley still is one of Mexico's most productive agricultural regions, mostly producing wheat, cotton and vegetables. The city of Mexicali is one of Mexico's most important exporters of asparagus, broccoli, carrots, green onions, lettuce, peas, peppers, radishes and tomatoes to the world. The government of the municipality was reorganized when the Baja California territory became the 29th state in 1953. The first factories appeared in the 1960s with the end of the Bracero program. A 1988 study found 100 factories in the city, including 10 electronics manufacturers, 25 auto parts manufacturers,27 textile plants and nine plastics companies. Most maquiladoras are run by US companies, followed by Mexican, South Korean, and Japanese companies. =21st century= Today Mexicali is an important center for maquiladora (assembly plant) production in the automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, metallurgical, and health items as well as manufacturing and exporting products to various countries. The 2010 Baja California earthquake occurred on Easter Sunday about 60 km south-southeast of Mexicali. This very large magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred at 15:40:40 local time (UTC‚àí8) according to the U.S. Geological Survey. With a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong), it was felt in northern Baja California near the United States‚ÄìMexico border, and was also felt in western cities such as Tijuana, San Diego, Los Angeles and parts of Arizona. Geography The Mexicali Valley is one of the largest and most fertile valleys in Mexico. Over fifty different crops are grown in the valley, which is similar in production to the Imperial Valley. National and international industries have invested in Mexicali and surrounding cities to take advantage of its tax-free status given to industry. The Mexicali Valley is a primary source of water for the region, which is the largest irrigation district in Mexico. =Ecology= Despite its arid desert location, Mexicali is watered through a system of aquifers in the valley. Under a 1944 water treaty, the city is \\"...guaranteed an annual quantity of [of water] to be delivered...\\" from the Colorado River. However, a proposed concrete lining in the United States on the All-American Canal would cut off billions of leaked gallons of water, which is used to irrigate onions, alfalfa, asparagus, squash and other crops in Mexicali. The nearby Cerro Prieto volcano is adjacent to the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Power Station. which creates high volumes of pollutants, among them, mercury. As of 2014, the government are creating a zone of exclusion, due to the alarming amount of pollutants and contamination that has permeated throughout miles around the geothermal plant of Cerro Prieto. =Climate= Because of its low annual precipitation, Mexicali has an arid climate (BWh), featuring long, extremely hot summers and mild to warm winters. Under the criteria for the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mexicali maintains desert weather temperatures every year. On December 12, 1932, the city experienced snowfall. Rainfall usually occurs in the winter months of December, January and February. Summer rainfall in the city is infrequent, although in some years thunderstorms and the remnants of tropical storms and hurricanes passing over Baja from the Pacific can sometimes drop heavy rainfall (most likely in August and September). A notable example was Hurricane Kathleen (1976), which dropped several inches of rain in the area. During winter time, Mexicali is affected by the snow storms that pass by the town of La Rumorosa located in the Sierra de Ju√°rez, about 45 minutes west of the city, causing a decrease in temperature that lasts from two days to one week. The summer temperatures in Mexicali are significantly higher than Tijuana, the other major city in Baja California. This is caused by the temperatures in Tijuana being moderated by the ocean, but nearby inland areas such as Mexicali being significantly hotter. However, the hot desert climate seen in Mexicali is actually not unusual for similar parallels, seen in Baghdad, Iraq for example. On 28 July 1995 the daily high temperature in Mexicali was the highest ever recorded in Mexico, . Economy In its beginnings Mexicali was an important center for cotton production for export, until synthetic fabrics reduced the worldwide demand for the fiber. Currently, horticulture is the most successful agricultural activity with scallion (green onion), and asparagus being among the most important crops. Cotton and wheat are still grown, but low government price guarantees and subsidies make wheat farmer protests an annual event. There is an annual agri-business fair, which if unfunded by the government, would have been dead a decade ago, named AGROBAJA, Agrobaja in March of every year, drawing people by the thousands, from all over Mexico and before the crisis, from the United States. The current prospects for economic growth in Mexicali rely on in-bond and assembly plants (maquiladoras), which come due to low wages and loose worker right laws, include companies like, Selther, Daewoo Electronics, Mitsubishi, Honeywell, Paccar, Vitro, Skyworks Solutions, CareFusion, Bosch, Price Pfister, Gulfstream, United Technologies Corporation, Kenworth, Kwikset and Rockwell Collins. Mexicali is also home to many food processing plants such as Nestl√©, Jumex, Bimbo, Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, and Sabritas. A new Corona Beer brewery is under construction as of June 2019. In December 2018 there were 180 in all, employing 70,000 people. =Silicon Border and Unaccounted Public Money Controversy= Silicon Border is an empty development supposedly tailored to the specific needs of high-technology manufacturing and is situated in the outskirts of Mexicali, along the western border of the U.S. and Mexico. The aim of the empty manufacturing park, which began in 2004, was to transform Mexicali into the world's next semiconductor manufacturing center, if the world economy was fine. The Mexican federal and Baja California state governments have given away $2 million of public money to private hands, without a referendum for the design of the project and the laying of a few streets and lamp posts that can be seen on the premises as the only work done. Neither authorities nor the private frontmen of the project have given the public any account on what the public money was spent on. Former president Vicente Fox offered 10 years of a tax rate as low as 3% to foreign owned factories. The premises sit empty as of April 2019. =Tourism= Cars crossing the border station from Mexicali-Calexico Mexicali also relies on tourism as a medium to generate revenue, and visitors cross by foot or by car from Calexico, United States, every day. Tourists are mainly attracted to local taco stands, restaurants, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs. Near the border, in walking distance, there are many shops and stalls selling Mexican curios and souvenirs. Arizona and Nevada residents look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, since they tend to be less expensive than in the United States. Pharmacies sell some drugs without a prescription and at much lower cost than in the US, but some medications still require a doctor's prescription, although several accessible doctor offices are located near the border as well. Mexico's drinking age is 18 years old (vs. 21 in the United States) which makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college students from Southern California. Mexicali hosts Baja Prog, one of the world's most important events in progressive rock. Since 1997, Baja Prog has been in the eyes of the world for being an event gathering the best bands of the progressive rock scene. Mexicali hosts four main shopping malls, the most visited being Plaza La Cachanilla, located a mile away from the US border. The mall hosts a variety of shops, which sell a wide array of items, ranging from cheap Mexican curios to expensive imports. The Plaza La Cachanilla also represents a common place for people to socialize, especially during summer days when the weather reaches high temperatures, many families come and spend the day inside the air-conditioned mall. For recreation, Mexicali has bath halls, bowling alleys, traditional cantinas, car clubs, strip clubs, movie theaters, museums, a zoo, a convention center, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants for every choice of food. Galerias del Valle, holds a WalMart Supercenter, a 12-screen movie theater Cinepolis, two casinos, and a food court, plus a large array of stores that sell many items needed for daily living. It is located on Boulevard Lazaro Cardenas at Calle 11. Cityscape Mexicali‚ÄìCalexico metropolitan area =City districts= The municipality of Mexicali is divided into the city main and 14 Administrative Districts, which are mainly located in the outskirts of the city and the largest populations in the Mexicali Valley. These Distrital offices offer municipal services such as Urban Planning, Vital Statistics, Street-Vending Inspection, Compliance, Public Works and Community Development and are, each, supervised by a Municipal Delegate. Civic Center ‚Äì In this sub-area are located the main federal, state and municipal buildings. Not far from the Civic Center is the New River, where there are other prominent buildings and premises like the CEART (State Center for the Arts) and the Mexicali Zoo. = La Chinesca = Monument to the Chinese Community in Friendship Square The city claimed to have the largest per capita concentration of residents of Chinese origin in Mexico, around 5,000 until 2012 when the Tijuana La Mesa District surpassed that number at 15,000 Chinese immigrants. The Chinese immigrants came to the area as laborers for the Colorado River Land Company, an American enterprise which designed and built an extensive irrigation system in the Valley of Mexicali. Some immigrants came from the United States, often fleeing anti-Chinese policies there, while others sailed directly from China. Thousands of Chinese were lured to the area by the promise of high wages, but that never materialized. Since 2000, new migrants from China to Mexicali come from many of the same areas as before 1960, with perhaps 90% from Guangdong or Hong Kong.Auy√≥n Gerardo, Eduardo. 2003. El drag√≥n en el desierto: los pioneros chinos en Mexicali. Mexicali, Baja California: Centro de Investigaci√≥n de la Cultura China Demographics As of 2010, the city of Mexicali had a population of 689,775. The city itself had a 2005 census population of 653,046, whereas the municipality's population was 895,962. It is the 13th largest municipality in Mexico as of the Census 2005 with population estimates exceeding one million alone. The population is constantly growing due to the number of maquiladoras in the area, lack of urban planning, and migrational aspects, like seasonal labor and the constant in-and-out flow of immigrants to the U.S. or into Mexico. Environment A study by Instituto Mexicano de la Competitividad has listed Mexicali as Mexico's most polluted air of large cities, with a PM10 rating of 137 for the year 2010. It is thought that the reason is lack of pavement (dust) and lack of wind, especially in summer. No information for PM5 or PM2.5 was given. Monterrey, Cuernavaca, and Tijuana rounded up the highest PM10 list in the study. The city is grappling with huge amounts of trash \\"from old appliances, to electronic waste and used tires, some of which comes from the United States.\\" Mexican government agencies in the border region have not made pollution a priority, and weak enforcement of environmental standards is considered a reason that multinationals locate factories there, along with low wages. It is difficult for residents to obtain information about toxic emissions, even information provided to the Mexican government. In general, maquiladoras are supposed to return any toxic waste to its country of origin, but in some cases it can be handled in Mexico. Education Faculty of Administrative Sciences of the UABC UABC Cultural Research Center According to a previous census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in 2008, the number of students who have graduated from Mexicali's public and private schools are as follows: Pre-scholar students: 18,648 Primary school students: 17,272 Secondary school students: 12,337 Technical education students: 531 Baccalaureate students: 6,152 Some public universities in the city include Autonomous University of Baja California, Campus Mexicali, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Baja California and the Mexicali Institute of Technology. Private universities include Centro de Ense√±anza T√©cnica y Superior, University of the Valley of Mexico and Xochicalco University. Culture Mexicali's \\"House of Culture\\" decorated for Day of the Dead The residents of Mexicali (Mexicalenses) call themselves \\"Cachanillas\\" (due to a local plant, the cachanilla, used by the Cucapah tribe to build shacks) and are from culturally diverse backgrounds. It is among the most ethnically diverse cities in Mexico, with people from various Native American, European, African, East Asian, and Middle Eastern origins. There is a very popular song called \\"Puro Cachanilla\\" also known as \\"El Cachanilla\\" that identifies people from Mexicali. In 2004, there were 11 theaters in the city: #Teatro del Estado. #Teatro de Casa de Cultura de Mexicali. Idem. #Teatro del CREA #Teatro Universitario de Mexicali, it is mainly used for UABC ceremonies and occasionally for plays. #Teatro al Aire Libre de Rector√≠a which hasn't been used in the last 30 years. #Teatro del Seguro Social that was inaugurated in the 1970s. #Teatro al aire libre del Centro de Ense√±anza T√©cnica y Superior CETYS unveiled in September 2006. #Teatro del Centro de Ense√±anza T√©cnica y Superior CETYS. #IMAX Theatre at the Sol del Ni√±o Museum #Centro Estatal de las Artes with multiple theater and convention center Mexicali also has the Baja Prog festival, a series of progressive rock concerts that take place during four consecutive days in springtime. It is hosted by CAST, a progressive rock band from Mexicali. Sports  Mexicali has many sites visited by people from across the country, as well as by visitors from the U.S. and Canada, such as the bullfighting arena, Plaza Calafia, where one or two bullfights are held yearly. Mexicali also has a professional 18-hole golf course, Club Campestre, where both national and international championships have taken place. The Plaza Calafia bullring in Mexicali, Baja California. =Basketball= The city's professional basketball team is Soles de Mexicali of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP). Soles lifted the national trophy as the 2006‚Äì07, 2014‚Äì15, 2017‚Äì18, and 2019‚Äì20 LNBP Champions. Their stadium, the Auditorio del Estado, is located in Ciudad Deportiva de Mexicali. The Bomberos de Mexicali were founded in 2010 and participated in the Pacific Coast Basketball Circuit, CIBACOPA. The team demonstrated strong results in the first leg of its inaugural season, yet was negatively affected by the April 4th earthquake, seeing its second leg play out as a road team in Tijuana's Municipal Auditorium. Due to the earthquake and its aftershocks, the Civil Protection Ministry of Mexicali ceased all massive events within enclosed structures. The Bomberos reached an agreement with the Municipal Government to renovate the hardwood of the Mexicali Gymnasium and call the Silver Colossus their home. Another defunct franchise, Calor de Mexicali (Mexicali Heat), participated in the 2007 edition of the league. They played their home games at the Gimnasio de Mexicali located on Avenida Reforma. Mexicali was also home to a 2006 American Basketball Association franchise, the Centinelas de Mexicali (The Sentinels). =Soccer= Ciudad Deportiva houses a football stadium where Cachanillas de Mexicali, a Mexican Third Division team plays. The home of the Pioneros del Valle, also a Mexican third division football team, is located in the Mexicali Valley. =Baseball= In addition, Ciudad Deportiva is the location of Estadio B'Air, where the √Åguilas de Mexicali play, competing in winter baseball's Mexican Pacific League (LMP). The team was founded on October 14, 1976 and have won the championship four times, 1985‚Äì86 (managed by Benjamin Reyes), in 1988‚Äì89 (manager Dave Machemer), in 1998‚Äì99 (manager Francisco Estrada), and in 2016‚Äì17 (manager Roberto ‚ÄúChapo‚Äù Vizcarra). Their brightest moment came when they won the 1986 Caribbean Series in Venezuela, becoming only the second Mexican team to take the title. Mexicali was the host for the Caribbean Series in 2009, and the qualification for the 2017 World Baseball Classic, in March 2016. The Centinelas de Mexicali are a professional team which plays in the North Sonora League, the main development league for the LMP. Young Mexicali baseball players have played in the Little League World Series three times; first in 1985, with the F√©lix Arce Little League representing the United States West region, and then in 2005 and 2007, the Seguro Social Little League representing Mexicali. =American football= The team plays in the newly built convention center, while local businessmen negotiate a deal for an American football team with the af2 under ownership of the Arena Football League in 2008. The owners announced they made a new team, the Mexicali Borregos Salvajes, which has not officially joined af2 but could play in Mexico's pro LFA league. Autonomous University of Baja California's Mexicali campus also fields a college football team, the . Infrastructure Rail tracks on Avenida Lopez Mateos leading north to the border crossing. =Transportation= Land Mexicali is located at a Junction of major interstates and federal highways. These include Interstate 8, leading from San Diego to the Arizona Sun Corridor where the cities of Phoenix and Tucson dominate, Federal Highway 2, which leads east to San Luis R√≠o Colorado and west to Tijuana, and Federal Highway 5 connecting San Felipe with Mexicali. Other roads lead southwest to Ensenada or north to the Imperial Valley. The road system in the city of Mexicali and its conurbation is very complex. Over the urban area long boulevards are traversed from one end of which most are 6 lanes with a median of 2 lanes. The backbone of the city is the Lazaro Cardenas Boulevard extending from east to west. This boulevard is 24.5 km long and consists of 6 lanes (3 each direction), a shoulder in each direction, and ridges of 3 lanes creating a wingspan of 50 meters. In certain sections the boulevard is made of 8 to 10 lanes. Other important boulevards include: Adolfo Lopez Mateos, Benito Ju√°rez, An√°huac, Justo Sierra, Venustiano Carranza, Manuel G√≥mez Morin, Francisco L. Montejano, Cetys, H√©ctor Ter√°n Ter√°n, Independencia and Heroico Colegio Militar, among others. There are two corridors within the city: New River Ecological Corridor, which is guided in the ancient New River bed, and the Palaco Industrial Corridor,Palaco Industrial Corridor this crosses the southern Industrial zone of Mexicali. There is also the beltway, located in the east of the city, connecting the Lazaro Cardenas Blvd. with Islas Agrarias Blvd.Islas Agrarias and the road to Colonia Abasolo,Colonia Abasolo and this in turn with the Airport Road. Within the urban area there are vehicular bridges, like the L√°zaro C√°rdenas-Benito Ju√°rez Blvds. underpass, H√©ctor Ter√°n Ter√°n-San Felipe Hwy underpass, Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos-Independencia Bridge, and L√°zaro C√°rdenas-Adolfo Lopez Mateos Distributor. The latter has a 15-m high bridge which makes it the highest in northwestern Mexico. It was also designed with first-world seismic technology, and would withstand earthquakes of similar intensity as the one that occurred on April 4, 2010. On 6 January 2011 at a press conference, the city of Mexicali, led by Francisco Jos√© P√©rez-Tejada Padilla, along with the state governor Jos√© Guadalupe Osuna Mill√°n, unveiled the modernized Palaco Industrial Corridor. This project would have been the largest and most expensive in the history of road infrastructure in Mexicali with an initial investment of 285 million pesos and 546 million more for the installation of the Express Line 1 (Fast Transportation bus line), with a total investment of 831 million pesos. The new Palaco Industrial Corridor began constructions in March 2011, with 6 lanes and berms at the edges that included two additional lanes to service the BRT. Its opening was planned for Wednesday, March 14, 2012. However, the project sits unable to be used since the Chief Architect for the project, who is the brother of the City Mayor, mis-measured the lanes on which the buses were to travel on, which ended up being more narrow than needed, rendering the whole project useless. Nobody knows where the tonnes of unused cement lay and what was done with it and the money was never spent. =Metropolitan transit= In the past 10 years, the public transport system has improved with the implementation of modern units. Currently there are over 40 routes across the city and its urban area, where companies like Atusa Plus, Getusmex, among others, offer this service. The fees for bus service marked by the Municipal Transportation System are: *Modern service unit with A/C: 13.00 pesos, although they change the amount in units which have no Air Conditioning on. *Standard service unit without A/C: 6.50 pesos Air The city is linked to other Mexican cities by Mexicali International Airport, which serves the city and the surrounding towns. Sea The proposed canal linking the Gulf of California with Mexicali, by way of Laguna Salada, would provide sea transportation to and from the Gulf from other important west coast cities and regional inland centers such as San Diego, Ensenada, and Phoenix.

Katz. (Univ. Chicago, 1979). 4 vols. , , , are an influential 18th-century treatise on the common law of England by Sir William Blackstone, originally published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford, 1765‚Äì1770. The work is divided into four volumes, on the rights of persons, the rights of things, of private wrongs and of public wrongs. The Commentaries were long regarded as the leading work on the development of English law and played a role in the development of the American legal system. They were in fact the first methodical treatise on the common law suitable for a lay readership since at least the Middle Ages. The common law of England has relied on precedent more than statute and codifications and has been far less amenable than the civil law, developed from the Roman law, to the needs of a treatise. The Commentaries were influential largely because they were in fact readable, and because they met a need. The Commentaries are often quoted as the definitive pre-Revolutionary source of common law by United States courts. Opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States quote from Blackstone's work whenever they wish to engage in historical discussion that goes back that far, or farther (for example, when discussing the intent of the Framers of the Constitution). The book was famously used as the key in Benedict Arnold's book cipher, which he used to communicate secretly with his conspirator John Andr√© during their plot to betray the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Contents Sir William Blackstone as illustrated in his Commentaries on the Laws of England. =The Rights of Persons= The Rights of Persons is the first volume in the four part series that is the Commentaries. Divided into 18 chapters, it is largely concerned with the rights of individuals; the rights of Parliament; the rights and title of the King; the royal family; the councils belonging to the King; kingly duties; the royal prerogative; the King's revenue; subordinate magistrates; the people (aliens, denizens, and natives); the rights of the clergy; the civil state; the military and maritime states; the relationship between master and servant (in modern-day terminology, employer and employee), husband and wife, parent and child, guardian and ward; and finally corporates. =The Rights of Things= The Rights of Things, Blackstone's longest volume, deals with property. The vast majority of the text is devoted to real property, this being the most valuable sort in the feudal law upon which the English law of land was founded. Property in chattels was already beginning to overshadow property in land, but its law lacked the complex feudal background of the common law of land, and was not dealt with nearly as extensively by Blackstone. =Of Private Wrongs= Of Private Wrongs dealt with torts as they existed in Blackstone's time. The various methods of trial that existed at civil law were also dealt with in this volume, as were the jurisdictions of the several courts, from the lowest to the highest. Almost as an afterthought, Blackstone also adds a brief chapter on equity, the parallel legal system that existed in English law at the time, seeking to address wrongs that the common law did not handle. =Of Public Wrongs= Of Public Wrongs is Blackstone's treatise on criminal law. Here, Blackstone the apologist takes centre stage; he seeks to explain how the criminal laws of England were just and merciful, despite becoming later known as the Bloody Code for their severity. He does however accept that \\"It is a melancholy truth, that among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, no less than an hundred and sixty have been declared by Act of Parliament to be felonious without benefit of clergy; or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death\\". Blackstone frequently resorted to assuring his reader that the laws as written were not always enforced, and that the King's power of pardon could be exercised to correct any hardships or injustices. Legacy Blackstone for the first time made the common law readable and understandable by non-lawyers. At first, his Commentaries were hotly contested, some seeing in them an evil or covert attempt to reduce or codify the common law which was anathema to common law purists. For decades, a study of the Commentaries was required reading for all first year law students. Lord Avonmore said of Blackstone: \\"He it was who first gave to the law the air of a science. He found it a skeleton and clothed it with life, colour and complexion. He embraced the cold statue and by his touch, it grew into youth, health and beauty.\\" Jeremy Bentham, who had been a critic of the Commentaries when they were first published, credits Blackstone with having: \\"... taught jurisprudence to speak the language of the scholar and the gentleman; put a polish upon that rugged science, cleansed her from the dust and cobwebs of the office and, if he has not enriched her with that precision which is drawn only from the sterling treasury of the sciences, has decked her out to advantage from the toilet of classical erudition, enlivened her with metaphors and allusions and sent her abroad in some measure to instruct.\\" While there is much valuable historical information in the Commentaries, later historians have tended to be somewhat critical of the uses Blackstone made of history. the easy and contradictory assurance that England's current political settlement represented the optimal state of rational and just government, while claiming simultaneously that this optimal state was an ideal that had always existed in the past, despite the many struggles in England's history between overreaching kings and wayward parliaments. But Blackstone's chief contribution was to create a succinct, readable, and above all handy epitome of the common law tradition. While useful in England, Blackstone's text answered an urgent need in the developing United States and Canada. In the United States, the common law tradition was being spread into frontier areas, but it was not feasible for lawyers and judges to carry around the large libraries that contained the common law precedents. The four volumes of Blackstone put the gist of that tradition in portable form. They were required reading for most lawyers in the Colonies, and for many, they were the only reading. Two decades after their publication, Blackstone's Commentaries were the focus of a mocking polemic by Jeremy Bentham, called Fragment on Government. This dissection of Blackstone's first book made Bentham's name notorious, though it was originally published anonymously. In 1841‚Äì45 Henry John Stephen published New Commentaries on the Laws of England (Partly Founded on Blackstone), whose structure was modelled on Blackstone's work and which liberally quoted from it; much of Blackstone's text remained as late as 1914 in the 16th edition of Stephen's Commentaries; in 1922 under Edward Jenks most of the text was rewritten but the structure was realigned more closely to Blackstone's original.; Quotations *\\"That the King can do no wrong, is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution.\\" *\\"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer.\\" *\\"There is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination, and engages the affections of mankind, as the right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. And yet there are very few, that will give themselves the trouble to consider the original and foundation of this right.\\" (Commentaries, Book II Ch.

After World War I, the U.S. rejected the Treaty of Versailles and did not join the League of Nations. In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol was prohibited by an amendment to the United States Constitution. Possession of liquor, and drinking it, was never illegal. The overall level of ab alcohol consumption did go down, however, state and local governments avoided aggressive enforcement. The federal government was overwhelmed with cases, so that bootlegging and speakeasies flourished in every city, and well-organized criminal gangs exploded in numbers, finances, power, and influence on city politics.Daniel Okrent 2010. Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (2010) A few local domestic-terrorist attacks from radicals, like the 1920 Wall Street Bombing and the 1919 United States anarchist bombings sparked the first Red Scare. Culture wars between fundamentalist Christians and modernists became more intense, as demonstrated by prohibition, the KKK, and the highly publicized Scopes Trial. The nation enjoyed a period of sustained prosperity, 1921‚Äì1929. Agriculture went through a bubble in soaring land prices that collapsed in 1921, and that sector remained depressed. Coal mining was shrinking as oil became the main energy source. Otherwise most sectors prospered. Construction flourished as office buildings, factories, paved roads, and new housing was evident everywhere. Automobile production soared, suburban housing expanded and the nation's homes, towns and cities were electrified, along with some farms. Prices were stable, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew steadily until 1929, when the financial speculation bubble burst as Wall Street crashed. In foreign policy President Wilson helped found the League of Nations but the U.S. never joined it, as the Congress refused to give up its constitutional role in declaring war. The nation instead took the initiative to disarm the world, most notably at the Washington Conference in 1921‚Äì22. Washington also stabilized the European economy through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at stabilizing the traditional ethnic balance and strictly limiting the total inflow. The act completely blocked Asian immigrants, providing no means for them to get in.https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression led to government efforts to restart the economy and help its victims. The recovery, however, was very slow. The nadir of the Great Depression was 1933, and recovery was rapid until the recession of 1938 proved a setback. There were no major new industries in the 1930s that were big enough to drive growth the way autos, electricity and construction had been so powerful in the 1920s. GDP surpassed 1929 levels in 1940. By 1939, isolationist sentiment in America had ebbed, and after the stunning fall of France in 1940 to Nazi Germany the United States began rearming itself and sent a large stream of money and military supplies to Britain, China and the Soviet Union. After the sudden Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered the war against Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy, and Nazi Germany, known as the \\"Axis Powers\\". Italy surrendered in 1943, and Germany and Japan in 1945, after massive devastation and loss of life, while the US emerged far richer and with few casualties.  1919: strikes, riots and scares  The United States was in turmoil throughout 1919. The huge number of returning veterans could not find work, something the Wilson administration had given little thought to. After the war, fear of subversion resumed in the context of the Red Scare, massive strikes in major industries (steel, meatpacking) and violent race riots. Radicals bombed Wall Street, and workers went on strike in Seattle in February. During 1919, a series of more than 20 riotous and violent black-white race-related incidents occurred. These included the Chicago, Omaha, and Elaine Race Riots. A phenomenon known as the Red Scare took place 1918‚Äì1919. With the rise of violent Communist revolutions in Europe, leftist radicals were emboldened by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and were eager to respond to Lenin's call for world revolution. On May 1, 1919, a parade in Cleveland, Ohio, protesting the imprisonment of the Socialist Party leader, Eugene Debs, erupted into the violent May Day Riots. A series of bombings in 1919 and assassination attempts further inflamed the situation. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducted the Palmer Raids, a series of raids and arrests of non-citizen socialists, anarchists, radical unionists, and immigrants. They were charged with planning to overthrow the government. By 1920, over 10,000 arrests were made, and the aliens caught up in these raids were deported back to Europe, most notably the anarchist Emma Goldman, who years before had attempted to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick.Stanley Coben, \\"A Study in Nativism: The American Red Scare of 1919‚Äì20,\\" Political Science Quarterly Vol. 79, No. 1 (Mar., 1964), pp. 52‚Äì75 in JSTOR  Aftermath of World War I  A 1919 sheet music cover, noting that many young veterans had served in France and were leaving rural America for the cities A popular Tin Pan Alley song of 1919 asked, concerning the United States troops returning from World War I, \\"How Ya Gonna Keep 'em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?\\". In fact, many did not remain \\"down on the farm\\"; there was a great migration of youth from farms to nearby towns and smaller cities.Linda Lobao and Katherine Meyer. \\"The great agricultural transition: Crisis, change, and social consequences of twentieth century US farming.\\" Annual review of sociology (2001): 103‚Äì124. The average distance moved was only 10 miles (16 km). Few went to the cities with over 100,000 people. However, agriculture became increasingly mechanized with widespread use of the tractor, other heavy equipment, and superior techniques disseminated through County Agents, who were employed by state agricultural colleges and funded by the Federal government. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson campaigned for the U.S. to join the new League of Nations, which he had been instrumental in creating, but he rejected the Republican compromise on the issue, and it was impossible to gain a 2/3 majority. During a grueling cross- country tour to promote the League, Wilson suffered a series of strokes. He never recovered physically and lost his leadership skills and was unable to negotiate or compromise. The Senate rejected entry into the League.John Milton Cooper, 'Woodrow Wilson (2009) ch 23‚Äì24 Defeat in the Great War left Germany in a state of turmoil and heavily in debt for war reparations, payments to the victorious Allies. The Allies in turn owed large sums to the US Treasury for war loans. The US effectively orchestrated payment of reparations; under the Dawes Plan, American banks loaned money to Germany to pay the reparations to countries like Britain and France, which in turn paid off their own war debts to the US. In the 1920s, European and American economies reached new levels of industrial production and prosperity. Women's suffrage After a long period of agitation, U.S. women were able in 1920 to obtain the necessary votes from a majority of men to obtain the right to vote in all state and federal elections. Women participated in the 1920 Presidential and Congressional elections. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, public schools, and world peace.Lynn Dumenil, The Modern Temper: American Culture and Society in the 1920s (1995) pp 98‚Äì144 Women did respond to these issues, but in terms of general voting they shared the same outlook and the same voting behavior as men.Kristi Andersen, After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics before the New Deal (1996) The suffrage organization NAWSA became the League of Women Voters. Alice Paul's National Woman's Party began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in 1972, but was not ratified and never took effect. The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect Al Smith, while rural dry counties mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert Hoover. Catholic women were reluctant to vote in the early 1920s, but they registered in very large numbers for the 1928 election‚Äîthe first in which Catholicism was a major issue.Allan J. Lichtman, Prejudice and the Old Politics: The Presidential Election of 1928 (1979) A few women were elected to office, but none became especially prominent during this time period. Overall, the women's rights movement was dormant in the 1920s, since Susan B. Anthony and the other prominent activists had died, and apart from Alice Paul few younger women came along to replace them.  Roaring Twenties  In the U.S. presidential election of 1920, the Republican Party returned to the White House with the landslide victory of Warren G. Harding, who promised a \\"return to normalcy\\" after the years of war, ethnic hatreds, race riots and exhausting reforms. Harding used new advertising techniques to lead the GOP to a massive landslide, carrying the major cities as many Irish Catholics and Germans, feeling betrayed, deserted the Democrats.John A. Morello, Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding (2001) =Prosperity= Except for a recession in 1920‚Äì21, the United States enjoyed a period of prosperity. Good times were widespread for all sectors (except agriculture and coal mining). New industries (especially electric power, movies, automobiles, gasoline, tourist travel, highway construction, and housing) flourished. \\"The business of America is business,\\" proclaimed President Coolidge.John Steele Gordon, The Business of America (2002) p. 247 Entrepreneurship flourished and was widely hailed. Business interests had captured control of the regulatory agencies established before 1915 and used progressive rhetoric, emphasizing technological efficiency and prosperity as the keys to social improvement. William Allen White, a leading progressive spokesman, supported GOP candidate Herbert Hoover in 1928 as one who could \\"spiritualize\\" business prosperity and make it serve progressive ends.Paul W. Glad, \\"Progressives and the Business Culture of the 1920s,\\" Journal of American History, Vol. 53, No. 1 (Jun., 1966), pp. 75‚Äì89 in JSTOR Energy was a key to the economy, especially electricity and oil. As electrification reached all the cities and towns, consumers demanded new products such as light bulbs, refrigerators, and toasters.David E. Nye, Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology, 1880‚Äì1940 (1992) Factories installed electric motors and saw productivity surge.Warren D. Devine, \\"From Shafts to Wires: Historical Perspective on Electrification,\\" Journal of Economic History, June 1983, Vol. 43 Issue 2, pp 347‚Äì62 in JSTOR With the oil booms in Texas, Oklahoma, and California, the United States dominated world petroleum production, now even more important in an age of automobiles and trucks.Harold F. Williamson, The American Petroleum Industry the Age of Energy 1899‚Äì1959 (1963) Herbert Hoover Herbert Hoover became world famous by leading the Commission for Relief in Belgium in World War I. He directed the U.S. Food Administration when the U.S. entered the war, and served as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s. An energetic exponent of progressivism he promoted engineering-style efficiency in business and public service, and promoted standardization, elimination of waste, and international trade. He easily won the Republican presidential nomination in 1928 and defeated Democrat Al Smith in a landslide. Paul Glad, \\"Progressives and the Business Culture of the 1920s,\\" Journal of American history (1966,) 53#1 pp 75-89 online The promise of prosperity made Hoover president, but the reality of economic decline ruined him, as Democrats tarred him with blame for the Great Depression in the United States. He was falsely accused of ignoring the crisis. Starting in late 1929 he tried multiple new ways to reverse the economic collapse as the world-wide Great Depression engulfed the United States. He called in all the experts for advice and looked for voluntary solutions that did not require government compulsion.William J. Barber, From New Era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the Economists, and American Economic Policy, 1921-33 (1985) No matter what he did the economy spiraled downward, hitting bottom just as he left office in early 1933. He lacked the political skills to rally support and was defeated in a landslide in 1932 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. After this loss, Hoover became staunchly conservative, and spoke widely against liberal New Deal policies.Brant Short, \\"The Rhetoric of the Post-Presidency: Herbert Hoover's Campaign against the New Deal, 1934-1936\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (1991) 21#2 pp. 333-350 online =Unions= Labor unions grew very rapidly during the war, emerging with a large membership, full treasuries, and a temporary government guarantee of the right of collective bargaining. Inflation was high during the war, but wages went up even faster. However, unions were weak in heavy industry, such as automobiles and steel. Their main strength was in construction, printing, railroads, and other crafts where the AFL had a strong system in place. Total union membership had soared from 2.7 million in 1914 to 5 million at its peak in 1919. An aggressive spirit appeared in 1919, as demonstrated by the general strike in Seattle and the police strike in Boston. The larger unions made a dramatic move for expansion in 1919 by calling major strikes in clothing, meatpacking, steel, coal, and railroads. The corporations fought back, and the strikes failed. The unions held on to their gains among machinists, textile workers, and seamen, and in such industries as food and clothing, but overall membership fell back to 3.5 million, where it stagnated until the New Deal passed the Wagner Act in 1935.Melvyn Dubofsky and Foster Rhea Dulles, Labor in America: A History (Harlan Davidson, 2004) pp 210‚Äì248 Real earnings (after taking inflation, unemployment, and short hours into account) of all employees doubled over 1918‚Äì45. Setting 1918 as 100, the index went to 112 in 1923, 122 in 1929, 81 in 1933 (the low point of the depression), 116 in 1940, and 198 in 1945.U. S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series D739 The bubble of the late 1920s was reflected by the extension of credit to a dangerous degree, including in the stock market, which rose to record high levels. Government size had been at low levels, causing major freedom of the economy and more prosperity. It became apparent in retrospect after the stock market crash of 1929 that credit levels had become dangerously inflated. =Immigration restriction= The United States became more anti-immigration in outlook during this period. The American Immigration Act of 1924 limited immigration from countries where 2% of the total U.S. population, per the 1890 census (not counting African Americans), were immigrants from that country. Thus, the massive influx of Europeans that had come to America during the first two decades of the century slowed to a trickle. Asians and citizens of India were prohibited from immigrating altogether. =Jazz= The \\"Jazz Age\\" symbolized the popularity of new musics and dance forms, which attracted younger people in all the large cities as the older generation worried about the threat of looser sexual standards as suggested by the uninhibited \\"flapper.\\" In every locality, Hollywood discovered an audience for its silent films. It was an age of celebrities and heroes, with movie stars, boxers, home run hitters, tennis aces, and football standouts grabbing widespread attention.Paula Fass; The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s (Oxford University Press, 1977)George Mowry, ed. The Twenties: Fords, Flappers, and Fanatics (Prentice-Hall, 1963) Black culture, especially in music and literature, flourished in many cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and Chicago but nowhere more than in New York City, site of the Harlem Renaissance. The Cotton Club nightclub and the Apollo Theater became famous venues for artists and writers.Steven Watson, The Harlem Renaissance: Hub of African-American Culture, 1920‚Äì1930 (1995) Radio was a new industry that grew explosively from home-made crystal sets, picking up faraway stations to stations in every large city by the mid-decade.Peter Scott and James T. Walker, \\"Bringing Radio into America's Homes: Marketing New Technology in the Great Depression,‚Äù Business History Review 90#2 (Summer 2016), 251‚Äì76. By 1927 two national networks had been formed, the NBC Red Network and the Blue Network (ABC). The broadcast fare was mostly music, especially by big bands. = Prohibition = Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol. In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol was prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in an attempt to alleviate high rates of alcoholism and, especially, political corruption led by saloon-based politicians. It was enforced at the federal level by the Volstead Act. Most states let the federals do the enforcing. Drinking or owning liquor was not illegal, only the manufacture or sale. National Prohibition ended in 1933, although it continued for a while in some states. Prohibition is considered by most (but not all) historians to have been a failure because organized crime was strengthened.Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (2010) = Ku Klux Klan = Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is the name of three entirely different organizations (1860s, 1920s, post 1960) that used the same nomenclature and costumes but had no direct connection. The KKK of the 1920s was a purification movement that rallied against crime, especially violation of prohibition, and decried the growing \\"influence\\" of \\"big-city\\" Catholics and Jews, many of them immigrants and their descendants from Ireland as well as Southern and Eastern Europe. Its membership was often exaggerated but possibly reached as many as 4 million men, but no prominent national figure claimed membership; no daily newspaper endorsed it, and indeed most actively opposed the Klan. Membership was verily evenly spread across the nation's white Protestants, North, West, and South, urban and rural. Historians in recent years have explored the Klan in depth. The KKK of the 1860s and the current KKK were indeed violent. However, historians discount lurid tales of a murderous group in the 1920s. Some crimes were probably committed in Deep South states but were quite uncommon elsewhere. The local Klans seem to have been poorly organized and were exploited as money-making devices by organizers more than anything else. (Organizers charged a $10 application fee and up to $50 for costumes.) Nonetheless, the KKK had become prominent enough that it staged a huge rally in Washington DC in 1925. Soon afterward, the national headlines reported rape and murder by the KKK leader in Indiana, and the group quickly lost its mystique and nearly all its members.Rory McVeigh, The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-Wing Movements and National Politics (2009) = Scopes \\"Monkey\\" Trial = The Scopes Trial of 1925 was a Tennessee court case that tested a state law which forbade the teaching of \\"any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.\\" The law was the result of a systematic drive by religious Fundamentalists to throw back the onslaught of modern ideas in theology and science. In a spectacular trial that drew national attention thanks to the roles of three-time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and famed lawyer Clarence Darrow for the defense, John T. Scopes was convicted of teaching evolution, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The Fundamentalists were widely ridiculed, with writers like H. L. Mencken poking merciless ridicule at them; their efforts to pass state laws proved a failure.Bruce B. Lawrence, Defenders of God: The Fundamentalist Revolt against the Modern Age (Harper & Row, 1989) = Federal government = Herbert Hoover Led by Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, the federal government in the 1920s took on an increasing role in business and economic affairs. In addition to Prohibition, the government obtained new powers and duties such as funding and overseeing the new U.S. Highway system, controlling agriculture, and the regulating radio and commercial aviation. The result was a rapid spread of standardized roads and broadcasts that were welcomed by most Americans.Daniel E. Garvey, \\"Secretary Hoover and the Quest for Broadcast Regulation\\", Journalism History (1976) 3#1 pp :66‚Äì70Michael S. Lewis-Beck, and Peverill Squire, \\"The Transformation of the American State: The New Era-New Deal Test.\\" Journal of Politics 53.1 (1991): 106-121. The Harding Administration was rocked by the Teapot Dome scandal, the most famous of a number of episodes involving Harding's cabinet members. The president, exhausted and dismayed from the news of the scandals, died of a heart attack in August 1923. His vice-president, Calvin Coolidge, succeeded him. Coolidge could not have been a more different personality than his predecessor. Dour, puritanical, and spotlessly honest, his White House stood in sharp contrast to the drinking, gambling, and womanizing that went on under Harding. In 1924, he was easily elected in his own right with the slogan \\"Keep Cool With Coolidge\\". Overall, the Harding and Coolidge administrations marked a return to the hands-off style of 19th-century presidents in contrast to the activism of Roosevelt and Wilson. Coolidge, who spent the entire summer on vacation during his years in office, famously said \\"The business of the American people is business.\\"Thomas B. Silver, Coolidge and the historians (1982) When Coolidge declined to run again in the 1928 election, the Republican Party nominated engineer and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who was elected by a wide margin over Al Smith, the first Catholic nominee. Hoover was a technocrat who had low regard for politicians. Instead he was a believer in the efficacy of individualism and business enterprise, with a little coordination by the government, to cure all problems. He envisioned a future of unbounded plenty and the imminent end of poverty in America. A year after his election, the stock market crashed, and the nation's economy slipped downward into the Great Depression.William E. Leuchtenburg, Herbert Hoover: The American Presidents Series (2009) p 72 After the crash, Hoover attempted to put in place many efforts to restore the economy, especially the fast-sinking agricultural sector. None worked. Hoover believed in stimulus spending and encouraged state and local governments, as well as the federal government, to spend heavily on public buildings, roads, bridges‚Äîand, most famously, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. But with tax revenues falling fast, the states and localities plunged into their own fiscal crises. Republicans, following their traditional mass drums, along with pressure from the farm bloc, passed the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs. Canada and other nations retaliated by raising their tariffs on American goods and moving their trade in other directions. American imports and exports plunged by more than two thirds, but since international trade was less than 5% of the American economy, the damage done was limited. The entire world economy, led by the United States, had fallen into a downward spiral that got worse and worse, and in 1931‚Äì32 began plunging downward even faster. Hoover had Congress set up a new relief agency, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in 1932, but it proved too little too late.Leuchtenburg, Herbert Hoover pp 131‚Äì33 =Foreign policy, 1919‚Äì1941= In the 1920s, American policy was an active involvement in international affairs, while systematically ignoring the League of Nations/ Instead Washington set up numerous diplomatic ventures, and used the enormous financial power of the United States to dictate major diplomatic questions in Europe.Bear F. Braumoeller, \\"The myth of American isolationism.\\" Foreign Policy Analysis 6.4 (2010): 349-371 online. Presidents, Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, avoided any political commitments or alliances with anyone else. Franklin Roosevelt followed suit before World War II broke out in 1939. They minimized contact with the League of Nations. However, as historian Jerald Combs reports their administrations in no way returned to 19th-century isolationism. The key Republican leaders: : including Elihu Root, Charles Evans Hughes, and Hoover himself, were Progressives who accepted much of Wilson's internationalism. ... They did seek to use American political influence and economic power to goad European governments to moderate the Versailles peace terms, induce the Europeans to settle their quarrels peacefully, secure disarmament agreements, and strengthen the European capitalist economies to provide prosperity for them and their American trading partners.Jerald A. Combs, The History of American Foreign Policy from 1895 (4th ed. 2012) vol 2 p 124 The Washington Naval Conference, was the most successful diplomatic venture the 1920s. It was held in Washington, under the Chairmanship of Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes from 12 November 1921 to 6 February 1922. Conducted outside the auspice of the League of Nations, it was attended by nine nations‚Äîthe United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Portugalu-s-history.com- Retrieved 2011-12-18 Russia and Germany were pariahs and were not invited. It focused on resolving misunderstandings or conflicts regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia. The main achievement was a series of naval disarmament agreements agreed to by all the participants, that lasted for a decade. It resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (the Washington Naval Treaty), the Nine- Power Treaty, and a number of smaller agreements. These treaties preserved peace during the 1920s but Were not renewed, as the world scene turned increasingly negative after 1930.Thomas H. Buckley, The United States and the Washington Conference, 1921‚Äì1922 (U of Tennessee Press, 1970). The Dawes plan was the American solution to the crisis of reparations, in which France was demanding more money than Germany was willing to pay, so France occupied the key industrial Ruhr district of Germany with its army. The crisis was solved by a compromise brokered by the United States in the form of the Dawes Plan in 1924.Patrick O. Cohrs, The Unfinished Peace after World War I: America, Britain and the Stabilisation of Europe, 1919‚Äì1932 (2006). This plan, sponsored by American Charles G. Dawes, set out a new financial scheme. New York banks loaned Germany hundreds of millions of dollars that it used to pay reparations and rebuild its heavy industry. France, Britain and the other countries used the reparations in turn to repay wartime loans they received from the United States. By 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the Young Plan that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks () and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were suspended for a year and in 1932 during the Lausanne Conference they were suspended for an indefinite period. After 1953 West Germany paid the entire remaining balance.Leonard Gomes, German Reparations, 1919‚Äì1932: A Historical Survey (Springer, 2010). =Mexico= Since the turmoil of the Mexican revolution had died down, the Harding administration was prepared to normalize relations with Mexico. Between 1911 and 1920 American imports from Mexico increased from $57,000,000 to $179,000,000 and exports from $61,000,000 to $208,000,000. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover took the lead in order to promote trade and investments other than in oil and land, which had long dominated bilateral economic ties. President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n assured Americans that they would be protected in Mexico, and Mexico was granted recognition in 1923. George D. Beelen, \\"The Harding Administration and Mexico: Diplomacy by Economic Persuasion.\\" The Americas 41.2 (1984): 177-189. A major crisis erupted in the mid-1930s when the Mexican government expropriated millions of acres of land from hundreds of American property owners as part of President L√°zaro C√°rdenas's land redistribution program. No compensation was provided to the American owners. John Dwyer, The Agrarian Dispute: The Expropriation of American-Owned Rural Land in Postrevolutionary Mexico (2009). The emerging threat of the Second World War forced the United States to agree to a compromise solution. The US negotiated an agreement with President Manuel Avila Camacho that amounted to a military alliance. Karl M. Schmitt, Mexico and the United States, 1821‚Äì1973: Conflict and Coexistence (1974) pp 185-88. =Intervention ends in Latin America= Small-scale military interventions continued after 1921 as the Banana Wars tapered off. The Hoover administration began a goodwill policy and withdrew all military forces.Alan McPherson, \\"Herbert Hoover, Occupation Withdrawal, and the Good Neighbor Policy.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 44.4 (2014): 623-639 online. President Roosevelt announced the \\"Good Neighbor Policy\\" by which the United States would no longer intervene to promote good government, but would accept whatever governments were locally chosen. His Secretary of State Cordell Hull endorsed article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States; it provides that \\"no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another\\". =Isolationism in 1930s= In the 1930s, the United States entered the period of deep isolationism, rejecting international conferences, and focusing moment mostly on reciprocal tariff agreements with smaller countries of Latin America. =Coming of war: 1937‚Äì1941= President Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in World War I. He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend- Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \\"Europe first\\" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.Robert Dallek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932‚Äì1945 (1995) pp 232, 319, 373  Great Depression  GDP in United States January 1929 to January 1941 Historians and economists still have not agreed on the causes of the Great Depression, but there is general agreement that it began in the United States in late 1929 and was either started or worsened by \\"Black Thursday,\\" the stock market crash of Thursday, October 24, 1929. Sectors of the US economy had been showing some signs of distress for months before October 1929. Business inventories of all types were three times as large as they had been a year before (an indication that the public was not buying products as rapidly as in the past), and other signposts of economic health‚Äîfreight carloads, industrial production, and wholesale prices‚Äîwere slipping downward. The events in the United States triggered a worldwide depression, which led to deflation and a great increase in unemployment. In the United States between 1929 and 1933, unemployment soared from 3% of the workforce to 25%, while manufacturing output collapsed by one-third. Local relief was overwhelmed. Unable to support their families, many unemployed men deserted (often going to \\"Hoovervilles\\") so the meager relief supplies their families received would stretch further. For many, their next meal was found at a soup kitchen, if at all. Adding to the misery of the times, drought arrived in the Great Plains. Decades of bad farming practices caused the topsoil to erode, and combined with the weather conditions (the 1930s was the overall warmest decade of the 20th century in North America) caused an ecological disaster. The dry soil was lifted by wind and blown into huge dust storms that blanketed entire towns, a phenomenon that continued for several years. Those who had lost their homes and livelihoods in the Dust Bowl were lured westward by advertisements for work put out by agribusiness in western states, such as California. The migrants came to be called Okies, Arkies, and other derogatory names as they flooded the labor supply of the agricultural fields, driving down wages, pitting desperate workers against each other. They came into competition with Mexican laborers, who were deported en masse back to their home country.James N. Gregory, American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California (Oxford UP, 1991). In the South, the fragile economy collapsed further. To escape, rural workers and sharecroppers migrated north by train, both black and white.Nicholas Lemann, The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How it Changed America (2011). By 1940 they were attracted by booming munitions factories in plants in the Great Lakes region Nationwide, farmers had been experiencing depressed market conditions for their crops and goods since the end of World War I. Many family farms that had been mortgaged during the 1920s to provide money to \\"get through until better times\\" were foreclosed when farmers were unable to make payments.Lee J. Alston, \\"Farm foreclosures in the United States during the interwar period.\\" Journal of Economic History 43#4 (1983): 885‚Äì903. = The New Deal = In the United States, upon accepting Democratic nomination for president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt promised \\"a new deal for the American people,\\" a phrase that has endured as a label for his administration and its many domestic achievements.William E. Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932‚Äì1940 (1963). The Republicans, blamed for the Depression, or at least for lack of an adequate response to it, were easily defeated by Roosevelt in 1932.Martin Carcasson, \\"Herbert Hoover and the presidential campaign of 1932: The failure of apologia.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 28.2 (1998): 349‚Äì365. in JSTOR Roosevelt entered office with no single ideology or plan for dealing with the depression. The \\"new deal\\" was often contradictory, pragmatic, and experimental. What some considered incoherence of the New Deal's ideology, however, was the presence of several competing ones, based on programs and ideas not without precedents in the American political tradition.Conrad Black, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom (2003). The New Deal consisted of many different efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy. Many of them failed, but there were enough successes to establish it as the most important episode of the 20th century in the creation of the modern American state.Michael Hiltzik, The New Deal: A Modern History (2011). The desperate economic situation, combined with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 Congressional elections, gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the \\"First Hundred Days\\" of his administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system, stock market, industry and agriculture.Anthony J. Badger, FDR: The first hundred days (2009). = \\"Bank holiday\\" and Emergency Banking Act = On March 6, two days after taking office, Roosevelt issued a proclamation closing all American banks for four days until Congress could meet in a special session. Ordinarily, such an action would cause widespread panic. But the action created a general sense of relief. First, many states had already closed down the banks before March 6. Second, Roosevelt astutely and euphemistically described it as a \\"bank holiday.\\" And third, the action demonstrated that the federal government was stepping in to stop the alarming pattern of bank failures. Three days later, President Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, a generally conservative bill, drafted in large part by holdovers from the Hoover administration, designed primarily to protect large banks from being dragged down by the failing smaller ones. The bill provided for United States Treasury Department inspection of all banks before they would be allowed to reopen, for federal assistance to tottering large institutions, and for a thorough reorganization of those in greatest difficulty. A confused and frightened Congress passed the bill within four hours of its introduction. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days, and $1 billion in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month. The immediate banking crisis was over. The Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act established various provisions designed to prevent another Great Depression from happening again. These included separating investment from savings and loan banks and forbidding the purchase of stock with no money down. Roosevelt also removed the currency of the United States from the gold standard, which was widely blamed for limiting the money supply and causing deflation, although the silver standard remained until 1971. Private ownership of gold bullion and certificates was banned and would remain so until 1975. = Economy Act = On the morning after passage of the Emergency Banking Act, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Economy Act, which was designed to convince the public, and moreover the business community, that the federal government was in the hands of no radical. The act proposed to balance the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and reducing pensions to veterans by as much as 15%. Otherwise, Roosevelt warned, the nation faced a $1 billion deficit. The bill revealed clearly what Roosevelt had always maintained: that he was as much of a fiscal conservative at heart as his predecessor was. And like the banking bill, it passed through Congress almost instantly‚Äîdespite heated protests by some congressional progressives. = Farm programs = The celebrated First Hundred Days of the new administration also produced a federal program to protect American farmers from the uncertainties of the market through subsidies and production controls, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which Congress passed in May 1933. The AAA reflected the desires of leaders of various farm organizations and Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace. Relative farm incomes had been falling for decades. The AAA included reworkings of many long-touted programs for agrarian relief, which had been demanded for decades. The most important provision of the AAA was the provision for crop reductions‚Äîthe \\"domestic allotment\\" system, which was intended to raise prices for farm commodities by preventing surpluses from flooding the market and depressing prices further. The most controversial component of the system was the destruction in summer 1933 of growing crops and newborn livestock that exceeded the allotments. They had to be destroyed to get the plan working. However, gross farm incomes increased by half in the first three years of the New Deal and the relative position of farmers improved significantly for the first time in twenty years. Urban food prices went up slightly, because the cost of the grains was only a small fraction of what the consumer paid. Conditions improved for the great majority of commercial farmers by 1936. The income of the farm sector almost doubled from $4.5 billion in 1932 to $8.9 billion in 1941 just before the war.Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series F43 Meanwhile, food prices rose 22% in nine years from an index of 31.5 in 1932, to 38.4 in 1941.Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series E137 The Farm Security Administration used photography to document poverty in rural America. Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother, depicts destitute pea pickers in California, centering on a mother of seven children, age thirty-two, in Nipomo, California, March 1936. However, rural America contained many isolated farmers scratching out a subsistence income. The new deal set up programs such as the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration to help them, but was very reluctant to help them buy farms. = 'Alphabet soup' = Roosevelt also created an alphabet soup of new federal regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee the stock market and a reform of the banking system that included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to establish a system of insurance for deposits. The most successful initiatives in alleviating the miseries of the Great Depression were a series of relief measures to aid some of the 15 million unemployed Americans, among them the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Civil Works Administration, and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. The early New Deal also began the Tennessee Valley Authority, an unprecedented experiment in flood control, public power, and regional planning. = Second New Deal = The Second New Deal (1935‚Äì36) was the second stage of the New Deal programs. President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced his main goals in January 1935: improved use of national resources, security against old age, unemployment and illness, and slum clearance, as well as a national welfare program (the WPA) to replace state relief efforts. The most important programs included Social Security, the National Labor Relations Act (\\"Wagner Act\\"), the Banking Act, rural electrification, and breaking up utility holding companies. Programs that were later ended by the Supreme Court or the Conservative coalition included the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the National Youth Administration (NYA), the Resettlement Administration, and programs for retail price control, farm rescues, coal stabilization, and taxes on the rich and the Undistributed profits tax. Liberals in Congress passed the Bonus Bill for World War veterans over FDR's veto. The Second New Deal proved especially controversial as it attempted to redistribute wealth, income and power in favor of the poor, the old, farmers and labor unions. Liberals strongly supported the new direction, and formed the New Deal coalition of union members, big city machines, the white South, and ethnic minorities to support it. Conservatives, typified by the American Liberty League, were strongly opposed.William Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal: 1932‚Äì1940 (1963); Kim Phillips-Fein, Invisible Hands: The Businessmen's Crusade Against the New Deal (2010) = Labor agitation = Workers and police battle in Minneapolis in June 1934. Roosevelt's first term saw a massive amount of labor upheaval. In 1934 alone, there was the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike that brought all of San Francisco into a four-day general strike, the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 that brought the Teamsters and other unions out for a strike causing the governor to declare martial law, the 1934 textile workers strike that brought hundreds of thousands of textile workers on the East Coast out on strike, as well as other strikes. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the communists no longer being a force in the labor movement, the conservative American Federation of Labor, which organized along craft union lines and which preached labor/capital cooperation, dominated the U.S. labor movement until the 1930s. In 1935, eight unions within the AFL organized the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to promote industrial unionism. The CIO unions were expelled by the AFL in 1936, and in 1938 they formed a rival federation to the AFL. The CIO had much success in organizing, with the Steel Workers Organizing Committee getting a contract with U.S. Steel in 1937, and winning the Flint Sit-Down Strike and getting General Motors to recognize the United Auto Workers (UAW) as the collective bargainer for GM workers. Having succeeded with GM, the UAW next turned its attention to Chrysler, which quickly came to terms. The last of the Big Three would prove to be a harder nut to crack, as Henry Ford remained absolutely opposed to unions. His security forces beat several UAW organizers outside the company's River Rouge plant in May 1937. Despite pressure on all fronts, Ford would not budge until a wildcat strike in 1941 convinced him to give in and unionize. = Recession of 1937 and recovery = The economy eventually recovered from the low point of the winter of 1932‚Äì33, with sustained improvement until 1937, when the Recession of 1937 brought back 1934 levels of unemployment. There is a broad consensus among scholars that the New Deal policies did not lengthen and deepen the depression; only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists believe it served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression. Apart from the WPA and CCC, most New Deal spending programs, such as the PWA and AAA, operated through private firms. The New Deal and Roosevelt's leadership were under assault during Roosevelt's second term, which suffered new economic setbacks in the Recession of 1937. A sharp economic downturn began in the fall of 1937 and continued through most of 1938. Conservatives said it was caused by the labor unions' assault on industry through massive strikes and the way the New Deal discourages further investment.Gary Dean Best, Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933‚Äì1938 (1990) Keynesian economists argued it was a result of a premature effort by FDR to balance the budget by reducing federal spending. The administration reacted by launching a rhetorical campaign against business monopoly power, which was cast as the villain.Theodore Rosenof, Economics in the Long Run: New Deal Theorists and Their Legacies, 1933‚Äì1993 (1997) The Supreme Court began busily dismantling the New Deal by ruling many of its programs unconstitutional and Roosevelt sought to replace the judges with more sympathetic ones in his infamous \\"Court Packing\\". Despite that, the New Deal gradually wound down and by 1939 the president had turned his attention towards foreign policy. But the administration's other response to the 1937 downturn had more tangible results. Ignoring his own Treasury Department, Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938, an effort to increase mass purchasing power and attack deflation. Roosevelt explained his program in a fireside chat in which he finally acknowledged that it was up to the government to \\"create an economic upturn\\" by making \\"additions to the purchasing power of the nation.\\" = World War II and the end of the Great Depression = It was not until the administration expanded Federal spending to support World War II, that the nation's economy fully recovered. Between 1939 and 1944 (the peak of wartime production), the nation's output almost doubled. Consequently, unemployment plummeted‚Äîfrom 14% in 1940 to less than 2% in 1943, as the labor force grew by ten million. The war economy was not so much a triumph of free enterprise as the result of government bankrolling business. While unemployment remained high throughout the New Deal years, consumption, investment, and net exports‚Äîthe pillars of economic growth‚Äîremained low. It was World War II, not the New Deal, which finally ended the crisis. Nor did the New Deal substantially alter the distribution of power within American society and economy; and it had only a small impact on the distribution of wealth among the population. = Legacies of the New Deal = A 2017 review of the published scholarship summarized the findings of researchers as follows: > The studies find that public works and relief spending had state income > multipliers of around one, increased consumption activity, attracted > internal migration, reduced crime rates, and lowered several types of > mortality. The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but > eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers.

The Reconstruction Finance > Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little > positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership > stakes. Although the New Deal did not end the depression, it increased the regulatory functions of the federal government in the stock market, the banking system, and others. It also produced a new political coalition that sustained the Democratic Party as the majority party in national politics for more than a generation after its own end. national debt/ GNP climbs from 20% to 40% under Hoover; levels off under FDR; soars during WW2 from Historical States US (1976) Laying the foundations for the postwar era, Roosevelt and the New Deal helped enhance the power of the federal government as a whole. Roosevelt also established the presidency as the preeminent center of authority within the federal government. By creating a large array of protections for various groups of citizens‚Äîworkers, farmers, and others‚Äîwho suffered from the crisis, enabling them to challenge the powers of the corporations, the Roosevelt administration generated a set of political ideas‚Äîknown to later generations as New Deal liberalism‚Äîthat remained a source of inspiration for decades and that helped shape the next experiment in liberal reform, the Great Society of the 1960s. On the other hand, the Roosevelt administration and its liberalism became the source of a vigorous conservative reaction. Led in Congress by Senator Robert A. Taft and the Conservative coalition, they blocked almost all New Deal proposals after 1936, and shut down the WPA, CCC and many other programs by 1943. Eventually in the 1970s and 1980s, a bipartisan coalition ended most New Deal regulations and programs. The most important remaining ones in the 21st century are Social Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  World War II  =Foreign and military policy= Big Three in Yalta formed U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin led the Allies against the Axis centered on Nazi Germany. Isolationist sentiment with regard to foreign wars in America had ebbed, but the United States at first declined to enter the war, limiting itself to giving supplies and weapons via Lend Lease to Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. American feeling changed drastically with the sudden Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. enthusiastically went to war against Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany. Italy surrendered in 1943, followed by Germany and Japan in 1945. The economy doubled and tripled in size as a massive industrial mobilization was accompanied by artificial wage and price controls. 16 million men entered the military (most were drafted), in addition to 300,000 women volunteers. After a series of defeats inflicted by Japan, the U.S. Navy turned the tide at Midway (June 1942), then inexorably moved toward total destruction of the Japanese military. After small-scale invasions of North Africa (1942) and Italy (1943), the main American effort was a strategic bombing campaign that destroyed the German Luftwaffe, followed by a massive invasion of France in 1944. American forces met up with Soviet forces marching into Germany from the east in May 1945. Overall, the entire nation was turned into a vast war machine, affecting society more than any other conflict fought by the United States, except perhaps the Civil War. After winning re-election to unprecedented third and fourth terms, Roosevelt's health was rapidly deteriorating; he died on April 12, 1945. Harry S. Truman had not been kept informed of major foreign policy and military decisions, but he continued most of Roosevelt's wartime policies. Truman moved sharply to the right in replacing FDR's liberal cabinet. With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil. The U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within bombing range of Tokyo. Strategic bombing using the B-29 destroyed all the major cities in 1945, as the U.S. captured Iwo Jima and Okinawa after heavy losses. With conventional and atomic bombs falling, an Allied invasion imminent, and an unexpected Soviet attack sweeping through Manchuria, the Emperor of Japan surrendered. Japan was occupied by the Americans under Douglas MacArthur; MacArthur's five year rule transformed Japan's government, society and economy along American lines into a peaceful democracy and a close ally of the U.S. =Homefront= Economics The main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944‚Äì45), soldiers. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked. It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence it was only \\"for the duration\\" and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline was tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.Harold G. Vatter, The U.S. Economy in World War II (1988) pp 27‚Äì31David Kennedy, Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929‚Äì1945 (2001) pp 615‚Äì68 Taxes and controls Federal tax policy was highly contentious during the war, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress. Everyone agreed on the need for high taxes to pay for the war. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully to impose a 100% tax on incomes over $25,000 (equal to $ today), while Congress enlarged the base downward. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).Geoffrey Perrett, Days of Sadness, Years of Triumph: The American People, 1939‚Äì1945: Volume 1 (1985) p. 300 Many controls were put on the economy. The most important were price controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the Office of Price Administration. Wages were also controlled.Harvey C Mansfield, A short history of OPA (Historical reports on War Administration) (1951) Corporations dealt with numerous agencies, especially the War production Board (WPB), and the War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.Paul A. C. Koistinen, Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940‚Äì1945 (2004) pp 498‚Äì517 Rationing In 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel oil, silk, nylon, coffee, stoves, shoes, meat, cheese, butter, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, and many other items. Some items‚Äîlike new automobiles and appliances‚Äîwere no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods (like clothes or cars). The ration system was complex and confusing, but high levels of patriotism made it acceptable as people helped each other through the maze of rules. To get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the Indianapolis 500. Sightseeing driving was banned, too. People had more money than they could spend, so they saved it, especially in government savings bonds. Bond rallies in many cities featured Hollywood film stars, who drew in the crowds needed to make the program a success. The buyer paid 3/4 of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. Workers were challenged to put \\"at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds\\". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special \\"Minuteman\\" flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the \\"Ten Percent Club\\". There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals. An added advantage was that citizens who were putting their money into War Bonds were not putting it into the home front wartime economy. Work force A \\"Rosie the Riveter\\", working on an A-31 \\"Vengeance\\" dive bomber. Tennessee, 1943. The unemployment problem ended in the United States with the beginning of World War II, when stepped up wartime production created millions of new jobs and the draft pulled young men out of the labor pool.Miller and Cornford Women also joined the workforce to replace men who had joined the forces, though in fewer numbers. Roosevelt stated that the efforts of civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves. \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" became the symbol of women laboring in manufacturing. The war effort brought about significant changes in the role of women in society as a whole. At the end of the war, many of the munitions factories closed. Other women were replaced by returning veterans. However most women who wanted to continue working did so. Labor shortages were felt in agriculture, even though most farmers were given an occupational exemption and few were drafted. Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies. In some areas schools were temporarily closed at harvest time to enable students to work. About 400,000 German prisoners of war were used as farm laborers both during and immediately after the war. With the war's ever increasing need for able bodied men consuming America's labor force in the early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements.Hinshaw (1943) Consequently, many states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to work. By 1943, there were almost three million American teenage boys and girls working in American fields and factories. In the process of bringing great numbers of children into the workforce, the War altered the lives of many adolescents. Lured by high wartime wages, they took jobs and forgot about their education. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers in America increased by 1.9 million; the number attending school declined by 1.25 million.Hoehling (1966) Labor unions Welder making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Co., Chattanooga, Tennessee. June 1942. The war mobilization changed the relationship of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) with both employers and the national government.Lichtenstein (2003) Both the CIO and the larger American Federation of Labor (AFL) grew rapidly in the war years.Philip Taft, The A.F. of L. from the Death of Gompers to the Merger (1959) pp 204‚Äì33 Nearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However the United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940, left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts, but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances. In return for labor's no-strike pledge, the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts. Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.Paul A. C. Koistinen, Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940‚Äì1945 p 410(2004) Even though the complaints from union members about the no-strike pledge became louder and more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The Mine Workers, by contrast, who did not belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine leader John L. Lewis a much hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions.Melvyn Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography (1977) pp 415‚Äì44 All the major unions grew stronger during the war. The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of union security, through arbitration and negotiation. Workers also won benefits, such as vacation pay, that had been available only to a few in the past while wage gaps between higher skilled and less skilled workers narrowed. Most union leaders saw women as temporary wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces. It was important that the wages of these women be kept high so that the veterans would get high wages.D'Ann Campbell, Women at War with America (1984) pp 139‚Äì62 Racial tensions The cities were relatively peaceful; much-feared large-scale race riots did not happen, but there were small-scale confrontations, notably the 1943 race riot in DetroitHarvard Sitkoff, The Detroit Race Riot of 1943 (1969) and the anti-Mexican Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles in 1943.Mauricio Maz√≥n, The Zoot-Suit Riots: The Psychology of Symbolic Annihilation (1984) Some German and Italian individuals were rounded up and interned as enemy aliens who lacked U.S. citizenship and were known by the FBI as supporters of the enemy. Japanese American internment About 100,000 persons of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast and their children were interned by the U.S. government. They were sent to inland camps. Canada followed a similar policy. The 100,000 or more Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not interned. The American camps were closed in 1944.Brian Hayashi, Democratizing the Enemy: The Japanese American Internment (2010) End of an era 1945 marked the end of an era. In foreign policy the United Nations was established on October 24, 1945, to serve as a world body to help prevent future world wars. By a vote of 65 to 7, the United States Senate, on December 4, 1945, approved the treaty that set full American participation in the UN, with a veto in the all-important Security Council. This marked a turn away from the traditional interest in strategic local concerns of the U.S. and toward more international involvement. Fears of a postwar depression did not materialize, thanks in part to the large stock of savings that paid for the pent-up demands for housing, cars, new clothes‚Äîand babies. The Baby Boom began as the veterans returned, many moving to the rapidly expanding suburbs. Optimism was the hallmark of the new age‚Äîan age of grand expectations.

This article focuses on political, economic, and diplomatic history. This period of rapid economic growth and soaring prosperity in the North and the West (but not in the South) saw the U.S. become the world's dominant economic, industrial, and agricultural power. The average annual income (after inflation) of non-farm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900, and then grew another 33% by 1918.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series D726 and D736 pp 164‚Äì5 With a decisive victory in 1865 over Southern secessionists in the Civil War, the United States became a united and powerful nation with a strong national government. Reconstruction brought the end of legalized slavery plus citizenship for the former slaves, but their new-found political power was rolled back within a decade, and they became second-class citizens under a \\"Jim Crow\\" system of deeply pervasive segregation that would stand for the next 80‚Äì90 years. Politically, during the Third Party System and Fourth Party System the nation was mostly dominated by Republicans (except for two Democratic presidents). After 1900 and the assassination of President William McKinley, the Progressive Era brought political, business, and social reforms (e.g., new roles for and government expansion of education, higher status for women, a curtailment of corporate excesses, and modernization of many areas of government and society). The Progressives worked through new middle-class organizations to fight against the corruption and behind-the-scenes power of entrenched, state political party organizations and big-city \\"machines\\". They demanded‚Äîand won‚Äîwomen's right to vote, and the nationwide prohibition of alcohol 1920-1933. In an unprecedented wave of European immigration, 27.5 million new arrivals between 1865 and 1918U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series C89 provided the labor base necessary for the expansion of industry and agriculture, as well as the population base for most of fast- growing urban America. By the late nineteenth century, the United States had become a leading global industrial power, building on new technologies (such as the telegraph and steel), an expanding railroad network, and abundant natural resources such as coal, timber, oil, and farmland, to usher in the Second Industrial Revolution. There were also two very important wars. The U.S. easily defeated Spain in 1898, which unexpectedly brought a small empire. Cuba quickly was given independence, as well as the Philippines (in 1946). Puerto Rico (and some smaller islands) became permanent U.S. territories, as did Alaska (added by purchase in 1867). The independent Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the U.S. as a territory in 1898. The United States tried and failed to broker a peace settlement for World War I, then entered the war after Germany launched a submarine campaign against U.S. merchant ships that were supplying Germany's enemy countries. The publicly stated goals were to uphold American honor, crush German militarism, and reshape the postwar world. After a slow mobilization, the U.S. helped bring about a decisive Allied Forces victory by supplying badly needed financing, food, and millions of fresh and eager soldiers. right right Reconstruction Era Reconstruction gave black farmers, businessmen and soldiers the right to vote for the first time in 1867, as celebrated by Harper's Weekly on its front cover, Nov. 16, 1867.\\"The First Vote\\" by William Waud, Harpers Weekly Nov. 16, 1867 Reconstruction was the period from 1863 to 1877, in which the federal government temporarily took control‚Äîone by one‚Äîof the Southern states of the Confederacy. Before his assassination in April 1865, President Abraham Lincoln had announced moderate plans for reconstruction to re-integrate the former Confederates as fast as possible. Lincoln set up the Freedmen's Bureau in March 1865, to aid former slaves in finding education, health care, and employment. The final abolition of slavery was achieved by the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in December 1865.William C. Harris, With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union (1997) However, Lincoln was opposed by the Radical Republicans within his own party who feared that the former Confederates would never truly give up on slavery and Confederate nationalism, and would always try to reinstate them behind-the-scenes. As a result, the Radical Republicans tried to impose legal restrictions that would strip most ex-rebels' rights to vote and hold elected office. The Radicals were opposed by Lincoln's Vice President and successor, Tennessee Democrat Andrew Johnson. However, the Radicals won the critical elections of 1866, winning enough seats in Congress to override President Johnson's vetoes of such legislation. They even successfully impeached President Johnson (in the House of Representatives), and almost removed him from office (in the Senate) in 1868. Meanwhile, they gave the South's \\"freedmen\\" new constitutional and federal legal protections. The Radicals' reconstruction plans took effect in 1867 under the supervision of the U.S. Army, allowing a Republican coalition of Freedmen, Scalawags (sympathetic local whites), and Carpetbaggers (recent arrivals from the North), to take control of Southern state governments. They ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, giving enormous new powers to the federal courts to deal with justice at the state level. These state governments borrowed heavily to build railroads and public schools, increasing taxation rates. The backlash of increasingly fierce opposition to these policies drove most of the Scalawags out of the Republican Party and into the Democratic Party. President Ulysses S. Grant enforced civil rights protections for African-Americans that were being challenged in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870 giving African-Americans the right to vote in American elections. U.S. Representative Stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding Reconstruction, and obtained a House vote of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson. Hans Trefousse, his leading biographer, concludes that Stevens \\"was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.\\" Reconstruction ended at different times in each state, the last in 1877, when Republican Rutherford B. Hayes won the contentious presidential election of 1876 over his opponent, Samuel J. Tilden. To deal with disputed electoral votes, Congress set up an Electoral Commission. It awarded the disputed votes to Hayes. The white South accepted the \\"Compromise of 1877\\" knowing that Hayes proposed to end Army control over the remaining three state governments in Republican hands. White Northerners accepted that the Civil War was over and that Southern whites posed no threat to the nation.Eric Foner, A Short History of Reconstruction (1990) pp 217‚Äì37 The end of Reconstruction marked the end of the brief period of civil rights and civil liberties for African Americans in the South, where most lived. Reconstruction caused permanent resentment, distrust, and cynicism among white Southerners toward the federal government, and helped create the \\"Solid South,\\" which typically voted for the (then-)socially conservative Democrats for all local, state, and national offices. White supremacists created a segregated society through \\"Jim Crow Laws\\" that made blacks second-class citizens with very little political power or public voice.C. Vann Woodward, The Strange Career of Jim Crow (1954) pp 67‚Äì111 The white elites (called the \\"Redeemers\\"‚Äîthe southern wing of the \\"Bourbon Democrats\\") were in firm political and economic control of the south until the rise of the Populist movement in the 1890s. Local law enforcement was weak in rural areas, allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress alleged-but-often-unproven crimes charged to blacks.C. Vann Woodward, Origins of the New South, 1877‚Äì1913 (1951) pp 205‚Äì34 Historians' interpretations of the Radical Republicans have dramatically shifted over the years, from the pre-1950 view of them as tools of big business motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slaves.Vernon Burton, \\"Civil War and Reconstruction,\\" in William L. Barney, ed., A Companion to 19th-century America (2006), pp. 54‚Äì56. In the South itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race. Americans often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black using Baptist sermons in Alabama. White preachers expressed the view that: : God had chastised them and given them a special mission ‚Äì to maintain orthodoxy, strict Biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor. In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as: : God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help them; God would be their rock in a stormy land.Wilson Fallin Jr., Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama (2007) pp 52-53 Historians in the 21st century typically consider Reconstruction to be a failure, but they \\"disagree on what caused Reconstruction to fail, focusing on whether it went too far, too fast or did not go far enough.\\" Eric Foner argued in 2015, \\"Today, scholars believe that if the era was 'tragic,' it was not because Reconstruction was attempted but because it failed.\\" Eric Foner, \\"Why Reconstruction Matters,\\" New York Times March 28, 2015 However, historian Mark Summers in 2014 sees a positive outcome: :if we see Reconstruction's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled, of a Union held together forever, of a North and South able to work together, of slavery extirpated, and sectional rivalries confined, of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty, backed by armed force, then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was, a lasting and unappreciated success. The West Volga Germans in central Kansas, 1875 In 1869, the First Transcontinental Railroad opened up the far west mining and ranching regions. Travel from New York to San Francisco now took six days instead of six months.Stephen E. Ambrose, Nothing Like It In The World; The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863‚Äì1869 (2000) After the Civil War, many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising \\"the Best Prairie Lands\\", \\"Low Prices\\", \\"Large Discounts For Cash\\", and \\"Better Terms Than Ever!\\". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable. The fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesmen sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. With the Homestead Act providing free land to citizens and the railroads selling cheap lands to European farmers, the settlement of the Great Plains was swiftly accomplished, and the frontier had virtually ended by 1890.Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, Westward Expansion (5th ed. 1982) ch 32 =American Indian assimilation= Expansion into the plains and mountains by miners, ranchers and settlers led to conflict with some of the regional Indian tribes. The government insisted the American Indians either move into the general society and become assimilated, or remain on assigned reservations, and used force to keep them there. The violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890.Robert M. Utley, and Wilcomb E. Washburn, Indian Wars (1987) pp 220‚Äì79. By 1880 the buffalo herds, a foundation for the hunting economy, had disappeared. American Indians had the choice of living on reservations, but some tribes refused to live there. Here food, supplies, education and medical care was provided by the federal government, or living on their own in society and earning wages, typically as a cowboy on a ranch, or manual worker in town. Reformers wanted to give as many American Indians as possible the opportunity to own and operate their own farms and ranches, and the issue was how to give individual Indians land owned by the tribe. To assimilate the Indians into American society, reformers set up training programs and schools, such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, that produced many prominent Indian leaders. The anti-assimilation traditionalists on the reservations, however, resisted integration. The reformers decided the solution was to allow Indians still on reservations to own land as individuals. The Dawes Act of 1887 was an effort to integrate American Indians into the mainstream; the majority accepted integration and were absorbed into American society, leaving a trace of American Indian ancestry in millions of American families. Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty on the reservations, supported by Federal food, medicine and schooling. In 1934, U.S. policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which attempted to protect tribal and communal life on the reservations.Francis Paul Prucha, The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians (1986) pp 181‚Äì241, 311‚Äì25 =Farming= Map of the United States, 1870‚Äì80.

Shannon, The Farmer's Last Frontier: Agriculture, 1860‚Äì1897 (1945) complete text online The number of farms tripled from 2.0 million in 1860 to 6.0 million in 1905. The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905. The value of farms soared from $8.0 billion in 1860 to $30 billion in 1906.Historical Statistics (1975) p. 437 series K1-K16 The federal government issued tracts virtually free to settlers under the Homestead Act of 1862. Even larger numbers purchased lands at very low interest from the new railroads, which were trying to create markets. The railroads advertised heavily in Europe and brought over, at low fares, hundreds of thousands of farmers from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain.William Clark, Farms and Farmers: The Story of American Agriculture (1970) p. 205 Despite their remarkable progress and general prosperity, 19th-century U.S. farmers experienced recurring cycles of hardship, caused primarily by falling world prices for cotton and wheat.Shannon, Farmer's Last Frontier: Agriculture, 1860‚Äì1897 (1945), ch 1 Along with the mechanical improvements which greatly increased yield per unit area, the amount of land under cultivation grew rapidly throughout the second half of the century, as the railroads opened up new areas of the West for settlement. The wheat farmers enjoyed abundant output and good years from 1876 to 1881 when bad European harvests kept the world price high. They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved. The farther west the settlers went, the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market, and the more inclined they were to protest, as in the Populist movement of the 1890s. Wheat farmers blamed local grain elevator owners (who purchased their crop), railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices.Elwyn B. Robinson, History of North Dakota (1982) p 203 The first organized effort to address general agricultural problems was the Grange movement that reached out to farmers. It grew to 20,000 chapters and 1.5 million members. The Granges set up their own marketing systems, stores, processing plants, factories and cooperatives. Most went bankrupt. The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s. A few Midwestern states passed \\"Granger Laws\\", limiting railroad and warehouse fees.D. Sven Nordin, Rich Harvest: A History of the Grange, 1867‚Äì1900 (1974) =Family life= Few single men attempted to operate a farm; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands.Deborah Fink, Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880‚Äì1940 (1992) During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. This was further supported by the scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools.Chad Montrie, \\"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands,\\" Great Plains Quarterly, (2005) 25#4 pp. 245‚Äì258 Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. For example, many joined a local branch of the Grange; a majority had ties to local churches. It was popular to organize activities that combined practical work, abundant food, and simple entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, and quilting bees,.Karl Ronning, \\"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880‚Äì1920,\\" Uncoverings, (1992) Vol. 13, pp 169‚Äì191 One could keep busy with scheduled Grange meetings, church services, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.Nathan B. Sanderson, \\"More Than a Potluck,\\" Nebraska History, (2008) 89#3 pp. 120‚Äì131 Childhood on the American frontier is contested territory. One group of scholars argues the rural environment was salubrious for it allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts.Katherine Harris, Long Vistas: Women and Families on Colorado Homesteads (1993)Elliott West, Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far Western Frontier (1989) However other historians offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.Elizabeth Hampsten, Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains (1991)Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey (2002) Industrialization Blast furnace at Edgar Thomson Steel Works near Pittsburgh, 1915 From 1865 to about 1913, the U.S. grew to become the world's leading industrial nation. Land and labor, the diversity of climate, the ample presence of railroads (as well as navigable rivers), and the natural resources all fostered the cheap extraction of energy, fast transport, and the availability of capital that powered this Second Industrial Revolution.Edward C. Kirkland, Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860‚Äì1897 (1961) The average annual income (after inflation) of non-farm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900, and then grew another 33% by 1918.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series D726 and D736 pp 164‚Äì5. The data is in constant 1914 dollars, taking out the effects of deflation and inflation, and takes unemployment into account. Where the First Industrial Revolution shifted production from artisans to factories, the Second Industrial Revolution pioneered an expansion in organization, coordination, and the scale of industry, spurred on by technology and transportation advancements. Railroads opened the West, creating farms, towns, and markets where none had existed. The First Transcontinental Railroad, built by nationally oriented entrepreneurs with British money and Irish and Chinese labor, provided access to previously remote expanses of land. Railway construction boosted opportunities for capital, credit, and would-be farmers.Albro Martin, Railroads Triumphant: The Growth, Rejection, and Rebirth of a Vital American Force (1992) pp 270‚Äì319 New technologies in iron and steel manufacturing, such as the Bessemer process and open-hearth furnace, combined with similar innovations in chemistry and other sciences to vastly improve productivity. New communication tools, such as the telegraph and telephone allowed corporate managers to coordinate across great distances. Innovations also occurred in how work was organized, typified by Frederick Winslow Taylor's ideas of scientific management.Robert Kanigel, One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (2005) pp 540‚Äì69 To finance the larger-scale enterprises required during this era, the corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization. Corporations expanded by merging, creating single firms out of competing firms known as \\"trusts\\" (a form of monopoly). High tariffs sheltered U.S. factories and workers from foreign competition, especially in the woolen industry. Federal railroad land grants enriched investors, farmers and railroad workers, and created hundreds of towns and cities.Larry Schweikart, The Entrepreneurial Adventure: A History of Business in the United States (1999) ch 14 Business often went to court to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes.Melvyn Dubofsky and Foster Rhea Dulles, Labor in America: A History (2010) pp 114‚Äì65 Powerful industrialists, such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and Jay Gould, known collectively by their critics as \\"robber barons\\", held great wealth and power, so much so that in 1888 Rutherford B. Hayes noted in his diary that the United States ceased being a government for the people and had been replaced by a \\"government of the corporation, by the corporation, and for the corporation.\\"Bacon, Katie (June 12, 2007). The Dark Side of the Gilded Age. The Atlantic. Retrieved March 24, 2014. In a context of cutthroat competition for wealth accumulation, the skilled labor of artisans gave way to well-paid skilled workers and engineers, as the nation deepened its technological base. Meanwhile, a steady stream of immigrants encouraged the availability of cheap labor, especially in mining and manufacturing.Burton W. Folsom and Forrest McDonald, The Myth of the Robber Barons: A New Look at the Rise of Big Business in America (1991) pp 44‚Äì67 =Labor and management= In the fast- growing industrial sector, wages were about double the level in Europe, but the work was harder with less leisure. Economic depressions swept the nation in 1873‚Äì75 and 1893‚Äì97, with low prices for farm goods and heavy unemployment in factories and mines. Full prosperity returned in 1897 and continued (with minor dips) to 1920. The pool of unskilled labor was constantly growing, as unprecedented numbers of immigrants‚Äî27.5 million between 1865 and 1918 ‚Äîentered the U.S. Most were young men eager for work. The rapid growth of engineering and the need to master the new technology created a heavy demand for engineers, technicians, and skilled workers. Before 1874, when Massachusetts passed the nation's first legislation limiting the number of hours women and child factory workers could perform to 10 hours a day, virtually no labor legislation existed in the country. Child labor reached a peak around 1900 and then declined (except in Southern textile mills) as compulsory education laws kept children in school. It was finally ended in the 1930s. =Labor organization= The first major effort to organize workers' groups on a nationwide basis appeared with The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor in 1869. Originally a secret, ritualistic society organized by Philadelphia garment workers, it was open to all workers, including African Americans, women, and farmers. The Knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron, Jay Gould, in an 1885 strike. Within a year, they added 500,000 workers to their rolls, far more than the thin leadership structure of the Knights could handle. The Knights of Labor soon fell into decline, and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Rather than open its membership to all, the AFL, under former cigar-makers union official Samuel Gompers, focused on skilled workers. His objectives were \\"pure and simple\\": increasing wages, reducing hours, and improving working conditions. As such, Gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused. The AFL would gradually become a respected organization in the U.S., although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborers.Philip Taft, The A.F. of L. in the time of Gompers (1957) ch 1=1 In times of economic depression, layoffs and wage cuts angered the workers, leading to violent labor conflicts in 1877 and 1894. In the Great Railroad Strike in 1877, railroad workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10-percent pay cut. Attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities. The Haymarket Riot took place in 1886, when an anarchist allegedly threw a bomb at police dispersing a strike rally at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago.Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States. New York: Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005. p. 272: * \\"But to this day it has not been discovered who threw the bomb.\\" At its peak, the Knights claimed 700,000 members. By 1890, membership had plummeted to fewer than 100,000, then faded away.Robert E. Weir, Beyond Labor's Veil: The Culture of the Knights of Labor (1996) The killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the Knights of Labor, which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blame. In the riots of 1892 at Carnegie's steel works in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a group of 300 Pinkerton detectives, whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers, were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed. As a result, the National Guard was called in to guard the plant; non-union workers were hired and the strike broken. The Homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937. Two years later, wage cuts at the Pullman Palace Car Company, just outside Chicago, led to a strike, which, with the support of the American Railway Union, soon brought the nation's railway industry to a halt. The shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy, and President Grover Cleveland acted vigorously. He secured injunctions in federal court, which Eugene Debs and the other strike leaders ignored. Cleveland then sent in the Army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving. The strike collapsed, as did the ARU. The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire killed 146 garment workers. The most militant working class organization of the 1905‚Äì1920 era was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions (in 1904, the year before its founding, 27,000 workers were killed on the jobZinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States. New York: Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005. p. 327) and discrimination against women, minorities, and unskilled laborers by other unions, particularly the AFL.Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States.

New York: Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005. p. 330 the Wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike (commonly known as the \\"Bread and Roses\\" strike) in Lawrence, Massachusetts. They proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away, primarily because the union failed to build long-term worker organizations even after a successful campaign, leaving the workers involved at the mercy of employers once the IWW had moved on. However, this was not fatal to the union. That the IWW directly challenged capitalism via direct action at the point of production prompted swift and decisive action from the state, especially during and after World War I. According to historian Howard Zinn, \\"the IWW became a threat to the capitalist class, exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge.\\"Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States. New York: Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005. p. 331 The IWW strongly opposed the 1917‚Äì18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government.

Gilded Age The \\"Gilded Age\\" that was enjoyed by the topmost percentiles of American society after the recovery from the Panic of 1873 floated on the surface of the newly industrialized economy of the Second Industrial Revolution. It was further fueled by a period of wealth transfer that catalyzed dramatic social changes. It created for the first time a class of the super-rich \\"captains of industry\\", the \\"robber barons\\" whose network of business, social and family connections ruled a largely White Anglo-Saxon Protestant social world that possessed clearly defined boundaries. The term \\"Gilded Age\\" was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their 1873 book, The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, employing the ironic difference between a \\"gilded\\" and a Golden Age.H. Wayne Morgan, ed. The Gilded Age: A Reappraisal (1970); Allan Nevins, The Emergence of Modern America, 1865‚Äì1878 (1933) With the end of Reconstruction, there were few major political issues at stake and the 1880 presidential election was the quietest in a long time. James Garfield, the Republican candidate, won a very close election, but a few months into his administration was shot by a disgruntled public office seeker. Garfield was succeeded by his VP Chester Arthur. Reformers, especially the \\"Mugwumps\\" complained that powerful parties made for corruption during the Gilded Age or \\"Third Party System\\". Voter enthusiasm and turnout during the period 1872‚Äì1892 was very high, often reaching practically all men. The major issues involved modernization, money, railroads, corruption, and prohibition. National elections, and many state elections, were very close. The 1884 presidential election saw a mudslinging campaign in which Republican James G. Blaine was defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland, a reformer.H. Wayne Morgan, From Hayes to McKinley: National Party Politics, 1877‚Äì1896 (1969) During Cleveland's presidency, he pushed to have congress cut tariff duties. He also expanded civil services and vetoed many private pension bills. Many people were worried that these issues would hurt his chances in the 1888 election. When they expressed these concerns to Cleveland, he said \\"What is the use of being elected or reelected, unless you stand for something?\\" The dominant social class of the Northeast possessed the confidence to proclaim an \\"American Renaissance\\", which could be identified in the rush of new public institutions that marked the period‚Äîhospitals, museums, colleges, opera houses, libraries, orchestras‚Äî and by the Beaux-Arts architectural idiom in which they splendidly stood forth, after Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.Charles W. Calhoun, ed. The Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Origins of Modern America (2nd ed. 2007) Social history Urbanization (the rapid growth of cities) went hand in hand with industrialization (the growth of factories and railroads), as well as expansion of farming. The rapid growth was made possible by high levels of immigration.John A. Garraty, The New Commonwealth, 1877‚Äì1890 (1968)Allan Nevins, The Emergence, of Modern America, 1865‚Äì1878 (1927) =Immigration= The Sunday magazine of the New York World appealed to Immigrants with this 1906 cover page celebrating their arrival at Ellis Island From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, 27.5 million in total. In all, 24.4 million (89%) came from Europe, including 2.9 million from Britain, 2.2 million from Ireland, 2.1 million from Scandinavia, 3.8 million from Germany, 4.1 million from Italy, 7.8 million from Russia and other parts of eastern and central Europe. Another 1.7 million came from Canada.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series C89-C119, pp 105‚Äì9 Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892, through the immigration station on Ellis Island, but various ethnic groups settled in different locations. New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.Stephan Thernstrom, ed., Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups (1980) covers the history of all the main groups Puck editorial cartoon. Immigrants were pushed out of their homelands by poverty or religious threats, and pulled to America by jobs, farmland and kin connections. They found economic opportunity at factories, mines and construction sites, and found farm opportunities in the Plains states. While most immigrants were welcomed, Asians were not. Many Chinese had been brought to the west coast to construct railroads, but unlike European immigrants, they were seen as being part of an entirely alien culture. After intense anti- Chinese agitation in California and the west, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. An informal agreement in 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement, stopped Japanese immigration.Thomas Archdeacon, Becoming American (1984) Some immigrants stayed temporarily in the U.S. then returned home, often with savings that made them relatively prosperous. Most, however, permanently left their native lands and stayed in hope of finding a better life in the New World. This desire for freedom and prosperity led to the famous term, the American Dream. =Religion= The Third Great Awakening was a period of renewal in evangelical Protestantism from the late 1850s to the 1900s.Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (1972) pp 731‚Äì872 It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism.Mark A. Noll, A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada (1992) pp 286‚Äì310 It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth. A major component was the Social Gospel Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements, and Christian Science.Robert William Fogel, The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism (2000) At the same time, the Catholic Church grew rapidly, with a base in the German, Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrant communities, and a leadership drawn from the Irish. The Catholics were largely working class and concentrated in the industrial cities and mining towns, where they built churches, parochial schools, and charitable institutions, as well as colleges.Charles R. Morris, American Catholic: The Saints and Sinners Who Built America's Most Powerful Church (1998) pp 141‚Äì95 The Jewish community grew rapidly, especially from the new arrivals from Eastern Europe who settled chiefly in New York City. They avoided the Reform synagogues of the older German Jews and instead formed Orthodox and Conservative synagogues.Hasia R. Diner, The Jews of the United States, 1654‚Äì2000 (2004) pp 71‚Äì111 =Nadir of race relations= The mob-style lynching of Will James, Cairo, Illinois, 1909. Starting in the end of the 1870s, African Americans lost many of the civil rights obtained during Reconstruction and became increasingly subject to racial discrimination. Increased racist violence, including lynchings and race riots, lead to a strong deterioration of living conditions of African Americans in the Southern states. Jim Crow laws were established after the Compromise of 1877. Many decided to flee for the Midwest as early as 1879, an exile which was intensified during the Great Migration that began before World War I.Rayford Logan, The Betrayal of the Negro from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson, (Da Capo Press, 1997) In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively upheld the Jim Crow system of racial segregation by its \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine. D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915), the first great American film, made heroes of the KKK in Reconstruction.Melvyn Stokes, D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation: A History of \\"The Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time (Oxford University Press, 2007). =Populism= By 1880, the Granger movement began to decline and was replaced by the Farmers' Alliance. From the beginning, the Farmers' Alliance were political organizations with elaborate economic programs. According to one early platform, its purpose was to \\"unite the farmers of America for their protection against class legislation and the encroachments of concentrated capital.\\" Their program also called for the regulation‚Äîif not the outright nationalization‚Äîof the railroads; currency inflation to provide debt relief; the lowering of the tariff; and the establishment of government-owned storehouses and low-interest lending facilities. These were known as the Ocala Demands.John D. Hicks, Populist Revolt: A History of the Farmers' Alliance and the People's Party(1931) During the late 1880s, a series of droughts devastated the West. Western Kansas lost half its population during a four- year span. By 1890, the level of agrarian distress was at an all-time high. Mary Elizabeth Lease, a noted populist writer and agitator, told farmers that they needed to \\"raise less corn and more hell\\". Working with sympathetic Democrats in the South and small third parties in the West, the Farmer's Alliance made a push for political power. From these elements, a new political party, known as the Populist Party, emerged. The elections of 1890 brought the new party into coalitions that controlled parts of state government in a dozen Southern and Western states and sent a score of Populist senators and representatives to Congress. Its first convention was in 1892, when delegates from farm, labor and reform organizations met in Omaha, Nebraska, determined at last to make their mark on a U.S. political system that they viewed as hopelessly corrupted by the monied interests of the industrial and commercial trusts. The pragmatic portion of the Populist platform focused on issues of land, railroads and money, including the unlimited coinage of silver. The Populists showed impressive strength in the West and South in the 1892 elections, and their candidate for President polled more than a million votes. It was the currency question, however, pitting advocates of silver against those who favored gold, that soon overshadowed all other issues. Agrarian spokesmen in the West and South demanded a return to the unlimited coinage of silver. Convinced that their troubles stemmed from a shortage of money in circulation, they argued that increasing the volume of money would indirectly raise prices for farm products and drive up industrial wages, thus allowing debts to be paid with inflated dollars. Conservative groups and the financial classes, on the other hand, believed that such a policy would be disastrous, and they insisted that inflation, once begun, could not be stopped. Railroad bonds, the most important financial instrument of the time, were payable in gold. If fares and freight rates were set in half-price silver dollars, railroads would go bankrupt in weeks, throwing hundreds of thousands of men out of work and destroying the industrial economy. Only the gold standard, they said, offered stability. The financial Panic of 1893 heightened the tension of this debate. Bank failures abounded in the South and Midwest; unemployment soared and crop prices fell badly. The crisis, and President Cleveland's inability to solve it, nearly broke the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party, which supported silver and free trade, absorbed the remnants of the Populist movement as the presidential elections of 1896 neared. The Democratic convention that year was witness to one of the most famous speeches in U.S. political history. Pleading with the convention not to \\"crucify mankind on a cross of gold\\", William Jennings Bryan, the young Nebraskan champion of silver, won the Democrats' presidential nomination. The remaining Populists also endorsed Bryan, hoping to retain some influence by having a voice inside the Bryan movement. Despite carrying the South and all the West except California and Oregon, Bryan lost the more populated, industrial North and East‚Äîand the election‚Äîto the Republican William McKinley with his campaign slogan \\"A Full Dinner Pail\\". In 1897 the economy began to improve, mostly from restored business confidence. Silverites‚Äîwho did not realize that most transactions were handled by bank checks, not sacks of gold‚Äîbelieved the new prosperity was spurred by the discovery of gold in the Yukon. In 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War drew the nation's attention further away from Populist issues. If the movement was dead, however, its ideas were not. Once the Populists supported an idea, it became so tainted that the vast majority of American politicians rejected it; only years later, after the taint had been forgotten, was it possible to achieve Populist reforms, such as the direct popular election of Senators in 1914. Women's suffrage Alice Paul stands victorious before the Women's Suffrage Amendment's ratification banner. The women's suffrage movement began with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention; many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women's Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,Rebecca J. Mead, How the Vote Was Won: Woman Suffrage in the Western United States, 1868‚Äì1914 (2006) though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.Glenda Riley, Inventing the American Woman: An Inclusive History (2001) Around 1912, the movement, which had grown sluggish, began to reawaken. This put an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women because men could no longer do their job.Aileen S. Kraditor, The Ideas of the Women's Suffrage Movement: 1890‚Äì1920 (1967) Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capitol and major cities. Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by Carrie Chapman Catt, and formed the more militant National Woman's Party. Suffragists were arrested during their \\"Silent Sentinels\\" pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as political prisoners.Katherine H. Adams and Michael L. Keene, Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign (2007) Finally, the suffragettes were ordered released from prison, and Wilson urged Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women. The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserved the franchise, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first voting woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that Women's Suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Nevertheless, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919. It became constitutional law on August 26, 1920, after ratification by the 36th required state.Elizabeth Frost-Knappman and Kathryn Cullen-Dupont, Women's Suffrage in America (2004) Foreign policy Republican campaign poster, 1900, compares prosperity now with depression in 1896, and stresses humanitarian foreign policy With the landslide election victory of William McKinley, who had risen to national prominence six years earlier with the passage of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, a high tariff was passed in 1897 and a decade of rapid economic growth and prosperity ensued, building national self-confidence. McKinley brought in a new governing philosophy, one that dominated the 20th century, in which politics was the arena in which compromises among interest groups were worked out for the national benefit. His system of politics emphasized economic growth, prosperity for all, and pluralism that provided benefits for every group. He rejected programs such as prohibition and immigration restriction that were designed to hurt an enemy. He felt parties had the duty to enact the people's will and educate them to new ideas. =War with Spain= Post-Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War map of \\"Greater America,\\" including Cuba and the Philippines. Spain had once controlled a vast colonial empire, but by the second half of the 19th century only Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and some African possessions remained. The Cubans had been in a state of rebellion since the 1870s, and American newspapers, particularly New York City papers of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, printed sensationalized \\"Yellow Journalism\\" stories about Spanish atrocities in Cuba. However, these lurid stories reached only a small fraction of voters; most read sober accounts of Spanish atrocities, and they called for intervention. On February 15, 1898, the battleship USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor. Although it was unclear precisely what caused the blast, many Americans believed it to be the work of a Spanish mine, an attitude encouraged by the yellow journalism of Hearst and Pulitzer. The military was rapidly mobilized as the U.S. prepared to intervene in the Cuban revolt. It was made clear that no attempt at annexation of Cuba would be made and that the island's independence would be guaranteed. Spain considered this a wanton intervention in its internal affairs and severed diplomatic relations. War was declared on April 25. The Spanish were quickly defeated, and Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders gained fame in Cuba. Meanwhile, Commodore George Dewey's fleet crushed the Spanish in the faraway Philippines. Spain capitulated, ending the three-month-long war and recognizing Cuba's independence. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded to the United States. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were small, some politicians hoped they would be strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly China. That never happened and after 1903 American attention turned to the Panama Canal as the key to opening new trade routes. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War thus began the active, globally oriented American foreign policy that continues to the present day. =Philippines= The U.S. acquired the Philippines from Spain on December 10, 1898 via the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. However, Philippine revolutionaries led by Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence and in 1899 began fighting the U.S. troops. The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War ended in 1901 after Aguinaldo was captured and swore allegiance to the U.S. Likewise the other insurgents accepted American rule and peace prevailed, except in some remote islands under Muslim control. Roosevelt continued the McKinley policies of removing the Catholic friars (with compensation to the Pope), upgrading the infrastructure, introducing public health programs, and launching a program of economic and social modernization. The enthusiasm shown in 1898‚Äì99 for colonies cooled off, and Roosevelt saw the islands as \\"our heel of Achilles.\\" He told Taft in 1907, \\"I should be glad to see the islands made independent, with perhaps some kind of international guarantee for the preservation of order, or with some warning on our part that if they did not keep order we would have to interfere again.\\" By then the President and his foreign policy advisers turned away from Asian issues to concentrate on Latin America, and Roosevelt redirected Philippine policy to prepare the islands to become the first Western colony in Asia to achieve self-government. The Filipinos fought side by side with the Americans when the Japanese invaded in 1941, and aided the American re-conquest of the islands in 1944‚Äì45; independence came in 1946. =Latin America= The U.S. demanded Spain stop its oppressive policies in Cuba; public opinion (overruling McKinley) led to the short, successful Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. The U.S. permanently took over Puerto Rico, and temporarily held Cuba. Attention increasingly focused on the Caribbean as the rapid growth of the Pacific states, especially California, revealed the need for a canal across to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Plans for one in Nicaragua fell through but under Roosevelt's leadership the U.S. built a canal through Panama, after finding a public health solution to the deadly disease environment. The Panama Canal opened in 1914.David G. McCullough, The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870‚Äì1914 (1978) In 1904, Roosevelt announced his \\"Corollary\\" to the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the United States would intervene in cases where Latin American governments prove incapable or unstable in the interest of bringing democracy and financial stability to them. The U.S. made numerous interventions, mostly to stabilize the shaky governments and permit the nations to develop their economies. The intervention policy ended in the 1930s and was replaced by the Good Neighbor policy.Frederick W. Marks III, Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt (1982) In 1909, Nicaraguan President Jos√© Santos Zelaya resigned after the triumph of U.S.-backed rebels. This was followed up by the 1912‚Äì1933 U.S. occupation of Nicaragua. The U.S. military occupation of Haiti, in 1915, followed the mob execution of Haiti's leader but even more important was the threat of a possible German takeover of the island. Germans controlled 80% of the economy by 1914 and they were bankrolling revolutions that kept the country in political turmoil. The conquest resulted in a 19-year-long United States occupation of Haiti. Haiti was an exotic locale that suggested black racial themes to numerous American writers including Eugene O'Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles.Mary A. Renda, Taking Haiti: Military Occupation and the Culture of U.S. Imperialism, 1915‚Äì1940 (2000) Limited American intervention occurred in Mexico as that country fell into a long period of anarchy and civil war starting in 1910. In April 1914, U.S. troops occupied the Mexican port of Veracruz following the Tampico Incident; the reason for the intervention was Woodrow Wilson's desire to overthrow the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. In March 1916, Pancho Villa led 1,500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico, attacked a U.S. Cavalry detachment, seized 100 horses and mules, burned the town, and killed 17 of its residents. President Woodrow Wilson responded by sending 12,000 troops, under Gen. John J. Pershing, into Mexico to pursue Villa. The Pancho Villa Expedition to capture Villa failed in its objectives and was withdrawn in January 1917.Eileen Welsome, The General and the Jaguar: Pershing's Hunt for Pancho Villa: A True Story of Revolution and Revenge (2007) In 1916, the U.S. occupied the Dominican Republic. Progressive Era Child laborer, Newberry, South Carolina. 1908. A new spirit of the times, known as \\"Progressivism\\", arose in the 1890s and into the 1920s (although some historians date the ending with World War I). The presidential election of 1900 gave the U.S. a chance to pass judgment on the McKinley Administration, especially its foreign policy. Meeting at Philadelphia, the Republicans expressed jubilation over the successful outcome of the war with Spain, the restoration of prosperity, and the effort to obtain new markets through the Open Door Policy. The 1900 election was mostly a repeat of 1896 except for imperialism being added as a new issue (Hawaii had been annexed in 1898). William Jennings Bryan added anti-imperialism to his tired-out free silver rhetoric, but he was defeated in the face of peace, prosperity and national optimism. President McKinley was enjoying great popularity as he began his second term, but it would be cut short. In September 1901, while attending an exposition in Buffalo, New York, McKinley was shot by an anarchist. He was the third President to be assassinated, all since the Civil War. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt assumed the presidency. Online at EBSCO. Political corruption was a central issue, which reformers hoped to solve through civil service reforms at the national, state, and local level, replacing political hacks with professional technocrats. The 1883 Civil Service Reform Act (or Pendleton Act), which placed most federal employees on the merit system and marked the end of the so-called \\"spoils system\\", permitted the professionalization and rationalization of the federal administration. However, local and municipal government remained in the hands of often-corrupt politicians, political machines, and their local \\"bosses\\". Henceforth, the spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties, and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall ring, which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held out against civil service reform until the 1970s. Many self-styled progressives saw their work as a crusade against urban political bosses and corrupt \\"robber barons\\". There were increased demands for effective regulation of business, a revived commitment to public service, and an expansion of the scope of government to ensure the welfare and interests of the country as the groups pressing these demands saw fit. Almost all the notable figures of the period, whether in politics, philosophy, scholarship, or literature, were connected at least in part with the reform movement. Trenchant articles dealing with trusts, high finance, impure foods, and abusive railroad practices began to appear in the daily newspapers and in such popular magazines as McClure's and Collier's. Their authors, such as the journalist Ida M. Tarbell, who crusaded against the Standard Oil Trust, became known as \\"Muckrakers\\". In his novel, The Jungle, Upton Sinclair exposed unsanitary conditions in the Chicago meat packing houses and the grip of the beef trust on the nation's meat supply. The hammering impact of Progressive Era writers bolstered aims of certain sectors of the population, especially a middle class caught between political machines and big corporations, to take political action. Many states enacted laws to improve the conditions under which people lived and worked. At the urging of such prominent social critics as Jane Addams, child labor laws were strengthened and new ones adopted, raising age limits, shortening work hours, restricting night work, and requiring school attendance. By the early 20th century, most of the larger cities and more than half the states had established an eight-hour day on public works. Equally important were the Workers' Compensation Laws, which made employers legally responsible for injuries sustained by employees at work. New revenue laws were also enacted, which, by taxing inheritances, laid the groundwork for the contemporary Federal income tax.John D. Buenker, John C. Burnham, and Robert M. Crunden, Progressivism (1986) =Roosevelt's presidency= Roosevelt, a progressive Republican, called for a \\"Square Deal\\", and initiated a policy of increased Federal supervision in the enforcement of antitrust laws. Later, extension of government supervision over the railroads prompted the passage of major regulatory bills. One of the bills made published rates the lawful standard, and shippers equally liable with railroads for rebates.H.W. Brands, Theodore Roosevelt (2001) Following Roosevelt's landslide victory in the 1904 election he called for still more drastic railroad regulation, and in June 1906, Congress passed the Hepburn Act. This gave the Interstate Commerce Commission real authority in regulating rates, extended the jurisdiction of the commission, and forced the railroads to surrender their interlocking interests in steamship lines and coal companies. Roosevelt held many meetings, and opened public hearings, in a successful effort to find a compromise for the Coal Strike of 1902, which threatened the fuel supplies of urban America. Meanwhile, Congress had created a new Cabinet Department of Commerce and Labor. Charles Lederer Conservation of the nation's natural resources and beautiful places was a very high priority for Roosevelt, and he raised the national visibility of the issue.Douglas Brinkley, The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America (2009) ch 15 The President called for a far-reaching and integrated program of conservation, reclamation and irrigation as early as 1901 in his first annual message to Congress. Whereas his predecessors had set aside 46 million acres (188,000 km¬≤) of timberland for preservation and parks, Roosevelt increased the area to 146 million acres (592,000 km¬≤) and began systematic efforts to prevent forest fires and to retimber denuded tracts. His appointment of his friend Gifford Pinchot as chief forester resulted in vigorous new scientific management of public lands. TR added 50 wildlife refuges, 5 new national parks, and initiated the system of designating national monuments, such as the Devils Tower National Monument.Douglas G. Brinkley, The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America (2009) =President Taft= Roosevelt's popularity was at its peak as the campaign of 1908 neared, but he was unwilling to break the tradition by which no President had held office for more than two terms. Instead, he supported William Howard Taft. On the Democratic side, William Jennings Bryan ran for a third time, but managed to carry only the South. Taft, a former judge, first colonial governor of the U.S.-held Philippines and administrator of the Panama Canal, made some progress with his Dollar Diplomacy.Paolo Coletta, The Presidency of William Howard Taft (1990). Taft continued the prosecution of trusts, further strengthened the Interstate Commerce Commission, established a postal savings bank and a parcel post system, expanded the civil service, and sponsored the enactment of two amendments to the United States Constitution. The 16th Amendment authorized a federal income tax, while the 17th Amendment, ratified in 1913, mandated the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people, replacing the prior system established in the original Constitution, in which they were selected by state legislatures. Yet balanced against these achievements was Taft's support for the Payne Aldrich tariff with protective schedules that outraged progressive opinion.Stanley D. Solvick, \\"William Howard Taft and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1963) pp. 424‚Äì42 in JSTOR. Protection was the ideological cement holding the Republican coalition together. High tariffs were used by Republicans to promise higher sales to business, higher wages to industrial workers, and higher demand for farm products. Progressive insurgents said it promoted monopoly. Democrats said it was a tax on the little man. It had greatest support in the Northeast, and greatest opposition in the South and West. The Midwest was the battle ground.Howard R. Smith, and John Fraser Hart, \\"The American tariff map.\\" Geographical Review 45.3 (1955): 327-346 online. Insurgents also complained about his opposition to statehood for Arizona because of its progressive constitution; his opposition to environmental activists; and his growing reliance on the conservative wing of his party. His patron Roosevelt became his enemy by 1910. The Republican Party was divided, and an overwhelming vote swept the Democrats back into control of Congress in the 1910 United States elections.Paolo E. Coletta, The Presidency of William Howard Taft (1973) pp 101‚Äì120. =President Wilson= Two years later, Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic, progressive governor of the state of New Jersey, campaigned against Taft, the Republican candidate, and against Roosevelt who was appalled by his successor's policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term. As the Republicans would not nominate him, he ran as a third-party Progressive candidate, but the ticket became widely known as the Bull Moose Party. The election was mainly a contest between Roosevelt and Wilson, Taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral votes.John Milton Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) Wilson, in a spirited campaign, defeated both rivals. Under his leadership, the new Congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in American history. Its first task was tariff revision. \\"The tariff duties must be altered,\\" Wilson said. \\"We must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege.\\" The Underwood Tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs, cotton and woolen goods, iron and steel, and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items. Although the act retained many protective features, it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for American workers. The second item on the Democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system. \\"Control,\\" said Wilson, \\"must be public, not private, must be vested in the government itself, so that the banks may be the instruments, not the masters, of business and of individual enterprise and initiative.\\" Passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was one of Wilson's most enduring legislative accomplishments, for he successfully negotiated a compromise between Wall Street and the agrarians. The plan built on ideas developed by Senator Nelson Aldrich, who discovered the European nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade. The new organization divided the country into 12 districts, with a Federal Reserve Bank in each, all supervised by a Federal Reserve Board. These banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks. Until the Federal Reserve Act, the U.S. government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks. While the official medium of exchange was gold coins, most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes, backed by the promise of redemption in gold. The trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves, prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin. With the passage of the act, greater flexibility in the money supply was assured, and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes‚Äîpaper dollars‚Äîto meet business demands. The Fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the World War. After 1914, issues of money and banking faded away from the political agenda.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era: 1910‚Äì1917 (1954), pp 43‚Äì53, 258-259 To resolve the long-standing dispute over trusts, the Wilson Administration dropped the \\"trust-busting\\" legal strategies of Roosevelt and Taft and relied on the new Federal Trade Commission to issue orders prohibiting \\"unfair methods of competition\\" by business concerns in interstate trade. In addition a second law, the Clayton Antitrust Act, forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation‚Äîinterlocking directorates, price discrimination among purchasers, use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises. After 1914 the trust issue faded away from politics.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era: 1910‚Äì1917 (1954), pp 67‚Äì73 The Adamson Act of 1916 established an eight-hour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the Democratic Party. The record of achievement won Wilson a firm place in American history as one of the nation's foremost liberal reformers. Wilson's domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime President who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed. World War I Woodrow Wilson. =Entry= Firmly maintaining neutrality when World War I began in Europe in 1914, the United States helped supply the Allies, but could not ship anything to Germany because of the British blockade. Sympathies among many politically and culturally influential Americans had favored the British cause from the start of the war, as typified by industrialist Samuel Insull, born in London, who helped young Americans enlist in British or Canadian forces. On the other hand, especially in the Midwest, many Irish Americans and German Americans opposed any American involvement, the Irish because they hated the British, and the Germans because they feared they would come under personal attack. The suffragist movement included many pacifists, and most churches opposed the war. German efforts to use their submarines (\\"U-boats\\") to blockade Britain resulted in the deaths of American travelers and sailors, and attacks on passenger liners caused public outrage. Most notable was torpedoing without warning the passenger liner Lusitania in 1915. Germany promised not to repeat; however it reversed position in early 1917, believing that unrestricted U-boat warfare against all ships headed to Britain would win the war, albeit at the cost of American entry. When Americans read the text of the German offer to Mexico, known as the Zimmermann Telegram, they saw an offer for Mexico to go to war with Germany against the United States, with German funding, with the promise of the return of the lost territories of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. On Apr 1, 1917, Wilson called for war, emphasizing that the U.S. had to fight to maintain its honor and to have a decisive voice in shaping the new postwar world.For detailed coverage of Wilson's speech see NY Times main headline, April 2, 1917, President Calls for War Declaration, Stronger Navy, New Army of 500,000 Men, Full Cooperation With Germany's Foes Congress voted on April 6, 1917 to declare war, but it was far from unanimous.John M. Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) =Germania= German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to the German Empire. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced \\"hyphenated Americanism\\", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, or ridiculed the British. About 1% of the 480,000 enemy aliens of German birth were imprisoned in 1917‚Äì18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.The War Department: Keeper of Our Nation's Enemy Aliens During World War I by Mitchell Yockelson. Presented to the Society for Military History Annual Meeting, April 1998. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched. The war saw a phobia of anything German engulf the nation; sauerkraut was rechristened \\"liberty cabbage\\".Frederick C. Luebke, Bonds of Loyalty: German Americans During World War I (1974) =Patriotism= The Wilson Administration created the Committee on Public Information (CPI) to control war information and provide pro-war propaganda. The private American Protective League, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was one of many private right-wing \\"patriotic associations\\" that sprang up to support the war and at the same time fight labor unions and various left-wing and anti-war organizations. The U.S. Congress passed, and Wilson signed, the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918. The Sedition Act criminalized any expression of opinion that used \\"disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language\\" about the U.S. government, flag or armed forces. Government police action, private vigilante groups and public war hysteria compromised the civil liberties of many Americans who disagreed with Wilson's policies.Ronald Schaffer, The United States in World War I (1978) =Draft= Navy poster by Howard Chandler Christy The United States was remarkably unprepared for war in 1917, since it had not fought a major conflict since 1865. The military was small by modern standards and used out- dated weapons. A hasty expansion and modernization of the armed forces was thus launched. The draft began in spring 1917 but volunteers were also accepted. Four million men and thousands of women joined the services for the duration.John W. Chambers, II, To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America (1987) =Economic confusion in 1917= In terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role. Washington was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge. Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the major source of energy and heat a grave crisis ensued. There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess. The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Washington finally take control of the crisis Kennedy, Over Here 113-25 =Women= The war saw many women taking what were traditionally men's jobs for the first time. Many worked on the assembly lines of factories, producing tanks, trucks and munitions. For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses. The Food Administration helped housewives prepare nutritious meals with less waste and with optimum use of the foods available. Most important, the morale of the women remained high, as millions joined the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families. With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.Lettie Gavin, American Women in World War I: They Also Served (2006) =Labor= Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense, where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917. In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910.Philip Taft, The A.F.L. in the time of Gompers (1957) Anti-war socialists controlled the IWW, which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action by the federal government. =Over there= On the battlefields of France in spring 1918, the fresh American troops were enthusiastically welcomed by the war-weary Allied armies in the summer of 1918. They arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, at a time that the Germans were unable to replace their losses. After the Allies turned back the powerful final German offensive (Spring Offensive), the Americans played a central role in the Allied final offensive (Hundred Days Offensive). Victory over Germany was achieved on November 11, 1918.Edward M. Coffman, The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I (1998) Using questionnaires filled out by doughboys as they left the Army, Guti√®rrez reported they were not cynical or disillusioned. They fought \\"for honor, manhood, comrades, and adventure, but especially for duty.\\"Edward A. :Guti√®rrez, Doughboys on the Great War: How American Soldiers Viewed Their Military Experience (2014) =Treaty= Britain, France and Italy imposed severe economic penalties on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles; instead, the United States signed separate peace treaties with Germany and her allies. The Senate also refused to enter the newly created League of Nations on Wilson's terms, and Wilson rejected the Senate's compromise proposal.

It is one of the world centres for research using neutrons. Founded in 1967 and honouring the physicists Max von Laue and Paul Langevin, the ILL provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5√ó1015 neutrons per second per cm2, with a thermal power of typically 58.3 MW. The ILL neutron scattering facilities allow the analysis of the structure of conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the measurement of stresses in mechanical materials. It also allows investigations into macromolecular assemblies, particularly protein dynamics and biomolecular structure. It is a world-renowned centre for nanoscale science.  History  Inside the reactor hall The institute was founded by France and Germany, with the United Kingdom becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide, through Research Councils, the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750 experiments are completed every year, in fields including magnetism, superconductivity, materials engineering, and the study of liquids, colloids and biological substances such as proteins. The high-flux research reactor produces neutrons through fission in a compact-core fuel element. Neutron moderators cool the neutrons to wavelengths usable experimentally. Neutrons are then directed at a suite of instruments to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering, and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the neutron. Fission products and gamma rays produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by the instrument suite. In 2000 began the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The first phase has already resulted in a 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase started in 2008: it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.  EPN Science Campus  The ILL shares its site, the 'epn science campus',epn-campus.eu with other institutions including the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Unit for Viral Host Cell Interactions (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structural (IBS) joined the campus in 2013.

It was long placed in with the other plovers in the family Charadriidae; however, behavioural evidence suggested they were distinct, and molecular studies confirmed this, suggesting that they are actually more closely related to the sheathbills, a uniquely Antarctic family. As such it is now placed in its own family, Pluvianellidae. This species is not a long-distance migrant, although some birds move further north in southern Argentina in winter. The species breeds inland and then moves to the coast during the winter, particularly to estuaries. One of their preferred areas during winter is in Puerto Madryn and Pen√≠nsula Valdes, Chubut, Argentina (Jehl 1975). This species is in its structure and habits much like a turnstone, but it cannot be confused with any other wader species. Its upperparts and breast are pale grey, and the rest of the underparts are white. It has short red legs, a black bill and red eyes. In young birds, the eyes and legs are yellowish in colour, and the plumage is grey overall with scaling. The call is a dovelike coo. This species breeds near water, usually saline lakes but there are reports of nests near rivers as well. Pairs defend territories, and both parents share incubation duties. It lays two large eggs on the ground, although usually only one chick survives. One unique aspect of its behaviour and physiology is its method of feeding its chicks. Chicks are fed by regurgitating food stored in the crop, this species being the only wader to do so. Magellanic plovers feed on small invertebrates, picked from the ground, or from under pebbles, again like a turnstone. They have been observed collecting worms in the bill in a similar fashion to a puffin.

An unfunded credit derivative is one where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or at any given time during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are credit default swaps. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and payments under the credit derivative are funded using securitization techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative. This synthetic securitization process has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), credit-linked notes or single-tranche CDOs. In funded credit derivatives, transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different slices of credit risk according to their risk appetite.  History and participants  The historical antecedents of trade credit insurance, which date back at least to the 1860s, also presaged credit derivatives more indirectly. The market in credit derivatives as defined in today's terms started from nothing in 1993 after having been pioneered by J.P. Morgan's Peter Hancock. By 1996 there was around $40 billion of outstanding transactions, half of which involved the debt of developing countries. Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product and include unfunded products such as credit default swaps and funded products such as collateralized debt obligations (see further discussion below). On May 15, 2007, in a speech concerning credit derivatives and liquidity risk, Timothy Geithner, then President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated: ‚ÄúFinancial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.‚Äù Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability. The ISDA reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding credit derivatives was $35.1 trillion with a gross market value of $948 billion (ISDA's Website). As reported in The Times on September 15, 2008, the \\"Worldwide credit derivatives market is valued at $62 trillion\\". Although the credit derivatives market is a global one, London has a market share of about 40%, with the rest of Europe having about 10%. The main market participants are banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.  Types  Credit derivatives are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded credit derivatives and unfunded credit derivatives. An unfunded credit derivative is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e., payments of premiums and any cash or physical settlement amount) itself without recourse to other assets. A funded credit derivative involves the protection seller (the party that assumes the credit risk) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. (The protection buyer, however, still may be exposed to the credit risk of the protection seller itself. This is known as counterparty risk.) Unfunded credit derivative products include the following products: * Credit default swap (CDS) * Total return swap * Constant maturity credit default swap (CMCDS) * First to Default Credit Default Swap * Portfolio Credit Default Swap * Secured Loan Credit Default Swap * Credit Default Swap on Asset Backed Securities * Credit default swaption * Recovery lock transaction * Credit Spread Option * CDS index products Funded credit derivative products include the following products: * Credit-linked note (CLN) * Synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) * Constant Proportion Debt Obligation (CPDO) * Synthetic constant proportion portfolio insurance (Synthetic CPPI) = Key unfunded credit derivative products =  Credit default swap  The credit default swap or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the credit derivatives market. This product represents over thirty percent of the credit derivatives market. The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or portfolio of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same. A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to asset-backed securities.  Total return swap  = Key funded credit derivative products =  Credit linked notes  In this example coupons from the bank's portfolio of loans are passed to the SPV which uses the cash flow to service the credit linked notes. A credit linked note is a note whose cash flow depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in credit spread, or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note. A CLN in effect combines a credit- default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption). Given its note-like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS. Typically, an investment fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge against possible down grades, or loan defaults. Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an overview rather than a detailed account of these instruments. The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well- rated borrower, packaged with a credit default swap on a less creditworthy risk. For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country's default or convertibility risk. From the bank's point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a credit event occurs. However, from the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well. The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon. Through the use of a credit default swap, the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults. There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension. * Credit-linked notes (CLN): Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be. * Collateralized debt obligation (CDO): Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets‚Äîthere also exists CDO-Squared (CDO^2) where the underlying assets are CDO tranches. * Collateralized bond obligations (CBO): Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO * Collateralized loan obligations (CLO): Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or the CLNs themselves.  Collateralized debt obligations  Not all collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up of loans is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization is known as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash. A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a Synthetic CDO. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset. Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying credit risk is itself a CDO tranche. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs- squared.  Pricing  Pricing of credit derivative is not an easy process. This is because: * The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation. * Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable. * The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default. * Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be different.  Risks  Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets. The US Federal Reserve issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades. These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system. One challenge in regulating these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested incentive in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.

He served as the president of the secessionist State of Katanga from 1960 to 1963 and as prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1964 to 1965.  Early life  A member of the Lunda ethnic group, Tshombe was born near Musumba, Belgian Congo, the son of a successful businessman. He received his education from an American missionary school and later trained as an accountant. In the 1950s, he took over a chain of stores in Katanga Province and became involved in politics. Political career Along with Godefroid Munongo, he founded the Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party. CONAKAT promoted a federal Congo independent of the Belgian colonial empire.The Congo from Leopold to Kabila, Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, 2002, , accessed February 2009 = President of Katanga = CONAKAT won control of the Katanga provincial legislature in the May 1960 general elections. One month later the Congo became an independent republic. Tshombe became President of the autonomous province of Katanga. Patrice Lumumba was tasked with forming a national government. Members of his party, the Mouvement National Congolais, were given charge of the portfolios of national defence and interior, despite Tshombe's objections. The portfolio for economic affairs was awarded to a CONAKAT member, but this was undercut by the positioning of nationalists in control of the Ministry and Secretariat for Economic Coordination. Mines and land affairs were placed under separate portfolios. Tshombe declared that this diluting of CONAKAT's influence rendered his agreement to support the government \\"null and void\\". On the evening of 11 July, Tshombe, accusing the central government of communist leanings and dictatorial rule, announced that Katanga was seceding from the Congo. Favoring continued ties with Belgium, he asked the Belgian government to send military officers to recruit and train a Katangese army. Tshombe in Katanga, 1962 Tshombe demanded United Nations recognition for independent Katanga, and he announced that any intervention by UN troops would be met with force. Nonetheless, Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and his successor, Cyrille Adoula, successfully requested intervention from UN forces. UN forces were sent under the direction of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. France, wishing to take advantage of Katangese minerals, sent to Tshombe the reinforcement of the mercenary Bob Denard and his men. It was supported by the networks of Jacques Foccart, the \\"Mr. Africa\\" of the French government.https://journals.openedition.org/ccrh/512 Lumumba's government was dissolved, and Lumumba taken prisoner by Mobutu and detained at Camp Hardy in Thysville. Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden (Belgian minister for African Affairs) sent a highly confidential telegram on 16 January 1961 to the government in L√©opoldville (President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu) to send Lumumba to Katanga. That would have stemmed from Lumumba's increasing popularity among soldiers, who might release him. Meanwhile, soldier mutinies and unrest increased by the day, at Prison Camp Hardy in Thysville. The telegram has still not been shown to exist. Whilst being flown in a Sabena Douglas DC-4 plane to Katanga, Lumumba was beaten by the Congolese soldiers escorting him. In custody in Katanga, Lumumba was visited by Katangese notables and Belgian officers, who included Tshombe, Godefroid Munongo, Kibwe, Kitenge, Grandelet, Son, Gat, Huygh√©, Tign√©e, Verscheure, Segers and Rougefort. Lumumba's execution, on 17 January, was carried out by a firing squad led by a Belgian mercenary, Julien Gat.The Assassination of Lumumba, Ludo De Witte, 2003, = Prime Minister of the Congo = Prime Minister Tshombe touring Stanleyville in 1964 In 1963, UN forces succeeded in suppressing Katanga, driving Tshombe into exile in Northern Rhodesia, later to Spain. In July 1964, he returned to the Congo to serve as prime minister in a new coalition government. His cabinet was sworn in on 10 July. Tshombe's national support was derived from the backing of provincial political bosses, customary chiefs, and foreign financial interests. Among his first acts in office were the lifting of a curfew in L√©opoldville, the release of 600 political prisoners‚Äîincluding Antoine Gizenga, and the ordering of Katangese gendarmes to return from their exile in Angola to the Congo and join the national army. In a New Year's message at the beginning of 1965, Tshombe rejected conciliation with the Simba rebels and called for their total defeat. He was dismissed from his position in October 1965 by President Kasa-Vubu. In November, General Mobutu, who had staged a successful coup against Kasa-Vubu, brought charges of treason against Tshombe, who again fled the country and settled in Francoist Spain.  Later life  In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death in absentia. On 30 June 1967, he was in a Hawker Siddeley jet aircraft that was hijacked by Francis Bodenan, an agent of the SDECE of France. According to the Congolese government, Tshombe was going to Africa. Tshombe was taken to Algeria, jailed, and placed under house arrest. The pilots of the plane, Britons Trevor Coppleston and David Taylor, were released and returned to the United Kingdom. The Congolese government demanded his extradition to Congo, and his Western supporters agitated for his release. The Algerians resisted both demands. A part of his supporters gathered to form the Tshombe Emergency Committee in the U.S., including Marvin Liebman and William F. Buckley, to press for his release and move to Spain. Long-time aide Michel Struelens travelled to different European cities to lobby for Tshombe, eventually to no avail.  Death and legacy  Tshombe died in 1969; the official cause of death was listed as \\"death from heart failure.\\" He was buried in a Methodist service at Etterbeek Cemetery, near Brussels, Belgium. Owing to his role in the death of Lumumba and his association with Western interests, Tshombe's surname to black African nationalists became synonymous with \\"sellout\\". The plot of the 1978 war film The Wild Geese is based in part on speculation that Tshombe's plane had initially been diverted to Rhodesia before being sent to Algeria. The film's characters Col. Allen Faulkner and President Julius Limbani were largely based on Tshombe and his military ally Maj. \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare.\\"Mercenary 'Mad Mike' Hoare dies aged 100,\\" www.bbc.com, 3 February 2020.

History  Lambda's founder William J. Thom, Esq. submitted incorporation papers for approval to the New York Courts in 1971, but his application was denied on the grounds that its proposed activities would be \\"neither benevolent nor charitable in purpose\\" and \\"there was no demonstrated need for its existence\\". That decision was overturned in 1973 by the New York Court of Appeals, which is the highest court of New York State. (In re Thom, 301 N.E.2d 542 (N.Y. 1973).). The original incorporators, in addition to Bill Thom, were E. Carrington Boggan, and Michael J. Lavery. At their first meeting on November 10, 1973, they elected to the newly constituted board of directors Rodney L. Eubanks, Shepherd Raimi, and D. Nicholas Russo.\\"Minutes of the Combined Organizational Meeting and of the First Meeting of the Members and First Meeting of Directors\\", Lambda Legal, November 10, 1973 Because of the scarcity of openly gay lawyers in 1973, Lambda Legal formed a Board of Advisors of eminent New Yorkers sympathetic to the cause of gay rights. They included US Congressperson Bella Abzug, NY State Senator Carol Bellamy, Association of the Bar President Merrell E. Clark, Rev. John Corn of Trinity Church and Martin Duberman, Distinguished Professor at City University of New York. Also on the Board of Advisors were two lawyers who later became New York State Supreme Court Justices: Phyllis Gangel-Jacob and Shirley Fingerhood. From its inception, Lambda Legal sought diversity on its board of directors. Initially it could find no lesbian lawyers who were willing or able to be openly associated with a gay activist organization. Nathalie Rockhill, a major figure in the early post-Stonewall days of Gay Liberation, was the first woman elected to the board in 1974. She was soon followed by lesbian law students and, in time, by lesbian lawyers. By the 1980s, men and women were equally represented on Lambda's board.Primary source ‚Äì original board member, Shepherd Raimi, July 23, 2008 Lambda's growth paralleled the growth of the gay movement. By the 1980s, with the advent of AIDS, gay awareness and activism had grown significantly. Thomas B. Stoddard, who was executive director from 1986 to 1992, helped to author a bill passed in 1986 by the New York City Council to protect gays against bias in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Mayor Ed Koch, who signed the bill enacting it into law said: \\"The legislation drafted by Tom Stoddard was perfect.\\" In 1993, Stoddard and other national gay leaders met with president Bill Clinton, the first such delegation to meet inside the Oval Office.Thomas Stoddard, 48, Dies; An Advocate of Gay Rights, New York Times, February 14, 1997 In 2013, Lambda Legal ‚Äì Midwest Regional Office was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. Its national headquarters remain in New York City, but today it has regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Washington.  Work  Lambda Legal has played a role in many legal cases pertaining to gay rights, including the 6-3 United States Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated sodomy laws in the United States. Lambda Legal carries out its legal work principally through test cases selected for the likelihood of their success in establishing positive legal precedents that will affect lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and those affected by HIV. Lambda Legal's staff of attorneys works on a wide range of cases, with their docket averaging more than 50 cases at any given time. Lambda Legal also maintains a national network of volunteer Cooperating Attorneys, which widens the scope of their legal work and allows attorneys, legal workers and law students to become involved in the program by working with Lambda Legal's legal staff. Lambda Legal pursues litigation in all parts of the country, in every area of the law that affects communities they represent, such as discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, and the military; HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and public policy issues; parenting and relationship issues; equal marriage rights; equal employment and domestic partnership benefits; \\"sodomy\\" law challenges; immigration issues; anti-gay initiatives; and free speech and equal protection rights. Before taking on legal work on behalf of same-sex marriage rights, Lambda Legal had to resolve an internal debate over the significance of marriage for its constituency and the strategic wisdom of taking on the issue. In 1990, it declined to represent the plaintiffs in the initial challenge to Hawaii's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It filed an amicus brief in that case at a later stage and another in Dean v. District of Columbia, its first advocacy for same-sex marriage. Lambda Legal publishes the \\"Little Black Book\\", which contains information regarding the possible consequences of gay men \\"cruising\\" for sex in public places. The \\"Little Black Book\\" includes the following material: \\"If you cruise in parks, bathrooms or other spaces open to public view, trust your instincts, be aware of your surroundings ‚Äì and know your rights. While Lambda Legal and other groups are fighting against the ways police target men who have sex with men, having sex where others might see you and take offense can subject you to arrest, publicity and other serious consequences. If you feel unsafe, you should leave.\\" The \\"Little Black Book\\" goes on to advise as follows: \\"If you‚Äôre cruising for sex and an undercover cop hits on you, what you do can still be a crime.\\" In July 2012, Lambda founder Bill Thom was interviewed at his nursing home in Manhattan, and gave a first-hand account of the early years of Lambda Legal. This resulted in a letter from the current co-chair of Lambda Legal to Bill Thom dated September 25, 2012 in which he says \\"The world is a vastly better place for LGBT people than when I started practice 20 years ago and is almost unrecognizable from the world in which you took on the heroic and unprecedented task of fighting back.\\" Following a presidential order to ban transgender troops from the US military, Lambda indicated that they would be taking action to challenge the legality of the order.https://twitter.com/LambdaLegal/status/901214228119465985 See also * LGBT rights in the United States * List of LGBT rights organizations * Diaz v.

(Its Appellate Division is also the highest intermediate appellate court.) It is vested with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, although outside New York City it acts primarily as a court of civil jurisdiction, with most criminal matters handled in County Court. The court is radically different from its counterparts in nearly all other states in that the Supreme Court is a trial court and is not the highest court in the state. The highest court of the State of New York is the Court of Appeals. Also, although it is a trial court, the Supreme Court sits as a \\"single great tribunal of general state-wide jurisdiction, rather than an aggregation of separate courts sitting in the several counties or judicial districts of the state.\\"Schneider v. Aulisi, 307 N.Y. 376, 384, 121 N.E.2d 375 (1954). There is a branch of the Supreme Court in each of New York's 62 counties. Jurisdiction New York County Courthouse at 60 Centre Street, viewed from across Foley Square Under the New York State Constitution, the New York State Supreme Court has unlimited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases, with the exception of certain monetary claims against the State of New York itself. In practice, the Supreme Court hears civil actions involving claims above a certain monetary amount (for example, $25,000 in New York City) that puts the claim beyond the jurisdiction of lower courts. Civil actions about lesser sums are heard by courts of limited jurisdiction, such as the New York City Civil Court, or the County Court, District Court, city courts, or justice courts (town and village courts) outside New York City. The Supreme Court also hears civil cases involving claims for equitable relief, such as injunctions, specific performance, or rescission of a contract, as well as actions for a declaratory judgment. The Supreme Court also has exclusive jurisdiction of matrimonial actions, such as either contested or uncontested actions for a divorce or annulment. The court also has exclusive jurisdiction over \\"Article 78 proceedings\\" against a body or officer seeking to overturn an official determination on the grounds that it was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable or contrary to law.Civil Practice Law and Rules article 78 In 1995, the New York Supreme Court established a trial level Commercial Division, beginning in New York County (Manhattan) and Monroe County (the 7th Judicial District). The Commercial Division has expanded to the 8th District (located in Buffalo), and the Albany, Kings, Nassau, Onondaga, Queens, Suffolk and Westchester County Supreme Courts. These are specialized Business Courts, with a defined jurisdiction focusing on business and commercial litigation. The jurisdictional amount in controversy required to have a case heard in the Commercial Division varies among these Commercial Division courts, ranging from $50,000 in Albany and Onondaga Counties to $500,000 in New York County, but the Commercial Division rules (Section 202.70) are otherwise uniform. With respect to criminal cases, the Criminal Branch of Supreme Court tries felony cases in the five counties of New York City, whereas they are primarily heard by the County Court elsewhere. Misdemeanor cases, and arraignments in almost all cases, are handled by lower courts: the New York City Criminal Court; the District Court in Nassau County and the five western towns of Suffolk County; city courts; and justice courts, and so on. Structure =Appellate Division= Second Department Appeals from Supreme Court decisions, as well as from the Surrogate's Court, Family Court, and Court of Claims, are heard by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division. This court is intermediate between the New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals. There is one Appellate Division, which for administrative purposes comprises four judicial departments.Mountain View Coach Lines v. Storms, 102 A.D.2d 663, 476 N.Y.S.2d 918 (2d Dept. 1984). Decisions of the Appellate Division department panels are binding on the lower courts in that department, and also on lower courts in other departments unless there is contrary authority from the Appellate Division of that department.Duffy v. Horton Memorial Hospital, 66 N.Y.2d 473, 497 N.Y.S.2d 890 (1985); Mountain View Coach Lines v. Storms, 102 A.D.2d 663, 476 N.Y.S.2d 918 (2d Dept. 1984). =Appellate terms= The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in each judicial department is authorized to establish \\"appellate terms\\". An appellate term is an intermediate appellate court that hears appeals from the inferior courts within their designated counties or judicial districts, and are intended to ease the workload on the Appellate Division and provide a less expensive forum closer to the people. Appellate terms are located in the First and Second Judicial Departments only. (The County Court \\"appellate sessions\\" hear appeals from the inferior courts in the Third and Fourth Judicial Departments.) In New York City, the Appellate Term hears appeals from the New York City Civil Court and Criminal Court. In the Second Department outside New York City, it hears appeals from the Nassau and Suffolk County District Courts, city courts, and justice (town and village) courts. Appellate terms consist of between three and five justices of the Supreme Court, appointed by the Chief Administrative Judge with the approval of presiding justice of the appropriate appellate division. The court sits in three-judge panels, with two justices constituting a quorum and being necessary for a decision. Decisions by the Appellate Term must be followed by courts whose appeals lie to it.28 NY Jur 2d, Courts and Judges ¬ß 220, at 274 [1997]Yellow Book of NY L.P. v. Dimilia, 188 Misc.2d 489, 729 N.Y.S.2d 286 (2001) =Criminal terms= In New York City, all felony cases are heard in criminal terms. The Criminal Term of the Supreme Court, New York County is divided into 1 all purpose part, 15 conference and trial parts, 1 youth part, 1 narcotics/sci part, 1 felony waiver/sci part, 1 integrated domestic violence part, and 16 trial parts, which include 3 Judicial Diversion Parts and 1 Mental Health Part. =Civil terms= In New York City, all major civil cases are heard in civil terms. Administration New York judicial districts The court system is divided into thirteen judicial districts: seven upstate districts each comprising between five and eleven counties, five districts corresponding to the boroughs of New York City, and one district on Long Island.Judiciary Law ¬ß 140. \\"The state is hereby divided into thirteen judicial districts, [...]\\" In each judicial district outside New York City, an Administrator (or Administrative Judge if a judge) is responsible for supervising all courts and agencies, while inside New York City an Administrator (or Administrative Judge) supervises each major court. Administrators are assisted by Supervising Judges who are responsible in the on-site management of the trial courts, including court caseloads, personnel, and budget administration, and each manage a particular type of court within a county or judicial district. The Administrator is also assisted by the District Executive and support staff. The district administrative offices are responsible for personnel, purchasing, budgets, revenue, computer automation, court interpreters, court security, and case management. Opinions of the New York trial courts are published selectively in the Miscellaneous Reports. Judges A judge of the New York Supreme Court is titled \\"justice\\". =Elections= Supreme Court justices are elected. Justices are nominated by judicial district nominating conventions, with judicial delegates themselves elected from assembly districts. Some (political party) county committees play a significant role in their judicial district conventions, for example restricting nomination to those candidates that receive approval from a party screening committee. Sometimes, the parties cross-endorse each other's candidates, while at other times they do not and incumbent judges must actively campaign for re-election. Judicial conventions have been criticized as opaque, brief and dominated by county party leaders. In practice, most of the power of selecting justices belongs to local political party organizations, such as the Kings County Democratic County Committee (Brooklyn Democratic Party), which control the delegates. The process was challenged in litigation which ultimately resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision in N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, which upheld the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system. New York Supreme Court justices are elected to 14-year terms. A Supreme Court Justice's term ends, even if the 14-year term has not yet expired, at the end of the calendar year in which he or she reaches the age of 70. However, an elected Supreme Court Justice may obtain certification to continue in office, without having to be re-elected, for three two-year periods, until final retirement at the end of the year in which the Justice turns 76. These additional six years of service are available only for elected Supreme Court Justices, not for \\"Acting\\" Justices whose election or appointments were to lower courts. =Assignments= Queens County Criminal Courts Building houses justices and courtrooms of the New York Supreme Court In many counties, the number of New York Supreme Court justices is fewer than the number of needed justices. For that reason, judges of the New York City Civil Court, New York City Criminal Court, New York Family Court, and New York Court of Claims are designated as Acting Supreme Court Justices. =Notable justices= * George G.

It was established as the Supreme Court of Judicature by the Province of New York on May 6, 1691. That court was continued by the State of New York after independence was declared in 1776. It became the New York Supreme Court under the New York Constitutional Convention of 1846. In November 2004, the court system merged the operations of two separate criminal courts‚Äîthe Bronx County Criminal Court and the Criminal Term of Bronx County Supreme Court‚Äîinto a single trial court of criminal jurisdiction known as the Bronx Criminal Division.

An improvised explosive device (IED) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery shell, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs are commonly used as roadside bombs. IEDs are generally seen in heavy terrorist actions or in asymmetric unconventional warfare by insurgent guerrillas or commando forces in a theatre of operations. In the second Iraq War, insurgents used IEDs extensively against U.S.-led forces and by the end of 2007 IEDs were responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq. They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001‚Äìpresent Afghanistan War. IEDs were also used frequently by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. Background X-ray of a suitcase showing a pipebomb and a laptop. An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack. IEDs may incorporate military or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME). An HME lab refers to a Homemade Explosive Lab, or the physical location where the devices are crafted. An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator. IEDs are extremely diverse in design and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads. Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could. In the conflicts of the 21st century, anti-personnel improvised explosive devices (IED) have partially replaced conventional or military landmines as the source of injury to dismounted (pedestrian) soldiers and civilians. These injuries were reported in BMJ Open to be far worse with IEDs than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation. This combination of injuries has been given the name \\"Dismounted Complex Blast Injury\\" and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in war. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy chain to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway. IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to detonate, and in some cases, they detonate on either the maker or the placer of the device. Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional munitions and standard consumer electronics components, such as mobile phones, consumer-grade two-way radios, washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available. IEDs may use artillery shells or conventional high-explosive charges as their explosive load as well as homemade explosives. However, the threat exists that toxic chemical, biological, or radioactive (dirty bomb) material may be added to a device, thereby creating other life-threatening effects beyond the shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. Chlorine liquid has been added to IEDs in Iraq, producing clouds of chlorine gas. A vehicle-borne IED, or VBIED, is a military term for a car bomb or truck bomb but can be any type of transportation such as a bicycle, motorcycle, donkey ( ), etc. They are typically employed by insurgents in particular, ISIS, and can carry a relatively large payload. They can also be detonated from a remote location. VBIED's can create additional shrapnel through the destruction of the vehicle itself and use vehicle fuel as an incendiary weapon. The act of a person's being in this vehicle and detonating it is known as an SVBIED suicide. Of increasing popularity among insurgent forces in Iraq, is the house-borne IED, or HBIED from the common military practice of clearing houses; insurgents rig an entire house to detonate and collapse shortly after a clearing squad has entered. =By warhead= The Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (JCS Pub 1-02) includes two definitions for improvised devices: improvised explosive devices (IED) and improvised nuclear device (IND). These definitions address the Nuclear and Explosive in CBRNe. That leaves chemical, biological and radiological undefined. Four definitions have been created to build on the structure of the JCS definition. Terms have been created to standardize the language of first responders and members of the military and to correlate the operational picture. Explosive A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from non-military components. Explosively formed penetrator/projectiles (EFPs) concave copper shape on top defines an explosively formed penetrator/projectile IEDs have been deployed in the form of explosively formed projectiles (EFP), a special type of shaped charge that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more), however they are not accurate at long distances. This is because of how they are produced. The large \\"slug\\" projected from the explosion has no stabilization because it has no tail fins and it does not spin like a bullet from a rifle. Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters. An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most vehicles in Iraq. Directionally focused charges Directionally focused charges (also known as directionally focused fragmentary charges depending on the construction) are very similar to EFPs, with the main difference being that the top plate is usually flat and not concave. It also is not made with machined copper but much cheaper cast or cut metal. When made for fragmentation, the contents of the charge are usually nuts, bolts, ball bearings and other similar shrapnel products and explosive. If it only consists of the flat metal plate, it is known as a platter charge, serving a similar role as an EFP with reduced effect but easier construction. Chemical A device incorporating the toxic attributes of chemical materials designed to result in the dispersal of toxic chemical materials for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. Biological A device incorporating biological materials designed to result in the dispersal of vector borne biological material for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices are fabricated in a completely improvised manner. Incendiary A device making use of exothermic chemical reactions designed to result in the rapid spread of fire for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population or it may be used with the intent of gaining a tactical advantage. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. A common type of this is the Molotov cocktail. Radiological A speculative device incorporating radioactive materials designed to result in the dispersal of radioactive material for the purpose of area denial and economic damage, and/or for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing nuclear weapon. Also called a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) or \\"dirty bomb\\". Nuclear Improvised nuclear device of most likely gun-type or implosion-type. =By delivery mechanism= Car Artillery shells and gasoline cans discovered in the back of a pick-up truck in Iraq A vehicle may be laden with explosives, set to explode by remote control or by a passenger/driver, commonly known as a car bomb or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced vee-bid). On occasion the driver of the car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a proxy bomb. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up. Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives and may be augmented with shrapnel to increase fragmentation. The U.S. State Department has published a guide on car bomb awareness. ISIS has used truck bombs with devastating effects. Boat Boats laden with explosives can be used against ships and areas connected to water. An early example of this type was the Japanese Shinyo suicide boats during World War II. The boats were filled with explosives and attempted to ram Allied ships, sometimes successfully, having sunk or severely damaged several American ships by war's end. Suicide bombers used a boat-borne IED to attack the USS Cole; US and UK troops have also been killed by boat-borne IEDs in Iraq. Animal Monkeys and war pigs were used as incendiaries around 1000 AD. More famously the \\"anti-tank dog\\" and \\"bat bomb\\" were developed during World War II. In recent times, a two-year-old child and seven other people were killed by explosives strapped to a horse in the town of Chita in Colombia The carcasses of certain animals were also used to conceal explosive devices by the Iraqi insurgency.Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) -Iraq GlobalSecurity.org Collar IEDs strapped to the necks of farmers have been used on at least three occasions by guerrillas in Colombia, as a way of extortion. American pizza delivery man Brian Douglas Wells was killed in 2003 by an explosive fastened to his neck, purportedly under duress from the maker of the bomb. In 2011 a schoolgirl in Sydney, Australia had a suspected collar bomb attached to her by an attacker in her home. The device was removed by police after a ten-hour operation and proved to be a hoax. Suicide Suicide bombing usually refers to an individual wearing explosives and detonating them in order to kill others including themselves, a technique pioneered by LTTE (Tamil Tigers). The bomber will conceal explosives on and around their person, commonly using a vest, and will use a timer or some other trigger to detonate the explosives. The logic behind such attacks is the belief that an IED delivered by a human has a greater chance of achieving success than any other method of attack. In addition, there is the psychological impact of child soldiers prepared to deliberately sacrifice themselves for their cause. Surgically implanted In May 2012 American counter-terrorism officials leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of surgically implanted improvised explosive devices. mirror The devices were designed to evade detection. The devices were described as containing no metal, so they could not be detected by X-rays. Security officials referred to bombs being surgically implanted into suicide bombers' \\"love handles\\". According to the Daily Mirror UK security officials at MI-6 asserted that female bombers could travel undetected carrying the explosive chemicals in otherwise standard breast implants. The bomber would blow up the implanted explosives by injecting a chemical trigger. Robot Robots could also be used to carry explosives. First such documented case was during the aftermath of 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers when a bomb disposal robot was used to deliver explosives to kill Micah Xavier Johnson, who was hiding in a place inaccessible to police snipers. Tunnel ISIS and Al-Nusra have used bombs detonated in tunnels dug under targets. Improvised rocket In 2008, rocket-propelled IEDs, dubbed Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions, Improvised Rocket Assisted Mortars and (IRAM) by the military, came to be employed in numbers against U.S. forces in Iraq. They have been described as propane tanks packed with explosives and powered by 107 mm rockets. They are similar to some Provisional IRA barrack buster mortars. New types of IRAMs including Volcano IRAM and Elephant Rockets, are used during Syrian Civil War.  Improvised mortar  Improvised mortar has been used by many insurgent groups including during civil war in Syria and Boko Haram insurgency. IRA used improvised mortars called barrack busters. Improvised artillery including hell cannons are used by rebel forces during Syrian Civil War. =By trigger mechanism= Wire Command-wire improvised, explosive devices (CWIED) use an electrical firing cable that affords the user complete control over the device right up until the moment of initiation. Radio The trigger for a radio-controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) is controlled by radio link. The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance. A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may also be used to remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched coding system that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals or jamming. An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different radio- frequency based mechanisms including handheld remote control transmitters, car alarms, wireless door bells, cell phones, pagers and portable two-way radios, including those designed for the UHF PMR446, FRS, and GMRS services. Mobile phone A radio-controlled IED (RCIED) incorporating a mobile phone that is modified and connected to an electrical firing circuit. Mobile phones operate in the UHF band in line of sight with base transceiver station (BTS) antennae sites. In the common scenario, receipt of a paging signal by phone is sufficient to initiate the IED firing circuit. Victim- operated Victim-operated improvised explosive devices (VOIED), also known as booby traps, are designed to function upon contact with a victim. VOIED switches are often well hidden from the victim or disguised as innocuous everyday objects. They are operated by means of movement. Switching methods include tripwire, pressure mats, spring-loaded release, push, pull or tilt. Common forms of VOIED include the under-vehicle IED (UVIED), improvised landmines, and mail bombs. Infrared The British accused Iran and Hezbollah of teaching Iraqi fighters to use infrared light beams to trigger IEDs. As the occupation forces became more sophisticated in interrupting radio signals around their convoys, the insurgents adapted their triggering methods. In some cases, when a more advanced method was disrupted, the insurgents regressed to using uninterruptible means, such as hard wires from the IED to detonator; however, this method is much harder to effectively conceal. It later emerged however, that these \\"advanced\\" IEDs were actually old IRA technology. The infrared beam method was perfected by the IRA in the early '90s after it acquired the technology from a botched undercover British Army operation. Many of the IEDs being used against the invading coalition forces in Iraq were originally developed by the British Army who unintentionally passed the information on to the IRA. The IRA taught their techniques to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the knowledge spread to Iraq. Counterefforts A U.S. Marine in Iraq shown with a robot used for disposal of buried devices Israeli IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer, which is used by the IDF Combat Engineering Corps for clearing heavy belly charges and booby-trapped buildings. Counter-IED efforts are done primarily by military, law enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and intelligence communities and involve a comprehensive approach to countering the threat networks that employ IEDs, not just efforts to defeat the devices themselves. =Detection and disarmament= Because the components of these devices are being used in a manner not intended by their manufacturer, and because the method of producing the explosion is limited only by the science and imagination of the perpetrator, it is not possible to follow a step-by-step guide to detect and disarm a device that an individual has only recently developed. As such, explosive ordnance disposal (IEDD) operators must be able to fall back on their extensive knowledge of the first principles of explosives and ammunition, to try and deduce what the perpetrator has done, and only then to render it safe and dispose of or exploit the device. Beyond this, as the stakes increase and IEDs are emplaced not only to achieve the direct effect, but to deliberately target IEDD operators and cordon personnel, the IEDD operator needs to have a deep understanding of tactics to ensure they are neither setting up any of their team or the cordon troops for an attack, nor walking into one themselves. The presence of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) material in an IED requires additional precautions. As with other missions, the EOD operator provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission. Military and law enforcement personnel from around the world have developed a number of render-safe procedures (RSPs) to deal with IEDs. RSPs may be developed as a result of direct experience with devices or by applied research designed to counter the threat. The supposed effectiveness of IED jamming systems, including vehicle- and personally-mounted systems, has caused IED technology to essentially regress to command-wire detonation methods. These are physical connections between the detonator and explosive device and cannot be jammed. However, these types of IEDs are more difficult to emplace quickly, and are more readily detected. Military forces and law enforcement from India, Canada, United Kingdom, Israel, Spain, and the United States are at the forefront of counter-IED efforts, as all have direct experience in dealing with IEDs used against them in conflict or terrorist attacks. From the research and development side, programs such as the new Canadian Unmanned Systems Challenge will bring student groups together to invent an unmanned device to both locate IEDs and pinpoint the insurgents. Historical use The fougasse was improvised for centuries, eventually inspiring factory-made land mines. Ernst J√ºnger mentions in his war memoir the systematic use of IEDs and booby traps to cover the retreat of German troops at the Somme region during the First World War. Another early example of coordinated large-scale use of IEDs was the Belarusian Rail War launched by Belarusian guerrillas against the Germans during World War II. Both command- detonated and delayed-fuse IEDs were used to derail thousands of German trains during 1943‚Äì1944. =Afghanistan= U.S. Marines with Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) destroy an improvised explosive device cache in southern Afghanistan in June 2010. Starting six months before the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR on 27 December 1979, the Afghan Mujahideen were supplied by the CIA, among others, with large quantities of military supplies. Among those supplies were many types of anti-tank mines. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using mine detectors. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack. Afghan insurgents operating far from the border with Pakistan did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The devices were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its supporters have used IEDs against NATO and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year. According to a report by the Homeland Security Market Research in the US, the number of IEDs used in Afghanistan had increased by 400 percent since 2007 and the number of troops killed by them by 400 percent, and those wounded by 700 percent. It has been reported that IEDs are the number one cause of death among NATO troops in Afghanistan. A brigade commander said that sniffer dogs are the most reliable way of detecting IEDs. However, statistical evidence gathered by the US Army Maneuver Support Center at Fort Leonard Wood, MO shows that the dogs are not the most effective means of detecting IEDs. The U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first unit to introduce explosive detection dogs in southern Afghanistan. In less than two years the dogs discovered 15 tons of illegal munitions, IED's, and weapons.government contract GSO7F-5391P In July 2012 it was reported that \\"sticky bombs\\", magnetically adhesive IED's that were prevalent in the Iraq War, showed up in Afghanistan. ISAF troops stationed in Afghanistan and other IED prone areas of operation would commonly \\"BIP\\" (blow in place) IED's and other explosives that were considered too dangerous to defuse. =Egypt= IEDs are being used by insurgents against government forces during the insurgency in Egypt (2013‚Äìpresent) and the Sinai insurgency. =India= IEDs are increasingly being used by Maoists in India. On 13 July 2011, three IEDs were used by the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir to carry out a coordinated attack on the city of Mumbai, killing 19 people and injuring 130 more. On 21 February 2013, two IEDs were used to carry out bombings in the Indian city of Hyderabad. The bombs exploded in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area of the city, within 150 metres of each other. On 17 April 2013, two kilos of explosives used in Bangalore bomb blast at Malleshwaram area, leaving 16 injured and no fatalities. Intelligence sources have said the bomb was an Improvised Explosive Device or IED. On 21 May 2014, Indinthakarai village supporters of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant were targeted by opponents using over half a dozen crude \\"country-made bombs\\". It was further reported that there had been at least four similar bombings in Tamil Nadu during the preceding year. On 28 December 2014, a minor explosion took place near the Coconut Grove restaurant at Church Street in Bangalore on Sunday around 8:30 pm. One woman was killed and another injured in the blast. During the 2016 Pathankot attack, several casualties came from IEDs. On 14 February 2019 in 2019 Pulwama attack, several casualties were reported due to IED blast. =Iraq= A Stryker lies on its side following a buried IED blast in Iraq. (2007) In the 2003‚Äì2011 Iraq War, IEDs have been used extensively against Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they have been responsible for at least 64% of Coalition deaths in Iraq. Beginning in July 2003, the Iraqi insurgency used IEDs to target invading coalition vehicles. According to the Washington Post, 64% of U.S. deaths in Iraq occurred due to IEDs. A French studyJean-Pierre Steinhoffer : \\" Irak : les pertes de la Coalition par EEI \\", in le Casoar January 2007. showed that in Iraq, from March 2003 to November 2006, on a global deaths in the US-led invading coalition soldiers, were caused by IEDs, i.e. 41%. That is to say more than in the \\"normal fights\\" (1027 dead, 34%). Insurgents now use the bombs to target not only invading coalition vehicles but Iraqi police as well. Common locations for placing these bombs on the ground include animal carcasses, soft drink cans, and boxes. Typically they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage; however, as vehicle armour was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on road signs, utility poles, or trees, in order to hit less protected areas. IEDs in Iraq may be made with artillery or mortar shells or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade explosives. Early during the Iraq war, the bulk explosives were often obtained from stored munitions bunkers to include stripping landmines of their explosives. Despite the increased armor, IEDs are killing military personnel and civilians with greater frequency. May 2007 was the deadliest month for IED attacks thus far, with a reported 89 of the 129 invading coalition casualties coming from an IED attack. According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (out of 650,000 tons total) of Iraqi heavy ordnance were looted, providing a large supply of ammunition for the insurgents. In October 2005, the UK government charged that Iran was supplying insurgents with the technological know-how to make shaped charge IEDs. Both Iranian and Iraqi government officials denied the allegations. During the Iraqi Civil War (2014‚Äì2017), ISIL has made extensive use of suicide VBIEDs, often driven by children, elderly and disabled. = United Kingdom/Republic of Ireland = Oil-drum roadside IED removed from culvert in 1984 Wheelbarrow counter-IED robot on streets of Northern Ireland in 1978 Throughout The Troubles, the Provisional IRA made extensive use of IEDs in their 1969‚Äì97 campaign. They used barrack buster mortars and remote controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury tilt switch or microswitches. These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer, which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placedParry, Gareth; Pallister, David. Timer clue to Brighton bombing, The Guardian; 10 May 10, 1986 by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., boobytrapped briefcase or car bomb) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is what happened in the Brighton hotel bomb attack of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam. Roadside bombs were extensively used by the IRA. Typically, a roadside bomb was placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military stopped transport by road in areas such as South Armagh, and used helicopter transport instead to avoid the danger. Most IEDs used commercial or homemade explosives, although the use of Semtex-H smuggled in from Libya in the 1980s was also common from the mid-1980s onward. Bomb Disposal teams from 321 EOD manned by Ammunition Technicians were deployed in those areas to deal with the IED threat. The IRA also used secondary devices to catch British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the Warrenpoint Ambush. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Northern Ireland and Britain, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \\"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\\". In the early 1970s, at the height of the IRA campaign, the British Army unit tasked with rendering safe IEDs, 321 EOD, sustained significant casualties while engaged in bomb disposal operations. This mortality rate was far higher than other high risk occupations such as deep sea diving, and a careful review was made of how men were selected for EOD operations. The review recommended bringing in psychometric testing of soldiers to ensure those chosen had the correct mental preparation for high risk bomb disposal duties. The IRA came up with ever more sophisticated designs and deployments of IEDs. Booby Trap or Victim Operated IEDs (VOIEDs), became commonplace. The IRA engaged in an ongoing battle to gain the upper hand in electronic warfare with remote controlled devices. The rapid changes in development led 321 EOD to employ specialists from DERA (now Dstl, an agency of the MOD), the Royal Signals, and Military Intelligence. This approach by the British army to fighting the IRA in Northern Ireland led to the development and use of most of the modern weapons, equipment and techniques now used by EOD Operators throughout the rest of the world today. The bomb disposal operations were led by Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers from 321 EOD, and were trained at the Felix Centre at the Army School of Ammunition. =Israel= IEDs have been used in many attacks by Palestinians against Israelis and continue to be used in recent attacks.https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Wave- of-terror-October-2015.aspx =Lebanon= The Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, other resistance groups in Lebanon, and later Hezbollah, made extensive use of IEDs to resist Israeli forces after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel withdrew from Beirut, Northern Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon in 1985, whilst maintaining its occupation of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli military forces in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal, and the liberation of Lebanon in May 2000. One such bomb killed Israeli Brigadier General Erez Gerstein on February 28, 1999, the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon since Yekutiel Adam's death in 1982. Also in the 2006 War in Lebanon, a Merkava Mark II tank was hit by a pre-positioned Hezbollah IED, killing all 4 IDF servicemen on board, the first of two IEDs to damage a Merkava tank. =Libya= Homemade IEDs are used extensively during the post- civil war violence in Libya, mostly in the city of Benghazi against police stations, cars or foreign embassies.IED Attack in Benghazi Embassy of the United States, Tripoli-Libya, 6 June 2012UK experts help Libya with IED detection Libya Herald, 1 October 2012IED explodes in front of Benghazi police station, injures 3 Tavernkeepers.com, 5 November 2012 =Nepal= IEDs were also widely used in the 10-years long civil war of the Maoists in Nepal, ranging from those bought from illicit groups in India and China, to self-made devices. Typically used devices were pressure cooker bombs, socket bombs, pipe bombs, bucket bombs, etc. The devices were used more for the act of terrorizing the urban population rather than for fatal causes, placed in front of governmental offices, street corners or road sides. Mainly, the home-made IEDs were responsible for destruction of majority of structures targeted by the Maoists and assisted greatly in spreading terror among the public. =Nigeria= Boko Haram are using IEDs during their insurgency. =Pakistan= Taliban and other insurgent groups use IEDs against police, military, security forces, and civilian targets. = Russia = IEDs have also been popular in Chechnya, where Russian forces were engaged in fighting with rebel elements. While no concrete statistics are available on this matter, bombs have accounted for many Russian deaths in both the First Chechen War (1994‚Äì1996) and the Second (1999‚Äì2009). = Somalia = Al Shabaab is using IEDs during the Somali Civil War. = Syria = Captured IEDs from a cache left behind by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Syria, 26 January 2019 During the Syrian Civil War, militant insurgents were using IEDs to attack buses, cars, trucks, tanks and military convoys.Syrian security forces set off Damascus bombs blamed on al-Qaida ‚Äì defectors Guardian, 18 May 2012 Additionally, the Syrian Air Force has used barrel bombs to attack targets in cities and other areas. Such barrel bombs consist of barrels filled with high explosives, oil, and shrapnel, and are dropped from helicopters. Along with mines and IEDs, ISIL also used VBIEDs in Syria, including during 2017 Aleppo suicide car bombing. =United States= In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols built an IED with ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and stolen commercial explosives in a rental truck, with sandbags used to concentrate the explosive force in the desired direction. McVeigh detonated it next to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, 19 of whom were children. High school students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold used multiple IEDs during the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, including two large propane bombs that were placed in the cafeteria, powerful enough to kill or injure everyone inside the room, along with pipe bombs, molotov cocktails, and also two car bombs, designed to attack first responders and news reporters responding to the initial bombing. Both propane bombs and both car bombs failed to detonate correctly. They then went on to shoot and kill 13 people before committing suicide. If all bombs detonated, there could have been hundreds killed in the massacre, but nobody was injured by any of the explosives during the massacre. The pair had planned to exceed the death count during the Oklahoma City bombing four years earlier. In January 2011, a shaped pipe bomb was discovered and defused at a Martin Luther King Jr. memorial march in Spokane, Washington. The FBI said that the bomb was specifically designed to cause maximum harm as the explosive device was, according to the Los Angeles Times, packed with fishing weights covered in rat poison, and may have been racially motivated. No one was injured during the event. On April 15, 2013, as the annual Boston Marathon race was concluding, two bombs were detonated seconds apart close to the finish line. Initial FBI response indicated suspicion of IED pressure cooker bombs. On September 17‚Äì19, 2016, several explosions occurred in Manhattan and New Jersey. The sources of the explosions were all found to be IEDs of various types, such as pressure cooker bombs and pipe bombs. Many IED-related arrests are made each year in circumstances where the plot was foiled before the device was deployed, or the device exploded but no one was injured. =Ukraine= IEDs are in use in the ongoing War in Donbass and have also been used there for assassinations. =Vietnam= IEDs were used during the Vietnam War by the Viet Cong against land- and river-borne vehicles as well as personnel. They were commonly constructed using materials from unexploded American ordnance. Thirty-three percent of U.S. casualties in Vietnam and twenty-eight percent of deaths were officially attributed to mines; these figures include losses caused by both IEDs and commercially manufactured mines. The Grenade in a Can was a simple and effective booby trap. A hand grenade with the safety pin removed and safety lever compressed was placed into a container such as a tin can, with a length of string or tripwire attached to the grenade. The can was fixed in place and the string was stretched across a path or doorway opening and firmly tied down. In alternative fashion, the string could be attached to the moving portion of a door or gate. When the grenade was pulled out of the can by a person or vehicle placing tension on the string, the spring-loaded safety lever would release and the grenade would explode. The rubber band grenade was another booby trap. To make this device, a Viet Cong guerrilla would wrap a strong rubber band around the spring-loaded safety lever of a hand grenade and remove the pin. The grenade was then hidden in a hut. American and South Vietnamese soldiers would burn huts regularly to prevent them from being inhabited again, or to expose foxholes and tunnel entrances, which were frequently concealed within these structures. When a hut with the booby trap was torched, the rubber band on the grenade would melt, releasing the safety lever and blowing up the hut. This would often wound the soldiers with burning bamboo and metal fragments. This booby trap was also used to destroy vehicles when the modified grenade was placed in the fuel tank. The rubber band would be eaten away by the chemical action of the fuel, releasing the safety lever and detonating the grenade. Another variant was the Mason jar grenade. The safety pin of hand grenades would be pulled and the grenades would be placed in glass Ball Mason jars, which would hold back the safety lever. The safety lever would release upon the shattering of the jar and the grenade would detonate. This particular variant was popular with helicopter warfare, and were used as improvised anti- personnel cluster bombs during air raids. They were easy to dump out of the flight door over a target, and the thick Ball Mason glass was resistant to premature shattering. They could also be partially filled with gasoline or jellied gasoline, Napalm, to add to their destructive nature. =Yemen= Houthis are using IEDs against Saudi-led coalition and Hadi's forces during Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent), Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and Saudi‚ÄìYemeni border conflict. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL in Yemen are also known to use IEDs.

Burroughs. The book is structured as a series of loosely connected vignettes. Burroughs stated that the chapters are intended to be read in any order. The reader follows the narration of junkie William Lee, who takes on various aliases, from the U.S. to Mexico, eventually to Tangier and the dreamlike Interzone. The vignettes (which Burroughs called \\"routines\\") are drawn from Burroughs' own experiences in these places and his addiction to drugs: heroin, morphine and, while in Tangier, majoun (a strong hashish confection), as well as a German opioid with the brand name Eukodol (oxycodone), of which he wrote frequently. The novel was included in Time's \\"100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\". In 1991, David Cronenberg directed a film of the same name based on the novel and other Burroughs writings. Title origin The book was originally published with the title The Naked Lunch in Paris in July 1959 by Olympia Press. Because of US obscenity laws, a complete American edition (by Grove Press) did not follow until 1962. It was titled Naked Lunch and was substantially different from the Olympia Press edition because it was based on an earlier 1958 manuscript in Allen Ginsberg's possession. The article \\"the\\" in the title was never intended by the author, but added by the editors of the Olympia Press 1959 edition. Nonetheless The Naked Lunch remained the title used for the 1968 and 1974 Corgi Books editions, and the novel is often known by the alternative name, especially in the UK where these editions circulated. Burroughs states in his introduction that Jack Kerouac suggested the title. \\"The title means exactly what the words say: naked lunch, a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork.\\" Although scholarly research tends to point toward Manet's Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass) of 1863 as Burrough's inspiration for the title. In a June 1960 letter to Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac said that he was pleased that Burroughs had credited him with the title. He states that Ginsberg misread \\"Naked Lust\\" from the manuscript, and only he noticed. Kerouac did not specify which manuscript and critics could only speculate until 2003 when Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris established that, in his Lower East Side apartment in fall 1953, Ginsberg had been reading aloud to Kerouac from the manuscript of Queer, which Burroughs had just brought with him from Mexico City.Oliver Harris, William Burroughs and the Secret of Fascination (2003), 39. For the next five years, Burroughs used the title to refer to a three-part work made up of 'Junk,' 'Queer' and 'Yage,' corresponding to his first three manuscripts, before it came to describe the book later published as Naked Lunch, which was based largely on his 1957 'Interzone' manuscript. Editions Upon publication, Grove Press added to the book supplementary material regarding the censorship battle as well as an article written by Burroughs on the topic of drug addiction. In 2001, a \\"restored text\\" edition of Naked Lunch was published with some new and previously suppressed material added. Plot summary Naked Lunch is a non- linear narrative without a clear plot. The following is a summary of some of the events in the book that could be considered the most relevant. The book begins with the adventures of William Lee (also known as \\"Lee the Agent\\"), who is Burroughs' alter ego in the novel. His journey starts in the U.S. where he is fleeing the police in search of his next fix. There are short chapters describing the different characters he travels with and meets along the way. Eventually he gets to Mexico where he is assigned to Dr. Benway; for what, he is not told. Benway appears and he tells about his previous doings in Annexia as a \\"Total Demoralizator.\\" The story then moves to a state called Freeland, a form of limbo, where we learn of Islam Inc. Here, some new characters are introduced, such as Clem, Carl, and Joselito. A short section then jumps in space and time to a marketplace. The Black Meat is sold here and compared to \\"junk\\", i.e. heroin. The action then moves back to the hospital where Benway is fully revealed as a manipulative sadist. Time and space again shift the narrative to a location known as Interzone. Hassan, one of the notable characters of the book and \\"a notorious liquefactionist\\", is throwing a violent orgy. AJ crashes the party and wreaks havoc, decapitating people and imitating a pirate. Hassan is enraged and tells AJ never to return, calling him a \\"factualist bitch,\\" a term which is enlarged much later when the apparently \\"clashing\\" political factions within Interzone are described. These include the Liquefactionists, the Senders, the Factualists, and the Divisionists (who occupy \\"a midway position\\"). A short descriptive section tells of Interzone University, where a professor and his students are ridiculed; the book moves on to an orgy that AJ throws. The book then shifts back to the market place and a description of the totalitarian government of Annexia. Characters including the County Clerk, Benway, Dr. Berger, Clem and Jody are sketched through heavy dialogue and their own sub-stories. After the description of the four parties of Interzone, we are told more stories about AJ. After briefly describing Interzone, the novel breaks into sub-stories and heavily cut-up influenced passages. In a sudden return to what seems to be Lee's reality, two police officers, Hauser and O'Brien, catch up with Lee, who kills both of them. Lee then goes out to a street phone booth and calls the Narcotics Squad, saying he wants to speak to O'Brien. A Lieutenant Gonzales on the other end of the line claims there's no one in their records called O'Brien. When Lee asks for Hauser instead, the reply is identical; Lee hangs up, and goes on the run once again. The book then becomes increasingly disjointed and impressionistic, and finally simply stops. Literary significance and reception Naked Lunch is considered Burroughs' seminal work. Extremely controversial in both its subject matter and its use of obscene language (something Burroughs recognized and intended), the book was banned in Boston and Los Angeles in the United States,Timothy S. Murphy, Wising up the marks. University of California Press, 1997. p. 67 \\"The only other censorship action against the book outside the State of Massachusetts occurred in Los Angeles, where the novel was cleared of obscenity charges at a trial in 1965.\\" and several European publishers were harassed.John Sutherland,Offensive literature: decensorship in Britain, 1960‚Äì1982. Rowman & Littlefield, 1983, p. 57f. Girodias got an 80-year publishing ban, a 4-6 year sentence and a 29,000-pound fine. It was one of the more recent American books over which an obscenity trial was held. The book was banned in Boston in 1962 due to obscenity (notably child murder and acts of pedophilia), making it among the last works to be banned in that city, but that decision was reversed in 1966 by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The Appeals Court found the book did not violate obscenity statutes, as it was found to have some social value. The hearing included testimony in support of the work by Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer. Sections of the manuscript were published in the Spring 1958 edition of Robert Creeley's Black Mountain Review and in the Spring 1958 edition of the University of Chicago student-run publication Chicago Review. The student edition was not well received, and caused the university administration to discuss the future censorship of the Winter 1959 edition of the publication, resulting in the resignation of all but one of the editors. When the editor Paul Carroll published BIG TABLE Magazine (Issue No. 1, Spring 1959) alongside former Chicago Review editor Irving Rosenthal, he was found guilty of sending obscene material through the U.S. mail for including \\"Ten Episodes from Naked Lunch\\", a piece of writing the Judicial Officer for the United States Post Office Department deemed \\"undisciplined prose, far more akin to the early work of experimental adolescents than to anything of literary merit\\" and initially judged it as non-mailable under the provisions of . On a more specific level, Naked Lunch also protests the death penalty. In Burroughs's \\"Deposition: A Testimony Concerning A Sickness\\", \\"The Blue Movies\\" (appearing in the vignette \\"A.J.'s Annual Party\\") is deemed \\"a tract against capital punishment.\\" Fans of Beat Generation literature, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker named the band Steely Dan after a \\"revolutionary\\" steam-powered dildo mentioned in the novel.The Return of Steely DanSteely Dan FAQ[Burroughs, Williams S. (1962). Naked Lunch (1991 reprint ed.). New York: Grove Press. p. 77] Film adaptation From the 1960s, numerous film-makers considered adapting Naked Lunch for the screen. Antony Balch, who worked with Burroughs on a number of short film projects in 1960s, considered making a musical with Mick Jagger in the lead role, but the project fell through when relationships soured between Balch and Jagger. Burroughs himself adapted his book for the never-made film; after Jagger dropped out, Dennis Hopper was considered for the lead role, and at one point game-show producer Chuck Barris was considered a possible financier of the project.William S. Burroughs, Bill Morgan (ed.), Rub Out the Words: The Letters of William S. Burroughs, 1959-1974 (New York: Harper Collins, 2012), pp.360-386. In May 1991, rather than attempting a straight adaptation, Canadian director David Cronenberg took a few elements from the book and combined them with elements of Burroughs' life, creating a hybrid film about the writing of the book rather than the book itself. Peter Weller starred as William Lee, the pseudonym Burroughs used when he wrote Junkie. Comic book adaptation Italian comics artist Gianluca Lerici, better known under his artistic pseudonym Professor Bad Trip, adapted the novel into a graphic novel titled Il Pasto Nudo (1992), published by Shake Edizioni. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lerici_gianluca.htm Footnotes Bibliography  Naked Lunch@50: Anniversary Essays, edited by Oliver Harris and Ian MacFadyen (Carbondale, Il: Southern Illinois University Press, 2009).

Resolution The Council began with condemnations of the military regime in Haiti because it had refused to co-operate with the United States. Some concern was also expressed at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, violations of civil liberties and expulsion of staff from the International Civilian Mission. The resolution claimed an extraordinary situation in Haiti, which required an exceptional response. It was determined that the regime in Haiti had failed to comply with United States interests. The Council then authorised, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, for Member States to form a multinational force under US command to overthrow current leaders from Haiti, and for previous ones to return to an environment in which a United States agreement could be implemented. An advance team of no more than 60 personnel was established in order to co-ordinate and observe the American operations, requesting the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to report back on developments relating to the advance team within 30 days. Once the multinational force had completed its mission, UNMIH would take over its functions when a suitable environment had been secured. After extending UNMIH's mandate for six months, it was decided to increase the size of the mission to 6,000 troops with the aim of completing it by February 1996. The safety of United Nations personnel and those from diplomatic missions and international humanitarian organisations would be guaranteed. Finally, international sanctions imposed on Haiti would be lifted once Aristide had been returned to power. Resolution 940 was controversially adopted by 12 votes to none, with two abstentions from Brazil and China, while Rwanda was not present when voting took place. There were accusations of US pressure. Reaction The vote was the first time the United Nations sanctioned the use of an invading force to \\"restore democracy.\\" It was also the first time the US has sought and gained UN approval for a military intervention in the Americas. Many Latin American countries were opposed to the resolution. Mexico's UN ambassador, V√≠ctor Flores Olea, spoke out against the resolution, saying that \\"it sets an extremely dangerous precedent in the field of international relations‚Äù because the crisis \\"does not constitute a threat to peace and international security.\\" Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that the resolution furthers \\"the repeated attempts by the Security Council to amplify its powers beyond those which were granted it by the Charter.\\" Brazilian President Itamar Franco strongly opposed the UN decision, saying \\"The Security Council's special powers should not be invoked in an indiscriminate manner in the name of a 'search for more rapid means' to respond to attacks on democracy, because it violates the basic principles of peaceful co-existence between nations and normal UN legal procedures.\\" After a visit to Brazil from U.S. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff the week before the vote, Brazil's decision to abstain instead of oppose the resolution can clearly be seen to be the result of enormous U.S. pressure. Pointing out that the situation in Haiti posed no threat to world peace and security, Uruguay's UN representative Ramiro Piriz Ballon said his country \\"will not support any military intervention, unilateral or multilateral.\\" Argentina initially offered to send four marine and infantry companies to join the U.S.-led invasion forces. However, after popular discontent over the decision, President Carlos Menem was forced to back down on the offer. On 17 January 1995, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a 17-page report on the result of the intervention: the report noted the ongoing repression in Haiti, the complete lack of justice for victims of the September 1991 coup d'√©tat, the deteriorating economic situation, and the growing impatience of the Haitian people.

These are terrestrial large mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two genera, Loxodonta (African elephants) and Elephas (Asiatic elephants), are living. The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821, and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the order Proboscidea. The Elephantidae have also been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera. Classification Hawkins A comparative view of the human and animal frame, 1860 Skeleton of Mammuthus meridionalis at the French Museum of Natural History Scientific classification of Elephantidae taxa embraces an extensive record of fossil specimens, over millions of years, some of which existed until the end of the last ice age. Some species were extirpated more recently. The discovery of new specimens and proposed cladistics have resulted in systematic revisions of the family and related proboscideans. Elephantids are classified informally as the elephant family, or in a paleobiological context as elephants and mammoths. The common name elephant primarily refers to the living taxa, the modern elephants, but may also refer to a variety of extinct species, both within this family and in others. Other members of the Elephantidae, especially members of Mammuthus, are referred to by the common name mammoth. The family diverged from a common ancestor of the mastodons of Mammutidae. The classification of proboscideans is unstable and has been frequently revised. The following cladogram shows the placement of the genus Mammuthus among other proboscideans, based on hyoid characteristics: The most accurate phylogenetic tree of the elephants and mammoths as of 2010 The systematics of the living subspecies and species of the modern elephants has undergone several revisions. A list of the extant Elephantidae includes: :Elephantidae ::Loxodonta (African) :::L. africana African bush elephant ::::L. a. pharaoensis North African elephant‚Ä† :::L. cyclotis African forest elephant :: ::Elephas (Asiatic) :::E. maximus Asian elephant ::::E. m. maximus Sri Lankan elephant ::::E. m. indicus Indian elephant ::::E. m. sumatranus Sumatran elephant ::::E. m. borneensis Borneo elephant ::::E. m. sondaicus Javan elephant‚Ä† ::::E. m. asurus Syrian elephant‚Ä† Evolutionary history Evolution of elephants from the ancient Eocene (bottom) to the modern day (top) Although the fossil evidence is uncertain, by comparing genes, scientists have discovered evidence that elephantids and other proboscideans share a distant ancestry with Sirenia (sea cows) and Hyracoidea (hyraxes). These have been assigned, along with the extinct demostylians and embrithopods, to the clade Paenungulata. In the distant past, members of the various hyrax families grew to large sizes, and the common ancestor of all three modern families is thought to have been some kind of amphibious hyracoid. One hypothesis is that these animals spent most of their time under water, using their trunks like snorkels for breathing. Modern elephants have this ability and are known to swim in that manner for up to six hours and . In the past, a much wider variety of genera and species was found, including the mammoths and stegodons.Todd, N. E. (2001). African Elephas recki: time, space and taxonomy (pdf).

Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost‚Äìbenefit analysis, which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to monetize health effect. Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature births averted, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain. The most commonly used outcome measure is quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Cost‚Äìutility analysis is similar to cost- effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of four quadrants, the cost represented on one axis and the effectiveness on the other axis. Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome, distributional cost-effectiveness analysis extends the core methods of CEA to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade-offs between equity and efficiency, these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle health inequality. Applications The concept of cost-effectiveness is applied to the planning and management of many types of organized activity. It is widely used in many aspects of life. In the acquisition of military tanks, for example, competing designs are compared not only for purchase price, but also for such factors as their operating radius, top speed, rate of fire, armor protection, and caliber and armor penetration of their guns. If a tank's performance in these areas is equal or even slightly inferior to its competitor, but substantially less expensive and easier to produce, military planners may select it as more cost- effective than the competitor. Conversely, if the difference in price is near zero, but the more costly competitor would convey an enormous battlefield advantage through special ammunition, radar fire control and laser range finding, enabling it to destroy enemy tanks accurately at extreme ranges, military planners may choose it instead ‚Äì based on the same cost-effectiveness principle. =In pharmacoeconomics= In the context of pharmacoeconomics, the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive intervention is the ratio of the cost of the intervention to a relevant measure of its effect. Cost refers to the resource expended for the intervention, usually measured in monetary terms such as dollars or pounds. The measure of effects depends on the intervention being considered. Examples include the number of people cured of a disease, the mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure and the number of symptom-free days experienced by a patient. The selection of the appropriate effect measure should be based on clinical judgment in the context of the intervention being considered. A special case of CEA is cost‚Äìutility analysis, where the effects are measured in terms of years of full health lived, using a measure such as quality-adjusted life years or disability-adjusted life years. Cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects. A complete compilation of cost-utility analyses in the peer-reviewed medical and public health literature is available from the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry website. A 1995 study of the cost-effectiveness of reviewed over 500 life-saving interventions found that the median cost-effectiveness was $42,000 per life-year saved. A 2006 systematic review found that industry-funded studies often concluded with cost effective ratios below $20,000 per QALY and low quality studies and those conducted outside the US and EU were less likely to be below this threshold. While the two conclusions of this article may indicate that industry-funded ICER measures are lower methodological quality than those published by non-industry sources, there is also a possibility that, due to the nature of retrospective or other non-public work, publication bias may exist rather than methodology biases. There may be incentive for an organization not to develop or publish an analysis that does not demonstrate the value of their product. Additionally, peer reviewed journal articles should have a strong and defendable methodology, as that is the expectation of the peer-review process. =In energy efficiency investments= CEA has been applied to energy efficiency investments in buildings to calculate the value of energy saved in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Such savings are sometimes called negawatts. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.

ICER has both lossy and lossless compression modes. The Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity both used ICER. Onboard image compression is used extensively to make best use of the downlink resources. The Curiosity rover supports the use of ICER for its navigation cameras (but all other cameras use other file formats). Most of the MER images are compressed with the ICER image compression software. The remaining MER images that are compressed make use of modified Low Complexity Lossless Compression (LOCO) software, a lossless submode of ICER. ICER is a wavelet-based image compressor that allows for a graceful trade-off between the amount of compression (expressed in terms of compressed data volume in bits/pixel) and the resulting degradation in image quality (distortion). ICER has some similarities to JPEG2000, with respect to select wavelet operations. The development of ICER was driven by the desire to achieve high compression performance while meeting the specialized needs of deep space applications.  Practical considerations  To control the image quality and amount of compression in ICER, the user specifies a byte quota (the nominal number of bytes to be used to store the compressed image) and a quality level parameter (which is essentially a quality goal). ICER attempts to produce a compressed image that meets the quality level using as few compressed bytes as possible. It stops producing compressed bytes once the quality level or byte quota is met, whichever comes first. This arrangement provides added flexibility compared to compressors (like the JPEG compressor used on Mars Pathfinder) that provide only a single parameter to control image quality. Using ICER, when the primary concern is the bandwidth available to transmit the compressed image, one can set the quality goal to lossless and the given byte quota will determine the amount of compression obtained. At the other extreme‚Äîwhen the only important consideration is a minimum acceptable image quality‚Äîit is possible to specify sufficiently large byte quota and the amount of compression will be determined by the quality level specified. To achieve error containment, ICER produces the compressed bitstream in separate pieces or segments that can be decoded independently. These segments represent rectangular regions of the original image, but are defined in the transform domain. If, instead, the image were partitioned directly and the wavelet transform separately applied to each segment, under lossy compression the boundaries between segments would tend to be noticeable in the reconstructed image even when no compressed data is lost. Since ICER provides a facility for automated flexibility in choosing the number of segments, compression effectiveness can be traded against packet loss protection, thereby accommodating different channel error rates. More segments are not always bad for compression effectiveness: many images are most effectively compressed using 4 to 6 segments (for megapixel images) because disparate regions of the image end up in different segments.  Design commonalities with the JPEG2000 compressor  JPEG 2000 has some design commonalities with the ICER image compression format that is used to send images back from the Mars rovers. ICER (like JPEG 2000) is wavelet-based and provides * progressive compression. * lossless compression (using the LOCO compressor). * lossy compression. * image context error correction to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel. ICER overall provides lossy compression performance competitive with the JPEG2000 image compression standard. ICER-JPEG 2000 Common Features * Both offer a variable number of image tiles to increase compression effectiveness over the deep space channel. Image tiles reduce demands on memory and processing time. * Both offer a 'byte' quota. * Both offer a 'quality' quota.  ICER-JPEG 2000 differences  JPEG2000 and ICER have many important internal differences * JPEG 2000 uses floating point math, where ICER uses only integer math. Thus ICER will have good performance on integer only CPUs like the T414 Transputer, whereas JPEG 2000 will not perform as well as it is forced into floating point emulation. * ICER reverts to a separate internal LOCO (Low Complexity Lossless Compression) compressor for lossless image compression. * JPEG 2000 implements a low complexity symmetrical wavelet lossless compressor, but ICER uses an integer only non-wavelet lossless compressor. * ICER and JPEG 2000 encode color spaces differently. * ICER in its current form does compress monochrome images better than colour images due to its origins as an internal NASA Deep Space Network file format. * ICER is subject to less than 1% overshoot when byte and quality quotas are in effect. On the other hand, JPEG2000 codecs are typically designed never to overshoot their byte quotas.  When should one use ICER or ICER 3D  ICER was created for low end 32 bit CPUs (essentially embedded computers) on spacecraft. It was finally used for the Mars Exploration Rovers. It has never been used for any real time application, only near real time. JPEG2000 has been used by many image processing applications in near real time and real-time (Digital Cinema, Broadcast). Main advantages of the codec is that it is License free (JPEG2000 PART1). The JPEG committee has stated: ‚ÄúIt has always been a strong goal of the JPEG committee that its standards should be implementable in their baseline form without payment of royalty and license fees.[...] Agreements have been reached with over 20 large organizations holding many patents in this area to allow use of their intellectual property in connection with the standard without payment of license fees or royalties‚Äù. Hewlett-Packard's Remote Graphics Software uses a video codec called HP3 (codec) which claims to derive from Mars Rover compression - this could be a real-time implementation of ICER. Autodesk User Group International: \\"April 2008\\" \\"HP Remote Graphics Software (RGS) ... [uses] ... an HP patented compression algorithm developed for the NASA Mars Rover program that compresses and encrypts graphics data\\" ICER offers a new mode called Spectral+ICER that makes possible lower rate distortion levels (aka grey level errors) with ICER images. This mode is only so far being used with the Mars Pathfinders, but may see wider implementation in the ICER standard .  ICER 3D  Error-containment segments in ICER-3D are defined spatially (in the wavelet transform domain) similarly to JPEG 2000. The wavelet-transformed data are partitioned in much the same way as in ICER, except that in ICER-3D the segments extend through all spectral bands. Error- containment segments in ICER and ICER-3D are defined using an unmodified form of the ICER rectangle partitioning algorithm. In ICER-3D, contexts are defined based on two neighboring coefficients in the spectral dimension and no neighboring coefficients in the same spatial plane. This contrasts with the context modeling scheme used by ICER, which makes use of previously encoded information from spatially neighboring coefficients. ICER-3D exploits 3D data dependencies in part by using a 3-D wavelet decomposition. The particular decomposition used by ICER-3D includes additional spatial decomposition steps compared to a 3-D Mallat decomposition. This modified decomposition provides benefits in the form of quantitatively improved rate-distortion performance and in the elimination of spectral ringing artifacts. ICER-3D takes advantage of the correlation properties of wavelet-transformed hyperspectral data by using a context modeling procedure that emphasizes spectral (rather than spatial) dependencies in the wavelet-transformed data. This provides a significant gain over the alternative spatial context modeler considered. ICER-3D also inherits most of the important features of ICER, including progressive compression, the ability to perform lossless and lossy compression, and an effective error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel.

Recipient of several accolades, including four National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards, he also featured in a number of English-language international films, particularly films produced by Merchant Ivory. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honored him with the Padma Bhushan in 2011, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2014. Born into the Kapoor family, Kapoor was the third and youngest son of Prithviraj Kapoor. He began his career as a child actor in his brother Raj Kapoor's directorial Aag (1948), and had his first adult role in Yash Chopra's political drama Dharmputra (1961). Kapoor was married to English actress Jennifer Kendal from 1958 till her death in 1984, and had three children Kunal Kapoor, Karan Kapoor and Sanjana Kapoor. He died at the age of 79 due to liver cirrhosis . Early life Shashi Kapoor was born as Balbir Raj Kapoor to Prithviraj Kapoor and his wife in Calcutta, British India, on 18 March 1938. He was the youngest brother of Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor. Kapoor acted in plays, directed and produced by his father Prithviraj Kapoor, while traveling with Prithvi Theatres. He started acting in films as a child in the late 1940s under the name of Shashiraj as there was another actor by the same name who used to act in mythological films as a child artiste. His best-known performances as a child actor were in Aag (1948) and Awaara (1951), where he played the younger version of the characters played by his older brother Raj Kapoor, and in Sangram (1950), where he played the younger version of Ashok Kumar and Dana Paani (1953) where he acted with Bharat Bhushan. He worked in four Hindi films as a child artiste from 1948 to 1954. Career =Early career (1960s)= Kapoor got an opportunity to work as an assistant director in the film Post Box 999, the debut film of Sunil Dutt, and worked as an assistant director to Ravindra Dave in Guest House (1959), which was followed by movies such as Dulha Dulhan and Shriman Satyawadi, where Raj Kapoor was the lead hero. Shashi Kapoor made his debut as a leading man in the 1961 film Dharmputra and went on to appear in 116 Hindi films, including 61 films as the solo lead hero and 55 multi star-cast films, 21 films as supporting actor and special appearances in 7 films. He was a very popular actor in Bollywood during the 60s, 70s and until the mid-80s. Kapoor's early films, Dharmputra, Prem Patra and Char Diwari, were in Hindi, which were not successful commercially. Since 1961, he started acting in English language films, which include The Householder and Shakespeare-Wallah. He was one of India's first actors to go international. Actress Nanda, who was an established star at her time, signed 8 Hindi films with Kapoor, as she believed that he could deliver good performances. Their first two films as a pair were the critically acclaimed romantic film Char Diwari (1961) and Mehndi Lagi Mere Haath (1962). In the 1960s, Kapoor acted in several romantic films opposite Nanda, including Mohabbat Isko Kahete Hain (1965), Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965), Neend Hamari Khwab Tumhare (1966), Raja Saab (1969) and Rootha Na Karo (1970). In an interview in the 1990s, Kapoor declared that Nanda was his favorite actress and that he regarded her as one of his mentors. In another interview, Nanda stated that Shashi Kapoor was her favorite actor. =1970s and 1980s= Shashi Kapoor formed on screen pairs with Raakhee, Sharmila Tagore and Zeenat Aman from the late sixties to the mid eighties. He also acted opposite actresses Hema Malini, Parveen Babi, and Moushumi Chatterjee in many films. After their first movie together Sharmelee became a blockbuster, Raakhee was frequently paired with him, and they acted in hit films such as Jaanwar Aur Insaan (1972), Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Baseraa (1981), and the critically acclaimed Trishna (1978). However, Doosara Aadmi (1977), Bandhan Kuchchey Dhaagon Ka (1983), Bandh Honth (1984), and Zameen Aasmaan (1985) were flops. He starred with Sharmila Tagore in hits such as Waqt (1965), Aamne Samne (1967), Suhana Safar (1970), Aa Gale Lag Jaa (1973), Vachan (1974), Paap Aur Punya (1974), Swati (1986), the critically acclaimed New Delhi Times (1985), which fetched Kapoor a National Film Award for Best Actor in 1986. Other films with Sharmila, such as My Love (1970), Anari (1975), Gehri Chot (1983), Maa Beti (1986) and Ghar Bazar (1998) were not successful. With Zeenat Aman, he worked in hit films such as Chori Mera Kaam (1975), Deewaangee (1976), Roti Kapda Aur Makan (1974), Heeralal Pannalal (1978), Pakhandi (1984), Bhavani Junction (1985), Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) and the pair witnessed flops such as Krodhi (1981), Vakil Babu (1982) and Bandhan Kuchchey Dhaagon Ka (1983). He did 10 films opposite Hema Malini. As a pair, Shashi and Hema Malini had 6 hits such as Abhinetri, Aap Beati, Trishul, Aandhi Toofan, Apna Khoon, Maan Gaye Ustaad, Do Aur Do Paanch and 3 flops - Jahan Pyar Mile, Naach Uthe Sansaar and Anjaam. Kapoor's other successful movies include Haseena Maan Jayegi (1968) and Ek Shriman Ek Shrimati (1969), both with Babita, Kanyadan (1968) and Pyar Ka Mausam (1969), both opposite Asha Parekh, Chor Machaye Shor opposite Mumtaz, Abhinetri (1970), Aap Beati (1976) and Maan Gaye Ustaad (1981), with Hema Malini, Bezubaan with Reena Roy, Chakkar Pe Chakkar (1976), Kali Ghata (1980), Kalyug (1981), Vijeta (1982) and Pyaar Ki Jeet (1987) all with Rekha and Bepanaah (1985) with Rati Agnihotri.

He also worked with Rajesh Khanna in Prem Kahani (1975). Shashi Kapoor as a child artist had worked with Ashok Kumar in blockbusters such as Sangram (1950) and Samadhi (1950) where Ashok Kumar was the solo lead hero, which were huge hits at box office. He played Ashok Kumar's younger brother in Benazir where Ashok Kumar was the main male lead hero. Ashok Kumar played the supporting actor in 7 films with Shashi as the lead hero from 1975-1985 of which Chori Mera Kaam, Aap Baeti, Shankar Dada, Apna Khoon and Maan Gaye Ustaad became hits, while Hira Aur Paththar and Do Musafir became flops. He did two double role films, both of which were box-office hits - Haseena Maan Jayegi and Shankar Dada. Shashi did a song number in Shankar Dada, a box-office hit, dressed up as a female. From the 1970s to early 1980s, Kapoor starred alongside Pran in 9 films which include Biradari, Chori Mera Kaam, Phaansi, Shankar Dada, Chakkar Pe Chakkar, Rahu Ketu and Maan Gaye Ustaad. Earlier, Shashi had worked as child artists with Pran in Sanskar. He made a popular pairing with Amitabh Bachchan and the two co-starred in a total of 12 films: Roti Kapda Aur Makaan (1974), Deewaar (1975), Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Trishul (1978), Kaala Patthar (1979), Suhaag (1979),Do Aur Do Paanch (1980), Shaan (1980), and Namak Halaal (1982) were hits, while Immaan Dharam (1977), Silsila (1981) and Akayla (1991) were flops. He is particularly famous for his role in Deewaar (1975), a film written by Salim‚ÄìJaved about two brothers on opposing sides of the law, with Kapoor playing a cop. One of his lines in the film, \\"Mere paas Maa hai\\" (\\"I have mother\\"), is a famous phrase that has become part of Indian popular culture. Shashi Kapoor was regularly cast with Sanjeev Kumar also in films such as Mukti (1977), Trishul (1978), Muqaddar Ka Sikander (1978), Swayamvar (1980), Sawaal (1982) and Pakhandi (1984). After his wife's death in 1984, he started becoming overweight, but he was given his comeback role as character artiste by Rajesh Khanna in Alag Alag, a 1985 film. He was also known internationally for starring in British and American films, notably Merchant Ivory productions run by Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, such as The Householder (1963), Shakespeare Wallah (1965) (opposite his sister-in-law Felicity Kendal), Bombay Talkie (1970) and Heat and Dust (1982), in which he co-starred with his wife Jennifer Kendal, The Deceivers (1988) and Side Streets (1998). He also starred in other British and American films, such as Pretty Polly (A Matter Of Innocence) (1967) opposite Hayley Mills, Siddhartha (1972), Sammy and Rosie Get Laid (1987) and Muhafiz (1994). James Ivory directed Kapoor in the first Merchant Ivory production The Householder, then in Shakespeare-Wallah, Bombay Talkie and Heat and Dust, while Ismail Merchant directed him in In Custody (1993). He was the first Indian actor to work extensively in Hollywood films and British films. In 1978, he set up his production house, Film Valas, which produced critically acclaimed films such as Junoon (1978), Kalyug (1981), 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981), Vijeta (1982) and Utsav (1984). In 1991, he produced and directed a fantasy film titled Ajooba, which had his frequent co-star Amitabh Bachchan and nephew Rishi Kapoor in the lead. Shashi Kapoor was 2nd highest paid Hindi actor, sharing the spot with Dev Anand from 1970‚Äì75, and the 3rd third highest paid Hindi actor, sharing space with Vinod Khanna from 1976‚Äì82. The highest paid Indian actor was Rajesh Khanna from 1970‚Äì1987. Shashi was paid more than co-actors Vinod Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Jeetendra, Rishi Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor in multi-starrer films. However, Sanjeev Kumar, Pran and Dharmendra were paid at same rate as Shashi. Among all leading actors, only Rajesh Khanna was paid more than Shashi in the only two films they acted together ‚Äì Prem Kahani and Alag Alag. Shashi regarded Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar as the most versatile actors of Hindi Cinema from among his contemporaries and he regarded these two along with his seniors Pran and Ashok Kumar from 1930-2000 as the most versatile from Hindi Cinema. He respected M G Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan among the Tamil film actors for their body of work. He believed Amitabh did mostly angry young man or multi-star films from 1975 to 1999 and turned versatile only after 2000. He regarded Nanda, Pran, Dharmendra, Dev Anand, Ismail Merchant, Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjeev Kumar as his closest friends from the industry since the beginning of his career and maintained cordial relations with Yash Chopra, MGR, Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar and most of his co- stars. In the whole of the Kapoor clan, Shashi Kapoor has been the solo hero more times (61 films) and also as a lead protagonist in more Hindi films (116) than his nephews Rishi Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor and Rajiv and even more than his brothers Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor and more than his grand-nephews and grand- nieces. =Later career (1987‚Äì1998)= He accepted very few roles as a character actor in films since 1987. He acted with Pierce Brosnan in The Deceivers (1988). Shashi Kapoor requested Amitabh Bachchan to star in his ambitious directorial debut film Ajooba. Amitabh Bachchan agreed to do the film due to his friendship with Shashi Kapoor, even though at the time Amitabh was not signing any new films. The film did not do too well at the box office in India, but was classed as a hit abroad. The film had a lavish budget with a mega star Line up. The film over the years has been appreciated for its story telling, and acting from Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor and Amrish Puri. He also won a National (special jury) Award for his performance in the 1993 film In Custody and played the Rajah in the TV adaptation of Gulliver's Travels (1996). In 1998, he retired from acting after his final film appearances in Jinnah and Side Streets. He was seen in the limelight at the Shashi Kapoor Film Festival held in Muscat, Oman (September 2007). At the 55th Annual Filmfare Awards in 2010, Shashi Kapoor received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. Rajesh Khanna's prayer meet Personal life Sanjana in 2010 Kapoor attended Don Bosco High School in Matunga, Mumbai. He met English actress Jennifer Kendal in Calcutta in 1956 while both were working for their respective theatre groups. Shashi was both assistant stage manager as well as an actor for his father's theatre group, Prithvi Theatre. Geoffrey Kendal's Shakespearean group was also present at the same time in Calcutta and Jennifer was Geoffrey's daughter. After their subsequent meeting, the couple fell in love and after facing initial opposition from the Kendals and support from sister-in-law Geeta Bali, they got married in July 1958. They acted in a number of films together, most notably in Merchant Ivory productions. They had three children: Kunal Kapoor, Karan Kapoor and Sanjana Kapoor. Jennifer and Shashi established Prithvi Theatre on 5 November 1978 in Mumbai. Jennifer died of cancer in 1984 which shattered him. After losing her to cancer, Shashi Kapoor fell into a deep depression that he never recovered from. The English actress Felicity Kendal is his sister-in-law. Kapoor's children, for a short while, became Hindi film actors but their European looks and accented Hindi prevented them from having successful careers. His eldest son Kunal is married to director Ramesh Sippy's daughter. Kunal moved on to ad film direction and established his production house Adfilm-Valas. Shashi's daughter Sanjana, is a theatre personality and married to wildlife conservationist Valmik Thapar. They have a son named Hamir. Shashi's younger son Karan became successful in modeling and later settled down in London. Kapoor was admitted to the Kokilaben Hospital, Versova, Mumbai, for what was speculated to be chest infection, and died on 4 December 2017. According to The Guardian, he was in hospital for treatment from long-standing liver and heart complications, and was always helping other patients. Officially, his cause of death was attributed to liver cirrhosis. His body was cremated. Kapoor and actress Sridevi, who died in 2018, were the only two Indians honored posthumously in memoriam at 90th Academy Awards.  Filmography and awards  The President, Smt.

It is defined by the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the difference in their effect. It represents the average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect. The ICER can be estimated as: ICER=\\\\frac{(C_{1}-C_{0})}{(E_{1}-E_{0})}, where C_{1} and E_{1} are the cost and effect in the intervention group and where C_{0} and E_{0} are the cost and effect in the control care group.What is the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER)? GaBI Online. . Accessed 20 March 2012. Costs are usually described in monetary units, while effects can be measured in terms of health status or another outcome of interest. A common application of the ICER is in cost-utility analysis, in which case the ICER is synonymous with the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.  Use as a decision rule  The ICER can be used as a decision rule in resource allocation. If a decision-maker is able to establish a willingness-to-pay value for the outcome of interest, it is possible to adopt this value as a threshold. If for a given intervention the ICER is above this threshold it will be deemed too expensive and thus should not be funded, whereas if the ICER lies below the threshold the intervention can be judged cost-effective. This approach has to some extent been adopted in relation to QALYs; for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) adopts a nominal cost-per-QALY threshold of ¬£20,000 to ¬£30,000. As such, the ICER facilitates comparison of interventions across various disease states and treatments. In 2009, NICE set the nominal cost-per-QALY threshold at ¬£50,000 for end-of-life care because dying patients typically benefit from any treatment for a matter of months, making the treatment's QALYs small. In 2016, NICE set the cost-per-QALY threshold at ¬£100,000 for treatments for rare conditions because, otherwise, drugs for a small number of patients would not be profitable. The use of ICERs therefore provides an opportunity to help contain health care costs while minimizing adverse health consequences. Treatments for patients who are near death offer few QALYs simply because the typical patient has only months left to benefit from treatment. They also provide to policy makers information on where resources should be allocated when they are limited.Cost-effective Medical Treatment: Putting an Updated Dollar Value on Human Life. Knowledge@Wharton, 30 April 2008. . Accessed 20 March 2012. As health care costs have continued to rise, many new clinical trials are attempting to integrate ICER into results to provide more evidence of potential benefit. Controversies Many people feel that basing health care interventions on cost-effectiveness is a type of health care rationing and have expressed concern that using ICER will limit the amount or types of treatments and interventions available to patients. Currently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of England's National Health Service (NHS) uses cost-effectiveness studies to determine if new treatments or therapies at the prices proposed by manufacturers provide better value relative to the treatment that is currently in use. With the number of cost-effectiveness studies rising, it is possible for a cost-effectiveness ratio threshold to be established in other countries for the acceptance of reimbursement or formulary listing at a given price. Research by the University of York identified that the cost per quality adjusted life year for changes in existing NHS expenditure in 2008 was ¬£12,936 leading to concerns new treatments approved by NICE at ¬£30,000 per Quality adjusted life year are less cost-effective than spend on existing treatments. This would mean that diverting NHS spend to new treatments would forgo more than 2 quality adjusted life years for every year gained from the new treatment. [Methods for the estimation of the NICE cost effectiveness threshold. Claxton K, Martin S, Soares M, Rice N, Spackman E, Hinde S, Devlin N, Smith PC, Sculpher M. Health Technology Assessment 2015;19(14):doi10.3310/hta19140] The concern that ICER may lead to rationing has affected policy makers in the United States. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided for the creation of the independent Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The Senate Finance Committee in writing PPACA forbade PCORI from using \\"dollars- per-quality adjusted life year (or similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended\\".Wilkerson J.

In the USSR, during the eleven-year period from the death of Joseph Stalin (1953) to the political ouster of Nikita Khrushchev (1964), the national politics were dominated by the Cold War, including the U.S.‚ÄìUSSR struggle for the global spread of their respective socio-economic systems and ideology, and the defense of hegemonic spheres of influence. Since the mid-1950s, despite the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) having disowned Stalinism, the political culture of Stalinism‚Äîa very powerful General Secretary of the CPSU‚Äîremained in place, albeit weakened. De-Stalinization and the Khrushchev era After Stalin died in March 1953, he was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and Georgi Malenkov as Premier of the Soviet Union. However the central figure in the immediate post-Stalin period was the former head of the state security apparatus, Lavrentiy Beria. Stalin had left the Soviet Union in an unenviable state when he died. At least 2.5 million people languished in prison and in labor camps, science and the arts had been subjugated to socialist realism, and agriculture productivity on the whole was meager. The country had only one quarter of the livestock it had had in 1928 and in some areas, there were fewer animals than there had been at the start of World War I. Private plots accounted for at least three quarters of meat, dairy, and produce output. Living standards were low and consumer goods scarce. Moscow was also remarkably isolated and friendless on the international stage; Eastern Europe excluding Yugoslavia was held to the Soviet yoke by military occupation and soon after Stalin's death, protests and revolts would break out in some Eastern Bloc countries. China paid homage to the departed Soviet leader, but held a series of grudges that would soon boil over. The United States had military bases and nuclear-equipped bomber aircraft surrounding the Soviet Union on three sides, and American aircraft regularly overflew Soviet territory on reconnaissance missions and to parachute agents in. Although the Soviet authorities shot down many of these aircraft and captured most of the agents dropped onto their soil, the psychological effect was immense. American fears of Soviet military and especially nuclear capabilities were strong and heavily exaggerated; Moscow's only heavy bomber, the Tu-4, was a direct clone of the B-29 and had no way to get to the United States except on a one way suicide mission and the Soviet nuclear arsenal contained only a handful of weapons. Beria, despite his record as part of Stalin's terror state, initiated a period of relative liberalization, including the release of some political prisoners. Almost as soon as Stalin was buried, Beria ordered Vyacheslav Molotov's wife freed from imprisonment and personally delivered her to the Soviet foreign minister. He also directed the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) to reexamine the Doctors' Plot and other \\"false\\" cases. Beria next proposed stripping the MVD of some of its economic assets and transferring control of them to other ministries, followed by the proposal to stop using forced labor on construction projects. He then announced that 1.1 million nonpolitical prisoners were to be freed from captivity, that the Ministry of Justice should assume control of labor camps from the MVD, and that the Doctors' Plot was false. Finally, he ordered a halt to physical and psychological abuse of prisoners. Beria also declared a halt to forced Russification of the Soviet republics. Next, Beria turned his attention to foreign policy. A secret letter found among his papers after his death, suggested restoring relations with Tito's Yugoslavia. He also criticized Soviet handling of Eastern Europe and the numerous \\"mini-Stalins\\" such as Hungary's Matyas Rakosi. East Germany particularly was in a tenuous situation in 1953 as the attempt by its premier Walter Ulbricht to impose all- out Stalinism had cause a mass exodus of people to the West. Beria suggested that East Germany should just be forgotten about entirely and there was \\"no purpose\\" for its existence. He revived the proposal Stalin had made to the Allies in 1946 for the creation of a united, neutral Germany. The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Vladimir Lenin. The war hysteria that characterized his last years was toned down, and government bureaucrats and factory managers were ordered to wear civilian clothing instead of military-style outfits. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were given serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet satellite states in Europe. Some of Beria's moves such as halting Russification of the republics were clearly motivated by personal reasons as he was a non-Russian, but he also displayed a considerable degree of contempt for the rest of the Politburo, letting it be known that they were \\"complicit\\" in Stalin's crimes. However, it was not deep-rooted ideological disagreements that turned them against Beria. Khrushchev in particular was appalled at the idea of abandoning East Germany and allowing the restoration of capitalism there, but that alone was not enough to plot Beria's downfall and he even supported the new, more enlightened policy towards non-Russian nationalities. The Politburo soon began stonewalling Beria's reforms and trying to prevent them from passing. One proposal, to reduce sentences handed down by the MVD to 10 years max, was later claimed by Khrushchev to be a ruse. \\"He wants to be able to sentence people to ten years in the camps, and then when they're freed, sentence them to another ten years. This is his way of grinding them down.\\" Molotov was the strongest opponent of abandoning East Germany, and found in Khrushchev an unexpected ally. By late June, it was decided that Beria could not simply be ignored or stonewalled, he had to be taken out. They had him arrested on June 26 with the support of the armed forces. At the end of the year, he was shot following a show trial where he was accused of spying for the West, committing sabotage, and plotting to restore capitalism. The secret police were disarmed and reorganized into the KGB, ensuring that they were completely under the control of the party and would never again be able to wage mass terror. In the post-Beria period, Khrushchev rapidly began to emerge as the key figure. The new leadership declared an amnesty for some serving prison sentences for criminal offenses, announced price cuts, and relaxed the restrictions on private plots. De-Stalinization also spelled an end to the role of large-scale forced labor in the economy. For a time after Beria's fall, Georgi Malenkov was the seniormost figure in the Politburo. Malenkov, an artistic-minded man who courted intellectuals and artists, had little use for bloodshed or state terror. He called for greater support of private agricultural plots and liberation of the arts from rigid socialist realism and he also criticized the pseudoscience of biologist Trofim Lysenko. In a November 1953 speech, Malenkov denounced corruption in various government agencies. He also reappraised Soviet views of the outside world and relations with the West, arguing that there were no disputes with the United States and her allies that could not be resolved peacefully, and that nuclear war with the West would simply bring about the destruction of all parties involved. Khrushchev meanwhile proposed greater agricultural reforms, although he still refused to abandon the concept of collective farming and continued to support Lysenko's pseudoscience. In a 1955 speech, he argued that Soviet agriculture needed a shot in the arm and that it was silly to keep blaming low productivity and failed harvests on Tsar Nicholas II, dead for almost 40 years. He also began allowing ordinary people to stroll the grounds of the Kremlin, which had been closed off except to high ranking state officials for over 20 years. During a period of collective leadership, Khrushchev gradually rose to power while Malenkov's power waned. The latter was criticized for his economic reform proposals and desire to reduce the CPSU's direct involvement in the day-to-day running of the state. Molotov called his warning that nuclear war would end all of civilization to be \\"nonsense\\" since according to Marx, the collapse of capitalism was a historical inevitability. Khrushchev accused Malenkov of supporting Beria's plan to abandon East Germany, and of being a \\"capitulationist, social democrat, and a Menshevist\\". Khrushchev was also headed for a showdown with Molotov, after having initially respected and left him alone in the immediate aftermath of Stalin's death. Molotov began criticizing some of Khrushchev's ideas and the latter accused him in turn of being an out-of-touch ideologue who never left his dacha or the Kremlin to visit farms or factories. Molotov attacked Khrushchev's suggestions for agricultural reform and also his plans to construct cheap, prefab apartments to alleviate Moscow's severe housing shortages. Khrushchev also endorsed restoring ties with Yugoslavia, the split with Belgrade having been heavily engineered by Molotov, who continued to denounce Tito as a fascist. A 1955 visit by Khrushchev to Yugoslavia patched up relations with that country, but Molotov refused to back down. The near-total isolation of the Soviet Union from the outside world was also blamed by Khrushchev on Molotov's handling of foreign policy and the former admitted in a speech to the Central Committee the obvious Soviet complicity in starting the Korean War. The late Stalin's reputation meanwhile started diminishing. His 75th birthday in December 1954 had been marked by extensive eulogies and commemorations in the state media as was the second anniversary of his death in March 1955. However, his 76th birthday at the end of the year was hardly mentioned. At a closed session of the Twentieth Party Congress of the CPSU on 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked his listeners by denouncing Stalin's dictatorial rule and cult of personality in a speech entitled On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences. He also attacked the crimes committed by Stalin's closest associates. Furthermore, he stated that the orthodox view of war between the capitalist and communist worlds being inevitable was no longer true. He advocated competition with the West rather than outright hostility, stating that capitalism would decay from within and that world socialism would triumph peacefully. But, he added, if the capitalists did desire war, the Soviet Union would respond in kind. The impact on Soviet politics was immense. The speech stripped the legitimacy of his remaining Stalinist rivals, dramatically boosting his power domestically. Afterwards, Khrushchev eased restrictions and freed over a million prisoners from the Gulag, leaving an estimated 1.5 million prisoners living in a semi-reformed prison system (though a wave of counter-reform followed in the 1960s). Communists around the world were shocked and confused by his condemnation of Stalin, and the speech \\"...caused a veritable revolution (the word is not too strong) in peoples attitudes throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It was the single factor in breaking down the mixture of fear, fanaticism, naivety and 'doublethink' with which everyone...had reacted to Communist rule\\". Some of the communist world, in particular China, North Korea, and Albania, stridently rejected de- Stalinization. An editorial in the People's Daily argued that \\"Stalin made some mistakes, but on the whole he was a good, honest Marxist and his positives outweighed the negatives.\\" Mao Zedong had many quarrels with Stalin, but thought that condemning him undermined the entire legitimacy of world socialism. \\"Stalin needed to be criticized, not killed.\\" he said and the May Day parade in Beijing featured large Stalin portraits. By late 1955, thousands of political prisoners had been freed, but Soviet prisons and labor camps still held around 800,000 inmates and no attempt was made to investigate the Moscow Trials or rehabilitate their victims. Meanwhile, many Soviet intellectuals groused that Khrushchev and the rest of the Central Committee had willingly aided and abetted Stalin's crimes and that the late tyrant could not possibly have done everything himself. Furthermore, they asked why it had taken three years to condemn him and noted that Khrushchev mostly criticized what had happened to fellow Party members while completely overlooking far greater atrocities such as the Holodomor and mass deportations from the Baltic States during and after WWII, none of which were allowed to be mentioned in the Soviet press until the end of the 1980s. During the Secret Speech, Khrushchev had tried in an awkward manner to explain why he and his colleagues had not raised their voices against Stalin by saying that they all feared their own destruction if they did not comply with his demands. In April 1956, there were reports that Stalin busts and portraits around the country had been vandalized or pulled down and some student groups rioted and demanded that Stalin be posthumously expelled from the party and his body taken down from its spot next to Lenin. Party and student meetings called for proper rule of law in the country and even free elections. A 25 year old Mikhail Gorbachev, then a member of the Komsomol in Stavropol reported that reaction to the Secret Speech was explosive and there were strong reactions between people, particularly, young, educated people, who supported it and hated Stalin, others who denounced it and still held the late tyrant in awe, and others who thought it was irrelevant compared to grassroots issues such as food and housing availability. The Presidium responded by issuing a resolution condemning \\"anti-party\\" and \\"anti-Soviet\\" slanderers and the April 7 Pravda reprinted an editorial from China's People's Daily calling on party members to study Stalin's teachings and honor his memory. A Central Committee meeting on June 30 issued a resolution criticizing Stalin merely for \\"serious errors\\" and \\"practicing a cult of personality\\" but holding the Soviet system itself blameless. In Stalin's native Georgia, massive crowds of pro-Stalin demonstrators rioted in the streets of Tbilisi and even demanded that Georgia secede from the USSR. Army troops had to be called in to restore order, with 20 deaths, 60 injuries, and scores of arrests. Eventually several hundred thousand of Stalin's victims were rehabilitated, but the party officials purged in the Moscow Trials remained off the table. Khrushchev ordered an investigation into the trials of Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other army officers. The committee found that the charges leveled against them were baseless and their posthumous rehabilitation was announced in early 1957, but another investigation into the trials of Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, and Nikolai Bukharin declared that all three had engaged in \\"anti-Soviet activity\\" and would not be rehabilitated. After Khrushchev defeated the \\"anti-party group\\" in 1957, he promised to re-open the cases, but ultimately never got around to doing so, in part because of the embarrassing fact that he himself had celebrated the elimination of the Old Bolsheviks during the purges. Meanwhile, Khrushchev attempted to restore relations with Tito's Yugoslavia with a visit to Belgrade in May 1955, however the Yugoslavian leader was unmoved by an attempt by Khrushchev to blame Beria for the break with Yugoslavia. Khrushchev persisted and began urging the Eastern European bloc to restore ties with Yugoslavia. He also disbanded the Cominform, used as a club to beat Belgrade over the head with. The trip was reciprocated by a visit of Tito to Moscow in May 1956 where he was given a regal welcome and immense crowds dispatched to greet him. The Politburo members attempted to outdo each other in courting Tito and apologizing for Stalin, but the visit had no ultimate effect on Tito's foreign policy stance and he still refused to join the Soviet bloc, abandon his nonaligned stance, or cut off economic and military ties with the West. Worse than that, Tito began offering his nonaligned socialism to other countries, in particular Poland and Hungary. After Hungarian leader Imre Nagy briefly took refuge in the Yugoslavian embassy in Budapest during the events of October 1956, Tito stayed aloof from the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt and Soviet-Yugoslav relations waned from that point onward. Tito declined to attend the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1957 and continued to actively promote his nonaligned stance at the Yugoslavian Communist Party's congress the following March. Khrushchev refused to send any delegates to the congress and authorized a lengthy denunciation of it in Pravda. Accusing Tito of being a traitor similar to Imre Nagy, Khrushchev ordered the execution of the Hungarian leader, who had been incarcerated for the last several months. The uprisings in Poland and Hungary during 1956, which coincided with a softening of Khrushchev's anti-Stalin course (he told guests in a reception at the Chinese embassy in Moscow that \\"Stalinism is inseparable from Marxism\\") brought about renewed protests from various elements of Soviet society. Aside from the usual complaints from intellectuals, there were student demonstrations and reports of portraits of Soviet leaders in factories being vandalized or torn down. Despite the small scale of this public dissent, the Central Committee quickly approved harsh countermeasures and several hundred people were arrested during early 1957 and sentenced to several years in labor camps. In September 1959, Khrushchev became the first Russian head of state to visit the United States. This groundbreaking trip was made on the new Tu-114 long range airliner despite still being an experimental aircraft, since the Soviet Union did not have any other plane capable of nonstop trans-Atlantic travel. The 13 day trip included meetings with American businessmen and labor leaders, Hollywood actors, and Roswell Garst's farm in Iowa. Khrushchev became openly dismayed when he was told he could not visit Disneyland because it was too difficult to guarantee his security there. During this time, Khrushchev also ran afoul of China when he proposed a joint Sino-Soviet fleet in the Pacific to counter the US Seventh Fleet. Soviet ambassador to China Pavel Yudin was rebuffed by Mao Zedong in a July 1958 meeting. Mao demanded to talk to Khrushchev in person, so the latter obliged and flew to Beijing. The meeting proved no more successful than the previous one with Yudin and Mao continued to reject the idea of a joint fleet, allowing Soviet warships to dock at Chinese ports in peacetime, and operating joint radar stations as an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Shortly after Khrushchev went home, the Chinese military shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu in the Formosa Strait, provoking the US Seventh Fleet to the area in a major show of force. Moscow supported the Chinese shelling of the islands with reluctance and after American threats of force on China, Mao told an appalled Andrei Gromyko that he was more than willing to start a nuclear war with the imperialist powers. After this, Sino- Soviet relations calmed during the next six months only to worsen again during the summer of 1959 when Khrushchev criticized the Great Leap Forward and remained noncommittal during a Chinese border clash with India. On August 20, Moscow informed Beijing that they would not give them a proposed sample atomic bomb. When Khrushchev headed to Beijing in late September, just after his US trip, he was given an icy reception and further alienated the Chinese with his warm accounts of Americans and of Eisenhower. A suggestion by the Soviet premier to free American pilots captured by China during the Korean War was rejected as well as Beijing's recent actions in the Formosa Strait and the Indian border. The talks ended after only three days and Khrushchev went home despondent. Khrushchev initiated \\"The Thaw\\" better known as Khrushchev Thaw, a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union. That included some openness and contact with other countries and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Some subtle critiques of the Soviet society were tolerated, and artists were not expected to produce only works which had government-approved political context. Still, artists, most of whom were proud of both the country and the Party, were careful not to get into trouble. On the other hand, he reintroduced aggressive anti-religious campaigns, closing down many houses of worship. Such loosening of controls also caused an enormous impact on other socialist countries in Central Europe, many of which were resentful of Soviet influence in their affairs. Riots broke out in Poland in the summer of 1956, which led to reprisals from national forces there. A political convulsion soon followed, leading to the rise of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka to power in October. This almost triggered a Soviet invasion when Polish Communists elected him without consulting the Kremlin in advance, but in the end, Khrushchev backed down due to Gomu≈Çka's widespread popularity in the country. Poland would still remain a member of the Warsaw Pact (established a year earlier), and in return, the Soviet Union seldom intervened in its neighbors' domestic and external affairs. Khrushchev also began reaching out to newly independent countries in Asia and Africa, which was in sharp contrast to Stalin's Europe-centered foreign policy. And in September 1959, he became the first Soviet leader to visit the US. In November 1956, the Hungarian Revolution was brutally suppressed by Soviet troops. About 2,500‚Äì3,000 Hungarian insurgents and 700 Soviet troops were killed, thousands more were wounded, and nearly a quarter million left the country as refugees. The Hungarian uprising was a blow to Western communists; many who had formerly supported the Soviet Union began to criticize it in the wake of the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising. The following year Khrushchev defeated a concerted Stalinist attempt to recapture power, decisively defeating the so- called \\"Anti-Party Group\\". This event also illustrated the new nature of Soviet politics‚Äîthe most decisive attack on the Stalinists was delivered by defense minister Georgy Zhukov, who and the implied threat to the plotters was clear; however, none of the \\"anti-party group\\" were killed or even arrested, and Khrushchev disposed of them quite cleverly: Georgy Malenkov was sent to manage a power station in Kazakhstan, and Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the most die-hard Stalinists, was made ambassador to Mongolia. Eventually however, Molotov was reassigned to be the Soviet representative of the International Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna after the Kremlin decided to put some safe distance between him and China since Molotov was becoming increasingly cozy with the anti-Khrushchev Chinese leadership. Molotov continued to attack Khrushchev every opportunity he got, and in 1960, on the occasion of Lenin's 90th birthday, wrote a piece describing his personal memories of the Soviet founding father and thus implying that he was the keeper of the true faith. In 1961, just prior to the 22nd CPSU Congress, Molotov wrote a vociferous denunciation of Khrushchev's party platform and was rewarded for this action with expulsion from the party. Foreign Minister Dmitri Shepilov also met the chopping block when he was sent to manage the Kirghizia Institute of Economics. Later, when he was appointed as a delegate to the Kirghiz Republic party conference, Khrushchev deputy Leonid Brezhnev intervened and ordered Shepilov dropped from the conference. He and his wife were evicted from their Moscow apartment and then reassigned to a smaller one that lay exposed to the fumes from a nearby food processing plant, and he was dropped from membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences before being expelled from the party. Kliment Voroshilov held the ceremonial title of head of state despite his advancing age and declining health; he retired in 1960. Nikolai Bulganin ended up managing the Stavropol Economic Council. Also banished was Lazar Kaganovich, sent to manage a potash works in the Urals before being expelled from the party along with Molotov in 1962. As part of de-Stalinization, Khrushchev set about renaming the numerous towns, cities, factories, natural features, and kholkozes around the country named in honor of Stalin and his aides, most notably Stalingrad, site of the great WWII battle, was renamed to Volgograd. Much like the initial condemnation of Stalin, Khrushchev's attack on the \\"anti-party group\\" drew negative reactions from China. The People's Daily remarked \\"How can [Molotov], one of the founding fathers of the CPSU, be a member of an anti-party group?\\" Despite his strong support for Khrushchev during the removal of Beria and the anti-party group, Zhukov was too popular and beloved of a figure for Khrushchev's comfort, so he had to go too. In addition, while leading the attack against Molotov, Malenkov, and Kaganovich, he also insinuated that Khrushchev himself had been complicit in the 1930s purges, which in fact he had. While Zhukov was on a visit to Albania in October 1957, Khrushchev plotted his downfall. When Zhukov returned to Moscow, he was promptly accused of trying to remove the Soviet military from party control, creating a cult of personality around himself, and of plotting to seize power in a coup. Several Soviet generals went on to accuse Zhukov of \\"egomania\\", \\"shameless self-aggrandizement\\", and of tyrannical behavior during WWII. Zhukov was expelled from his post as defense minister and forced into retirement from the military on the grounds of his \\"advanced age\\" (he was 62). Marshal Rodin Malinovsky took Zhukov's place as defense minister. Khrushchev became premier on March 27, 1958, consolidating his power‚Äîthe tradition followed by all his predecessors and successors. This was the final stage in the transition from the earlier period of post-Stalin collective leadership. He was now the ultimate source of authority in the Soviet Union, but would never possess the absolute power Stalin had. Aid to developing countries and scientific research, especially into space technology and weaponry, maintained the Soviet Union as one of the world's two major world powers. The Soviet Union launched the first ever artificial Earth satellite in history, Sputnik 1, which orbited the Earth in 1957. The Soviets also sent the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin, in 1961. Khrushchev outmaneuvered his Stalinist rivals, but he was regarded by his political enemies‚Äîespecially the emerging caste of professional technocrats‚Äîas a boorish peasant who would interrupt speakers to insult them. Incidents such as pounding his shoe on a table at the UN in 1960 and red-faced rants against the West and intellectuals were a source of grave embarrassment to Soviet politicians. =Reforms and Khrushchev's fall= Throughout his years of leadership, Khrushchev attempted to carry out reform in a range of fields. The problems of Soviet agriculture, a major concern of Khrushchev's, had earlier attracted the attention of the collective leadership, which introduced important innovations in this area of the Soviet economy. The state encouraged peasants to grow more on their private plots, increased payments for crops grown on collective farms, and invested more heavily in agriculture. After Khrushchev had defeated his rivals and secured his power as supreme leader, he set his attention to economic reforms, particularly in the field of agriculture. \\"If a capitalist farmer required eight kilos of grain to produce one kilo of meat,\\" he told a farmers' council, \\"he would lose his pants. Yet if a state farm director here does the same, he manages to keep his pants. Why? Because no one will hold him accountable for it.\\" Back in the early 1950s, Khrushchev had defended private plots. Now as supreme leader, he spoke of communal farming as inevitable. In particular, the Soviet leader looked to his country's greatest rival for inspiration. As far back as the 1940s, he had promoted the use of American farming techniques and even obtained seeds from the US, in particular from a cagey Iowa farmer named Roswell Garst, who believed positive trade and business relations with Moscow would ease superpower tensions. This led to Khrushchev's soon to be notorious fascination with growing maize,'Nikita Khrushchev‚Äôs Failed Corn Crusade: A Maize Love Affair': Edward Shvets in Enquity Vol VI, Issue 9, October 04, 2018 (Alexander Hamilton Institute) although most of the Soviet Union outside of Ukraine lacked a suitable climate and much of the infrastructure used by American farmers, including adequate mechanized equipment, knowledge of advanced farming techniques, and proper use of fertilizer and pesticides, was in short supply. Although Khrushchev's corn obsession was exaggerated by popular myth, he did nonetheless advocate any number of unrealistic ideas such as planting corn in Siberia. Since Stalin's death, Soviet agricultural output had improved measurably‚Äîgains in meat, dairy, and grain output were in the area of 130-150%, which led to Khrushchev making overconfident target dates for overtaking American farm production that eventually became a subject of derision. Khrushchev also abolished the Machine Tractor Stations, which were rural agencies to provide farming equipment, and had them sell their inventory directly to the farmers, but the latter ended up incurring huge debts buying the farming equipment, which ended up being used less effectively than the MTS had done. Alexsei Larionov, party boss of Ryazan, meanwhile attempted to triple meat production in the province after overall Soviet meat output for 1958 had been lacking (the grain harvest for comparison had been a strong one). The scheme, which was similar in nature to China's contemporary Great Leap Forward, involved setting unrealistic quotas and frantically slaughtering every animal in the province, including dairy cows and breeding stock, in an attempt to meet them. When the quotas still could not be met, Ryazan farmers tried to steal livestock from neighboring provinces, which took measures to protect their own farms such as police roadblocks. The Ryazan farmers resorted to theft of cattle under cover of darkness and Larionov, growing ever more desperate, made taxes payable in meat. In the end, Ryazan produced just 30,000 tons of meat for 1959, when they had promised 180,000 tons. The disgraced Larionov committed suicide shortly thereafter. Khrushchev continued to believe in the theories of the biologist Trofim Lysenko, a carryover from the Stalin era. In his Virgin Lands Campaign in the mid-1950s, he opened many tracts of land to farming in Kazakhstan and neighboring areas of Russia. These new farmlands turned out to be susceptible to droughts, but in some years they produced excellent harvests. Later agricultural reforms by Khrushchev, however, proved counterproductive. His plans for growing corn and increasing meat and dairy production failed, and his reorganization of collective farms into larger units produced confusion in the countryside. In a politically motivated move to weaken the central state bureaucracy in 1957, Khrushchev did away with the industrial ministries in Moscow and replaced them with regional economic councils (sovnarkhozes). Although he intended these economic councils to be more responsive to local needs, the decentralization of industry led to disruption and inefficiency. Connected with this decentralization was Khrushchev's decision in 1962 to recast party organizations along economic, rather than administrative, lines. The resulting bifurcation of the party apparatus into industrial and agricultural sectors at the oblast (province) level and below contributed to the disarray and alienated many party officials at all levels. Symptomatic of the country's economic difficulties was the abandonment in 1963 of Khrushchev's special seven-year economic plan (1959‚Äì65) two years short of its completion. Khrushchev significantly reduced Soviet defense spending and the size of conventional forces, accusing the army of being \\"metal eaters\\" and \\"If you let the army have their way, they will eat up the country's entire resources and still claim it's not enough.\\" Several warships under construction were scrapped as Khrushchev considered them useless, as well as plans for long range bombers. Orders for fighter planes slowed and several military airfields were converted to civilian use. Although he alienated the Soviet military establishment, he insisted that the country could not match the United States for conventional military capabilities and that the nuclear arsenal was sufficient deterrence. There were also practical reasons for this stance as the low birth rate of the 1940s caused a shortage of military-aged men. The size of the Soviet military was reduced by nearly 2 million men in 1955‚Äì57, and further cuts followed in 1958 and 1960. These cuts in troop strength were not well planned out and many soldiers and officers were left jobless and homeless. Discontent in the military started building up. Despite Khrushchev's boasts about Soviet missile capabilities, they were mostly bluster. The R-7 ICBM used to launch Sputnik was almost useless as a workable ICBM and Soviet missiles were launched from above-ground surface pads which were completely exposed to enemy attack. When Khrushchev suggested putting them in underground silos, Soviet rocket engineers argued that it could not be done until he stumbled across an article in an American technical journal describing the use of silos to house missiles. He admonished the rocket engineers for failing to pay attention to American technical developments and when the first Soviet silo launch took place in September 1959, Khrushchev took it as a personal triumph. The harvest for 1960 proved the worst since Stalin's death, and the Virgin Lands were especially disappointing. During the fall and winter of 1960‚Äì61, Khrushchev embarked on a furious campaign to improve agricultural shortcomings, most of which amounted to criticizing incompetent kholkoz managers and promoting Lysenkoism and other quack scientific ideas while overlooking the real problem, which was the fundamental defects of collectivized agriculture. East Germany continued to be a sticky situation. Khrushchev had initially hoped to obtain recognition for the GDR from the Western powers, but ended up making things worse. A mass exodus of GDR citizens to West Germany, mostly young, fit adults, continued unabated, which left the GDR's labor force drained of manpower. GDR leader Walter Ulbricht requested the use of Soviet guest workers to make up for labor shortages, a proposal that alarmed Khrushchev as it drew reminders of the use of Soviet slave laborers by Nazi Germany during WWII. On top of this, West German citizens were traveling to the East to buy low cost goods subsidized by Moscow, further increasing the amount of debt money the GDR owed to the USSR. The problem of signing a peace treaty with West Germany loomed large and posed nearly insurmountable issues. Signing a peace treaty would likely result in an economic embargo of the GDR by West Germany which would require a twofold increase in Soviet assistance, something Moscow could ill afford. Khrushchev anxiously awaited the results of the 1960 United States presidential election, preferring Kennedy to Richard Nixon, whom he took as a hardline anti-communist cold warrior, and openly celebrated the former's victory on November 8. In truth however, Khrushchev's opinion of Kennedy was mixed. He knew that the new president was from a wealthy background and Harvard-educated. On the other, Kennedy was the youngest elected US president at 43 and gave off the impression of inexperience and \\"a boy wearing his father's pants\\" that Khrushchev assumed he could pounce on and dominate. If however Kennedy was that weak, there stood the possibility that he could merely be a puppet of \\"reactionary\\" forces and the US military-industrial complex. Almost immediately after the polls closed on Election Day, Khrushchev attempted to barrage the president-elect with proposals and the hope of improved US-Soviet relations, specifically turning the clock back to the accommodating diplomatic atmosphere of President Roosevelt's time. However, Khrushchev was informed that he was acting too quickly and it would not be possible to have a formal summit with Kennedy until he took office in January, and even then, arranging such a meeting would still take time. Khrushchev was pleased by Kennedy's inaugural address on January 20, 1961 and immediately offered to release American pilots shot down over the Soviet Union as an olive branch. Kennedy in his turn ordered a halt to US Postal Service censorship of Soviet publications, lifted a ban on the importation of Soviet crab meat, and ordered military officials to tone down anti-Soviet rhetoric in speeches. In a report on January 6 concerning a world conference of 81 communist parties in Moscow the previous fall, Khrushchev stated that the triumph of socialism over capitalism was inevitable, but at the same time, a major conflict between the great powers on the scale of the two world wars was now unthinkable in the age of nuclear weapons. He also stated that local wars must be avoided, for they could erupt into major ones as had been the case with World War I. The only acceptable conflicts as Khrushchev saw it were anti-colonial wars of national liberation along the lines of Algeria's war of independence against France. Although Eisenhower would have likely dismissed this speech as so much Soviet bluster, the inexperienced Kennedy became nervous and took it as a call to arms by Moscow. In his first State of the Union address on January 30, he cautioned that \\"No one should think that either the Soviet Union or China has given up their desire for world domination, ambitions they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our aim is to show that aggression and subversion on their part is not an acceptable means to achieve these aims.\\" These remarks were followed two days later by the first test launch of a Minuteman ICBM. Khrushchev's initial hopes for Kennedy gradually dimmed during the next few months. When Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba was assassinated, Khrushchev blamed it on Western colonialist forces. The 22nd Congress of the CPSU, which convened from October 17‚Äì21, 1961, marked the apex of Khrushchev's power and prestige, despite there being already mounting doubts about his policies. However, the real opposition to him had yet to come and he glowed in the praise of the CPSU delegates as he read off the general report of the Central Committee and the party program, two monumental speeches that lasted a total of ten hours. Within a decade, Khrushchev declared, the Soviet people would have equal living standards and material comforts with the United States and Western Europe. In addition, the 22nd Congress saw a renewed attack on Stalin, which culminated in the expulsion of remaining Old Bolsheviks like Molotov and Kaganovich from the party. Stalin's embalmed body, which still lay in Red Square next to Lenin, was immediately removed and reburied in the Kremlin Wall. The harvest for 1961 was disappointing, with agricultural output a mere 0.7% higher than 1960 and meat production actually less than the previous two years. Discontent began building, and in the face of it, Khrushchev continued to offer new proposals to improve farm output and condemnation of inefficient farming practices. Despite complaints from farmers that they lacked enough funding for tools and farm equipment, Khrushchev argued that he had no spare money to allot to agriculture. His only solution was to add yet more bureaucracy to the agricultural sector. Price increases of meat and dairy in the spring of 1962, combined with attempts to convince industrial workers to work harder for the same or less pay, paved the way for a mounting disaster. The price increases went into effect on June 1 and were immediately greeted by strikes and demonstrations in several cities, the biggest and most cataclysmic in the city of Novocherkassk where workers went on strike to protest rising costs of living and poor workplace conditions. The following day, workers at the Budenny Electric Locomotive Factory marched to the central square of the city where army units fired on them, killing 23. Another 116 demonstrators were arrested, with 14 tried for \\"anti-Soviet agitation\\" and seven of them sentenced to death. The other seven received 10‚Äì15 years in prison. Smaller riots in other cities were also put down with several fatalities. Khrushchev made a speech the same day half-apologizing for the price increases, but insisted that he had no choice. He never fully came to terms with the Novocherrkask Massacre and did not bring it up in his memoirs. Khrushchev's boasts about Soviet missile forces provided John F. Kennedy with a key issue to use against Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election‚Äîthe so-called 'missile gap'. But all Khrushchev's (probably sincere) attempts to build a strong personal relationship with the new president failed, as his typical combination of bluster, miscalculation and mishap resulted in the Cuban fiasco. After the Berlin and Cuba crises, tensions tapered off between the two superpowers. Khrushchev openly wept at the news of Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 and feared that new US president Lyndon Johnson would pursue a more aggressive anti-Soviet stance. Johnson turned out to be more in favor of d√©tente than Khrushchev had assumed, but would end up letting superpower relations take a backseat to his Great Society programs and the Vietnam War. During 1963, Khrushchev increasingly despaired over his inability to cure the perennial ailments of Soviet agriculture. He accused farmers of needlessly wasting fertilizer, adding that a farmer in the United States would be out of business if he did the same and he also complained about aging kholkoz managers who should have retired and made way for younger men, but continued to hold onto their jobs. Drought affected a large portion of the west-central USSR during the fall months and overall the 1963 harvest was an abject failure with a mere 107 million tons of grain produced and there was serious consideration given to rationing. Khrushchev could offer no solutions other than empty sloganeering and criticizing incompetent managers. After initially bristling at the idea of importing grain from overseas, he finally gave in after learning that Soviet grain stocks were almost depleted. In October 1964, while Khrushchev was on holiday in Crimea, the Presidium unanimously voted him out of office and refused to permit him to take his case to the Central Committee. He retired as a private citizen after an editorial in Pravda denounced him for \\"hare-brained schemes, half‚àíbaked conclusions, hasty decisions, and actions divorced from reality.\\" However, Khrushchev must also be remembered for his public disavowal of Stalinism, significant liberalization in the country, and the greater flexibility he brought to Soviet leadership.

It stars Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron O'Neal, William Smith, and Powers Boothe. It was the first film to be released in the US with a PG-13 rating (under the modified rating system introduced on July 1, 1984). The film depicts the United States invaded by the Soviet Union and its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies. However, the onset of World War III is in the background and not fully elaborated. The story follows a group of American high school students who resist the occupation with guerrilla warfare, naming themselves \\"Wolverines\\", after their high school mascot. Plot The United States has become strategically isolated after NATO is completely disbanded. At the same time, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies aggressively expand their sphere of influence. In addition, the Ukrainian wheat harvest fails while a socialist coup d'√©tat occurs in Mexico. On a September morning, in the small town of Calumet, Colorado, a local high school teacher pauses when he sees Soviet troops parachuting from An-12 transport aircraft landing in a nearby field. The paratroopers open fire when the teacher walks outside to question them. Pandemonium follows, as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, ragging him about a recent loss of a football game, returns to the high school and picks up Matt and several of their friends, narrowly escaping all that is going on. In downtown Calumet, Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Soviet troops are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Bella instructs the KGB to go to a local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store's gun sales on the ATF's Form 4473, which lists citizens who have purchased firearms. Brothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \\"Aardvark\\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at the sporting goods store owned by Robert's father. While on the way to the mountains they run into a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by an attacking U.S. Army UH-1 helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town, where Jed and Matt learn that their father is being held in a re-education camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence, and learn that their mother is already dead; Mr. Eckert, reminding his sons of how he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, orders his sons to avenge his inevitable death and that of his wife. The kids visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in \\"occupied America\\". Robert's father is revealed to have been executed because of the missing inventory from his store. The Masons charge Jed and Matt with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces, calling themselves \\"Wolverines\\" after their high school mascot. The occupation forces initially try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. During one of these mass executions, the fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to soften the blow against Calumet and save the lives of the captured citizens by appeasing the occupation authorities, effectively becoming a collaborator, but with little success. Despite the reprisal tactics, the occupation forces get nowhere. The Wolverines meet an American fighter pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner (Powers Boothe), who was shot down by Cuban MiG-21s. Tanner informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington, D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes; the Strategic Air Command was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent assaults via Mexico and Alaska. Most of the Southern United States and North Western Canada has been taken over by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River and the lines have stabilized. The only remaining U.S. allies, the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, are militarily crippled. Concerned about nuclear fallout, both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons. Tanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Their actions draw the attention of a Soviet General, who orders reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals against civilians eventually leads to the high command of both sides of war to know the name \\"Wolverines\\", and the Soviet generals publicly stating that the area \\"may not be pacified for much longer\\". Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his collaborating father. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a tracking device, then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A Spetsnaz unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable radio triangulation equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the radio triangulation signal to Daryl, who confesses and pleads for mercy. He is executed, along with a Spetsnaz operative by an increasingly hardened Robert when the others cannot find the heart to kill their friend. The remaining Wolverines are ambushed by Mi-24 helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed, Robert while successfully but suicidally attacking a gunship. Jed and Matt go to attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet, to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella comes across the brothers, but sensing the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to bring himself to kill them, and so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park where they spent time as kids, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness where they reach the frontier of Free America. In the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. The rock is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby. The plaque reads: Cast * Patrick Swayze as Jed Eckert * C. Thomas Howell as Robert Morris * Lea Thompson as Erica Mason * Charlie Sheen as Matt Eckert * Darren Dalton as Daryl Bates * Jennifer Grey as Toni Mason * Brad Savage as Danny * Doug Toby as Arturo \\"Aardvark\\" Mondragon * Powers Boothe as Lieutenant Colonel Andrew \\"Andy\\" Tanner, USAF * Ben Johnson as Mr. Jack Mason * Lois Kimbrell as Mrs. Mason * Harry Dean Stanton as Mr. Tom Eckert * Ron O'Neal as Colonel Ernesto Bella * William Smith as Colonel Strelnikov * Vladek Sheybal as General Bratchenko * Frank McRae as Mr. Teasdale * Roy Jenson as Mr. Samuel Morris * Pepe Serna as Mr. Mondragon * Lane Smith as Mayor Bates * Judd Omen as Nicaraguan Captain * Radames Pera as Sergeant Stepan Gorsky Production =Ten Soldiers= The film was originally called Ten Soldiers and was written by Kevin Reynolds. It was set in the near future as a combined force of Russians and Cubans launched an invasion of the Southwestern US. Ten children take to the hills when their small town is captured and they turn into a skilled and lethal guerrilla band.Bart p 109‚Äì110 Producer Barry Beckerman read the script, and, in the words of Peter Bart, \\"thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, ‚Äòart‚Äô picture made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.\\"Bart p 110 He got his father Sidney Beckerman to help him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. Walter Hill briefly considered the script before turning it down. So too did other directors. The Beckermans pitched the project to David Begelman when he was at MGM and were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was being run by Frank Yablans. Senior vice-president for production Peter Bart, who remembers it as a \\"sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of Lord of the Flies\\", took the project to the head of the studio, Frank Yablans. The script's chances of being filmed increased when Kevin Reynolds became mentored by Steven Spielberg who helped him make Fandango. MGM bought the script. =John Milius= Bart recalls that things changed when \\"the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen Rambo and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial and rotund filmmaker who loved war movies and also loved war? The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, General Alexander Haig, the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\\" Bart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage Fandango was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.Bart p 111 Milius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.Bart p 112 Milius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would take place; this was reportedly based on Hitler's proposed plans to invade the USA.Bart p 112‚Äì113 Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the Hudson Institute, the conservative think tank founded by Herman Kahn, to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican regime would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half. Bart says, \\"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project. 'This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,' Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6 million movie almost tripled.\\" Other changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond. There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.Bart p 113 Milius later said, \\"I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn't have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn't even that violent ‚Äì the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War II.\\" Bart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.Bart p 114 The Pentagon withdrew its cooperation from the film.Bart p 133 =Casting= Milius wanted Robert Blake to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.Bart p 135 Patrick Swayze as Jed Eckert. C. Thomas Howell as Robert Morris. Lea Thompson as Erica Mason. Charlie Sheen as Matt Eckert. Darren Dalton as Daryl Bates. Jennifer Grey as Toni Mason. Brad Savage as Danny. Doug Toby as Arturo \\"Aardvark\\" Mondragon. =Filming= The movie was filmed in and around the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic Fred Harvey Company hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of \\"Calumet, Colorado\\", referencing the town in Michigan, are still there today. An old Safeway grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie. Before starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in Newhall, California. Soldier of Fortune reported that the movie's T-72 tank was such a precise replica that \\"while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two CIA intelligence officers followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from\\". Powers Boothe later claimed, \\"Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters. Originally, my character was anti-war, as well as a rightist. I was supposed to be the voice of reason in that movie. But certain cuts negated my character.\\" Lea Thompson says the original cut featured a love scene between her and Powers Boothe but it \\"was cut out after some previews because of the age difference. And that was the main reason I took the movie‚Äìit was such a terrific scene.\\" Some of the weaponry devised for the film did not work. Futuristic helicopters created did not have FAA approval to fly over people.Bart p 134 The budget increased from $11 million to $15 million. It eventually came in at $19 million.Bart p 228 =Music= The film's score was composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris; it was the first soundtrack album to be released (on LP and compact disc) by Intrada Records. The label issued the complete score in 2007. Reception =Box office= Red Dawn was the 20th highest-grossing film of 1984, opening on August 10, 1984 in 1,822 theatres and taking in $8,230,381 on its first weekend. Its box office gross is $38,376,497. =Critical reaction= Red Dawn received mixed reviews, receiving a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews. The New York Times reviewer said, \\"To any sniveling lily-livers who suppose that John Milius ... has already reached the pinnacle of movie-making machismo, a warning: Mr. Milius's Red Dawn is more rip-roaring than anything he has done before. Here is Mr. Milius at his most alarming, delivering a rootin'-tootin' scenario for World War III.\\" MGM apologized to Alaska war veterans for the film's advertising, which claimed that no foreign troops had ever landed on US soil, thereby overlooking the Aleutian Islands Campaign. At the time it was released, Red Dawn was considered the most violent film by the Guinness Book of Records and the National Coalition on Television Violence, with a rate of 134 acts of violence per hour, or 2.23 per minute. The DVD Special Edition (2007) includes an on-screen \\"Carnage Counter\\" in a nod to this. A few days after the NCTV survey came out, 35 protestors picketed the MGM/UA building in opposition to the film. John Milius said: > What these people really don't like is that the movie shows violence being > perpetrated against Russian and Cuban invaders, which is what the > demonstration was all about. My question is, where were all these > demonstrators when the Russians shot down that airliner? Were they cheering? > And what about the people being gassed and yellow-rained in Afghanistan? ... > There's really no pleasure in outraging these people. I suppose next some > extreme right wing organisation will give me an award, which is equally > ridiculous. Soon afterward, the Gun Owners of America announced that they were honoring Milius for \\"dramatically depicting the importance in our time of the Second Amendment.\\" =Later reputation= National Review Online has named the film No. 15 in its list of the \\"Best Conservative Movies.\\" Adam Arseneau at the website DVD Verdict opined that the film \\"often feels like a Republican wet dream manifested into a surrealistic Orwellian nightmare\\". According to Jesse Walker of Reason, Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard argued that the film was \\"not so much pro-war as it is anti-State.\\" Rothbard gave the film a generally positive review, while expressing some reservations with the story: =Home media= Red Dawn has been variously released across a variety of formats. * 1985: Red Dawn released on VHS. It was also released at the same time on PAL and Betamax. * 1985: The first LaserDisc release. The film was released several times on this format, with the latest in April 1994. * 1998: First DVD release. * In 2007, a two-disc DVD Collector's Edition was released. Unusual among the \\"extras\\" are interviews of residents recalling the filming of the movie. * In 2015, a DVD release featured Red Dawn with the 2012 remake. Another release the same year excluded the remake. * In 2017, the Collector's Edition was released on Blu-ray. References in the film The movie being shown to American prisoners at the re-education camp is Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky (1938). Much of the story is set in the Arapaho National Forest, and a group of Soviet soldiers refer to the Colorado War, which was fought there between the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes and the US government. Operation Red Dawn The operation to capture former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was named Operation Red Dawn and its targets were dubbed \\"Wolverine 1\\" and \\"Wolverine 2\\". Army Captain Geoffrey McMurray, who named the mission, said the naming \\"was so fitting because it was a patriotic, pro-American movie.\\" Milius approved of the naming: \\"I was deeply flattered and honored. It's nice to have a lasting legacy.\\" Cultural influence Red Dawn has been referenced by and influenced a number of other mediums including music, film, and video games. =Film and television= * Numerous references occur in the movie Hot Tub Time Machine, including the movie playing in the Ski Patrol station and being watched by Blaine, who considers it one of the best movies of all time. * \\"Grey Dawn\\" is a South Park episode which parodies Red Dawn where the old people of the town, fed up with how they are treated, take over the quiet Colorado town. * SEAL Team is 2017 American military drama series that follows an elite team of the United States Navy Seals. In one episode the team must rescue a Russian scientist and his wife and bring them across the Chinese border into Afghanistan as Russian Special Forces pursue them. The SEAL Team successfully evades them and crosses into Afghanistan, at which point one of the SEAL's raises his weapon and yells \\"Wolverines!\\" to his pursuers, a reference to an iconic scene from the movie. The SEAL also states \\"don't tell me y'all never seen Red Dawn before.\\" =Music= * Rock musician David Rosenthal assembled prog rock group Red Dawn in 1992 with drummer Chuck Burgi and bassist Greg Smith. =Video games= Red Dawn has influenced a number of video games. * Freedom Fighters is a 2003 video game that takes place during a Soviet invasion of New York. This game is based heavily on Red Dawn in terms of characters, costumes and design, and the last mission closely resembles one of the final scenes when the Wolverines attack the Soviet base. * The plot of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 includes an invasion of the United States by an ultra-nationalist Russia, where members of the United States Army's 75th Ranger Regiment have to repel the attack. The achievement \\"Red Dawn\\" is awarded for completing the American \\"Wolverines!\\" and \\"Exodus\\" missions in Veteran difficulty. \\"Wolverines!\\" itself is a reference to the movie. * Homefront, is a video game by Red Dawns writer John Milius, about a North Korean invasion of America and borrows heavily from the movie. One notable \\"easter egg\\" relating to the film is a large billboard at a school sport stadium which reads \\"Go Wolverines!!!\\". In turn, the plot of the 2012 remake of Red Dawn borrows heavily from Homefront, including the use of a united Korean threat, the use of rural and suburban settings for the primary action, and partisan warfare. =Red Dawn Emails= In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a string of emails by Trump administration officials detailing concerns about the government's response to COVID-19 were dubbed the \\"Red Dawn emails\\" in reference to the film. Remake The remake takes place in a slightly altered version of the modern day (c. 2012), with North Korea invading the United States. Milius did not like the remake, and criticised it as \\"terrible\\" after reading an original script where the villains were Chinese. > There was a strange feeling to the whole thing. They were fans of the movie > so they put in stuff they thought was neat. It's all about neat action > scenes, and has nothing to do with story. ...

The series featured Patrick McGoohan as secret agent John Drake. Ralph Smart created the programme and wrote many of the scripts. Danger Man was financed by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment. Series development The idea for Danger Man originated with Ralph Smart, an associate of Lew Grade, the head of ITC Entertainment. Grade was looking for formats that could be exported. Ian Fleming was brought in to collaborate on series development, but left before development was complete. Like James Bond, the main character is a globetrotting British spy (although one who works for NATO rather than MI6) who cleverly extricates himself from life-threatening situations and introduces himself as \\"Drake...John Drake.\\" Fleming was replaced by Ian Stuart Black, and a new format/character initially called \\"Lone Wolf\\" was developed. This evolved into Danger Man. After Patrick McGoohan was cast, he also affected character development. A key difference from Bond traces to the family-oriented star's preferences: no firearms (with a few rare exceptions, such as episode 26, \\"The Journey Ends Halfway\\") and no outright seduction of female co-stars (though Drake did engage in low-key romance in a few episodes). Plotline From the first series voice-over: The line \\"NATO also has its own\\" is not always present. Programme overview The first series of episodes ran to 24‚Äì25 minutes each and portrayed John Drake as working for a Washington, D.C.-based intelligence organization, apparently on behalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), whose assignments frequently took him to Africa, Latin America, and the Far East. They were filmed in black and white. In episode 9, \\"The Sanctuary\\", Drake declares he is an Irish-American. Drake is sometimes at odds with his superiors about the ethics of the missions. Many of Drake's cases involved aiding democracy in foreign countries, and he was also called upon to solve murders and crimes affecting the interests of either the U.S. or NATO or both. For the second series (seasons 2 and 3), which aired several years after the first, the episode's length was extended to 48‚Äì49 minutes and Drake underwent retconning. His nationality became British, and he was an agent working for a secret British government department, called M9 (analogous to Secret Intelligence Service), though his Mid-Atlantic English accent persists for the first few episodes in production. These were also filmed in black and white. Other than the largely nominal change of employer and nationality, Drake's mandate remains the same: \\"to undertake missions involving national and global security\\". In keeping with the episodic format of such series in the 1960s, there are no ongoing story arcs and there is no reference made to Drake's NATO adventures in the later M9 episodes. =Pilot episode= The pilot was written by Brian Clemens, who later co-created The Avengers. In an interview Clemens said: > The pilot I wrote was called \\"View from the Villa\\" and it was set in Italy, > but the production manager set the shoot on location in Portmeirion, which > looked like Italy but which was much closer. And obviously the location > stuck in Patrick McGoohan's mind, because that's where he shot his > television series The Prisoner much later. The second unit director on the pilot, according to Clemens: > ... shot some location and background stuff and sent the dailies back to the > editing room at Elstree. Ralph Smart looked at them, hated them, and called > up the second unit director and said \\"Look, these are terrible, you'll never > be a film director,\\" and then he fired him. The name of the second unit > director? John Schlesinger. =Cancellation and resurrection= When American financing for a second season failed to materialize, the program was cancelled. The first season of the series had aired in America each Wednesday, 8:30 to 9:00 pm (Eastern Standard Time), on CBS from 5 April to 13 September 1961.Tim Brooks & Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946‚Äìpresent 5th Edition; New York: Ballantine, 1992, p. 205 It was used by the network as a late-spring replacement for Wanted Dead or Alive, which had just wrapped its third and final season. (A 5-disc boxset DVD release of Danger Man's first season by A&E; Home Video in 2000 erroneously states on its cover notes that these first 39 episodes were never broadcast in the US.) After a two-year hiatus, two things had changed; Danger Man had subsequently been resold all around the world, whilst repeat showings had created a public clamour for new shows. Also, by this time James Bond had become popular, as had ABC's The Avengers. Danger Mans creator, Ralph Smart, re-thought the concept; the second series' (1964) episodes were 49 minutes long and had a new musical theme, Edwin Astley's \\"High Wire\\". Drake gained an English accent and did not clash with his bosses at first. The revived Danger Man was broadcast in the U.S. as Secret Agent, first shown as a CBS summer replacement program. It had a new U.S.-only theme song, \\"Secret Agent Man\\", sung by Johnny Rivers, which became a success in its own right. In other parts of the world, the show was titled Destination Danger or John Drake. The fourth season consists of only two episodes, \\"Koroshi\\" and \\"Shinda Shima\\", the only two episodes of Danger Man to be filmed in colour. These two separate but related episodes were recut together as a feature for cinemas in Europe and for American broadcast, as done with two-parters from other ITC series such as The Baron and The Saint.The Danger Man Collection, issue 49. DeAgostini, 2006. Whilst \\"Koroshi\\" retains a strong plot-line and sharp characterizations, \\"Shinda Shima\\" drew heavily on contemporary Bond movies, principally Dr. No. When the episodes were completed, McGoohan announced he was resigning from the series to create, produce, and star in a project titled The Prisoner, with David Tomblin as co- producer and George Markstein as script editor. Markstein was then the Danger Man script consultant. A number of behind-the-scenes personnel on Danger Man were subsequently hired for The Prisoner.Fairclough, R: The Prisoner, p. 29\\\\. Carlton, 2002. The two colour episodes aired (in black and white) in the UK in the time slot of The Prisoner, which could not make its scheduled broadcast dates. The European cinema film feature version, Koroshi, did not receive theatrical release in the US but instead aired on network television as a TV movie in 1968. =Character of 'Drake'= Unlike the James Bond films, Danger Man strove for realism, dramatising credible Cold War tensions. In the second series, Drake is an undercover agent of the British external intelligence agency. As in the earlier series, Drake finds himself in danger with not always happy outcomes; sometimes duty forces him to decisions which lead to good people suffering unfair consequences. Drake doesn't always do what his masters tell him. Drake is rarely armed, though he engaged in fist fights, and the gadgets he uses are generally credible. In one episode (\\"To Our Best Friend\\"), Drake says; \\"I never carry a gun. They're noisy, and they hurt people. Besides, I manage very well without.\\" Agent Drake uses his intelligence, charm and quick thinking rather than force. He usually plays a role to infiltrate a situation, for example to scout for a travel agency, naive soldier, embittered ex-convict, brainless playboy, imperious physician, opportunistic journalist, bumbling tourist, cold-blooded mercenary, bland diplomat, smarmy pop disc jockey, precise clerk, compulsive gambler, or impeccable butler. Unlike James Bond, Drake is often shown re-using gadgets from previous episodes. Among the more frequently seen are a small spy camera hidden in a cigarette lighter and activated by flicking the lighter, a miniature reel-to-reel tape recorder hidden inside the head of an electric shaver or a pack of cigarettes, and a microphone which could be embedded in a wall near the target via a shotgun-like apparatus, that used soda siphon cartridges containing CO2 as the propellant, allowing Drake to eavesdrop on conversations from a safe distance. As Drake gets involved in a case, things are rarely as they seem. He is not infallible ‚Äî he gets arrested, he makes mistakes, equipment fails, careful plans do not work; Drake often has to improvise an alternative plan. Sometimes investigation fails and he simply does something provocative to crack open the case. People he trusts can turn out to be untrustworthy or incompetent; he finds unexpected allies. John Drake, unlike Bond, never romanced any of the women, as McGoohan was determined to create a family-friendly show.\\"No Girls or Guns for Danger Man\\", Woman, 30 October 1965, p. 69. Drake uses his immense charm in his undercover work, and women are often very attracted to him, but the viewers are left to assume whatever they want about Drake's personal life. McGoohan denounced the sexual promiscuity of James Bond and The Saint, roles he had rejected, although he had played romantic roles before Danger Man. The only exceptions to this rule were the two \\"linked\\" episodes of the series, \\"You're Not in Any Trouble, Are You?\\" and \\"Are You Going to be More Permanent?\\", in which Drake encounters two different women - both played by Susan Hampshire - and which contain numerous similarities in dialogue and set-pieces and both end with Drake in a pseudo-romantic circumstance with Hampshire's character. Drake was also shown falling for the female lead in the episode \\"The Black Book\\" though nothing comes of it; this episode is also one of the only scripts to directly address Drake's loneliness in his chosen profession. John Drake was not blind to the attraction of the opposite sex, often commenting on the prettiness of his latest associate. It was also the fact that many times the women in the show turned out to be femmes fatale, and heavily involved in the very plots Drake is fighting. Although the villains are often killed, Drake himself rarely kills. An examination of all episodes indicates that, in the entire series, he only shoots one person dead, in one of the last half-hour episodes from the 1960 season. While another shooting occurs in \\"The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove\\", it is revealed to be a dream. Drake's uses of non-firearm deadly force during the series number fewer than a dozen. Despite the lack of firearm violence, The Encyclopedia of 20th-Century American Television by Ron Lackmann notes Danger Man was one of the most violent series ever produced. Drake is almost never shown armed with a gun, and the episode \\"Time to Kill\\" centres on Drake's hesitancy and initial refusal to take an assassination mission (events transpire to prevent Drake from having to carry out the task). =Co-stars and guest stars= In the second series, Drake displays an increasingly resentful attitude towards his superiors at M9,'Danger Man: The Battle of the Cameras' A Complete Production Guide by Andrew Pixley first answering unwillingly to \\"Gorton\\" (Raymond Adamson) and later to \\"The Admiral\\" or Hobbs (Peter Madden). In the series \\"Hardy\\" was played by Richard Wattis. Most episodes had roles for guest stars such as Donald Pleasence, Howard Marion Crawford, Donald Houston, Maurice Denham, Joan Greenwood, John Le Mesurier, Sylvia Syms, Paul Eddington, and Burt Kwouk. Episode list Music =Theme= * Series 1 \\"The Danger Man Theme\\", composed by Edwin Astley * Series 2‚Äì4 \\"High Wire\\", composed by Edwin Astley * Series 2‚Äì4 in the US as Secret Agent, \\"Secret Agent Man\\", theme composed by P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri, and recorded by Johnny Rivers. * Incidental music throughout all four series by Edwin Astley The second Danger Man theme, \\"High Wire,\\" developed during series 2‚Äì4. The original version features a subdued rhythm section with almost inaudible drums. This was replaced with a revised version with drums and bass pushed to the fore in the mix. The end credits theme tune was set to end in the same manner as the opening theme, ending on the held, questioning, lower \\"E\\". The two-note coda was added soon afterwards to make a definite ending. An audio clip from the recording session can be heard as an extra on the final disk of the DVD set from Network DVD. The revised theme featured this as a normal end to the tune. As series 4 was to be made in colour, a completely new arrangement was recorded which owed much to the arrangement on Astley's full- length version of \\"High Wire\\" (released on single the previous year ‚Äì see below). The feature film Koroshi was created from the only two episodes made for series 4, \\"Koroshi\\" and \\"Shinda Shima\\", and uses this new arrangement over the closing titles only. =Singles= *1961 ‚Äì \\"Theme from Danger Man\\", The Red Price Combo (main theme used in the 1st Series) ‚Äì Parlophone 45 R 4789 *1964 ‚Äì Danger Man \\"High Wire\\", The Bob Leaper Orchestra (alternative main theme, not used in any episodes.

The first series had McGoohan leaving a building and getting into a convertible under the opening narration reproduced earlier, and driving off. The earlier of the two sequences for the hour-long series features a photograph of a benevolently-smiling McGoohan zooms partly out towards the right of the frame, then stops, adding the legend \\"Patrick McGoohan as\\". The three-ringed 'target' revolves round in time to the three- note orchestra hits to obscure McGoohan's photo as it reveals the programme logo on a pure black background. The second version was in two segments. The first segment is filmed, comprising a full-length McGoohan in stark negative, menacingly taking a few paces towards the camera, before he then stops. In quick succession, the camera zooms-in fast onto his eyes, freeze-frames, then switches from negative to positive. The legend \\"Patrick McGoohan as\\" is added. This then switches to a different photo with McGoohan looking left out of picture. The familiar three-ringed 'target' then reveals the programme logo on a pure black background as before. The music was re-recorded for this version of the ident and lasted for the rest of the programme's run. Transition to The Prisoner McGoohan resigned from the series, forcing its cancellation. He created a new project titled The Prisoner, with David Tomblin as co-producer and George Markstein as script editor. Markstein was then the Danger Man script consultant. A number of behind-the-scenes personnel on Danger Man were subsequently hired for The Prisoner. An unused, fourth-series script was reworked as an episode of The Champions. =Secret agent John Drake and Prisoner Number Six= Prisoner fans frequently debate whether John Drake of Danger Man and Number Six in The Prisoner are the same person.White, Matthew and Jaffer Ali, The Official Prisoner Companion, Warner Books, 1988, p. 145. Like John Drake, Number Six is evidently a secret agent, but one who has resigned from his job. According to The Prisoner: The Official Companion by Robert Fairclough, the Prisoner episode \\"The Girl Who Was Death\\" was based upon a two-part Danger Man script that had been planned for the fourth series. In this surreal episode, Number Six meets \\"Potter\\", John Drake's Danger Man contact. Christopher Benjamin portrayed the character in both series, with the episode also featuring an actor named John Drake in a small, non-speaking role. As well as guest-starring in this show, Paul Eddington played another spy and No.6's former colleague, Cobb, in the opening episode of the latter show. The first Danger Man season includes four episodes which use footage filmed in the Welsh resort of Portmeirion, which later became the primary shooting location of the Village in The Prisoner. Further inspiration came from a Danger Man episode called \\"Colony Three\\", in which Drake infiltrates a spy school in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The school, in the middle of nowhere, is set up to look like a normal English town in which pupils and instructors mix as in any other normal city, but the instructors are virtual prisoners with little hope of ever leaving. It is often thought this episode was a precursor to The Prisoner; it was filmed in the new town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire.Colony Three The Danger Man Website. Even reference books conflict on The Prisoner as a Danger Man continuation. Vincent Terrace's The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947‚Äì1979 postulates that John Drake's resignation reason is revealed in the \\"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\\" episode, which is a follow-up to a mission assigned to Number Six before he was sent to The Village. Richard Meyers makes the same claim in his 1981 book, TV Detectives. He further states that this connects directly to \\"an episode of Secret Agent never shown in this country [i.e. the United States] with John Drake investigating the story of a brain transferral device in Europe\\",Meyers, Richard, TV Detectives, A. S. Barnes and Company, 1981, p. 113, but no such episode of Danger Man was ever made. And, indeed, he might have been confusing that plot device with the one from the \\"Who's Who?\\" episode of the contemporaneous spy-fi show The Avengers. Nigel Stock (who played \\"The Colonel\\" in \\"Do Not Forsake Me...\\") also guest-starred in the Danger Man episode \\"A Little Loyalty Always Pays\\", as Major Bert Barrington. McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that the two characters were not the same, and that he had originally wanted a different actor to play the role of Number Six.New Video magazine Fall/Summer 1985 by Barrington Calia In popular culture *Danger Man has remained part of pop culture consciousness. Author Stephen King alludes to John Drake's cool in his novel The Shining. The band Tears for Fears refer to the character in their song \\"Swords and Knives\\", and Dead Can Dance titled one of the songs on their Into the Labyrinth album \\"The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove\\" after a Danger Man episode, although the content of the song has no apparent relationship to the episode. *The American theme song has appeared in countless movies and TV shows, including during the climax of the first Austin Powers movie, and was covered by Devo. *In 2000, the UPN network aired a short-lived spy series entitled Secret Agent Man. Due to the similarities in titles between this series and the American edition of Danger Man, Secret Agent Man, a series with no relationship to the McGoohan program, is often erroneously referred to as a spin-off or remake of Danger Man. *The British animated series Danger Mouse was largely inspired by Danger Manhttps://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/06/how-we-made-danger- mouse-by-david-jason and is a broad parody of both this series and secret agent films and television in general. *In episode \\"No Marks for Servility\\" (season 2, episode 9, #48, broadcast 8 December 1964), Drake, who is posing as a proper English butler, rescues a kidnapping victim while wearing a bowler hat and trench coat, and carrying a rolled-up umbrella, much as John Steed did on The Avengers. Brian Clemens, who co-created The Avengers, was also involved with Danger Man. Home releases All four series are now available on DVD in Europe, Australasia and North America. In Britain, Network DVD released a 13-disc \\"Special Edition\\" boxed set of the one-hour shows in June 2007. Extra features include the edited-together movie version of \\"Koroshi\\" and \\"Shinda Shima\\", the US Secret Agent opening and closing titles, image galleries for each episode, and a specially written 170-page book on the making of the one- hour series. Umbrella Entertainment has released the 24-minute series on DVD in Australia; the 49-minute series has been released by Madman. Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment released the 1st (24 min) series in January 2010 on a 6-disc set with a commemorative booklet by Andrew Pixley. The Carlton 6 disc set is out of issue.Network DVD, retrieved 19 November 2009 In North America, the three series of hour-long episodes of the series were released by A&E; Home Video, under licence from Carlton International Media Limited, under the title Secret Agent AKA Danger Man in order to acknowledge the American broadcast and syndication title. The episodes were digitally remastered from 35MM film prints and were presented in their original UK broadcast format and original CBS broadcast order; the two episodes that constituted the aborted fourth season were also included, the first time they had been released in their original format (however this meant the transition scene filmed for the Koroshi feature-length version is omitted). The episodes retain their original Danger Man opening credits (including the original theme by the Edwin Astley Orchestra), the first time these have been seen in the U.S., with the Secret Agent credits included as an extra feature. A&E; Home Entertainment later released the first season of the original U.K. Danger Man on Region 1 DVD, newly-restored and remastered, unedited, uncut and presented in its original U.K. broadcast format and order. A&E; subsequently released a single-set \\"megabox\\" containing all of the one-hour episodes; a revised megabox, released in 2007, added the half-hour episodes, and was released again in a modified slimline package in 2010. To date, no North American DVD release has occurred of the Koroshi TV movie edit of the two fourth-season episodes. On December 9, 2014, Timeless Media Group re-released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in a 17-disc set entitled Secret Agent (Danger Man)- The Complete Series. As of October 2020, Danger Man is streaming on Amazon and Roku.https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/secret-agent/B07F215L66 Production Marathon House 2011 The Washington title sequence of the first Series 24-minute episodes is a composite of the United States Capitol in the background and the Castrol Building, complete with London Bus stop, in the Marylebone Road, London as the foreground. This building is now Marathon House converted from offices to flats in 1998. In reality, no such building is allowed to exist in Washington, D.C., as the Height of Buildings Act of 1910 limits the heights of building (except churches) to 130 feet, thus giving the United States Capitol building, at 289 feet, an unobstructed view from any part of the city. (This has led to the popular belief that buildings in Washington, D.C. are restricted to the height of the U.S. Capitol building.)Height of Buildings Act of 1899 Original novels and comic books First issue of the Gold Key Comics series. Several original novels based upon Danger Man were published in the UK and US, the majority during 1965 and 1966. * Target for Tonight ‚Äì Richard Telfair, 1962 (published in US only) * Departure Deferred ‚Äì W. Howard Baker, 1965 * Storm Over Rockall ‚Äì W. Howard Baker, 1965 * Hell for Tomorrow ‚Äì Peter Leslie, 1965 * The Exterminator ‚Äì W.A. Balinger [W. Howard Baker], 1966 * No Way Out ‚Äì Wilfred McNeilly, 1966 Several of the above novels were translated into French and published in France, where the series was known as Destination Danger. An additional Destination Danger novel by John Long was published in French and not printed in the US or UK. At least one of the novels, The Exterminator, was later republished in the 1970s by Zenith Publications in the UK, with no direct reference to Danger Man on the cover. The adventures of John Drake have also been depicted in comic book form. In 1961, Dell Comics in the US (whose book-publishing cousin issued the Telfair novel) published a one-shot Danger Man comic as part of its long- running Four Color series, based upon the first series format. It depicted Drake as having red hair, a trait shared with Patrick McGoohan, but which was unseen as Danger Man had been made only in monochrome at that time. In 1966, Gold Key Comics published two issues of a Secret Agent comic book based upon the hour-long series (this series should not be confused with Secret Agent, an unrelated comic book series published by Charlton Comics in 1967, formerly titled Sarge Steel). In Britain, a single Danger Man comic book subtitled \\"Trouble in Turkey\\" appeared in the mid-1960s and a number of comic strip adventures appeared in hardback annuals. French publishers also produced several issues of a Destination Danger comic book in the 1960s, although their Drake was blond. Spanish publishers produced a series titled 'Agent Secreto'. The Germans were particularly prolific, using 'John Drake' and a picture of McGoohan, as the cover for hundreds of \\"krimi\\" magazines. Broadcasters =Australia= The Australian rights are held by the Nine Network who, over many decades, have shown numerous repeats in non-peak viewing times. From 2012 to 2017 there were numerous showings in the early hours of the morning on Gem, a Nine Network digital outlet, sometimes twice per morning. The Danger Man repeats alternate with re-screenings of other British series such as Gideon's Way, The Baron, and The Avengers. =American= CBS broadcast some of the original format's episodes of the program in 1961 under the Danger Man title as a summer replacement for the Western series Wanted: Dead or Alive. Danger Man was rebroadcast on American TV in the 2000s, when STARZ!‚Äôs Mystery channel started broadcasting the one-hour episodes in its American CBS broadcast version under the Secret Agent title. Prior to this, Secret Agent was widely seen in syndication. The half-hour Danger Man episodes were not as widely distributed. In September 2018, Charge! began airing the series in its original UK format beginning with the second season.

Unlike James Bond, he never carried a gun, rarely used far-fetched gadgets, never got the girl, and rarely killed anyone on screen. Drake's background was never explored in detail in the series, and also appeared to undergo an amount of retconning involving his nationality. In the first Danger Man series (1960‚Äì61), Drake speaks with a slightly exaggerated American accent (commonly referred to as a Mid-Atlantic accent), and is described as being an Irish American. In this series he's an operative working for a branch of NATO. In the second series (1964‚Äì66), Drake speaks with a less pronounced accent that is more British with Irish undertones which was McGoohan's natural accent. In this later version, he works for a fictional British secret service branch called M9; no further reference is made to him being American. He is now said to be British, except in one episode in which he identifies himself as being Irish. In both versions of the series, Drake is depicted as something of a lone wolf and a maverick. In one early episode he initially refuses a mission that requires him to assassinate a man; he reluctantly takes the mission and is visibly upset when his target is accidentally shot during a struggle. Other episodes (particularly during the later series) have him clashing with his superiors, or at least strongly disagreeing with their methods. In the history of the series, Drake is shown only once intentionally shooting anyone to death, and then only in self- defence. (He is shown shooting people on another occasion, but only during a dream sequence; the aforementioned early episode shooting is depicted as being unintended). Drake was not opposed to using lethal force when absolutely necessary, however, and on rare occasions did kill villains using other methods (throwing off a train, causing the collision of two airplanes, etc.). Drake is most often shown working alone, having received his orders from unidentified officials (or sometimes stumbling upon a case by himself). During the 1960 - '62 series, he is shown occasionally answering to a British superior named Hardy and in one episode Drake's Washington, DC office is shown and it's learned that he has a secretary. The first season of the '64 - '66 series sees Drake receiving orders from Hobbs, a somewhat cold M9 official who is always seen fiddling with a letter opener. In the following season his superior is a former brigadier, Gorton. During the final full season, Drake is on his own, except for one episode in which he takes orders from an M-like character played by Bernard Lee who played M in the James Bond films. In one episode of the third series, viewers are introduced to a group of M9 technicians who support Drake's missions, including a Q-like gadget man and a wardrobe supervisor. Drake is almost never shown becoming romantically involved with his leading ladies. This was a requirement put in place by McGoohan who didn't want Drake to become a clone of James Bond in that respect. McGoohan allowed a couple of exceptions (particularly in two episodes guest starring Susan Hampshire, both of which imply Drake and the two different characters played by Hampshire continue a relationship \\"off camera\\") and there is a considerable amount of sexual tension present in other episodes. In \\"The Black Book\\", an episode in which Drake becomes attracted to a young woman involved in a spy ring, it's learned that Drake cannot allow himself to become involved with anyone due to his line of work; this is graphically illustrated in the American version of the opening credits which depict a female form being separated from Drake by a set of bars. McGoohan denied that the character of Number Six in The Prisoner, the show that McGoohan did after Danger Man, was meant to be Drake. His co-creator of The Prisoner, George Markstein, claimed otherwise. The debate over the identity of Number Six stems from references in dialogue to the character being a former agent, the appearance of \\"Potter\\", a character from the final season of Danger Man, and the fact one episode (\\"The Girl Who Was Death\\") was based upon a script originally written for Danger Man. Making matters even more complex is the reference to Number Six as \\"Drake\\" in some of the officially licensed novels based upon the series, such as Number Two (1969) by David McDaniel which identifies Number Six by the name Drake in the very first line of the book. The Girl Who Was Death also features an actor named John Drake in a small role as a bowler in the two cricket matches featured in its early scenes.

In Slovakia, 4.4 million are ethnic Slovaks of 5.4 million total population. There are Slovak minorities in many neighboring countries including Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine and sizeable populations of immigrants and their descendants in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States among others, which are collectively referred to as the Slovak diaspora.  Name  The name Slovak is derived from *Slovƒõnin—ä, plural *Slovƒõnƒõ, the old name of the Slavs (Proglas, around 863). The original stem has been preserved in all Slovak words except the masculine noun; the feminine noun is Slovenka, the adjective is slovensk√Ω, the language is slovenƒçina and the country is Slovensko. The first written mention of adjective slovensk√Ω (Slovak) is in 1294 (ad parvam arborem nystra slowenski breza ubi est meta). The original name of Slovaks Slovenin/Slovene was still recorded in Pressburg Latin-Czech Dictionary (the 14th century),, but it changed to Slov√°k under the influence of Czech and Polish (around 1400). The first written mention of new form in the territory of present-day Slovakia is from Bardejov (1444, \\"Nicoulaus Cossibor hauptman, Nicolaus Czech et Slowak, stipendiarii supremi\\"). The mentions in Czech sources are older (1375 and 1385). The change is not related to the ethnogenesis of Slovaks, but exclusively to linguistic changes in the West Slavic languages. The word Slovak was used also later as a common name for all Slavs in Czech, Polish and also Slovak language together with other forms. In Hungarian, \\"Slovak\\" is T√≥t (pl: t√≥tok), an exonym. It was originally used to refer to all Slavs including Slovenes and Croats, but eventually came to refer primarily to Slovaks. Many place names in Hungary such as T√≥tszentgy√∂rgy, T√≥tszentm√°rton, and T√≥tkoml√≥s still bear the name. T√≥th is a common Hungarian surname. The Slovaks have also historically been variously referred to as Slovyenyn, Slowyenyny, Sclavus, Sclavi, Slavus, Slavi, Winde, Wende, or Wenden. The final three terms are variations of the Germanic term Wends, which was historically used to refer to any Slavs living close to Germanic settlements.  Ethnogenesis  J√°n Holl√Ω (portrait from 1885) The early Slavs came to the territory of Slovakia in several waves from the 5th and 6th centuries and were organized on a tribal level. Original tribal names are not known due to the lack of written sources before their integration into higher political units. Weakening of tribal consciousness was probably accelerated by Avars, who did not respect tribal differences in the controlled territory and motivated remaining Slavs to join together and to collaborate on their defense. In the 7th century, Slavs (probably including some Slovak ancestors) founded larger tribal union: Samo's empire. Regardless of Samo's empire, the integration process continued in other territories with various intensities. The final fall of the Avar Khaganate allowed new political entities to arise. The first such political unit documented by written sources is the Principality of Nitra, one of the foundations of later common ethnic consciousness. At this stage in history it is not yet possible to assume a common identity of all Slovak ancestors in the territory of eastern Slovakia, even if it was inhabited by closely related Slavs. The Principality of Nitra become a part of Great Moravia, a common state of (later) Moravians and Slovaks (Czech ancestors were joined only for a few years). The relatively short existence of Great Moravia prevented it from suppressing differences which resulted from its creation from two separate entities, and therefore a common \\"Slovak-Moravian\\" ethnic identity failed to develop. The early political integration in the territory of present-day Slovakia was however reflected in linguistic integration. While dialects of early Slovak ancestors were divided into West Slavic (western and eastern Slovakia) and non-West Slavic (central Slovakia), between the 8th and 9th centuries both dialects merged, thus laying the foundations of a later Slovak language. The 10th century is a milestone in the Slovak ethnogenesis. The fall of Great Moravia and further political changes supported their formation into a separate nation. At the same time, with the extinction of the Proto-Slavic language, between the 10th and 13th centuries Slovak evolved into an independent language (simultaneously with other Slavic languages). The early existence of the Kingdom of Hungary positively influenced the development of common consciousness and companionship among Slavs in the Northern Hungary, not only within boundaries of present-day Slovakia. The clear difference between Slovaks and Hungarians made adoption of specific name unnecessary and Slovaks preserved their original name (in Latin e.g. Slavus), which was also used in communication with other Slavic peoples (Polonus, Bohemus, Ruthenus). In political terms, the medieval Slovaks were a part of the multi-ethnic political nation Natio Hungarica, together with Hungarians (or, more exactly, Magyars), Slavonians, Germans, Romanians and other ethnic groups in the Kingdom of Hungary. Since a medieval political nation did not consist of ordinary people but nobility, membership of the privileged class was necessary for all these peoples (nobiles Hungary). Like other nations, the Slovaks began to transform into a modern nation from the 18th century under the idea of national romanticism. The modern Slovak nation is the result of radical processes of modernization within the Habsburg Empire which culminated in the middle of the 19th century.Stefan Auer, Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe, Routledge, 2004, p. 135 The transformation process was slowed down by conflict with Hungarian nationalism and the ethnogenesis of the Slovaks become a political question, particularly regarding their deprivation and preservation of their language and national rights. In 1722, Michal Bencsik, professor of law at the University of Trnava, published theory that nobility and burghers of Trenƒç√≠n should not have same privileges as Hungarians, because they are descendants of Svatopluk's people (inferior to Magyars). Neither Bencsik nor his Slovak opponent J√°n Baltaz√°r Magin put the continuity of settlement into serious question. Also, the first history of Slovaks written by Georgius Papanek (or Juraj Pap√°nek), traced the roots of the Slovaks to Great Moravia in Historia gentis Slavae. De regno regibusque Slavorum (1780) (\\"History of the Slavic People: On the kingdom and kings of the Slavs\\"). Pap√°nek's work became a basis for argumentation of the Slovak national revival movement. However, the Slovak national revival not only accepted the continuity of population but also emphasized it, thus proving that Slovaks are equal citizens of the state and Hungarian \\"unique statesmanlike gift\\" was neither required for the foundation of the state nor Christianization. In 1876, Hungarian linguist P√°l Hunfalvy published a theory about missing continuity between Slovaks and Slavs before the arrival of the Hungarians. Hunfalvy tried to prove that ancestors of Slovaks did not live in the territory of the present-day Slovakia before arrival of the old Hungarians (Magyars), but Slovaks emerged later from other Slavs who came to the Kingdom of Hungary from neighbouring countries after the 13th century. J√°nos Kar√°csonyi assumed that central and northern Slovakia were uninhabited (1901) and in his next work \\"Our historical right to the territorial integrity of our country\\" (1921) he claimed that the remainder of the original Slavs were assimilated by Magyars and modern Slovaks are descendants of immigrants from Upper Moravia and Oder (the population density on these territories was too low in that time and large numbers of colonists coming from these areas was not possible). The theory was then misused by inter-war Hungarian revisionists, who questioned continuity to support Hungarian claims on Slovakia. In 1982, when rich archaeological evidence proved the opposite were already available, a similar theory was published by Hungarian historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy. Gy√∂rffy accepted that smaller groups of Slavs could remain in the territory of Slovakia, but stated that the Slovaks' origin is in sparse settlement of various Slavic groups later strengthened by later colonization. According to academic Ferenc Makk, the medieval Moravians are not the ancestors of Slovaks and the majority of the Slovak people are descended from later Slavic newcomers.Ferenc, Makk, \\"√âs er≈ëvel elfoglalta eg√©sz Pann√≥ni√°t\\", In: Tiszat√°j, 1996-10, p. 76 The statue of Sv√§topluk I The opposite theory, supporting the supposed former common past of the Czech and Slovak nations, thus also legitimizing the creation of the united Czechoslovak nation, gained political support in the inter-war Czechoslovakia. Like Kar√°csonyi, Czech historian V√°clav Chaloupeck√Ω assumed that northern and central parts of Slovakia remained uninhabited until the 13th century and the south-western part was inhabited by Czechs. Yet in 1946, Chaloupeck√Ω assumed that the Slovak nation emerged from neighboring Slavs and had been formed only in the 17th century. His theory about the lack of population in the greater part of Slovakia covered by forests had already been scientifically refuted by Daniel Rapant (e.g. in his work O star√Ω Liptov, 1934), and was proven wrong by numerous archaeological findsFor example Slavic mounds in Kras≈àany near ≈Ωilina, cemetery in Martin, magnate mounds in Turƒçianska Blatnica, Mal√Ω ƒåepƒç√≠n and ≈Ωabokreky, settlements in Liptovsk√Ω Michal, Liptovsk√° Mara (unearthed during construction of the water dam), Vlachy, Liptovsk√° ≈†tiavnica, Paludza, Sokolƒçe, Liskov√°, Podture≈à, Prosiek, Bobrovn√≠k, Likavka ‚Äì all of them from 8‚Äì10th century. (Uhl√°r, 1992, p. 326) and rejected by Czechoslovak histography. On the other hand, inter-war Slovak autonomists, opposing ethnic Czechoslovakism, dated the existence of the Slovak nation to times of Pribina (trials to document existence of Slovaks in early Slavic era i.e. in time of Samo's empire are marginal and exist outside of the modern mainstream Slovak histography). After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the formation of independent Slovakia motivated interest in a particularly Slovak national identity. One reflection of this was the rejection of the common Czechoslovak national identity in favour of a pure Slovak one.  History  = Slavs of the Pannonian Basin = The first known Slavic states on the territory of present-day Slovakia were the Empire of Samo and the Principality of Nitra, founded sometime in the 8th century. = Great Moravia = Pribina, ruler of Principality of Nitra, established and ruled the Balaton Principality from 839/840 to 861. Great Moravia (833 ‚Äì ?907) was a Slavic state in the 9th and early 10th centuries, whose creators were the ancestors of the Czechs and Slovaks.Ference Gregory Curtis. Chronology of 20th-century eastern European history. Gale Research, Inc., 1994. , p. 103 Important developments took place at this time, including the mission of Byzantine monks Cyril and Methodius, the development of the Glagolitic alphabet (an early form of the Cyrillic script), and the use of Old Church Slavonic as the official and literary language. Its formation and rich cultural heritage have attracted somewhat more interest since the 19th century. The original territory inhabited by the Slavic tribes included not only present-day Slovakia, but also parts of present-day Poland, southeastern Moravia and approximately the entire northern half of present-day Hungary.A history of Eastern Europe: crisis and change, Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries = Kingdom of Hungary = Gallery of famous Slovak people, active in different areas (history, literature, education, religion, science).

However, according to other historians, from 895 to 902, the whole area of the present-day Slovakia became part of the rising Principality of Hungary, and became (without gradation) part of the Kingdom of Hungary a century later.Krist√≥, Gyula (1996). Hungarian History in the Ninth Century. Szeged: Szegedi K√∂z√©pkor√°sz M≈±hely. p. 229. Krist√≥, Gyula (1993).

A separate entity called Nitra Frontier Duchy, existed at this time within the Kingdom of Hungary. This duchy was abolished in 1107. The territory inhabited by the Slovaks in present-day Hungary was gradually reduced. When most of Hungary was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1541 (see Ottoman Hungary), the territory of present-day Slovakia became the new center of the reduced kingdom that remained under Hungarian, and later Habsburg rule, officially called Royal Hungary. Some Croats settled around and in present-day Bratislava for similar reasons. Also, many Germans settled in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially in the towns, as work-seeking colonists and mining experts from the 13th to the 15th century. Jews and Gypsies also formed significant populations within the territory. During the period, most of present-day Slovakia was part of Habsburg rule, but Ottoman ruled southern and southeasternmost parts of it. After the Ottoman Empire were forced to retreat from present-day Hungary around 1700, thousands of Slovaks were gradually settled in depopulated parts of the restored Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Croatia) under Maria Theresia, and that is how present-day Slovak enclaves (like Slovaks in Vojvodina, Slovaks in Hungary) in these countries arose. After Transylvania, Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia), was the most advanced part of the Kingdom of Hungary for centuries, but in the 19th century, when Buda/Pest became the new capital of the kingdom, the importance of the territory, as well as other parts within the Kingdom fell, and many Slovaks were impoverished. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Slovaks emigrated to North America, especially in the late 19th and early 20th century (between cca. 1880‚Äì1910), a total of at least 1.5 million emigrants. Slovakia exhibits a very rich folk culture. A part of Slovak customs and social convention are common with those of other nations of the former Habsburg monarchy (the Kingdom of Hungary was in personal union with the Habsburg monarchy from 1867 to 1918). = Czechoslovakia = People of Slovakia spent most part of the 20th century within the framework of Czechoslovakia, a new state formed after World War I. Significant reforms and post-World War II industrialization took place during this time. The Slovak language was strongly influenced by the Czech language during this period.  Culture  The art of Slovakia can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when some of the greatest masterpieces of the country's history were created. Significant figures from this period included the many Old Masters, among them the Master Paul of Levoƒça and Master MS. More contemporary art can be seen in the shadows of Koloman Sokol, Alb√≠n Brunovsk√Ω, Martin Benka, Mikul√°≈° Galanda, ƒΩudov√≠t Fulla. Julius Koller and Stanislav Filko, in the 21st century Roman Ondak, Bla≈æej Bal√°≈æ. The most important Slovak composers have been Eugen Sucho≈à, J√°n Cikker, and Alexander Moyzes, in the 21st century Vladimir Godar and Peter Machajd√≠k. The most famous Slovak names can indubitably be attributed to invention and technology. Such people include Jozef Murga≈°, the inventor of wireless telegraphy; J√°n Bah√Ωƒæ, ≈†tefan Baniƒç, inventor of the modern parachute; Aurel Stodola, inventor of the bionic arm and pioneer in thermodynamics; and, more recently, John Dopyera, father of modern acoustic string instruments. Hungarian inventors Joseph Petzval and Stefan Jedlik were born of Slovak fathers. Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include Pavol Jozef ≈†af√°rik, Matej Bel, J√°n Koll√°r, and its political revolutionaries, such Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik and Alexander Dubƒçek. There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first one was Anton Bernol√°k whose concept was based on the dialect of western Slovakia (1787). It was the enactment of the first national literary language of Slovaks ever. The second notable man was ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r. His formation of the Slovak language had principles in the dialect of central Slovakia (1843). The best known Slovak hero was Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k (the Slovak equivalent of Robin Hood). The prominent explorer and diplomat M√≥ric Be≈àovsk√Ω, Hungarian transcript Benyovszky was Slovak as well (he comes from Vrbov√© in present-day Slovakia and is e.g. listed as \\"nobilis Slavicus ‚Äì Slovak nobleman\\" in his secondary school registration). In terms of sports, the Slovaks are probably best known (in North America) for their ice hockey personalities, especially Stan Mikita, Peter ≈†≈•astn√Ω, Peter Bondra, ≈Ωigmund P√°lffy, Mari√°n Hossa and Zdeno Ch√°ra. For a list see List of Slovaks. Zdeno Ch√°ra is only the second European captain in history of the NHL that led his team to win the Stanley Cup, winning it with Boston Bruins in season 2010‚Äì11.

History =James Kent and the early study of law at Columbia University= James Kent The teaching of law at Columbia reaches back to the 18th century. Graduates of the university's colonial predecessor, King's College, included such notable early American judicial figures as John Jay, who would later become the first Chief Justice of the United States. Columbia College appointed its first professor of law, James Kent, in 1793. The lectures of Chancellor Kent in the course of four years had developed into the first two volumes of his Commentaries, the second volume being published November 1827. Kent did not, however, succeed in establishing a law school or department in the College. Thus, the formal instruction of law as a course of study did not commence until the middle of the 19th century.Theodore W. Dwight, \\"Columbia College Law School, New York,\\" 1 Green Bag 141 (1889) =Theodore Dwight and the founding of the law school= The Columbia College Law School, as it was then officially called, was founded in 1858. The first law school building was a Gothic Revival structure located on Columbia's Madison Avenue campus. Thereafter, the college became Columbia University and moved north to the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. As Columbia Law Professor Theodore Dwight observed, at its founding the demand for a formal course of study in law was still speculative: > It was considered at that time mainly as an experiment. No institution > resembling a law school had ever existed in New York. Most of the leading > lawyers had obtained their training in offices or by private reading, and > were highly skeptical as to the possibility of securing competent legal > knowledge by means of professional schools. Legal education was, however, at > a very low ebb. The clerks in the law offices were left almost wholly to > themselves. Frequently they were not even acquainted with the lawyers with > whom, by a convenient fiction, they were supposed to be studying. > Examinations for admission to the bar were held by committees appointed by > the courts, who, where they inquired at all, sought for the most part to > ascertain the knowledge of the candidate of petty details of practice. In > general, the examinations were purely perfunctory. A politician of influence > was not readily turned away. Few studied law as a science; many followed it > as a trade or as a convenient ladder whereby to rise in a political career.\\" The Gothic Revival Law Library on Columbia's Madison Avenue Campus Indeed, Columbia Law School was one of the few law schools established in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks, were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction. At its founding, four distinct courses of lectures of this class were then established: one on Philology, offered by distinguished scholar and statesman, George P. Marsh; a second by Dr. Francis Lieber, a standard writer upon topics of political science and of international law, then a professor at Columbia College; a third course on Ethics, by Professor Nairne, also of the College; and a fourth on Municipal Law, by Theodore W. Dwight, then Professor of Law in Hamilton College, New York, which at the time already had a flourishing law school. The original course of study to obtain a degree consisted of just two years, rather than the modern standard of three. The first lecture in the law school was delivered on Monday, November 1, 1858, by Mr. Dwight, at the rooms of the Historical Society. It was an introductory lecture, afterwards printed. The audience consisted mainly of lawyers. It was plain that many of them could be counted upon as friends of a system of legal education. The result was an immediate attendance of 35 students, who showed their intention of pursuing a regular course of study by at once paying a tuition fee for instruction throughout the year. Such assurances were given of a future increase of numbers that it was determined to divide each class at the beginning of the coming year into two sections, for their convenience. The next year, the number of students was 62; in the third year, there were 103. Many of these early students were members of the bar. In 1860, in order to stimulate excellence in attainments of the students, a series of annual prizes was established, commencing with $250, and diminishing regularly by $50, until the sum of $100 was reached. These were adjudicated by leading members of the bar upon the combined merits of written answers to printed questions, and of essays upon topics selected by the instructors. None could compete for the prizes except those who had fully completed the two years' course. The questions covered the range of studies for the whole course. Stringent rules were adopted in reference to the answers, so as to secure the absolute fidelity of the candidates in their work. =The Dwight Method= Professor Dwight believed a course of legal study should focus on the application of basic legal principles, as learned through the study of legal treatises, coupled with frequent moot courts which would permit students to demonstrate their proficiency in applying those principles to new legal problems.http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/articles/15AmLaw419-422.pdf In this way, Dwight's method of teaching diverged significantly from the \\"case method\\" which had then been popularized by Dean Langdell of the Harvard Law School which focused on the study of individual cases and the use of inductive reasoning to distill governing legal principles from those case with little time spent on the practical application of those principles. thumb Dwight believed that his method was superior to the case method because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching. In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: \\"It is not out of place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries . . .The Roman jurists had \\"cases\\" to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and \\"burning\\" questions of their time. They were, however, in the habit of referring back to a legal principle in disposing of a concrete case, and believed that great principles could be so stated as to win the attention of students and give them a solid basis for future detailed acquisitions.\\". By the late 19th century, Dwight's method gave way to the case method which by the turn of the 20th century had become the standard curriculum at all of the other premier American law schools at Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1891, in response to Columbia's adoption of the case method, Dwight and a number of other professors left the law school to found New York Law School in Manhattan's Financial District. =Columbia Law in the 20th century= After Dwight's departure, William Albert Keener of Harvard Law School became dean of the law school from 1891 to 1901 when he was succeeded by George Washington Kirchwey. Future Supreme Court Justice Harlan Fiske Stone graduated from the law school in 1898. While practicing law in New York, he began lecturing at Columbia Law School in 1899 and joined the faculty as a full professor. He subsequently became dean of the law school in 1910 and held the position until 1923 when he left to join Sullivan and Cromwell as a partner. Stone became Attorney General of the United States in 1924 and held that Office for almost a year before joining the Supreme Court of the United States as an associate justice. In the 1920s and 30s, the law school soon became known for the development of the legal realism movement. Among the major realists affiliated with Columbia Law School were Karl Llewellyn, Felix S. Cohen and William O. Douglas. In September 1988, Columbia Law School founded the first AIDS Law Clinic in the country, taught by Professor Deborah Greenberg and Mark Barnes.

Jagdish Bhagwati is University Professor of Economics and Law. For the year ending December 2009, Columbia Law School's faculty ranked #2 in the nation for the number of academic papers authored and downloaded on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN), according to cumulative statistics, exceeded only by Harvard Law School's faculty. In 2007 (the prior such ranking by SSRN) Columbia Law School's faculty also was the #2 most downloaded law faculty in the United States. Law centers and programs Columbia University was among the first schools to establish both comparative and international law centers, as well as an effective space law department. The law school also has major centers for the study of international law, including the Center for Chinese Legal Studies, the Center for Korean Legal Studies, the Center for Japanese Legal Studies (the first and only center of its kind in the United States), the European Legal Studies Center, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, the Center on Corporate Governance, the Center for Gender & Sexuality Law, the Center for Law and Economic Studies, the Center on Global Legal Transformation, as well as several other centers and law programs. In July 2012, the law school launched three new centers: i) the Ira M. Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership to \\"study global financial markets and their diverse, interdependent actors\\"; ii) the Center for Constitutional Governance to \\"bring together a dynamic roster of constitutional scholars who are deeply engaged in the study of governmental structure and relationships, including experts on separation of powers and issues of federalism\\"; and iii) the Center for International Commercial and Investment Arbitration to \\"further the teaching and study of international arbitration, building on the Law School's considerable expertise in this rapidly growing area of legal practice.\\" In 2006, the law school embarked on an ambitious campaign to increase the number of faculty by fifty percent without increasing the number of students. On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a CLS Lecturer-in-Law since 1999, to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Sotomayor created and co-taught a course entitled \\"The Federal Appellate Externship\\" every semester at the law school since the fall 2000. Federal Appellate Externships and many other externships, including Federal District Externships, are offered each year at Columbia Law. Among other externships, the law school offers a full-semester externship on the federal government in Washington, D.C., which provides students hands-on experience in government law offices. In addition to their placements at federal agencies, students in the program are also required to attend a weekly seminar and write a substantive research paper. The Federal Government Externship has the following three specific components: # Field Placements: Students are required to work a minimum of 30 hours a week doing substantive legal work at a federal agency. Options include, amongst others, several sections of the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security, # Seminar: Students conduct an in-depth analysis of the roles lawyers play in federal offices. Each seminar is taught by Columbia Law faculty and a Washington-based adjunct professor. Each seminar also features guest speakers and has a substantive writing component. # Supervised Research: Students are required to produce an 8,000‚Äì10,000-word research paper on a topic closely connected to their externship and field placement. Externs are encouraged to consult with the agency in which they work to develop their topic. Arthur W. Diamond Library Jerome L. Greene Hall, home of the law school and the Arthur W. Diamond Library. June 2019 Columbia Law School's Arthur W. Diamond Library is one of the most comprehensive libraries in the world and is the second largest academic law library in the United States, with over 1,000,000 volumes and subscriptions to more than 7,450 journals and other serials.

Columbia Law publishes thirteen other student-edited journals, including the Columbia Business Law Review, Columbia Human Rights Law Review (which in turn publishes A Jailhouse Lawyer's Manual), Columbia Journal of Asian Law, Columbia Journal of Environmental Law, Columbia Journal of European Law, Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts, Columbia Journal of Law & Social Problems, Columbia Journal of Race & Law, Columbia Journal of Tax Law, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, Columbia Science and Technology Law Review, and the American Review of International Arbitration. Joint degree program In December 2010, the law school announced the addition of an accelerated JD/MBA joint degree program, which allows students to obtain both a JD and MBA within three years. The accelerated program will not replace the existing four-year JD/MBA joint degree program. Interested students will be able to choose between the two programs. A joint degree can prove to be beneficial to law students' career objectives. To enable interested students to achieve this goal, the law school may approve a joint degree with any of the following of Columbia's graduate or professional schools: * Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (Ph.D. in selected programs) * School of Business * School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) * Graduate School of Journalism * School of the Arts * School of Public Health * School of Social Work * School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation Additionally, in recent years, students have successfully petitioned the law school's Rules Committee for permission to create a joint degree program with schools that have agreed to grant advanced standing toward their master's degree for work completed in the Columbia J.D. program: * Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government * Johns Hopkins' Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies * Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs * Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Dual degree programs and alliances, abroad Columbia has cultivated alliances and dual degree programs with overseas law schools, including the University of Oxford, King's College London, University College London, and the London School of Economics in London, England; the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris (\\"Sciences Po\\") and the Universit√© Panth√©on-Sorbonne in Paris, France; the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands; and the Institute for Law and Finance (ILF) at Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt, Germany. The double degree options include JD/Masters in French Law (4 year program in Paris), JD/Masters Program in Global Business (3 Year program in Paris), JD/LLM (3 year program in London), LLB/JD (4 year program in London), and JD/LLM (4 year program in Frankfurt). Columbia Law School has one of the largest international alliances with China, and with Peking University, specifically, a joint exchange program that begin in 2006 when students could be exchanged for a semester, which was expanded as a program in 2011 to allow faculty to teach or co-teach courses abroad, and which was expanded as a program again in 2013 when Columbia Law School dean David Schizer and Peking University Law School dean Zhang Shouwen signed a memorandum of understanding between the universities, allowing for joint publications and joint seminars between faculty at the respective universities. Clinical programs The law school runs nine vigorous clinical programs that contribute to the community, including the nation's first technology-based clinic, called Lawyering in the Digital Age. This clinic is currently engaged in building a community resource to understand the collateral consequences of criminal charges. In April 2006, Columbia announced that it was starting the nation's first clinic in sexuality and gender law. The Sexuality and Gender Law Clinic \\"is the first law school clinic anywhere in the U.S. directed by a full-time law school faculty member and dedicated to legal and public policy issues related to gender and sexuality.\\" In 2007, Columbia opened a new program in law and technology. Given that Columbia is well known for its strength in corporate law, the law school offers, for example, a \\"Deals\\" course that includes participants from the Columbia Business School and the law school. In addition, the Columbia Business and Law Association (CBLA), the law school's principal student group dedicated to the interaction between law and business, routinely sponsors lectures, workshops, and networking events from traditional areas of interest such as investment banking, management consulting, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, and entrepreneurship. CBLA also serves as a center for members of the Columbia Law School community interested in many aspects of business law, including corporate governance and securities regulation. The student-run organization Unemployment Action Center has a chapter at Columbia Law School. Facilities Columbia Law School's main building, Jerome L. Greene Hall, was designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, architects of the United Nations Headquarters and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts (which for many years served as the site of Columbia Law School's graduation ceremonies). It is located at the intersection of Amsterdam Avenue and West 116th Street. One of the building's defining features is its frontal sculpture, Bellerophon Taming Pegasus, designed by Jacques Lipchitz, symbolizing man's struggle over (his own) wild side/unreason. In 1996, the law school was given an extensive renovation and expansion by Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects), including the addition of a new entrance fa√ßade and three story skylit lobby, as well as the expansion of existing space to include an upper-level students' commons, lounge areas, and a caf√©. In the summer of 2008, construction of a new floor in Jerome Greene Hall was completed providing 38 new faculty offices. Other Columbia Law School buildings include William and June Warren Hall, the Jerome Greene Annex (which Jerome Greene's representatives politely declined to have renamed after the building of Jerome Greene Hall), and William C. Warren Hall (or \\"Little Warren\\"). Lenfest Hall, the law school's premier residence, opened in August 2003. The hall was named for H. F. Lenfest '58 and his wife Marguerite. Lenfest contains more than 200 luxury student residences, including private studio apartments and one-bedroom apartments. In addition to Lenfest Hall, the majority of Columbia Law students live in the university's Graduate Student Housing consisting of single and shared apartments in buildings throughout Morningside Heights. All Columbia Law students are guaranteed housing on campus for the duration of their law school studies. Columbia graduate legal studies program Columbia offers a Graduate Legal Studies Program, including the Master of Laws (LL.M.) and the Doctor of the Science of Law (J.S.D.) degrees. The LL.M. Program is considered one of the best in the United States and has been ranked very highly according to private studies. Each year the law school enrolls approximately 210 graduate students from more than 50 countries with experience in all areas of the legal profession, including academia, the judiciary, public service, civil rights and human rights advocacy, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private practice. Graduate students are an important component of the law school community. They participate in many co- curricular activities, including student journals, moot courts, and student organizations. Graduate students also organize and speak at conferences, workshops, and colloquia on current legal issues. U.S. Supreme Court clerkships Since 2005, 24 Columbia Law alumni have served as judicial clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the most distinguished appointments a law school graduate can obtain. This record gives Columbia a ranking of fifth among all law schools for supplying such law clerks for the period 2005‚Äì2017. Columbia has placed 135 clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court in its history, one of the top five law schools for clerks; this group includes Lee Bollinger, who clerked for Chief Justice Warren Burger in the 1972 Term, and is now the president of Columbia University. Employment According to Columbia Law School's official 2014 ABA-required disclosures, 93.8 percent of the Class of 2014 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment ten months after graduation. Columbia Law School's Law School Transparency under-employment score was 1.6 percent, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Columbia Law School for the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year was $101,345. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $357,503. Columbia Law School alumni Theodore Roosevelt Franklin D. Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States and the 25th vice president of the United States, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, were students at CLS; neither graduated from CLS, but they both received honorary J.D.s in October 2008.\\"Presidents Roosevelt Receive Posthumous J.D.s\\" Law.Columbia.edu. October 9, 2008. Retrieved December 3, 2015. Former President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, received his LL.M. at Columbia; Giuliano Amato, twice former Prime Minister of Italy (1992‚Äì93 and 2000‚Äì2001), was also a CLS graduate. Graduates of the law school have served as members of the United States President's Cabinet and non-U.S. government executive cabinets, including U.S. Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of War (now U.S. Secretary of Defense), and Attorney General, among others. Three of the school's graduates have served as Chief Justice of the United States: Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and John Jay. Columbia Law School is the only law school to have graduated more than one chief justice. Nine alumni of Columbia Law School have served on the Supreme Court of the United States, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Several alumni have served as United States Solicitor General. There are over 90 current and past members of the U.S. federal courts who have graduated from CLS. Internationally, CLS graduates also have occupied prominent judicial positions, including Shi Jiuyong, former president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ); Xue Hanqin, current member of the ICJ; Giuliano Amato, current member of the Constitutional Court of Italy; Jan Schans Christensen ('88 LL.M.), current member of the Supreme Court of Denmark; Susan Denham, current Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Ireland; Marvic Leonen ('04 LL.M.), current member of the Supreme Court of the Philippines; Hironobu Takesaki, current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Japan; Umu Hawa Tejan-Jalloh, current Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; Karin Maria Bruzelius, former member of the Supreme Court of Norway; Lawrence Collins, former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; and Francis M.

Sovern, Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Charles Warren, Amy Wax, Herbert Wechsler, and Mark D. West. In 2015, the positions of Attorney General of the United States (Eric Holder), Solicitor General (Don Verrilli), and the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division (Lanny Breuer) were all occupied by graduates of the law school. CLS alumni are also notable in the arts, business, and elsewhere. For example, civil rights activist, recording artist, and actor Paul Robeson received his law degree from CLS in 1923. Academy Award-winning lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II attended the law school. Moe Berg was a Major League Baseball player, and a spy for the United States. Alumni of the law school have been the president or founder of more than 30 colleges and universities in the nation. Entrepreneur and former 2020 Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is also an alumnus.https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/04/12/Andrew-Yang-centers- presidential-bid-around-universal-basic-income/2141554677406/ Columbia Law School in popular culture * Marvel Comics character Matthew Murdock, the alter ego of superhero Daredevil, and his roommate and eventual law partner, Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson, attended Columbia Law School. * On the television show Law & Order, District Attorney Adam Schiff and Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross studied law at Columbia. * In Body Heat, Edmund Walker (played by Richard Crenna), the wealthy husband of the film's femme fatale, is a Columbia Law School graduate. * In the film Old School, Dean Gordon Pritchard bribes the student body president by guaranteeing her admission to Columbia Law. * In the film Just Cause, Law Professor Paul Armstrong, played by Sir Sean Connery, is a Columbia Law graduate. * In the film Two Weeks Notice, Howard Wade, played by David Haig, asks for a lawyer trained at Columbia Law School. * On the television show How I Met Your Mother, the character Marshall Eriksen is an Environmental Law graduate of Columbia Law School. * On The West Wing (S5), Angela (the new head of legislative affairs at the White House) meets Leo to talk about the President's high popularity in polls during the time of his daughter's kidnapping.

Founded after the dissolution of their first band, the mod-influenced Graduate, Tears for Fears were initially associated with the new wave synthesizer bands of the early 1980s. Later, the band branched out into more mainstream pop and attained international chart success. Tears for Fears were part of the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. The band's debut album, The Hurting (1983), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Their second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985), reached number one on the US Billboard 200, achieving multi-platinum status in both the UK and the US. Songs from the Big Chair contained two Billboard Hot 100 number one hits: \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\"'. The latter song won the Brit Award for Best British Single in 1986.. Brit Awards. After the release of their platinum-selling third album, The Seeds of Love (1989), Smith and Orzabal had an acrimonious split in 1991. Orzabal retained the Tears for Fears name as a solo project, releasing the albums Elemental (1993) and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995). Orzabal and Smith reconciled in 2000 and released an album of new material, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, in 2004. The duo have toured consistently since then. History =Formation= Orzabal and Smith met as teenagers in Bath, Somerset, England. The duo became session musicians for the band Neon, where they first met future Tears For Fears drummer Manny Elias. Neon also featured Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher who went on to become Naked Eyes. Smith and Orzabal's professional debut came with the band Graduate, a mod revival/new wave act. In 1980, Graduate released an album, Acting My Age, and a single \\"Elvis Should Play Ska\\" (referring to Elvis Costello, not Presley). The single just missed the top 100 in the UK, but performed well in Spain and in Switzerland. By 1981, Orzabal and Smith had become more influenced by artists such as Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno. They departed from Graduate and formed a band called History of Headaches, which they soon changed to Tears for Fears. The band's name was inspired by primal therapy, developed by the American psychologist Arthur Janov, which gained tremendous publicity after John Lennon became Janov's patient in 1970. In a 2004 interview with VH1 UK, Orzabal and Smith said that when they finally met Janov in the mid-1980s, they were disillusioned to find he had become quite \\"Hollywood\\" and wanted the band to write a musical for him. As Tears for Fears, Orzabal and Smith intended to form the nucleus of the group and bring in surrounding musicians to help them complete the picture. Around this time they met local musician Ian Stanley, who offered them free use of his home 8-track studio. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to Phonogram Records in the UK in 1981 by A&R; manager Dave Bates. Their first single, \\"Suffer the Children\\", produced by David Lord, was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of \\"Pale Shelter\\" (produced by Mike Howlett) in March 1982, but neither releases were successful. =The Hurting and first international successes (1982‚Äì1983)= The band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, \\"Mad World\\", which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982. Their first album, The Hurting, was released in March 1983. For this album (and the next), keyboardist and composer Ian Stanley and drummer Manny Elias were considered full band members, though Smith and Orzabal were still essentially the frontmen and public face[s] of the band. The album, produced by Chris Hughes and Ross Cullum, showcased guitar- and synthesiser-based songs with lyrics reflecting Orzabal's bitter childhood and his interest in primal therapy. The album was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached No. 1 and platinum status. It also reached the top 20 in several other countries and yielded the international hit singles \\"Mad World\\" (top 5 hit in South Africa), \\"Change\\" (top 40 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and South Africa ‚Äì their first single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100), and a re-recorded version of \\"Pale Shelter\\". All three of these singles reached the Top 5 in the UK. Towards the end of 1983, the band released a new, slightly more experimental single, \\"The Way You Are\\", intended as a stopgap while they worked on their second album. The single was a top-30 hit in the UK, but did not come close to matching the success of their three previous hits, despite a national concert tour in December of that year (captured on the In My Mind's Eye live video release). The single, which heavily featured sampling and programmed rhythms, was a departure from Tears for Fears' previous musical approach. In the liner notes to their 1996 B-sides compilation album Saturnine Martial & Lunatic they wrote \\"this was the point we realised we had to change direction\\", though the somewhat experimental style of the single continued to be reflected in their forthcoming B-sides. =Songs from the Big Chair and worldwide fame (1984‚Äì1986)= In early 1984, they began working with a new producer, Jeremy Green, on their new single \\"Mothers Talk\\". However, the band were ultimately unhappy with the results and so producer Chris Hughes was brought back into the fold and the \\"Mothers Talk\\" single re-produced for release in August 1984. A departure from their earlier works, the single became a top-20 hit in the UK, but it was the follow-up single \\"Shout\\" (released in the UK in November 1984) that was the real beginning of the band's international fame. \\"Shout\\", a top-5 UK hit, paved the way for their second album, Songs from the Big Chair (released in February 1985), which entered the UK album chart at No. 2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. They did away with the predominantly synthpop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band's stylistic hallmark. Anchored on the creative hub of Orzabal, Stanley and producer Hughes, the new Tears for Fears sound helped to propel Songs from the Big Chair into becoming one of the year's biggest sellers worldwide, eventually being certified triple platinum in the UK and quintuple platinum in the US (where it remained the No. 1 album for five weeks in the summer of 1985). The album's title was inspired by the book and television miniseries Sybil, the chronicle of a woman with multiple personality disorder who sought refuge in her analyst's \\"big chair\\", Orzabal and Smith stating they felt each of the album's songs had a distinctive personality of its own. The band had also recorded a track titled \\"The Big Chair\\", which was released as the B-side to \\"Shout\\" but was not included on the album. The album's success came in conjunction with the array of hit singles it yielded: \\"Mothers Talk\\" (re- recorded yet again for its US release in 1986), \\"Shout\\" (No. 4 UK, No. 1 in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and a huge hit in other territories), \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" (their highest- charting UK and Irish hit at No. 2 and another No. 1 in the US and in Canada), \\"Head over Heels\\" (UK No. 12, US No. 3, Ireland No. 5, Canada No. 8), and \\"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\\" (UK No. 23 and Ireland No. 10). Some territories even saw the release of limited edition 10\\" singles for these hits, and a variety of double packs and picture discs in addition to the regular 7\\" and 12\\" formats. Following the album's release, the band went on a world tour that lasted most of the year, playing notably at the Montreux Golden Rose Rock and Pop Festival in May 1985. In September 1985, the band performed \\"Shout\\" at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. Also during the tour, Orzabal and Smith discovered an American female singer/pianist, Oleta Adams, who was performing in a Kansas City hotel bar, and whom they invited to collaborate on their next album. Towards the end of the year, the band released a video collection/documentary titled Scenes from the Big Chair. In February 1986, having completed the lengthy and exhausting Big Chair world tour, Tears for Fears were honoured at the 1986 Brit Awards in London, where they won the Best British Single award for \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\". The band was also nominated for Best British Group and Best British Album, and Chris Hughes was nominated for Best Producer. The band performed the song at the ceremony, which became the final public performance of drummer Manny Elias who left the group shortly afterwards. The same year, Orzabal and Stanley worked together on a side project named Mancrab and released a single, \\"Fish for Life\\", which was written for the soundtrack of the film The Karate Kid, Part II. The track was written and produced by Orzabal and Stanley, and featured vocals by US singer/dancer Eddie Thomas, who was one of the dancers in the video for \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\". Live Aid On 13 July 1985, Tears for Fears were scheduled to perform at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia for the Live Aid charity event. However, on the morning of the historic event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear at the event before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group George Thorogood and the Destroyers, which has a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non- appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist Andrew Saunders and saxophonist Will Gregory, had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by Alan Griffiths on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate proceeds from their concerts played in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York. As a further donation, the band also recorded a slightly rewritten version of one of their biggest hits and released it for the British fundraising initiative Sport Aid, a sister project of Band Aid in which people took part in running races of varying length and seriousness to raise more money for African famine relief projects. Sport Aid's slogan was \\"I Ran the World\\", therefore Tears for Fears released \\"Everybody Wants to Run the World\\" (No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in Ireland). Indirectly, the band were involved in the earlier Band Aid single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" from 1984, which featured a slowed down sample from their song \\"The Hurting\\" (from their debut album of the same name) in the introduction. =The Seeds of Love (1987‚Äì1990)= It was 1989 before the group released their third album, The Seeds of Love (on which Ian Stanley appeared for the last time as a member of Tears for Fears), at a reported production cost of over a million pounds. The album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist Nicky Holland, who had toured with the band on their \\"Big Chair\\" world tour in 1985. Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down. The length of the production impacted on the band's management company, who had financially over-extended themselves in other business matters and were hoping for an earlier release date to pay off their debts. The album retained the band's epic sound while showing increasing influences ranging from jazz and blues to the Beatles, the latter being evident on the hit single \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" The second single from the album was \\"Woman in Chains\\" (a top 40 hit in the UK, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the US), on which Phil Collins played drums and Oleta Adams‚Äîwhom Orzabal would later guide to a successful solo career‚Äîshared vocals. The album was a worldwide success, entering the UK Albums Chart at no. 1, making the top 10 in the US and in numerous other countries, eventually going on to sell millions of copies internationally. The band set out on an extensive \\"Seeds of Love\\" world tour sponsored by Philips to start recovering the debt incurred. The band's show in Santa Barbara, California, in May 1990 would be captured on the Going to California live video as the singles \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\" and \\"Famous Last Words\\" delivered modest chart success. A 64-page companion book, simply titled Tears for Fears ‚Äì The Seeds of Love, was released by Virgin Books in 1990 and offered extensive insight from Orzabal, Holland and Adams into the songwriting and production process for the album, as well as the musical scores for each track and rare promotional photographs from the era. =Break-up and solo careers (1991‚Äì1992)= After The Seeds of Love, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious falling out and parted company in 1991. The split was blamed on Orzabal's intricate but frustrating approach to production and Smith's desire to slow down the pace of their work (prior to the release of The Seeds of Love, Smith's marriage had also broken down). Another factor in the break-up was the band's manager, Paul King, who declared bankruptcy in 1990 and was later convicted of fraud. The duo had signed to King's Outlaw Management Agency in 1982 and remained clients throughout the remainder of the decade (the agency also operated the band's fan club, the Tears For Fears World Service, between 1983 and 1986). By the late 1980s, the agency had run into serious debt and, after discrepancies were discovered in King's financial management, Orzabal became increasingly concerned that Smith was unwilling to drop King as their manager. Outlaw folded in 1990 with debts of almost ¬£1 million as King declared bankruptcy. In 2004, following fraudulent activities with his other businesses, King was prosecuted for fraud and imprisoned for three and a half years, as well as being disqualified from being a company director again for ten years. Following Smith's departure, Orzabal kept the band name alive by releasing the 1992 hit single \\"Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)\\". The single was released to promote the band's greatest hits collection Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82‚Äì92), which featured every single to reach the Top 20, either in the UK or internationally, apart from the Sport Aid fundraiser. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK, where it was certified double platinum, and also reached the Top 10 in several other countries, including France, Italy and New Zealand. Smith relocated to New York City, and in 1993 he released his first solo album, Soul on Board. The album was a commercial failure and Smith himself has said on numerous occasions that he despised it, alleging that he only made it to fulfill his recording contract. In 1995, he met local songwriter and producer Charlton Pettus. The two formed a self-described \\"organic\\" partnership, writing simple, melody-based songs and recording them at home on vintage analogue equipment. The result was released in 1997 under the name Mayfield and a short US tour followed. =Second line-up: Elemental and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1993‚Äì1996)= In 1993, Orzabal (still under the name Tears for Fears) released the album Elemental together with longtime collaborator Alan Griffiths. Co-produced by Tim Palmer, it yielded the international hit \\"Break It Down Again\\" (top 20 in the UK, Canada, France, and Italy) and was supported with another successful world tour, including a college tour of the US where \\"Break It Down Again\\" reached no. 25. The album was a top 10 hit in the UK, France and Italy, and top 30 in several other countries. Although it charted considerably lower in the US than the previous two studio albums (no. 45), it still earned a Gold disc there for sales of over half a million copies. The singles \\"Cold\\", \\"Elemental\\" and \\"Goodnight Song\\" met with minor chart success in certain territories. The lyrics to \\"Cold\\" contained a scathing reference to the band's former manager, Paul King, in which Orzabal sings \\"King got caught with his fingers in the till. Where's your calculator ‚Äì did you leave it in your will?\\" Orzabal, still working with Griffiths and Palmer, released another Tears for Fears album, Raoul and the Kings of Spain, in 1995. This was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new Latin musical influence (Raoul was originally the name Orzabal's parents wanted to give him, and is also the name of his own first son). Orzabal stated that it was not a concept album but that there was a theme, namely that of familial relationships. The album also included a reunion with Oleta Adams who duetted with Orzabal on the track \\"Me and My Big Ideas\\". The album was not a commercial success by Tears for Fears standards, though minor chart success came via the single release of the title track (top 40 in the UK) and (to a lesser extent) the single \\"God's Mistake\\". The release of the album had been delayed for nearly a year due to a last-minute label switch from Mercury to Epic (part of Sony Music), and the ensuing confusion (Mercury had already begun promotion) did not help the album's chances either. Although the track listing for the album had been changed at the record company's request, Sony did not extend Tears for Fears' contract following the album's release. A worldwide tour followed, including dates in Latin America, though Orzabal declined to tour his native UK this time except for a single show in London. In 1996 a B-sides collection, Saturnine Martial & Lunatic, was released on Mercury, which included B-sides and some rare tracks from the successful 1982‚Äì93 period. The liner notes, written by Orzabal and Chris Hughes, gave fans an insight into the songwriting process as well as a rare glimpse of self-deprecating humour regarding the tracks they would rather forget. =Remasters and other projects= In 1999, Mercury Records released remastered editions of Tears for Fears' first three albums, including B-sides, remixes, and extended versions. Supervised by producer Chris Hughes, the remasters also included new liner notes for each album providing details and new insights into the music. Due to record company mergers and acquisitions in the late 1990s, Tears for Fears' back catalogue was eventually placed into the Universal Music fold. After undertaking production work and some songwriting for the Icelandic singer-songwriter Emil√≠ana Torrini on her 1999 album Love in the Time of Science, Orzabal re-teamed with Alan Griffiths and released the album Tomcats Screaming Outside, released on Eagle Records as a solo project under his own name. Whereas Tears for Fears' work had become guitar-based, Tomcats Screaming Outside showcased a predominantly electronic style. =Reunion: Everybody Loves a Happy Ending= In 2000, routine paperwork obligations led the duo to re-establish contact with each other after Orzabal signed a business document on Smith's behalf. Smith flew back to England (where Orzabal still lived) and they had dinner and decided to work on a new album together. The songwriting sessions included Charlton Pettus (Smith's collaborator since the mid-1990s), and fourteen songs were written and recorded in less than six months. The ensuing album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, was scheduled for release on Arista Records in late 2003, but a change in management at Arista prompted the band to opt out of their contract and switch to the New Door label (a new offshoot of Universal Music), and delayed the release until September 2004. Two US tours followed, and the 2004 tour included an unrehearsed guest appearance by Oleta Adams at the Kansas City show for a performance of \\"Woman in Chains\\". The song \\"Who Killed Tangerine?\\" was used in the movie Fever Pitch. Everybody Loves a Happy Ending was released in the UK and Europe in March 2005 on Gut Records, shortly after the comeback single \\"Closest Thing to Heaven\\" became the first Tears for Fears UK Top 40 hit in a decade. The promo video for the single was a colourful fantasy that featured Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy riding in a hot air balloon. The European releases of the album contained all fourteen tracks recorded during the ELAHE sessions (the US version only contained twelve), and a brief tour of larger UK venues followed in April. In 2005, the band began discussions with Universal Music for the release of a new comprehensive anthology of their work to date, including a new track titled \\"Floating Down the River\\". However, the subsequent release (at least in the US) was a compilation issued as part of Hip-O Records' generic \\"Gold\\" series, a Universal subsidiary that specialises in budget-priced back catalogue compilations. A live performance at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, recorded in June 2005, was released on CD and DVD in France and Benelux. Titled Secret World ‚Äì Live in Paris, it was released on the XIII Bis label in early 2006 and became a best-seller, with over 70,000 physical copies sold in addition to downloads. The CD contained the aforementioned new studio song, \\"Floating Down the River\\", and a remastered Curt Smith/Mayfield track, \\"What Are We Fighting For?\\". The relationship with XIII Bis proved so successful that Smith chose the comparatively small French label to release his 2007 solo album, Halfway, Pleased. Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith in 2008. In 2006, Songs from the Big Chair was re-issued again by Universal Music, this time as a 2-disc Deluxe Edition with additional B-sides and rarities added, expanding further than the 1999 remastered version. The release did not include the lyrics as the band had intended with the original release, but came with a 24-page booklet including rare photographs and newly written liner notes. The 28-track set contained four sections, with the first disc containing the original album and various B-sides taken from the earlier 1999 remastered edition. It also included the rare piano version of \\"The Working Hour\\", which had previously only been available as a limited edition item. The second disc contained various 7\\" versions of the singles (including the aforementioned \\"The Way You Are\\", the re-recording of \\"I Believe\\" and the 1986 US remix of \\"Mothers Talk\\"), followed by various 12\\" remixes from the era. In August 2009, the Raoul and the Kings of Spain album was also re-issued by Cherry Red Records, featuring seven bonus B-side tracks from the time of its original release. =2010‚Äìpresent= In April 2010, Tears for Fears joined the reformed 1980s group Spandau Ballet on their seven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, before a four-date headlining tour of their own in Southeast Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and a 17-date tour of the United States.. 22 March 2010. In 2011 and 2012, they played dates in the US, Japan, South Korea, Manila and South America. In May 2013, Smith confirmed that he was writing and recording new Tears for Fears material with Orzabal and Charlton Pettus. Several songs were worked on in the UK at Orzabal's home studio, Neptune's Kitchen, in April 2013, and continued in Los Angeles in July 2013. According to Orzabal, they have been producing more dark, dramatic pieces of music. \\"There's one track that's a combination of Portishead and Queen. It's just crazy,\\" Orzabal stated. In August 2013, Tears For Fears released their first newly recorded material in nearly a decade, with a cover of Arcade Fire's \\"Ready to Start\\" made available on SoundCloud. In 2014, the track was included on a limited edition 3-track 10\\" vinyl EP from the band called Ready Boy & Girls?, released exclusively for Record Store Day, which also featured covers of Hot Chip's \\"Boy From School\\" and Animal Collective's \\"My Girls\\". All three songs were recorded as \\"kick-start\\" projects as the band commenced work on their seventh studio album. In an interview on BBC Radio Devon in October 2014, Orzabal stated that the band had now signed to Warner Music Group and that around five or six songs had so far been completed for the new album. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band's debut album The Hurting, Universal Music reissued it in October 2013 in two Deluxe Editions (one a 2-disc set and the other a 4-disc set with a DVD of the 1983 In My Mind's Eye concert). Deluxe Editions of the band's second album, Songs From The Big Chair, were released on 10 November 2014 including a 6-disc set that features various rarities and two DVDs (one audio, one video). On 12 November 2014, Tears for Fears performed \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! TV programme. In mid 2015, the band began a series of live dates in the US and Canada. In July 2016, the band played their first live dates in the UK in over ten years: the Newmarket Nights festival at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 July,; and a closing night headlining appearance at Camp Bestival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 31 July. The gigs marked the band's first UK festival appearances since Knebworth in 1990. The band again toured the US and Canada in September and October 2016. In 2017, the band toured North America with co-headliners Hall & Oates, and also played in Israel, at the British Summer Time Festival in London's Hyde Park on 8 July, and at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil on 22 September. In a July 2017 interview, Orzabal stated that the band had collaborated with songwriter/producer Sacha Skarbek on their new album tentatively titled The Tipping Point, and divulged several song titles from it including \\"My Demons\\", \\"I Love You But I'm Lost\\", \\"End of Night\\" and \\"Up Above the World\\". In an interview with SiriusXM Canada the same month, Orzabal divulged that although the band had signed with Warner Music to release their new album (which had been scheduled for October 2017), Universal Music had then approached Warner Music about buying the rights to the album so that they could release it (Universal being the rights holders of the vast majority of the band's back catalogue). On 26 October 2017, the band performed a 65-minute live set at the BBC Radio Theatre in London for the Radio 2 in Concert series, which was broadcast on both radio and television (via the BBC Red Button service). The following night, the band played their first full-length UK concert since 2005, at London's Royal Albert Hall. Prior to this, on 12 October, \\"I Love You But I'm Lost\\" was released as a single from a new 16-track Tears For Fears compilation album titled Rule The World - The Greatest Hits. The compilation was released by Universal Music on 10 November 2017, and includes fourteen Top 40 hits from all six previous Tears For Fears albums along with two new tracks. In October 2017, the band announced an 11-date UK arena tour for April‚ÄìMay 2018, featuring Alison Moyet as the support act. However, the tour was postponed to early 2019 due to unspecified health reasons. The band performed at further UK and European festivals in Summer 2019, starting with the Hampton Court Palace Festival on 18 and 19 June, the Forest Live festival at Delamere Forest on 21 June, and the Nocturne Live Concert Series at Blenheim Palace on 22 June. In February 2020, the band's Songs from the Big Chair was the subject of an episode of the BBC series Classic Albums featuring new interviews with the band and all key personnel from the album's creation and subsequent success. To coincide with the album's 35th anniversary, the 2014 deluxe boxed set was reissued by Universal Music, as well as a new 12-inch vinyl picture disc of the album.

Phoca hispida), is an earless seal inhabiting the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The ringed seal is a relatively small seal, rarely greater than 1.5 m in length, with a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light grey rings, hence its common name. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the Northern Hemisphere: ranging throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and include two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the primary prey of polar bears and killer whales, and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic. Names Another name is jar seal. It is known as netsik or nattiq by the Inuit. Description backflippers The ringed seal is the smallest and most common seal in the Arctic, with a small head, short cat-like snout, and a plump body. Its coat is dark with silver rings on the back and sides with a silver belly, from which this seal gets its vernacular name. Depending on subspecies and condition, adult size can range from and weigh from . (2011). The seal averages about long with a weight of about . This species is usually considered the smallest species in the true seal family, although several related species, especially the Baikal seal, may approach similarly diminutive dimensions. Their small front flippers have claws more than thick that are used to maintain breathing holes through thick ice. Taxonomy and phylogeny The taxonomy of ringed seal has been much debated and revised in the literature. Due to its wide range, as many as ten subspecies have been described. Currently, five distinct subspecies are recognized: P. h. hispida in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea, P. h. ochotensis in the Sea of Okhotsk, P. h. saimensis in Lake Saimaa in Finland, P. h. ladogensis in nearby Lake Ladoga in Russia and P.h. botnica in the Gulf of Bothnia. The ringed seal is most closely related to the Caspian seal (P. caspica) and Baikal seal (P. sibirica), all of which share similar small sizes, features of skull morphology and affinity for ice. The closest phylogenetic relatives to the genus Pusa are the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and the species in the genus Phoca (the harbor seal and largha seal), in which ringed seals were formerly classified. Together with the remaining northern latitude ice seals (ribbon seal, bearded seal, harp seal and hooded seal), these seals constitute the subfamily Phocinae. Range and habitat Ringed seals occur throughout the Arctic Ocean. They can be found in the Baltic Sea, the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay. They prefer to rest on ice floe and will move farther north for denser ice. Two subspecies, P. h. saimensis and ladogensis, can be found in freshwater. Ringed seals have a circumpolar distribution from approximately 35¬∞N to the North Pole, occurring in all seas of the Arctic Ocean. In the North Pacific, they are found in the southern Bering Sea and range as far south as the seas of Okhotsk and Japan. Throughout their range, ringed seals have an affinity for ice-covered waters and are well adapted to occupying seasonal and permanent ice. They tend to prefer large floes (i.e., > 48 m in diameter) and are often found in the interior ice pack where the sea ice coverage is greater than 90%. They remain in contact with ice most of the year and pup on the ice in late winter-early spring. Distribution in Alaska: Ringed seals are found throughout the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas, as far south as Bristol Bay in years of extensive ice coverage. During late April through June, ringed seals are distributed throughout their range from the southern ice edge northward. Preliminary results from recent surveys conducted in the Chukchi Sea in May‚ÄìJune 1999 and 2000 indicate that ringed seal density is higher in nearshore fast and pack ice, and lower in offshore pack ice. Results of surveys conducted by Frost and Lowry (1999) indicate that, in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, the density of ringed seals in May‚ÄìJune is higher to the east than to the west of Flaxman Island. The overall winter distribution is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the ice edge in late spring and summer. Thus, ringed seals occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi seas in winter apparently are migratory, but details of their movements are unknown. Ringed seals reside in arctic waters and are commonly associated with ice floes and pack ice. The ringed seal maintains a breathing hole in the ice thus allowing it to use ice habitat that other seals cannot. Life history Pup of ringed seal. Females reach sexual maturity at 4 years while males do not reach maturity until 7 years old. During the spring breeding season, females construct lairs within the thick ice and give birth in these structures. Females give birth to a single pup on ice floes or shorefast ice in March or April after a 9-month gestation period. Pups are weaned after one month and build up a thick layer of blubber. Females usually begin mating in late April. Males will roam the ice for a mate. When found, the male and female may spend several days together before mating. Then the male looks for another mate. Ringed seals live about 25 to 30 years. They are solitary animals and when hauled out on ice separate themselves from each other by hundreds of yards. Ecology =Diet= Ringed seals eat a wide variety of small prey that consists of 72 species of fish and invertebrates. Feeding is usually a solitary behavior and their prey of choice includes mysids, shrimp, arctic cod, and herring. While feeding, ringed seals dive to depths of . In the summer ringed seals feed along edge of the sea-ice for polar cod. In shallow water they feed on smaller cod. Ringed seals may also eat herring, smelt, whitefish, sculpin, perch, and crustaceans. =Predators= Ringed seal are an important food item in particular for polar bears.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Bear: Ursus maritimus, globalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg During the pupping season, Arctic fox and glaucous gulls take ringed seal pups born outside lairs while killer whales, Greenland sharks and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water. Human interactions Preparation of the ringed seal skin of the ringed seal. Ringed seals have long been an important component of the diet of Arctic indigenous peoples throughout their range, and continue to be harvested annually by many communities. Early Paleoeskimo sites in Arctic Canada revealed signs of harvested ringed seals dating from c. 4000‚Äì3500 BP, likely captured in frozen cracks and leads in the ice, with a selection for juveniles and young adults.Murray, M. S. (2005). \\"Prehistoric Use of Ringed Seals: A zooarchaeological Study from Arctic Canada\\". Environmental Archaeology 10 (1): 19-38 In 2012 the Government of Nunavut warned pregnant women to avoid eating ringed seal liver due to elevated levels of mercury, although they stressed eating traditional \\"country food\\" is still healthy for adults.Study says ringed seal liver dangerous for pregnant women Bycatch in fishing gear, such as commercial trawls, is a threat to ringed seals. Climate change is potentially the most serious threat to ringed seal populations since much of their habitat is dependent upon pack ice. = Conservation in the United States = The estimated population size for the Alaska stock of ringed seals is 249,000 animals. In 2010 the trend in numbers for this population was unknown. Ringed seals are listed as a species of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN, and were considered 'not threatened' under the Endangered Species Act in 2006. Reliable estimates of the minimum population, potential biological removal and human-caused mortality were not available in 2006. The level of annual U.S. commercial fishery-related mortality or injury was considered insignificant. The Alaska stock of ringed seals is not considered a strategic fishery stock. In 2008 the US National Marine Fisheries Service began a conservation status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this seal under the ESA is warranted.(28 March 2008). \\"Proposed Rules\\". Federal Register 73(61). Subspecies Photo of Pusa hispida saimensis, also known as Saimaa Ringed Seal, from 1956 The populations living in different areas have evolved to separate subspecies, which are currently recognized as: * Pusa hispida hispida: Arctic coasts of Europe, Russia, Canada and Alaska, including Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen, Greenland and Baffin Island. * Pusa hispida ochotensis: Kamchatka, Okhotsk Sea and southward to 35¬∞N, along the Japanese Pacific coast. * Pusa hispida botnica (validity questionable): The Baltic Sea, especially in the Bothnian Bay where there is a large population, but there are also populations in the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga and the Archipelago Sea. A publication from the HELCOM organisation classified P. h. botnica as 'vulnerable' in 2013. * Pusa hispida ladogensis (Ladoga seal) Lake Ladoga * Pusa hispida saimensis (Saimaa ringed seal). Lives only in Lake Saimaa in Finland and is one of the most threatened seals in the world with a total population of around 400 individuals.

The town was named after the Scottish town of Rutherglen which lies just outside Glasgow. At the , Rutherglen had a population of 2,109. Features Rutherglen Wine Experience & Visitor Centre Rutherglen is located north of Wangaratta and west of Wodonga, just 10 kilometres from the Murray River at the border towns of Wahgunyah and Corowa. Originally a gold-mining town of the mid-19th century, it has since developed into a major wine-producing area, with 17 wineries all located within a short drive from the town centre, the best of which are highly regarded by wine critics (Halliday, Parker). The Muscat and Topaque (formerly known as Tokay) wines are sometimes described as having no worldwide equal. The region also produces a good Port style of fortified wine. The largest winery in the region is the All Saints Winery, located just a short drive north-west outside of Wahgunyah. Established in 1864, it features landscaped gardens, ponds, a restaurant and wine tasting facilities. The Rutherglen Wine Experience Visitor Information Centre, located in the town centre on Main Street, offers displays of the town's rich history, how wines are made, and comprehensive tourist information. The main street of Rutherglen maintains its historical charm, with most of the shop fronts retaining the same look they had a century ago. Attractions within the town include Lake King which is surrounded by Apex Park and Rutherglen Park, as well as the historical wine-bottle-shaped water tower in Campbell Street. History Rutherglen Post Office opened on 1 November 1860. The Rutherglen Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. Wine The Rutherglen wine region is a wine- producing area around the town of Rutherglen and is particularly noted for its sweet fortified wines. Sport The town in conjunction with nearby town Corowa has an Australian Rules football team (Corowa-Rutherglen) competing in the Ovens & Murray Football League. Another Australian rules football team, Rutherglen Football Club, play in the Tallangatta & District Football League. Golfers play at the course of the Rutherglen Golf Club on Murray Street.

Rydderch ‚Äì pronounced 'rutherch' ‚Äì 'ruther' as in 'brother' and 'ch' as in 'loch' ‚Äì was one of the most famous kings associated with the Welsh-speaking kingdom which centred on Dumbarton. Governance Rutherglen Town Hall =Westminster= A separate constituency in the Parliament of Scotland from the late 16th century, Rutherglen was a parliamentary burgh represented in the UK Parliament as a component of Glasgow Burghs constituency from 1708 to 1832, and as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs from 1832 to 1918. In 1918, the Rutherglen constituency was created, which became Glasgow Rutherglen in 1983. In 2005, Scottish constituencies for the UK parliament were reviewed with many new seats introduced, and the town is now within the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. Following the 2019 election, Margaret Ferrier of the Scottish National Party is the local MP,Election 2019: Rutherglen & Hamilton West BBC News, 13 December 2019 replacing Gerard Killen of Scottish Labour who in 2017 had narrowly defeated incumbent Ferrier, herself originally elected in 2015. =Holyrood= In 1999, the Scottish Parliamentary constituency of Glasgow Rutherglen was created, with the same boundaries as the then UK parliamentary constituency.

Taking another ward encompassing the southern parts of the town into consideration, its overall population was approximately 30,000 in 2016.

There are also numerous bus links into Glasgow city centre or other destinations such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Govanhill and Dennistoun, all services either running directly along the Main Street (which has dedicated public transport lanes for peak times) or close to it via Mill Street / Glasgow Road (A730) to the west or Stonelaw Road / Farmeloan Road (A749) to the east. Glasgow Corporation Tramways operated routes in the area from the early 1900s until the late 1950s. Completion of the M74 Extension in 2011 meant that there is a six-lane motorway bisecting the northern part of the town, allowing easier access to places such as Glasgow Airport and the English border. Some years after the project was completed, studies show that pollution levels on Rutherglen's densely populated Main Street were still measured consistently at dangerously high levels, despite forecasts that traffic levels on urban streets in areas served by the motorway would reduce.Rutherglen made an Air Quality Management Area after pollution levels exceed national guidelines, Daily Record, 14 December 2015Rutherglen named as pollution hotspot, Daily Record, 7 February 2018Rutherglen town centre listed as one of South Lanarkshire's worst areas for air pollution, Daily Record, 28 January 2020 Media The local newspaper is the Rutherglen Reformer.

Geography Map of central Rutherglen published in 1923 The Royal Burgh of Rutherglen has expanded over the years and now encompasses many other neighbourhoods, the majority built after World War II on land which was either farms or rural estates.Military Maps of Scotland (18th century): Roy Lowlands, 1752-55, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland)Northern Part of Lanarkshire. Southern Part. Top section, John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832 (National Library of Scotland) Since being granted Royal Burgh status by King David I in the 12th century, the town has grown considerably from its origins as little more than a single street, and although growth has been hampered to some extent by the proximity of the river to the north and the encroaching Glasgow urban sprawl to the west, it now covers a much larger area than the initial Burgh boundaries,OS National Grid Maps, 1944-1967, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) OS Six-inch 1st edition, 1843-1882, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) although the aforementioned restrictions mean its administrative centre with the majority of facilities and the highest population density is concentrated at the north of its overall territory rather than towards the geographic centre (neighbouring Cambuslang has a similar issue: its town centre is in the far west of its territory, with its boundaries with Rutherglen and the river preventing any expansion in those directions). Historic areas such as Farme Cross, Bankhead and Gallowflat have changed greatly over the years and the village of Burnside (which falls under the Rutherglen boundary but has its own Community Council) also expanded to share a single suburban settlement with its larger neighbour. More recent post-war developments at Newfield and Burnhill within the older part of town, plus those on the peripheries including Blairbeth, Cathkin, Eastfield, Fernhill, Spittal and Springhall have given the town a frequently changing character. Other than some shopping areas and the large industrial estates in Farme Cross and Shawfield, the neighbourhoods referred to are residential in type; the 1922 book Rutherglen Lore indicates a deliberate intention for the historic Burgh area to be encircled to the south by residential suburbs, while all land to its north would be dedicated to industry, and that remains the case a century later. =Burgh (Main Street) and Clincarthill= The Burgh area includes the old heart of the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen around the ancient and unusually wide, tree-lined Main Street and its environs, which have been designated a conservation area since 2008.Rutherglen Conservation Area: Character Appraisal, South Lanarkshire Council, 2008 It features several religious establishments, various pubs, shops and restaurants, historic and modern civic buildings and community facilities, all within a dense network of housing, mainly tenements.

A large flat grass field to the west of the neighbourhood was popular in the summer months for football, buts its size was greatly reduced by a junction re-alignment in 2016, connecting Croftfoot Road and Blairbeth Road - previously a staggered junction via Fernhill Road with single lanes causing considerable congestion at peak times - into a single crossroads with filter lanes, as part of the Cathkin Relief Road works.

Biography =Early years= Steve Norman was born in Stepney, east London and was considered a musical child prodigy. He started pursuing an interest in popular music as a guitarist in a Dame Alice Owen's School band called The Cut with Gary Kemp, Tony Hadley and John Keeble in 1976. The band was later named The Makers, The Gentry and then Spandau Ballet. =Spandau Ballet= Spandau Ballet signed with Chrysalis Records. By the third Spandau Ballet album, Norman brought percussion to the mix and introduced the alto saxophone, which has since become his signature instrument. With Spandau Ballet, Norman toured the globe and continued to have hits throughout the 1980s. In 1985 Norman appeared with the band at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium. Because of a dispute over royalties, the band split up in the early 1990s. After a 20-year hiatus, newspaper reports claimed early in 2009 that Spandau Ballet was set to reform later that year. On 25 March 2009, Norman, Gary Kemp, Martin Kemp, Tony Hadley and John Keeble announced their reunion at a press conference on board . The band also announced their 'Reformation Tour' starting in October 2009. Norman co-wrote the song \\"Once More\\" which became the first new Spandau Ballet single in 20 years. =After Spandau Ballet= Spandau Ballet at Echo Arena Liverpool, November 2009 In the early 1990s after the band went their separate ways, Norman moved to Ibiza and took some time off from performing. During his time on the island, Norman collaborated with numerous musicians and producers who lived there, including Lenny Krarup, Nacho Sotomayor, Stefan Zauner and DJ Pippi. Norman also worked with Rafa Peletey on various projects, including Funky Jack's \\"Saxomatic\\" percussion mix. Norman also sourced and compiled the music for the Made in Ibiza Chills n' Thrills compilation album and co-compiled A Journey Through Savannah with Peletey for their record label, Island Pulse Records. Norman continued to play live at house music events throughout the UK and on the international club scene, performing with his saxophone, or occasionally percussion alongside such musicians as Byron Stingily of Ten City, Frankie Knuckles, Angie Brown, Steve Edwards, Alison Limerick, Jeremy Healy and Brandon Block. Norman formed a partnership with Hed Kandi, DJ John Jones and Martin Ikin from Soul Purpose called 'The Collective'. Their first production was a re-working of Joe Smooth's \\"Promised Land\\" featuring Peyton on lead vocals and Shelley Preston (formerly of Bucks Fizz) on backing vocals. In 2013, Norman played on three tracks on Bruce Foxton's album, Back in the Room. He also played on James Stevenson's album Everything's Getting Closer To Being Over released in 2014. Norman has performed at various concerts in aid of The Prince's Trust charity. He also played at the \\"Free Nelson Mandela Concert\\" some years later along with Tony Hadley. =Cloudfish= In 2001, Norman and Rafa Peletey formed a production team called Cloudfish and invited Shelley Preston to provide the vocals. As a result, Cloudfish became a band with Norman, Preston and Peletey writing and producing their own songs. Peletey left in 2003 to front his own band, joining up with Norman and Preston from time to time. Cloudfish have continued to write, produce and perform and were featured artists on the eponymous CD of the Italian quintet, Quintessenza. Cloudfish sold out a number of concerts including the one at Ronnie Scott's. Their song \\"So High\\" was included on the CD compilation, Dome Ibiza: The Chillout Session Vol. 2. Personal life Norman writes a regular column reviewing CDs for the magazine, Ibiza Now. He is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur F.C..

Her first recordings‚Äî\\"Salty Papa Blues\\", \\"Evil Gal Blues\\", \\"Blow Top Blues\\", and \\"Long, Long Journey\\"‚Äîwere produced by Leonard Feather in 1944, placing her in the company of clarinetist Barney Bigard and tenor saxophonist Georgie Auld.

She had three Grammy nominations: for the Don't Go to Strangers album in 1960, the Save Your Love for Me album in 1981, and My Buddy (dedicated to her first employer, Buddy Johnson) in 1998. In 2008 the album Don't Go to Strangers was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.2008 Grammy Hall of Fame List Following her recordings for Prestige, on which Jones was featured with high-profile arrangers such as Oliver Nelson and jazz stars such as Frank Wess, Roy Haynes, and Gene Ammons, she had a musical partnership of more than 30 years with tenor saxophonist Houston Person, who received equal billing with her. He also produced her albums and served as her manager after the pair met in one of Johnny \\"Hammond\\" Smith's bands. Although Etta Jones is likely to be remembered above all for her recordings on Prestige, her close professional relationship with Person (frequently, but mistakenly, identified as Jones' husband) helped ensure that the last two decades of her life would be marked by uncommon productivity, evidenced by a string of albums for Muse Records. In 1996, she recorded The Melody Lingers On, the first of five sessions for the HighNote label. Her last recording, a tribute to Billie Holiday, was released on the day of Jones' death. Only one of her recordings‚Äîher debut album for Prestige Records (Don't Go to Strangers, 1960)‚Äîenjoyed commercial success with sales of over 1 million copies. Her remaining seven albums for Prestige, and beginning in 1976, her 12 recordings for Muse Records, and seven recordings for HighNote Records secured her a devoted following. She died in Mount Vernon, New York at the age of 72 from cancer. She was survived by her husband, John Medlock, and a granddaughter.

The house, located near Lewes in East Sussex, England, is thought to be about six hundred years old and listed at grade II.Kennedy, p. 5  History of the house  \\"There had been a manor house at Glynde Bourne (as it was often spelt) since the fifteenth century\\", but the exact age of the house is unknown. Some surviving timber framing and pre-Elizabethan panelling makes an early sixteenth-century date the most likely.Kennedy, p. 6, notes in a caption of a 1756 watercolour: \\"The original fifteenth century house is almost hidden behind the imposing addition\\" In 1618, it came into the possession of the Hay family, passing to James Hay Langham in 1824. He inherited his father's baronetcy and estate in Northamptonshire in 1833 which under the terms of his inheritance should have led to him relinquishing Glyndebourne, but as a certified lunatic he was unable to do so. After litigation the estate passed to a relative, Mr Langham Christie, but he later had to pay ¬£50,000 to persuade another relative to withdraw a rival claim. Langham Christie's son, William Langham Christie, made substantial alterations to the house in the 1870s. First, a brick extension hid its seventeenth-century facade, while ornate stonework and balustrading was added. Then, in 1876, the architect Ewan Christian was engaged to install bay windows and add decorative brickwork to give the house the Jacobethan appearance which can still be seen from the gardens today. Some of the exterior of the older parts of the house can be seen from the driveway next to the theatre. Origins of the opera house John Christie obtained the use of the house in 1913 after the death of William Langham Christie, his grandfather. He came into full legal possession of the estate in 1920. Among other renovations, he added to the house an organ room, long, in the process almost doubling the length of the south facade of the house. This room contained one of the largest organs outside of a cathedral in the country. It was built by the firm of Hill, Norman & Beard Ltd (bought by Christie in 1923). After the Second World War, John Christie made a gift of sections of the soundboards, pipes and structural parts to the rebuilt Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks (which had been destroyed in the Blitz); the case and console remain at Glyndebourne. John Christie's fondness for music led him to hold regular amateur opera evenings in this room. At one of these evenings in 1931, he met his future wife, the Sussex-born Canadian soprano Audrey Mildmay, a singer with the Carl Rosa Opera company who had been engaged to add a touch of professionalism to the proceedings.Kennedy, p. 7 They were married on 4 June 1931. During their honeymoon, they attended the Salzburg and Bayreuth festivals, which gave them the idea of bringing professional opera to Glyndebourne, although Christie's original concept was for it to be similar to the Bayreuth Festival.Susan Aspen, \\"Pastoral Retreats: Playing at Arcadia in Modern Britain\\", Susan Aspen, ed., Operatic Geographies: The Place of Opera and the Opera House, Chicago University Press, 2019, 195-212, p. 201. As their ideas evolved, the concept changed to focus on smaller-scale productions of operas by Mozart more suited to the intimate scale of the planned theatre. The first theatre The organ room, 1 August 2006 As an annex to the organ room, the Christies built a fully equipped and up-to-date theatre with a 300-seat auditorium and an orchestra pit capable of holding a symphony orchestra. Christie engaged conductor Fritz Busch as the first music director, Carl Ebert, the Intendant of Berlin's St√§dtische Oper as artistic director, and Rudolf Bing became general manager until 1949. All three men were exiles from Nazi Germany. After extensive rehearsals, the first six-week season opened on 28 May 1934 with a performance of Le nozze di Figaro followed by Cos√¨ fan tutte. Boyd Neel had conducted the first music heard in the renovated Glyndebourne opera house in 1934, in private performances, at John Christie's invitation.The Gramophone, July 1972, p. 178 John Christie's original theatre was soon enlarged and improved many times after its initial construction. As early as 1936 its capacity was increased to 433; by 1952 it held nearly 600, and finally, in 1977, it held 850 people. In addition, a rehearsal hall was constructed. Productions were interrupted by the Second World War, during which time the house became an evacuation centre for children from London. After 1945 the Festival slowly began again. Until 1951, the entire burden of financing the opera festival was undertaken by John Christie himself, but, in 1952, the Glyndebourne Festival Society was formed to take over the financial management. Christie's death in 1962 resulted in his son George (later Sir George) taking over, and additional changes and improvements to the theatre continued. Hill, Norman and Beard built the pipe organ in 1924, and it gradually expanded over the years. John Christie owned a considerable share in the company. Currently, the organ is a gutted shell, the pipes having been donated to various churches for the construction of new organs after World War II. The organ originally contained 4 manuals and 46 stops, but this was eventually expanded to 106 stops, unusual for an English-built organ in having multiple diapason chorus ranks of pipes. A short semi-documentary film was made in 1955 entitled On Such a Night, featuring excerpts from that year's production of Le nozze di Figaro and with glimpses of John Christie, Vittorio Gui and Carl Ebert, interwoven with fictional story about an American going there for the first time.Milnes, Rodney. 'On Such A Night' - Rodney Milnes rediscovers a Glyndbourne gem. Opera, 2010 Festivals Issue, page 44-47. The present theatre Interior of the present Glyndebourne Opera House, 2008 By the late 1980s the theatre's expansion, which had proceeded in a somewhat piecemeal fashion, included an agglomeration of outbuildings which housed restaurants, dressing rooms, storage and other facilities. It became clear to George Christie that a completely new theatre - and not just an enlargement of the old one - was necessary. Having chosen the architects Michael and Patty Hopkins of Hopkins Architects in a design competition, Christie announced in 1990 that a new theatre, capable of seating 1,200 people, would be constructed in 1992. The balcony of the present theatre The old theatre hosted its last festival in 1992, and construction of a brand-new 1,200-seat theatre was under way. It was completed at a cost of ¬£34 million, 90 per cent of which was raised through donations, which gave the donors control of 28% of the seats. The inaugural performance in the new theatre on 28 May 1994, given sixty years to the day after the old theatre's first performance, was Le nozze di Figaro.Kennedy, p. 50 The design of the theatre, a large brick oval building, has resulted in a four-level, horseshoe-shaped auditorium with main level seating, two balconies, and a gallery topped with a circular roof. The over sixty-foot-high stage building is semi-circular in shape and allows for the efficient flying and storage of scenery. The acoustics, by Derek Sugden and Rob Harris of Arup Acoustics, have received praise. Education Since its establishment in 1986, Glyndebourne's Education department has undertaken an array of projects within the local community. Schools around the Sussex and Kent area often visit the venue for performances and workshops. Youth opera projects are also undertaken such as the recent production of Knight Crew for 14- to 19-year-olds and the previous Hip H'Opera project in 2006 - timed to coincide with the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. The department has also worked with HMP Lewes since 1988 in projects such as inmate-designed puppet shows influenced by works such as Verdi's Falstaff. Wind turbine Glyndebourne has featured windmills for many years. A post-mill, erected in 1706, was used until 1921, but collapsed in 1925, and the trestle timbers were blown down in 1964. Glyndebourne applied for planning permission to Lewes District Council in January 2007. The council granted permission in July 2007, but the decision was called in by the Secretary of State because of the wider implications of the proposal for renewable energy development in the South Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and strong opposition from countryside protection groups and local residents. On 10 July 2008 the Secretary of State granted planning permission. In 2008-9 Glyndebourne erected a temporary 50m mast on Mill Plain to monitor meteorological conditions for a year, prior to erection of the turbine. The data collected showed lower wind levels than had been predicted at this location, perhaps because 2008-9 had lower wind levels than usual. The turbine was launched in January 2012, and generated 89% of the company's electricity requirements in the first 12 months, up to 31 January 2013.

He is especially remembered for his cool swinging solos as a member of the Modern Jazz Quartet and his penchant for collaborating with several hard bop and post-bop players. A very expressive player, Jackson differentiated himself from other vibraphonists in his attention to variations on harmonics and rhythm. He was particularly fond of the twelve-bar blues at slow tempos. He preferred to set the vibraphone's oscillator to a low 3.3 revolutions per second (as opposed to Lionel Hampton's speed of 10 revolutions per second) for a more subtle tremolo. On occasion, Jackson sang and played piano professionally. Biography Jackson was born on January 1, 1923 in Detroit, Michigan, United States, the son of Manley Jackson and Lillie Beaty Jackson. Like many, he was surrounded by music from an early age, particularly that of religious meetings: \\"Everyone wants to know where I got that funky style. Well, it came from church. The music I heard was open, relaxed, impromptu soul music\\" (quoted in Nat Hentoff's liner notes to Plenty, Plenty Soul). He started on guitar when he was seven, then on piano at 11. While attending Miller High School, he played drums in addition to timpani and violin and also sang in the choir. At 16, he sang professionally in a local touring gospel quartet called the Evangelist Singers. He took up the vibraphone at 16 after hearing Lionel Hampton play the instrument in Benny Goodman's band. Jackson was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie, who hired him for his sextet in 1945, then his larger ensembles. Jackson quickly acquired experience working with the most important figures in jazz of the era, including Woody Herman, Howard McGhee, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie Parker. In the Gillespie big band, Jackson fell into a pattern that led to the founding of the Modern Jazz Quartet: Gillespie maintained a former swing tradition of a small group within a big band, and his included Jackson, pianist John Lewis, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Kenny Clarke (considered a pioneer of the ride cymbal timekeeping that became the signature for bop and most jazz to follow) while the brass and reeds took breaks. When they decided to become a working group in their own right, around 1950, the foursome was known at first as the Milt Jackson Quartet, becoming the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) in 1952. By that time Percy Heath had replaced Ray Brown. Known at first for featuring Jackson's blues-heavy improvisations almost exclusively, in time the group came to split the difference between these and Lewis's more ambitious musical ideas (Lewis had become the group's musical director by 1955, the year Clarke departed in favour of Connie Kay), boiling the quartet down to a chamber jazz style that highlighted the lyrical tension between Lewis's mannered, but roomy, compositions and Jackson's unapologetic swing. The MJQ had a long independent career of some two decades until disbanding in 1974, when Jackson split with Lewis. The group reformed in 1981, however, and continued until 1993, after which Jackson toured alone, performing in various small combos, although agreeing to periodic MJQ reunions. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Jackson recorded for Norman Granz's Pablo Records, including Jackson, Johnson, Brown & Company (1983), featuring Jackson with J. J. Johnson on trombone, Ray Brown on bass, backed by Tom Ranier on piano, guitarist John Collins, and drummer Roy McCurdy. In 1989, Jackson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.Mattingly, Rick. \\"Milt Jackson\\". PAS Hall of Fame. Percussive Arts Society. Pas.org; retrieved March 25, 2018. His composition \\"Bags' Groove\\" is a jazz standard (\\"Bags\\" was a nickname given to him by a bass player in Detroit. \\"Bags\\" referred to the bags under his eyes). He was featured on the NPR radio program Jazz Profiles. Some of his other signature compositions include \\"The Late, Late Blues\\" (for his album with Coltrane, Bags & Trane), \\"Bluesology\\" (an MJQ staple), and \\"Bags & Trane\\". Jackson died of liver cancer in Manhattan, New York, at the age of 76. He was married to Sandra Whittington from 1959 until his death; the couple had a daughter. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Milt Jackson among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

For example, it is claimed by the manufacturers of oat cereals that oat bran can reduce cholesterol, which will lower the chances of developing serious heart conditions. Vague health claims include that the food inside is \\"healthy\\", \\"organic\\", \\"low fat\\", \\"non-GMO\\", \\"no sugar added\\", or \\"natural\\". Health claims are also made for over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs, medical procedures, and medical devices, but these generally have a separate, much more stringent set of regulations.  United States  In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as a separate type of consumer item from food or over-the-counter drugs. =Food= Objections by consumer advocates The use of the label ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù on a variety of foods has been a particular issue for many food quality advocacy groups. In their comments to the FDA, The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) urged FDA officials to address the incongruity between current dietary recommendation/nutritional standards and their definition, CSPI argued that the current definition is too ambiguous and sets a low health standard that allows processed foods with minimal and low nutritional value to use this definition to entice consumers into making poor health choices.The Center for Science In The Public Interest. (2017, April 26). ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù Definition Should Steer Consumers to Fruits & Vegetables: CSPI. Retrieved from Center for Science in the Public Interest website:https://cspinet.org/news/%E2%80%9Chealthy%E2%80%9D-definition-should- steer-consumers-fruits-vegetables-cspi-20170426 The CSPI claimed that the FDA's current guidance on this issue could be potentially misleading and could incline customers to consume unhealthy foods without making informed decisions. CSPI and their research suggested that a new standard and more adequate definition should make it more difficult for processed food brands to obtain and misuse the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food label, ultimately giving consumers a better ability to make informed decisions based on the nutritional and health quality of the food they consume as opposed to relatively unsubstantiated claims. In addition to using the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food label to draw customers to low nutrition foods, food marketers have used a variety of ‚Äúlow content,‚Äù like low fat, low calorie, etc. claims to assuage consumer's health concerns and to potentially mislead them. ‚ÄúLow content‚Äù claims are labels or other advertised claims that appear on packages and or in advertisements are used so that consumers perceive the products they buy as being healthier or more nutritious. Misleading food health assertions of this nature are both widespread in food marketing and also not reflective of the actual nutritional or health quality of the food or beverage in question. These claims are not consistent among all food and beverage groups, although some of them do accurately represent the nutritional and or health benefits of a certain food or beverage, often this does not guarantee that all claims across all beverages and foods are reflective of actual nutrition. Additionally, even if a certain product is in fact low fat or any one of the different types of ‚Äúlow content‚Äù claims, consumers often focus on the claim and neglect other health considerations like added sugars, calories, and other unhealthy ingredients. The Food industry constantly confuses consumers. Some of the basic reasons why people are misled is because terms such as natural, non-GMO, trans-fat free, or kosher do not have consistent definitions for consumers to follow. Without clear standards or definitions, these claims are not informative of the true nutritional content of the food in question. Non-GMO products are often mistaken for organic, just because it is certified as non-GMO. Conventionally raised crops like corn, canola, and soy may be certified non-GMO if they are grown without genetically engineered seeds. Many snack chips being sold in stores use non-GMO ingredients grown with chemical pesticides. Non-GMO does not mean certified non-GMO. Many food products and nutritional products claim to be non-GMO but do not provide certification of that status. Any company that self-proclaims its products to be non-GMO has to back it up with certification. Trans-Fat Free does not mean the food is free from trans fats. In fact, in the U.S. alone, the FDA currently allows foods containing up to 0.5g of trans fats per serving to claim zero grams of trans fats per serving, which is completely misleading. Choosing one food item over another for reasons such as products claiming they are all natural or fat free do not always mean it is healthier. The FDA does not define ‚Äúnatural‚Äù but if labeled so, the food must not contain added colors, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances. However, foods labeled natural can contain preservatives. Companies will argue that natural products that contain high fructose corn syrup are healthy because it comes from corn. No sugar added items are often bought but also not fully understood. Foods like fruit, milk, cereals, and vegetables naturally contain sugar. Although there may not have been added sugar, they still contain natural sugars. These sugar free products may contain added ingredients like maltodextrin, which is a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates may be simple sugars or complex starches that can raise blood sugar. Just because ‚Äúno sugar added‚Äù is labeled does not mean the product is calorie free or carbohydrate free which most consumers often misunderstand. Most consumers are ignorant about the actual nutritional content of their foods and heavily rely on the food labels and claims that are provided on packages. This over-reliance on a variety of different claims has many implications including uninformed customer purchases and over-consumption of unhealthy foods.  FDA guidelines  The FDA has guidelines for what is considered a misleading label. There are rules for the size of the font and what to name food products. The name must include what the food actually is, that means if the food is canned carrots the can must have Carrots on the label. If an official name for the food does not exist, then the label must give the consumer some idea of what the food contains. The FDA states the name should be a ‚Äústatement of identity,‚Äù meaning the company cannot make up a new name for an already existing food. A product must be called an imitation if its nutritional values are significantly different than the original food. With beverage brands advertising as juice, the beverage must have a high content of the fruit or vegetable in the juice. The name of the juice must be from its more prominent fruit or vegetable by volume. For example, Coca-Cola tried to sell pomegranate juice which had only .3% pomegranate in it, so they had to change the label. For a beverage to be called \\"juice\\", it must be 100% juice; if it is less than 100%, then it must be called a drink or beverage.  Marketing and consumer perceptions  Many companies have started to use their packaging for food as a marketing tool. Words such as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù, and ‚Äúnatural‚Äù have contributed to what is called the health-halo effect, which is when consumers overestimate the healthfulness of an item based on claims on the packaging.Brown, R. (2016, February 4). Why Food Labels Are So Misleading. Retrieved from Next Avenue website: http://www.nextavenue.org/why-food-labels-are-so-misleading/ Food companies may incorporate whole grain and higher fiber levels into their products in order to advertise these advantages. However, there is no regulated amount of grain needed in a certain product to be able to advertise this benefit, and the product may not be as nutritious as advertised. Other studies have shown that marketing for food products has demonstrated an effect on consumers‚Äô perceptions of purchase intent and flavor. One study in particular performed by Food and Brand Lab researchers at Cornell University looked at how an organic label affects consumers‚Äô perceptions. The study concluded that the label claiming the product was ‚Äúorganic‚Äù altered perceptions in various ways. Consumers perceived these foods to have fewer calories and stated they were willing to pay up to 23.4% more for the product.Cornell Food & Brand Lab. (2013, April 1). Organic labels bias consumers perceptions through the 'health halo effect'. ScienceDaily.

Averoigne is a fictional counterpart of a historical province in France, detailed in a series of short stories by the American writer Clark Ashton Smith. Smith may have based Averoigne on the actual province of Auvergne, but its name was probably influenced by the French department of Aveyron, immediately south of Auvergne, due to the similarity in pronunciation. Sixteen of Smith's stories take place in Averoigne. In Smith's fiction, the Southern French province is considered \\"the most witch-ridden in the entire country.\\" The most well-known citizen is Gaspard du Nord of Vyones, a wizard who translated The Book of Eibon into Norman French.  Fictional history  In ancient times, Smith depicts Averoigne as having been settled by the fictional Gallic tribe called the Averones. They established a number of settlements in the region, many of which were fortified when the Roman Empire absorbed the region. When Christianity spread through the Empire, many churches and monasteries were established among the ruins of Druidic temples. Greatest among these was a great cathedral constructed in Vyones, completed in 1138.  Fictional geography  Averoigne is depicted by Smith as being located in the southern half of France. The northern half of the territory is dominated by the walled city of Vyones, site of an impressive cathedral. In the southern half is located the town of Ximes; the main road of Averoigne runs between Ximes and Vyones, straight through the thick, dark forest that blankets the province. A river called Isoile flows from the mountains in the northern part of the province to feed into a swamp in the south. Other towns and villages depicted by Smith as being located in Averoigne include: Moulins, Les Hiboux, La Fren√¢ie, Touraine, Sainte Zenobie, and P√©rigon. In the forest can be found haunted ruins, such as the Ch√¢teau of Fausseflammes and the stronghold of Ylourgne. (It was from that abandoned abode of evil robber barons, that the horrific events of The Colossus of Ylourgne had their start.) Reception In 1993, Stefan Dziemianowicz wrote in Dark Eidolon: The Journal of Smith Studies that \\"The Colossus of Ylourgne, with its series of increasingly bizarre events culminating in the rampage of the most awesome monster to appear in Smith's fiction, comes closest of any of the Averoigne tales to evoking the sense of wonder in Smith's otherworldly fantasies... Smith appears to be saying that even the sorcerors of Averoigne are unable to transcend their flawed humanity.\\"  Bibliography  Smith based the following stories in the Averoigne setting: *\\"The End of the Story\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., May 1930) *\\"A Rendezvous in Averoigne\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., April/May 1931) *\\"The Maker of Gargoyles\\" (synopsis), by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., August 1932) *\\"The Mandrakes\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., February 1933) *\\"The Beast of Averoigne\\" (originally published version), by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., May 1933) *\\"The Holiness of Az√©darac\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., November 1933) *\\"The Colossus of Ylourgne\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., June 1934) *\\"The Disinterment of Venus\\" (synopsis), by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., July 1934) *\\"Mother of Toads\\" (originally published version), by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Popular Fiction Publishing Co., July 1938) *\\"The Enchantress of Sylaire\\", by Clark Ashton Smith (Weird Tales, Weird Tales, July 1941) *\\"The Satyr\\" (alternate ending), by Clark Ashton Smith (Genius Loci, Arkham House, 1948) ‚Äì Originally written in 1931. *\\"Averoigne\\" (poetry), by Clark Ashton Smith (Challenge, Spring 1951) All these stories have recently been collected in the ebook The Averoigne Archives: The Complete Averoigne Tales of Clark Ashton Smith (Pickman's Press, 2019). =Fragments= A number of other Averoigne stories exist in outline form, uncompleted at the time of Smith's death.

The common gull (Larus canus) or sea mew is a medium-sized gull that breeds in the Palearctic, northern Europe, and northwestern North America. The North American subspecies is commonly referred to as the mew gull, although that name is also used by some authorities for the whole species. Many common gulls migrate further south in winter. There are differing accounts as to how the species acquired its vernacular name (see Etymology section below). The name \\"sea mew\\" is a calque of the Dutch name \\"zee meeuw\\" Description Common Gulls, Larus canus, in flight Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Adult common gulls are long, noticeably smaller than the herring gull and slightly smaller than the ring-billed gull. It is further distinguished from the ring-billed gull by its shorter, more tapered bill, which is a more greenish shade of yellow and is unmarked during the breeding season. The body is grey above and white below. The legs are greenish-yellow. In winter, the head is streaked grey and the bill often has a poorly defined blackish band near the tip, which is sometimes sufficiently obvious to cause confusion with ring-billed gull. They have black wingtips with large white \\"mirrors\\". Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern, and grey legs. They take two to three years to reach maturity. The call is a high-pitched \\"laughing\\" cry. Larus canus winter plumage.jpgWinter plumage Larus canus-calling.jpgBreeding adults have red rings around dark eyes Kizhi Island, Russia Taxonomy There are four subspecies, two of which are considered distinct species by some authorities: * L. c. canus ‚Äì Linnaeus, 1758 ‚Äì common gull. nominate, found in Europe and western Asia. Small; mantle medium grey (palest subspecies); wingtips with extensive black; iris dark. Wingspan ; mass . * L. c. heinei ‚Äì Homeyer, 1853 ‚Äì Russian common gull. Found in central northern Asia. Medium size; mantle dark grey (darkest subspecies); wingtips with extensive black; iris dark. Mass . * L. c. kamtschatschensis ‚Äì Bonaparte, 1857; syn. L. kamtschatschensis ‚Äì Kamchatka gull. Found in northeastern Asia. Large; mantle medium-dark grey; wingtips with extensive black; iris pale. Mass . * L. c. brachyrhynchus ‚Äì Richardson, 1831; syn. L. brachyrhynchus ‚Äì mew gull or short-billed gull. Found in Alaska and western Canada. Small; mantle medium-dark grey; wingtips with little black and much white; iris pale. Wingspan ; mass . Ecology Both common and mew gulls breed colonially near water or in marshes, making a lined nest on the ground or in a small tree; colony size varies from 2 to 320 or even more pairs. Usually three eggs are laid (sometimes just one or two); they hatch after 24‚Äì26 days, with the chicks fledging after a further 30‚Äì35 days. Like most gulls, they are omnivores and will scavenge as well as hunt small prey. The global population is estimated to be about one million pairs; they are most numerous in Europe, with over half (possibly as much as 80-90%) of the world population. By contrast, the Alaskan population is only about 10,000 pairs. Vagrancy The common gull occurs as a scarce winter visitor to coastal eastern Canada and as a vagrant to the northeastern USA. There is one recent record of a mew gull in Europe, on the Azores in 2003. Etymology The scientific name is from Latin. Larus appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and canus is \\"grey\\". The name \\"common gull\\" was coined by Thomas Pennant in 1768 because he considered it the most numerous of its genus. Others assert that the name does not indicate its abundance, but that during the winter it feeds on common land, short pasture used for grazing. John Ray earlier used the name common sea-mall. It is said that uncommon gull is a more accurate description. There are many old British regional names for this species, typically variations on maa, mar and mew.

Starring Gallo and Chlo√´ Sevigny, it tells the story of a motorcycle racer on a cross-country drive who is haunted by memories of his former lover. It was photographed with handheld 16 mm cameras in various locations throughout the United States, including New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Ohio, Missouri, Utah, Nevada, and California. Following its world premiere at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the film garnered a great deal of media attention because of the explicit final scene between Gallo and Sevigny, as well as a feud between Gallo and the film critic Roger Ebert, who stated that The Brown Bunny was the worst film in the history of Cannes, although he later gave a re-edited version his signature \\"thumbs up\\". Plot Motorcycle racer Bud Clay undertakes a cross-country drive, following a race in New Hampshire, in order to participate in a race in California. All the while he is haunted by memories of his former lover, Daisy. On his journey he meets three women, but Bud seems to be a lost soul, and he is unable to form an emotional connection with any of them. He first meets Violet at a gas station in New Hampshire and convinces her to join him on his trip. They stop at her home in order to get her clothes, but he drives off as soon as she enters the house. Bud's next stop is the home of Daisy's parents, the location of Daisy's brown bunny. Daisy's mother does not remember Bud, who grew up in the house next door, nor does she remember having visited Bud and Daisy in California. Next, Bud stops at a pet shelter, where he asks about the life expectancy of rabbits (he is told it is about five or six years). At a highway rest stop, he meets a distressed woman, Lilly. He comforts and kisses her, before starting to cry and eventually leaving her. Bud appears more distressed as the road trip continues, crying as he drives. He stops at the Bonneville Speedway to race his motorcycle. In Las Vegas, he drives around prostitutes on street corners, before deciding to ask one of them, Rose, to join him for a lunch. She eats McDonald's food in his truck until he stops, pays her, and leaves her back on the street. After having his motorcycle checked in a Los Angeles garage, Bud stops at Daisy's house, which appears abandoned. He leaves a note on the door frame, after sitting in his truck in the driveway remembering about kissing Daisy in this place, and checks in at a hotel. Daisy eventually appears there. She seems nervous, going to the bathroom twice to smoke crack cocaine, while Bud waits for her, sitting on his bed. As she proposes to go out to buy something to drink, Bud tells her that, because of what happened the last time they saw each other, he does not drink anymore. They have an argument about Daisy kissing other men. At this point, Bud undresses Daisy and she fellates him. Once done, he insults her as they lie in bed, talking about what happened during their last meeting. Bud continuously asks Daisy why she had been involved with some men at a party. She explains that she was just being friendly and wanted to smoke marijuana with them. Bud becomes upset because Daisy was pregnant and it transpires that the baby died as a result of what happened at this party. Through flashback scenes, the viewer understands that Daisy was raped at the party, a scene witnessed by Bud, who did not intervene. Daisy asks Bud why he did not help her, and his feelings of guilt on this are considerable. He tells her that he did not know what to do, and so he decided to leave the party. After he came back a bit later, he saw an ambulance in front of the house and Daisy explains to Bud that she is dead, having passed out prior to the rape and then choked to death on her own vomit. Bud awakens the next morning, alone; his encounter with Daisy turns out to have been a figment of his imagination. The movie ends as Bud is driving his truck in California. Cast * Vincent Gallo as Bud Clay * Chlo√´ Sevigny as Daisy * Cheryl Tiegs as Lilly * Elizabeth Blake as Rose * Anna Vareschi as Violet * Mary Morasky as Mrs. Lemon Production and release The film was shot in 16 mm and then blown up in 35 mm, which gives the photography a typical \\"old-school grain\\". Vincent Gallo is credited as director of the photography as well as one of the three camera operators along with Toshiaki Ozawa and John Clemens. The version of the film shown in the U.S. has been cut by about 25 minutes compared to the version shown at Cannes, removing a large part of the initial scene at the race track (about four minutes shorter), about six minutes of music and black screen at the end of the film, and about seven minutes of driving before the scene in the Bonneville Speedway. Neither Anna Vareschi nor Elizabeth Blake, both in the film, were professional actresses. Kirsten Dunst and Winona Ryder were both attached to the project but left. In an interview from The Guardian Sevigny said of the sex scene: \\"It was tough, the toughest thing I've ever done, but Vincent was very sensitized to my needs, very gentle. . . . And we'd been intimate in the past.\\" \\"An independent spirit\\", The Sunday Times, October 2003 For the film's promotion, a trailer was released featuring a split screen in the style of Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls, depicting on one side of the screen a single point-of-view-shot of a driver on a country road, and the other side various scenes from the end of the film featuring Chlo√´ Sevigny. Both sides of the screen had no audio tracks attached, although the song \\"Milk and Honey\\" by folk singer Jackson C. Frank played over the trailer's duration. Controversy =Cannes reception and reviews= The film was entered into the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Upon his return to the US, Gallo took a defiant stance, defending the film and finishing a new edit that clarified and tightened the storyline. A war of words then erupted between Gallo and film critic Roger Ebert, with Ebert writing that The Brown Bunny was the worst film in the history of Cannes, and Gallo retorting by calling Ebert a \\"fat pig with the physique of a slave trader.\\"Peretti, Jacques. \\"Jacques Peretti on Shooting Vincent Gallo\\". The Guardian. November 14, 2003. Paraphrasing a statement attributed to Winston Churchill, Ebert responded with, \\"It is true that I am fat, but one day I will be thin, and he will still be the director of The Brown Bunny.\\" Gallo then claimed to have put a hex on Ebert's colon, cursing the critic with cancer. In response, Ebert quipped that watching a video of his colonoscopy had been more entertaining than watching The Brown Bunny. Gallo subsequently stated that the hex had actually been placed on Ebert's prostate and that he had intended the comment to be a joke which was mistakenly taken seriously by a journalist. He also conceded to finding Ebert's colonoscopy comment to be an amusing comeback. A shorter, re-edited version of the film played later in 2003 at the Toronto International Film Festival (although it still retained the controversial sex scene).What Culture#5: The Brown Bunny The new version was regarded more highly by some, even Ebert, who gave the new cut three stars out of a possible four. On the August 28, 2004 episode of the television show Ebert & Roeper, Ebert gave the new version of the film a \\"thumbs up\\" rating. In a column published about the same time, Ebert reported that he and Gallo had made peace. According to Ebert: In 2018 however, Gallo rebuked Ebert's statement, calling it \\"both far- fetched and an outright lie.\\" He went on to state the final cut was only 8 minutes shorter than the Cannes cut, not 26 as Ebert claimed. According to Gallo \\"If you didn‚Äôt like the unfinished film at Cannes, you didn‚Äôt like the finished film, and vice versa,\\" going on to speculate that Ebert wanted to distance himself from \\"a brutal, dismissive review of a film that other, more serious critics eventually felt differently about.\\" Nevertheless, The Brown Bunny still received mixed reviews from other critics and has a rating of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 94 reviews with an average score of 5.17/10. The site's consensus states \\"More dull than hypnotic, The Brown Bunny is a pretentious and self-indulgent bore.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics. French cinema magazine Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma voted The Brown Bunny one of the ten best films of 2004. The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Vienna International Film Festival for its \\"bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American filmmaking\\". The film, aside from the feud with Roger Ebert, gained some positive reaction from American critics as well. Neva Chonin of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"a somber poem of a film sure to frustrate those who prefer resolution to ambiguity... like an inscrutably bad dream, [it] lingers on\\". The film was praised by other filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard, John Waters, Sean Penn, and Werner Herzog who called it \\"the best portrayal of the particular loneliness a man feels.\\" The Daily Telegraph listed The Brown Bunny as one of the 100 \\"defining\\" films of the decade, calling it the decade's \\"most reviled\\" film, but saying it was \\"destined to become a future lost classic\\". =Sevigny's response= In August 2004 upon the film's limited theatrical release in the United States, star Sevigny took to defending the film and its final scene, stating: Despite the negative backlash toward Sevigny's involvement in the film, some critics praised her decision. New York Times reviewer Manohla Dargis said: Seven years later, in an interview for Playboys January 2011 issue, Sevigny talked about the oral sex scene in the film: =Billboard promotion= The Brown Bunny also attracted media attention over a large billboard erected over Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California in 2004 promoting the film. The billboard featured a black-and-white image taken from the fellatio sequence, drawing complaints from residents and business owners. The image showed Gallo standing with Sevigny on her knees, but did not show any explicit sexual content. It was eventually removed nonetheless. In 2011, a similar image featuring in the billboard of another French film, The Players (Les infid√®les), triggered a similar controversy. Soundtrack The motion picture soundtrack to The Brown Bunny was released exclusively in Japan. The first five tracks come from artists Gordon Lightfoot, Jackson C. Frank, Matisse/Accardo Quartet, Jeff Alexander and Ted Curson. The last five tracks are performed by John Frusciante. =Soundtrack re-release= Australian indie label Twelve Suns re-issued The Brown Bunny soundtrack on deluxe gatefold vinyl on April 26, 2014. This reissue was fully authorized by Vincent Gallo and remastered from his master recordings. The re-issue was limited to 1000 copies. The first 5 tracks are from the film The Brown Bunny. The last 5 tracks were written before the movie and used as inspiration during filming.

He was the long-time chairman of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) from 1961 until 1988, member of the federal cabinet in different positions between 1953 and 1969 and minister-president of the state of Bavaria from 1978 until 1988. Strauss is also credited as a co-founder of European aerospace conglomerate Airbus. After the 1969 federal elections, West Germany's CDU/CSU alliance found itself out of power for the first time since the founding of the Federal Republic. At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.David Wilsford, ed. Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe: A Biographical Dictionary (Greenwood, 1995) pp. 432‚Äì40. Early life Born in Munich on 6 September 1915, as the second child of a butcher, Strauss studied German letters, history and economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1935 to 1939. World War II In World War II, he served in the Wehrmacht on the Western and Eastern Fronts. While on furlough, he passed the German state exams to become a teacher. After suffering from severe frostbite on the Eastern Front in early 1943, he served as an Offizier f√ºr wehrgeistige F√ºhrung, responsible for the education of the troops, at the antiaircraft artillery school in Altenstadt Air Base, near Schongau. During the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, he served with the Panzer Regiment of the 13th Panzer Division. He held the rank of Oberleutnant at the end of the war. Early post-war years In 1945 he served as translator for the US army. He called himself Franz Strau√ü until soon after the war when he started using his middle name Josef as well.\\"Fragen zur Person\\" [Question about the person] from the Hanns Seidel Foundation Political life 1945‚Äì1961 After the war, in 1945, he was appointed deputy Landrat (chief executive and representative of the district) of Schongau by the American military government and was involved in founding the local party organization of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). Strauss became a member of the first Bundestag (Federal Parliament) in 1949. In 1953 Strauss became Federal Minister for Special Affairs in the second cabinet of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, in 1955 Federal Minister of Nuclear Energy, and in 1956 Defence Minister, charged with the build-up of the new West German defence forces, the Bundeswehrthe youngest man to hold this office at the time. He became chairman of the CSU in 1961. Strauss stated in a letter to HIAG in March 1957: \\"I think you know how I personally think about the front line units of the Waffen-SS. They are included in my admiration for the German soldiers of the last world war.\\" Lockheed bribery scandals Former Lockheed lobbyist admitted to investigators during a U.S. Senate hearing that Minister of Defence Strauss and his party had received at least $10 million in remuneration for arranging West Germany's purchase of 900 F-104G Starfighters in 1961, which later became part of the Lockheed bribery scandals. The party, its leaders, and Strauss all denied the allegations; and Strauss filed a slander suit against Hauser. Strauss and Hauser had met after World War II in Schongau, Bavaria, where Hauser was stationed. Hauser worked for U.S. Intelligence and Strauss was Hauser's translator. They were good friends, which Strauss later denied, in a denial belied by the fact that Strauss had attended Hauser's wedding. As the allegations were not corroborated, the issue was dropped. {{subscription It was known at the time that a Senate hearing in the U.S. revealed that Lockheed associates paid Strauss a bribe to purchase the planes, due to Boeing suing Lockheed over the lost German business. In a Senate hearing in the U.S., it was admitted by Lockheed associates that the funds were disbursed to Strauss. In spite of this fact, Strauss was never indicted in Germany due to his influence. Lockheed at that time was on the brink of collapse; the German contract was key to the company's survival. The F-104G's development had been expensive; the U.S. Air Force refused to purchase the plane due to its unnecessary features. The German contract proved to be a windfall for Lockheed. After Germany ordered the fighter planes from Lockheed, many more European governments started to place their trust in the Starfighter and ordered more planes, saving Lockheed from financial ruin. Spiegel affair Strauss was forced to step down as defence minister in 1962 in the wake of the Spiegel affair. Rudolf Augstein, owner and editor-in-chief of the influential Der Spiegel magazine, published German defense information that Strauss's department alleged was top secret. He was arrested on Strauss's request and was held for 103 days. On 19 November, the five FDP ministers of the cabinet resigned, demanding that Strauss be fired. This put Chancellor Adenauer himself at risk. He found himself publicly accused of backing the suppression of a critical press with the resources of the state. Strauss had no choice but to admit that he had lied to the parliament, and was forced to resign. Strauss himself was exonerated by the courts on the charge of acting against the constitution. Rivalry between Kohl and Strauss F. J. Strau√ü, K. Schiller Strauss was appointed minister of the treasury again in 1966, in the cabinet of Kurt Georg Kiesinger. In cooperation with the SPD minister for economy, Karl Schiller, he developed a groundbreaking economic stability policy; the two ministers, quite unlike in physical appearance and political background, were popularly dubbed ', after two dogs in a 19th-century cartoon by Wilhelm Busch.\\"Plisch und Plum\\" by Felix Rexhausen, Der Spiegel, 30 January 1967 After the SPD was able to form a government without the conservatives, in 1969, Strauss became one of the most vocal critics of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik. After Helmut Kohl's first run for chancellor in 1976 failed, Strauss cancelled the alliance between the CDU and CSU parties in the Bundestag, a decision which he only reversed months later when the CDU threatened to extend their party to Bavaria (where the CSU holds a political monopoly for the conservatives). In the 1980 federal election, the CDU/CSU opted to nominate Strauss as their candidate for chancellor. Strauss had continued to be critical of Kohl's leadership, so providing Strauss a shot at the chancellery may have been seen as an endorsement of either Strauss' policies or style (or both) over Kohl's. But many, if not most, observers at the time believed that the CDU had concluded that Helmut Schmidt's SPD was likely unbeatable in 1980, and felt that they had nothing to lose in running Strauss. Schmidt's victory was seen by Kohl's supporters as a vindication of their man, and though the rivalry between Kohl and Strauss persisted for years, once the CDU/CSU was able to take power in 1982, it was Kohl who became chancellor. He remained in power well beyond Strauss's death. European integration Strauss wrote a book called The Grand Design, in which he set forth his views of how the future unification of Europe might be achieved. Airbus As an aerospace enthusiast, Strauss was a key player in the creation of Airbus in the 1970s. He served as chairman of AirbusAirbus Corporate Information ‚Äì The Airbus story in the late 1980s, until his death in 1988; he saw the company win a lucrative but controversial (see Airbus affair) contract to supply planes to Air Canada just before his death. Munich's new airport, the Franz Josef Strau√ü Airport, was named after him in 1992. Minister-President of Bavaria Strauss addressing the CDU in 1986, two years before his death From 1978 until his death in 1988, Strauss was Minister-President of Bavaria, serving his rotation as president of the German Bundesrat in 1983‚Äì84. After his defeat in the 1980 federal election, he retreated to commenting on federal politics from Bavaria. In the following years, he was the most visible critic of Kohl's politics in his own political camp, even after Kohl ascended to the chancellorship. In 1983, he was primarily responsible for a loan of 3 billion Deutsche Marks given to East Germany. This move, in violation of longtime CSU/CDU policy to allow the East German economy to collapse naturally, was widely criticised even during Strauss's lifetime. The Republicans split from the CSU/CDU over this move. Strauss was a strong Bavarian monarchist. Visit to Albania Strauss visited communist Albania on 21 August 1984, while Enver Hoxha, the ruler from the end of World War II until his death in 1985, was still in power. Strauss was one of the few Western leaders, if not the only one, to visit the isolationist Albania in decades. This fuelled speculation that Strauss might be preparing the way for diplomatic links between Albania and West Germany and, indeed, relations were established in 1987. In 2017, Strauss was honored with the Albanian National Flag Order,Note on the website of the President of Albania while a city square holds his name in Tirana. Death On 1 October 1988, Strauss collapsed while out hunting with Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, in the Thurn and Taxis forests, east of Regensburg. He died in a Regensburg hospital on 3 October without having regained consciousness. He was 73. Family Strauss married in 1957. She died in a car accident in 1984. They had three children: , , and Monika, who was member of the Landtag of Bavaria and a Bavarian minister. In 2009 she was elected to the European Parliament. Legacy Strauss shaped post-war Bavaria and polarized the public like few others. He was an articulate leader of conservatives and a skilled rhetorician. His outspoken right-leaning political standpoints made him an opponent of more moderate politicians and the entire political left. His association with several large-scale scandals made many politicians distance themselves from him. His policies contributed to changing Bavaria from an agrarian state to one of Germany's leading industry centres, and one of the wealthiest regions of Germany.

Otter was the first widely distributed, high- performance theorem prover for first-order logic, and it pioneered a number of important implementation techniques. Otter is an acronym for Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective Research. Description Otter is based on resolution and paramodulation, constrained by term orderings similar to those in the superposition calculus. The prover also supports positive and negative hyperresolution and a set-of-support strategy. Proof search is based on saturation using a version of the given-clause algorithm, and is controlled by several heuristics. There also are meta-heuristics determining search parameters automatically. Otter also pioneered the use of efficient term indexing techniques to speed up the search for inference partners in large clause sets. Otter has been very stable for a number of years but is no longer actively developed. As of November 2008, the last changelog entry was dated 14 September 2004. A successor to Otter is Prover9.

It is based on the equational superposition calculus and uses a purely equational paradigm. It has been integrated into other theorem provers and it has been among the best-placed systems in several theorem proving competitions. E is developed by Stephan Schulz, originally in the Automated Reasoning Group at TU Munich, now at Baden-W√ºrttemberg Cooperative State University Stuttgart. System The system is based on the equational superposition calculus. In contrast to most other current provers, the implementation actually uses a purely equational paradigm, and simulates non- equational inferences via appropriate equality inferences. Significant innovations include shared term rewriting (where many possible equational simplifications are carried out in a single operation), several efficient term indexing data structures for speeding up inferences, advanced inference literal selection strategies, and various uses of machine learning techniques to improve the search behaviour. Since version 2.0, E supports many-sorted logic. E is implemented in C and portable to most UNIX variants and the Cygwin environment. It is available under the GNU GPL. Competitions The prover has consistently performed well in the CADE ATP System Competition, winning the CNF/MIX category in 2000 and finishing among the top systems ever since. In 2008 it came in second place.FOF division of CASC in 2008 In 2009 it won second place in the FOF (full first order logic) and UEQ (unit equational logic) categories and third place (after two versions of Vampire) in CNF (clausal logic). It repeated the performance in FOF and CNF in 2010, and won a special award as \\"overall best\\" system. In the 2011 CASC-23 E won the CNF division and achieved second places in UEQ and LTB. Applications E has been integrated into several other theorem provers. It is, with Vampire, SPASS, CVC4, and Z3, at the core of Isabelle's Sledgehammer strategy. E also is the reasoning engine in SInE and LEO-II and used as the clausification system for iProver.

Asset book value An asset's initial book value is its actual cash value or its acquisition cost. Cash assets are recorded or \\"booked\\" at actual cash value. Assets such as buildings, land and equipment are valued based on their acquisition cost, which includes the actual cash cost of the asset plus certain costs tied to the purchase of the asset, such as broker fees. Not all purchased items are recorded as assets; incidental supplies are recorded as expenses. Some assets might be recorded as current expenses for tax purposes. An example of this is assets purchased and expensed under Section 179 of the US tax code. =Depreciable, amortizable and depletable assets= Monthly or annual depreciation, amortization and depletion are used to reduce the book value of assets over time as they are \\"consumed\\" or used up in the process of obtaining revenue.Meigs and Meigs, Financial Accounting 4th ed. p. 90. These non-cash expenses are recorded in the accounting books after a trial balance is calculated to ensure that cash transactions have been recorded accurately. Depreciation is used to record the declining value of buildings and equipment over time. Land is not depreciated. Amortization is used to record the declining value of intangible assets such as patents. Depletion is used to record the consumption of natural resources.Wolk, Harry I., James L. Dodd and Michael G. Tearney (2004). Accounting Theory: Conceptual Issues in a Political and Economic Environment, 6th ed. South-Western. pp. 330‚Äì331. . Depreciation, amortization and depletion are recorded as expenses against a contra account. Contra accounts are used in bookkeeping to record asset and liability valuation changes. \\"Accumulated depreciation\\" is a contra-asset account used to record asset depreciation.Meigs, p.91 Sample general journal entry for depreciationMeigs, p.90 * Depreciation expenses: building... debit = $150, under expenses in retained earnings * Accumulated depreciation: building... credit = $150, under assets The balance sheet valuation for an asset is the asset's cost basis minus accumulated depreciation.Meigs, p.105 Similar bookkeeping transactions are used to record amortization and depletion. \\"Discount on notes payable\\" is a contra-liability account which decreases the balance sheet valuation of the liability.Meigs, p. 313 When a company sells (issues) bonds, this debt is a long-term liability on the company's balance sheet, recorded in the account Bonds Payable based on the contract amount. After the bonds are sold, the book value of Bonds Payable is increased or decreased to reflect the actual amount received in payment for the bonds. If the bonds sell for less than face value, the contra account Discount on Bonds Payable is debited for the difference between the amount of cash received and the face value of the bonds.Hermanson, Roger H., James Don Edwards, R. F. Salmonson, (1987) Accounting Principles Volume II, Dow Jones-Irwin, p. 657. Net asset value In the United Kingdom, the term net asset value may refer to book value. A mutual fund is an entity which primarily owns \\"financial assets\\" or capital assets such as bonds, stocks and commercial paper. The net asset value of a mutual fund is the market value of assets owned by the fund minus the fund's liabilities. This is similar to shareholders' equity, except the asset valuation is market-based rather than based on acquisition cost. In financial news reporting, the reported net asset value of a mutual fund is the net asset value of a single share in the fund. In the mutual fund's accounting records, the financial assets are recorded at acquisition cost. When assets are sold, the fund records a capital gain or capital loss. Financial assets include stock shares and bonds owned by an individual or company.Groppelli, Angelico A. (2000) Finance, 4th ed., p.25. These may be reported on the individual or company balance sheet at cost or at market value. Corporate book value A company or corporation's book value, as an asset held by a separate economic entity, is the company or corporation's shareholders' equity, the acquisition cost of the shares, or the market value of the shares owned by the separate economic entity. A corporation's book value is used in fundamental financial analysis to help determine whether the market value of corporate shares is above or below the book value of corporate shares. Neither market value nor book value is an unbiased estimate of a corporation's value. The corporation's bookkeeping or accounting records do not generally reflect the market value of assets and liabilities, and the market or trade value of the corporation's stock is subject to variations. Tangible common equity A variation of book value, tangible common equity, has recently come into use by the US Federal Government in the valuation of troubled banks.\\"US Eyes Large Stake in Citi\\", The Wall Street Journal, 23 February 2009,\\"Stress Test for Banks Exposes Rift on Wall St.\\". The New York Times, 24 February 2009, Tangible common equity is calculated as total book value minus intangible assets, goodwill, and preferred equity, and can thus be considered the most conservative valuation of a company and the best approximation of its value should it be forced to liquidate.Tangible Common Equity via Wikinvest Since tangible common equity subtracts preferred equity from the tangible book value, it does a better job estimating what the value of the company is to holders of specifically common stock compared to standard calculations of book value. Stock pricing book value To clearly distinguish the market price of shares from the core ownership equity or shareholders' equity, the term 'book value' is often used since it focuses on the values that have been added and subtracted in the accounting books of a business (assets ‚Äì liabilities). The term is also used to distinguish between the market price of any asset and its accounting value which depends more on historical cost and depreciation. It may be used interchangeably with carrying value. While it can be used to refer to the business' total equity, it is most often used: *as a 'per share value': The balance sheet Equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding at the date of the balance sheet (not the average o/s in the period). *as a 'diluted per share value': The Equity is bumped up by the exercise price of the options, warrants or preferred shares. Then it is divided by the number of shares that has been increased by those added. =Uses of books= #Book value is used in the financial ratio price/book. It is a valuation metric that sets the floor for stock prices under a worst-case scenario. When a business is liquidated, the book value is what may be left over for the owners after all the debts are paid. Paying only a price/book = 1 means the investor will get all his investment back, assuming assets can be resold at their book value. Shares of capital intensive industries trade at lower price/book ratios because they generate lower earnings per dollar of assets. Business depending on human capital will generate higher earnings per dollar of assets, so will trade at higher price/book ratios. #Book value per share can be used to generate a measure of comprehensive earnings, when the opening and closing values are reconciled. BookValuePerShare, beginning of year ‚Äì Dividends + ShareIssuePremium + Comprehensive EPS = BookValuePerShare, end of year.http://www.retailinvestor.org/earnings.html Use Book Value To Calculate Comprehensive EPS =Changes are caused by= #The sale of shares/units by the business increases the total book value. Book/sh will increase if the additional shares are issued at a price higher than the pre-existing book/sh. #The purchase of its own shares by the business will decrease total book value. Book/shares will decrease if more is paid for them than was received when originally issued (pre-existing book/sh). #Dividends paid out will decrease book value and book/sh. #Comprehensive earnings/losses will increase/decrease book value and book/sh. Comprehensive earnings, in this case, includes net income from the Income Statement, foreign exchange translation changes to Balance Sheet items, accounting changes applied retroactively, and the opportunity cost of options exercised. =New share issues and dilution= The issue of more shares does not necessarily decrease the value of the current owner. While it is correct that when the number of shares is doubled the EPS will be cut in half, it is too simple to be the full story. It all depends on how much was paid for the new shares and what return the new capital earns once invested. See the discussion at stock dilution. =Net book value of long term assets= Book value is often used interchangeably with \\"net book value\\" or \\"carrying value\\", which is the original acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion or amortization. Book value is the term which means the value of the firm as per the books of the company. It is the value at which the assets are valued in the balance sheet of the company as on the given date.

History Aerial view from 600 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) Weiach is first mentioned in 1271. It has belonged to Swiss Confederation since 1424. Since 1962 there has been a gravel industry located in Weiach. On 14 November 1990, Alitalia Flight 404 crashed into Stadlerberg Mountain near Weiach while attempting to land at Zurich Airport. The crash, which was caused by a faulty navigation system, killed all 40 passengers and 6 crew.http://www.airsafe.com/events/reports/alitalia-dc9-1990.pdf, Final Report of the Federal Aircraft Accidents Inquiry Board concerning Alitalia Flight 404, 1990. Geography Weiach has an area of . Of this area, 36.9% is used for agricultural purposes, while 49.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 11.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.9%) is non- productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). Weiach (dialect: ¬´Weych¬ª) is situated at approximately 390 metres above sea level in the northwestern corner of the Z√ºrich Lowlands (¬´Zuercher Unterland¬ª), at the cantonal boundary between Z√ºrich and Aargau. The River Rhine, flows some 100 meters north of the village and forms the natural border line to Germany, marking the lowest spot in the canton of Z√ºrich (332 meters above sea level). Population The Z√ºrich Tax Records (Z√ºrcher Steuerb√ºcher) of 1470 only contains a record of the manor of Weiach. At the time, the village comprised 16 households, with 48 inhabitants over the age of 15 liable to pay tax. Between 1634 and 1760, having been requested to do so by the Z√ºrich authorities, the priests kept detailed records of population size, albeit with sporadic intervals. Later figures have been taken from the following sources: 1790 Werdm√ºller's Memorabilia Tigurina, 1799 Priests' Inquiry of the Helvetian Government, 1820 Erni's Memorabilia Tigurina, 1827 Lutz's Vollst√§ndige Beschreibung des Schweizerlandes. The figure for 1836 is based on the Z√ºrich cantonal census. Figures from 1850 onwards have been taken from the Confederational Census. (The criteria for recording population data have changed considerably over the centuries. Each interpretation can cause the figures to vary considerably. The figures are taken from different sources. For the years 1710 to 1820, data are hardly available.) Over the centuries, the population size has been closely linked to the profitability of the land, since exports were rare. The resident population oscillated between 500 and 750 persons, making Weiach the largest parish in Neuamt. From the end of the 17th Century onwards, many began to look for work outside Weiach, resulting in emigration. This emigration was often to the United States. Many of the forefathers of Americans with the surname Baumgardner were originally from Weiach. By the 1960s and 1970s, a few new apartment blocks had been built here and there. In the wake of the agglomeration of Z√ºrich, Weiach became subsumed by the city in the mid 1980s. New residential areas were designated according to the Quartierpl√§ne. This triggered a construction boom, beginning on the edge of Sanzenberg. 30 per cent of the apartments which existed in 2000 had been built in the previous ten years. The population grew by over 35 per cent thanks to the building of 80 new apartment blocks between 1991 and 2000. Never before had so many people lived simultaneously in the parish of Weiach. The start of urbanisation can be seen from the explosion in the number of single person households from 1990 (an increase of 132 per cent). A large-scale construction project was planned at the end of 2007 to build a further 55 apartment blocks in the Bedmen area. If this goes ahead, the population figure will again pass the 1000 mark. =Demographics= Weiach has a population (as of ) of . , 10.1% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 6.9%. Most of the population () speaks German (93.6%), with Albanian being second most common ( 1.5%) and Serbo- Croatian being third ( 1.2%). In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 54.8% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (12.9%), the CSP (9.4%) and the FDP (8%). The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0‚Äì19 years old) make up 26.7% of the population, while adults (20‚Äì64 years old) make up 61% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 12.4%. In Weiach about 80.4% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Weiach has an unemployment rate of 2.46%. , there were 47 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 17 businesses involved in this sector. 120 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 16 businesses in this sector. 96 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 27 businesses in this sector.Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 04-Aug-2009 References External links * http://www.weiach.ch Category:Municipalities of the canton of Z√ºrich ","title":"Weiach"},{"id":"265298","text":"Singing Girl Guides A Girl Guide or Girl Scout is a member of a section of some Guiding organisations who is between the ages of 10 and 14. Age limits are different in each organisation. The term Girl Scout is used in the United States and several East Asian countries. The two terms are used synonymously within this article. Girl Guides are organised into units/troops averaging 15-30 girls under guidance of a team of leaders. Units subdivide into patrols of about six Guides and engage in outdoor and special interest activities. Units may affiliate with national and international organisations. Some units, especially in Europe, have been co-educational since the 1970s, allowing boys and girls to work together as Scouts. There are other programme sections for older and younger girls. Foundation Following the origin of the Boy Scouts in 1907 many girls took up Scouting. A group of Girl Scouts were prominent at the Crystal Palace Rally in 1909. After Robert Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in 1910 he formed the Girl Guides and asked his sister Agnes to look after the Girl Guides organisation. A few years later Baden- Powell's new wife Olave St. Claire Baden-Powell (commonly referred to as \\"Lady Baden-Powell\\") became involved and, in 1918, was appointed Chief Guide. Activities Most activities are similar to those of the (Boy) Scouts, but two central themes have been present from the earliest days of the movement: domestic skills and \\"a kind of practical feminism which embodies physical fitness, survival skills, camping, citizenship training, and career preparation\\". Polish Girl Guides by the monument to Small Partisan in Warsaw Unit affiliation =Troop= Local groups, called variously units, companies or troops are the fundamental unit of the Girl Guides. These are run by an adult, normally a woman who is between 18 and 65 years of age. She has responsibility for the girls in her group and plans out activities for the girls as well as leading the meetings. These leaders are supported by assistants. Meetings are held anywhere from weekly to monthly depending on the commitments of the participants and the activities in progress.

Tapper puts the player in the shoes of a bartender who must serve eager, thirsty patrons (before their patience expiresCLASSIC GAMES REVISITED - Tapper (Atari 2600) review at Univision ) while collecting empty mugs and tips. Originally sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, the arcade version features a Budweiser motif. It was intended to be sold to bars, with cabinets sporting a brass rail footrest and drink holders. Early machines had game controllers that were actual Budweiser beer tap handles, which were later replaced by smaller, plastic versions with the Budweiser logo on them.Rick Hicaro, former Marvin Glass & Associates employee; music composer/sound developer for Tapper The re-themed Root Beer Tapper followed in 1984, which was developed specifically for arcades because the original version was construed as advertising alcohol to minors. Gameplay In Tapper, the player is a bartender serving drinks to customers. The Budweiser logo is on the far wall. Root Beer Tapper replaces the bartender with a soda jerk serving non-alcoholic root beer. The controls consist of a four-position joystick and a tap handle. The game screen features four bars, each with a keg at one end and a door at the other. Customers enter through the doors and slowly advance toward the kegs, demanding service. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and slide them down the bar for the customers to catch. Pushing the joystick up or down instantly moves the bartender to the keg at the next bar in the chosen direction, with the top and bottom of the screen wrapping around to one another, while pushing left or right causes him to run along the bar where he is stationed. When the tap handle is pulled down, the bartender instantly moves to the keg (if he is not already standing there) and fills a mug; releasing it causes him to slide the mug along the bar. Customers slide back toward the doors upon catching a full mug, and disappear through the doors if they are close enough. If not, they stop after a certain distance, consume the drink, and resume their advance while sliding the empty mug back toward the keg. Customers occasionally leave tips on the bar, which the player can pick up for bonus points. Collecting a tip causes a group of female dancers to appear for a few seconds, distracting a portion of the customers so that they will stop advancing. However, distracted customers cannot catch drinks, and any customers who are either drinking or being pushed back at the start of the dancers' show will never be distracted. One life is lost whenever any of the following occurs: *The player fails to catch an empty mug before it falls off the keg end of a bar and breaks *A full mug slides to the door end of a bar without being caught, where it falls and breaks *Any customer reaches the keg end of a bar, whereupon they grab the bartender and slide him across the bar out the door Each screen is completed when the bar is completely emptied of customers. The bartender then pours/consumes a drink of his own with humorous results involving the empty mug, such as getting it stuck on his head or stubbing his toe when he tries to kick it. As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time. The player proceeds through four levels, each with its own theme and appropriately dressed customers, and must complete a set number of screens to advance from one level to the next. The levels are: # A western saloon with cowboys (2 screens) # A sports bar with athletes (3 screens) # A punk rock bar with punk rockers (4 screens) # An outer-space bar with aliens (4 screens) A bonus round is played after the end of each level, in which six cans of beer (or root beer) are placed on the bar. A masked figure shakes five of the cans, then pounds the bar to shuffle them. Choosing the one unshaken can awards bonus points, while choosing any other results in the bartender being sprayed in the face (the unshaken can then flashes for a moment to show where it was). After completing all four levels, the player returns to the start of the sequence and continues the game at a higher difficulty level.Game entry at Giantbomb Music Music and sound effects for the arcade version of Tapper were created Rick Hicaro of Marvin Glass & Associates. He used a Synclavier II synthesizer running with custom software written by Richard Ditton. The system interfaced directly to the arcade game system so sounds were true to the capabilities of the hardware. The game's score includes \\"Oh! Susanna\\" (composed by Stephen Foster), \\"Buffalo Gals\\" (traditional American folk song), the Budweiser theme, and \\"Can-Can\\" by Jacques Offenbach. The rest of the music was written by Rick Hicaro. An upright cabinet Ports Tapper was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari 5200, Atari 2600, BBC Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, IBM PC, and Amstrad CPC. Most of the home versions of Tapper featured the Mountain Dew logo, while the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions had the Pepsi logo, but they retained the bartender character of the original arcade game instead of the soda jerk in Root Beer Tapper. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Tapper on their March 15, 1984 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Compute!'s Gazette called the Commodore 64 version of Tapper \\"one of the most addictive games we've seen lately ... not only fun to play, but also immensely challenging, graphically entertaining, and full of action\\". The magazine stated that \\"it's a very well-designed strategy game\\", and concluded that it was \\"near the top in entertainment value\\". Legacy The art style is almost identical to a previous game called Domino Man, and the following game Timber. In fact, the main character in Timber is a rework of the main character in Tapper. The art is based on Mike Ferris, an artist who taught Scott Morrison art.Retro Gamer magazine, issue 74. \\"The making of ...

Weather researchers may aspire to eliminate or control dangerous types of weather such as this. A weather modification (also known as weather control) is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply. Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare like Operation Popeye, where clouds were seeded to prolong the monsoon in Vietnam. Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations under the Environmental Modification Convention. History A popular belief in northern Europe that shooting prevents hail caused many agricultural towns to fire cannons without ammunition. Veterans of the Seven Years' War, Napoleonic wars, and the American Civil War reported that rain fell after every large battle. After their stories were collected in War and Weather, the United States Department of War in the late 19th century purchased $9,000 of gunpowder and explosives to detonate them in Texas. The results of the test, supervised by Robert Dyrenforth, were inconclusive. Wilhelm Reich performed cloudbusting experiments in the 1950s, the results of which are controversial and not widely accepted by mainstream science. In November 1955, the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ù‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á) was initiated by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He discovered that many areas faced the problem of drought. Over 82 percent of Thai agricultural land relied on rainfall. Thai farmers were not able to grow crops for lack of water. The royal rainmaking project debuted on 20 July 1969 at his behest, when the first rainmaking attempt was made at Khao Yai National Park. Dry ice flakes were scattered over clouds. Reportedly, some rainfall resulted. In 1971, the government established the Artificial Rainmaking Research and Development Project within the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and CooperativesRoyal Rainmaking Project In January 2011, several newspapers and magazines, including the UK's Sunday Times and Arabian Business, reported that scientists backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, had created over 50 artificial rainstorms between July and August 2010 near Al Ain, a city which lies close to the country's border with Oman and is the second-largest city in the Abu Dhabi Emirate. The artificial rainstorms were said to have sometimes caused hail, gales and thunderstorms, baffling local residents. Cloud seeding Cloud seeding Cloud seeding is a common technique to enhance precipitation. Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as silver iodide, onto clouds to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air. Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the United States, China, India, and Russia. In China there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to \\"wash the air\\" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing. In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,Hunter, Steven M. (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation). 2007.

China estimates it to produce up to 10 billion cubic meters of rainfall each year. For comparison, more than 30 countries get less than 10 billion cubic meters of precipitation per year. Saudi Arabia has been cloud seeding since the 2000s and aims to increase rainfall by 15-30% per year. The material used is: potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium, and other materials. \\"In the first three months of 2017, the country carried out 101 cloud seeding operations, compared to 77 over the same period in 2014, according to Arabian Business, who wrote that during March last year when the country had two months of ‚Äúunusually wet weather‚Äù and more rainfall was recorded in Dubai and Al Ain than when records began in 1977.\\" = Consequences =  Societal  Without having adequate systems to handle weather modification may have disastrous consequences. \\"In the city of Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia was damaged by floods in 2009 that reportedly killed more than 100 people; igniting questions of why the country doesn‚Äôt have effective drainage systems in place.\\"  Human  The U.S. National Library of Medicine notes that the silver iodide has no known ‚Äúill effects‚Äù on people, although people‚Äôs ‚Äúhands may have remained yellowed for weeks‚Äù after being exposed to it. Project Stormfury Storm prevention Hail cannons at an international congress on hail shooting held in 1901 Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into storms and seeding the eyewall with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983. A similar project using soot was run in 1958, with inconclusive results. Various methods have been proposed to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes. Moshe Alamaro of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed using barges with upward-pointing jet engines to trigger smaller storms to disrupt the progress of an incoming hurricane; critics doubt the jets would be powerful enough to make any noticeable difference. Alexandre Chorin of the University of California, Berkeley, proposed dropping large amounts of environmentally friendly oils on the sea surface to prevent droplet formation. Experiments by Kerry Emanuel of MIT in 2002 suggested that hurricane-force winds would disrupt the oil slick, making it ineffective. Other scientists disputed the factual basis of the theoretical mechanism assumed by this approach. The Florida company Dyn-O-Mat and its CEO, Peter Cordani, proposed the use of a patented product it developed, called Dyn-O- Gel, to reduce the strength of hurricanes. The substance is a polymer in powder form (a polyacrylic acid derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm AeroGroup which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, AeroGroup tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the B-57 aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida. The tests were documented on film and made international news showing the storms were successfully removed on monitored Doppler radar. In 2003, the program was shut down because of political pressure through NOAA. Numerical simulations performed by NOAA showed however that it would not be a practical solution for large systems like a tropical cyclone.Subject: C5d) Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by adding a water absorbing substance ?, NOAA HRD FAQ Hail cannons have been used by some farmers since the 19th century in an attempt to ward off hail, but there is no reliable scientific evidence to confirm their effectiveness. Another new anti-hurricane technology is a method for the reduction of tropical cyclones' destructive force ‚Äì pumping sea water into and diffusing it in the wind at the bottom of such tropical cyclone in its eye wall. Hurricane modification NOAA published a page addressing various ideas in regards to tropical cyclone manipulation. In 2007, \\"How to stop a hurricane\\" explored various ideas such as: * Using lasers to discharge lightning in storms which are likely to become hurricanes * Pouring liquid nitrogen onto the sea to deprive the hurricane of heat energy. * Creating soot to absorb sunlight and change air temperature and create convection currents in the outer wall. Researchers from NOAA's hurricane research division addressed hurricane control based ideas. Later ideas (2017) include laser inversion along the same lines as laser cooling (normally used at cryogenic temperatures) but intended to cool the top 1mm of water. If enough power was used then it might be enough combined with computer modeling to form an interference pattern able to inhibit a hurricane or significantly reduce its strength by depriving it of heat energy. In the military Operation Popeye was a highly classified operation run by the US military in 1967-1972. The purpose was to prolong Monsoon in Southeast Asia. The overwhelming precipitation successfully disrupted the tactical logistics of Vietnamese army. Operation Popeye is believed as the first successful practice of weather modification technology in warfare. After it was unveiled, weather modification in warfare was banned by the Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD). In \\"Benign Weather Modification\\" published March 1997, Air Force Major Barry B. Coble superficially documents the existence of weather modification science where he traces the developments that have occurred, notably, in the hands of the Pentagon and CIA's staunchest ideological enemies. * The first scientifically controlled and monitored effort generally recognized by the meteorological community as constituting weather modification occurred in 1948. When Dr. Irving Langmuir first experimented with artificially seeding clouds to produce rain, his experiments showed positive results ‚Äì sparking tremendous interest in the field nearly overnight. * Many countries throughout the world practice weather modification. The Russians have long been interested in using weather modification as a way to control hail. In the 1990s a directive from the chief of staff of the Air Force Ronald R. Fogleman was issued to examine the concepts, capabilities, and technologies the United States would require to remain the dominant air and space force in the future. In law =US and Canada agreement= In 1975, the US and Canada entered into an agreement under the auspices of the United Nations for the exchange of information on weather modification activity. =1977 UN Environmental Modification Convention= Weather modification, particularly hostile weather warfare, was addressed by the \\"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72, TIAS 9614 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.\\" The Convention was signed in Geneva on May 18, 1977; entered into force on October 5, 1978; ratified by U.S. President Jimmy Carter on December 13, 1979; and the U.S. ratification deposited at New York January 17, 1980. =US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration= In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration keeps records of weather modification projects on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, under authority of Public Law 92-205, 15 USC ¬ß 330B, enacted in 1971. =Proposed US legislation= 2005 U.S. Senate Bill 517 and U.S. House Bill 2995 U.S. Senate Bill 517S. 517 [109th]: Weather Modification Research and Development Policy Authorization Act of 2005, proposed by U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and then U.S. Representative (later Senator) Mark Udall of Colorado (GovTrack.us) and U.S. House Bill 2995 were two bills proposed in 2005 that would have expanded experimental weather modification, to establish a Weather Modification Operations and Research Board, and implemented a national weather modification policy. Neither were made into law. 2007 U.S. Senate Bill 1807 & U.S. House Bill 3445 Senate Bill 1807 and House Bill 3445, identical bills introduced July 17, 2007, proposed to establish a Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board to fund weather modification research In religion and mythology Witches concoct a brew to summon a hailstorm. Magical and religious practices to control the weather are attested in a variety of cultures. In ancient India it is said that yajna or vedic rituals of chanting mantras and offering were performed by rishis to bring sudden bursts of rain fall in rain starved regions. Some Indigenous Americans, like some Europeans, had rituals which they believed could induce rain. The Finnish people, on the other hand, were believed by others to be able to control weather. As a result, Vikings refused to take Finns on their oceangoing raids. Remnants of this superstition lasted into the twentieth century, with some ship crews being reluctant to accept Finnish sailors. The early modern era saw people observe that during battles the firing of cannons and other firearms often initiated precipitation. In Greek mythology, Iphigenia was offered as a human sacrifice to appease the wrath of the goddess Artemis, who had becalmed the Achaean fleet at Aulis at the beginning of the Trojan War. In Homer's Odyssey, Aeolus, keeper of the winds, bestowed Odysseus and his crew with a gift of the four winds in a bag. However, the sailors opened the bag while Odysseus slept, looking for booty (money), and as a result were blown off course by the resulting gale.Homer, The Odyssey, book 10. In ancient Rome, the lapis manalis was a sacred stone kept outside the walls of Rome in a temple of Mars. When Rome suffered from drought, the stone was dragged into the city.Sir James Frazer, The Golden Bough, ch. 5 (abridged edition), \\"The Magical Control of Rain\\" The Berwick witches of Scotland were found guilty of using black magic to summon storms to murder King James VI of Scotland by seeking to sink the ship upon which he travelled.Christopher Smout, A History of the Scottish People 1560‚Äì1830, pp. 184‚Äì192 Scandinavian witches allegedly claimed to sell the wind in bags or magically confined into wooden staves; they sold the bags to seamen who could release them when becalmed.Adam of Bremen and Ole Worm are quoted as maintaining this in Grillot de Givry's Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy (Frederick Publications, 1954). In various towns of Navarre, prayers petitioned Saint Peter to grant rain in time of drought. If the rain was not forthcoming, the statue of St Peter was removed from the church and tossed into a river. In the Hebrew Bible, it is recorded that Elijah in the way of judgement, told King Ahab that neither dew nor rain would fall until Elijah called for it.1 Kinks 17:1 It is further recorded that the ensuing drought lasted for a period of 3.5 years at which time Elijah called the rains to come again and the land was restored.1 Kings 18 The New Testament records Jesus Christ controlling a storm by speaking to it.Mark 4:39 In Islam, Salat Al- Istisqa‚Äô (Prayer for Rain) is taken as recourse when seeking rain from God during times of drought.  Conspiracy theories  Weather modification, along with climate engineering, is a recurring theme in conspiracy theories. The chemtrail conspiracy theory supposes that jet contrails are chemically altered to modify the weather and other phenomena. Other theories attempt to implicate scientific infrastructure such as the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program or individuals such as the Rothschild family.  In literature  Frank Herbert's Dune series features weather control technology, mainly in the planets of Arrakis, where the technology is used to assure for privacy from observation and in order to hide from the Imperium their true population and their plans to terraform the planet, and in Chapterhouse, where the Bene Gesserit intend to turn the planet into a desert.

Today, Northern Cameroons forms parts of the Borno, Adamawa, and Taraba states of Nigeria, and the self-declared independent state of Southern Cameroons was renamed Ambazonia, the latter considered internationally to be part of Cameroon. History Cameroon from 1901-1972 The area of present-day Cameroon was claimed by Germany as a protectorate during the \\"Scramble for Africa\\" at the end of the 19th century. The German Empire named the territory Kamerun. =League of Nations Mandate= During the First World War, it was occupied by British, French and Belgian troops, and a later League of Nations Mandate to Great Britain and France by the League of Nations in 1922. The French mandate was known as Cameroun and the British territory was administered as two areas, Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons. Northern Cameroons consisted of two non-contiguous sections, divided by a point where the Nigerian and Cameroun borders met. In the 1930s, most of the white population consisted of Germans, which were interned in British camps starting in June 1940. The native population of 400,000 showed little interest in volunteering for the British forces; only 3,500 men did so.I.C.B Dear, ed, The Oxford Companion to World War II (1995) p 163 =Trust territory= When the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were reclassified as UN trust territories, henceforth administered through the UN Trusteeship Council. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence. The United Nations approved the Trusteeship Agreements for British Cameroons to be governed by Britain on 6 December 1946. =Independence= French Cameroun became independent, as Cameroun or Cameroon, in January 1960, and Nigeria was scheduled for independence later that same year, which raised question of what to do with the British territory. After some discussion (which had been going on since 1959), a plebiscite was agreed to and held on 11 February 1961. The Muslim-majority Northern area opted for union with Nigeria, and the Southern area voted to join Cameroon.Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p177 Northern Cameroons became the Sardauna Province of Northern NigeriaParties and Politics in Northern Nigeria, Routledge, 1968, page 155 on 31 May 1961, while Southern Cameroons became West Cameroon, a constituent state of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, later that year on 1 October 1961.

He is introduced in chapter #25 , first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on May 21, 1985, as Goku's fellow martial arts student under Kame- Sen'nin. As the series progresses, Krillin becomes Goku's closest ally and best friend as he fights every villain along with Goku or before him and is often depicted as the comic relief due to his baldness.  Design and appearance  Toriyama originally created Krillin along with the Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai as a method to help add depth to the story, as his editor Kazuhiko Torishima had stated that the series' protagonist, Goku, was too plain. Torishima explained that in order to develop Goku's characterization, they needed someone petty and mischievous to provide contrast, thus leading to the introduction of Krillin. Y≈´suke Watanabe, who wrote the screenplay for the film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, had originally written the film to take place at Krillin and Android #18's wedding, but Toriyama wrote it to take place at Bulma's birthday party. Watanabe thought Toriyama made the change because he wanted fans to imagine the wedding for themselves.DVD & Blu-ray Vision, issue #4, March 19, 2013 Toriyama cited Krillin and Bulma's older ages at the end of the manga as a reason he chose for Battle of Gods to take place after the Boo arc since they were in their \\"strongest condition at that time.\\"\\"Akira Toriyama Interview (Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods)\\". saiyanisland.com. March 17, 2013. Krillin's appearance stays relatively the same for the majority of the series. He is first introduced at age 13, with a shaved head and still dressed in the yellow-and-orange clothing worn at the monastery at which he had been training. He does not possess a visible nose, and has six spots of moxibustion burns on his forehead, a reference to the practice of Shaolin monks. Toriyama once stated, seemingly humorously, that Krillin's lack of a nose is because he has a \\"physical idiosyncrasy\\" that allows him to breathe through the pores of his skin. Later, he wears the orange gi uniform that is presented to both himself and Goku by Kame-Sen'nin in honor of their first martial arts competition.Dragon Ball manga, volume 3, chapter ? Occasionally he is seen in casual clothes, but for the most part continues to dress for training or fighting at all times.Dragon Ball Z anime, episode 1 During the Frieza arc, he wears Saiyan armor provided by Vegeta,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter ? but during the Cell arc he returns to wearing the orange gi, accompanied by a blue short-sleeved undershirt and boots.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter ? After the defeat of Cell, Krillin stops shaving his head, and grows his black hair out, before later shaving it again during Frieza's resurrection.Dragon Ball Z manga, vol. 20, chapter 232 When he settles down with his family, Krillin is shown wearing a workout outfit consisting of a red \\"Tacos\\" T-shirt and brown drawstring pants.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 20, chapter ?

However, after doing the hardships that Kame- Sen'nin assigns, the two become friends. After finishing their training, Kame- Sen'nin has Krillin and Goku compete in the 21st Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai. Krillin beats the odored fighter Bacterian, who uses his stench as a weapon, and makes it to the semi-finals. However, he is defeated by Jackie Chun, who is really Kame-Sen'nin in disguise preventing his students from becoming arrogant with too many victories. Krillin continues to train with Kame-Sen'nin and helps Goku to collect the Dragon Balls by fighting against General Blue and participating in Baba Uranai's tournament. However, he is quickly defeated by Dracula Man, who bites down on his head, causing blood to pour out.Dragon Ball manga, volume 9, chapter 99 Three years later, Krillin enters the 22nd Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai.Dragon Ball manga, volume 10, chapter ?

Several years later, in the span of a day, Krillin is attacked by Raditz while attending a reunion,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 2 and is unable to save Gohan from Piccolo, who takes him for training.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 10 A year afterward, Krillin confronts the Saiyan invaders Vegeta and Nappa along with his friends,Dragon Ball manga, volume 18, chapter 213 following months of training in preparation for their arrival. After Yamcha's death, he avenges his friend by killing most of the Saibermen. In the battle against Nappa, Krillin tries to get involved in his fight with Tenshinhan after Nappa severs the latter's arm, though is stopped by Nappa. Krillin double teams Nappa with Piccolo, creating multiple copies of themselves with the Tri-Form and failing thanks to the clones cutting their power. Krillin later goes toe-to-toe with Nappa alone, launching a Kienzan at him that Nappa almost catches before Vegeta warns him, and is saved from an attack from Nappa by Piccolo. After Nappa is defeated, and Goku arrives, Krillin requests that he fight Vegeta elsewhere to prevent their friends' corpses from being destroyed. He and Gohan leave the battlefield but return after Gohan worries for Goku, who is being crushed by Vegeta in his Oozaru form. Krillin unsuccessfully attempts cutting Vegeta's tail in a sneak attack, and later is given the Genki Dama to launch at Vegeta by Goku, which misses initially but is bounded back by Gohan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 4, chapter 43 After Vegeta yields from further conflict given his extensive injuries, Krillin takes Yajirobe's sword and moves in to kill him, but agrees to spare his life per Goku's request.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 5, chapter 47 He then travels with Gohan and Bulma to planet Namek to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive their dead friends, since the Earth's Dragon Balls vanished due to Piccolo's death.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 5, chapter ? Once there, they save a young Namekian called Dende from death at the hands of Frieza's henchmen. Krillin receives an increase in power from Guru, the grand elder of the Namekians, when he unlocks his hidden potential. After a few close encounters with Vegeta, Krillin and Gohan are forced to team up with him in order to fight Frieza's strongest warriors, the Ginyu Force. They are overpowered by them until Goku arrives and defeats the Force.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 8, chapter ? After Krillin and Gohan collect the seven Dragon Balls and wish back Piccolo, they begin a battle against Frieza, during which Krillin is stabbed in the chest,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 102 removes Frieza's tail following being healed by Dende, thereby distracting Frieza from continuing to crush Gohan to death,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 105 and injures Vegeta in an attempt to capitalize on his Saiyan ability to grow stronger when in a near-death state at Vegeta's request.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 10, chapter 109 After a long fight between Goku and Frieza, Goku decides to use the Genki-dama, Krillin giving his energy to Piccolo so he can stall Frieza and attacking Frieza himself with his last bit of strength. When the group recovers from the Genki-dama, and Frieza emerges unscathed, the latter detonates Krillin from the inside, killing him instantly, which triggers Goku's first ever transformation into a Super Saiyan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 11, chapter 123 After Frieza's defeat, Krillin is revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 135 Krillin trains for three years to confront Dr. Gero who tries to use his androids to kill Goku.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 144 Krillin is momentarily forced to leave his friends with the androids to take Yamcha away from the battlefield in the aftermath of his deadly encounter with Gero, who Krillin finds the base of and signals the others to his location after having a fight with Gero.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 155 When the Androids, #16, #17 and #18 are released, Krillin is the only hero present that does not engage #17 and #18 due to his fear. After the duo defeat his friends, Krillin unsuccessfully pleads for the androids to spare Goku's life, and becomes infatuated with the female #18 after she kisses him on the cheek, and he then heals his defeated friends. After Krillin encounters the artificial life form Cell, Krillin and Trunks travel to Dr. Gero's laboratory basement, where Krillin kills the present timeline version of Cell and the two discover the weakness to the androids is a deactivating controller, which Bulma constructs and gives to Krillin. Krillin soon after encounters #18 with the module and after a period of deliberation, destroys it. Because of this, regardless of his efforts, Cell absorbs her and achieves his perfect form.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 16, chapter ? Enraged over her loss, Krillin engages Cell in combat, the latter standing in place while Krillin's attacks have no effect and striking Krillin only once, placing Krillin in a near-death state. After Krillin is revived by Trunks, he warns Trunks of Cell's strength, having been able to sense his true power right before being attacked. He moves Vegeta away from the impending fight between Trunks and Cell, healing Vegeta during the battle between the two. He later participates in the Cell Games, a martial arts tournament created by Cell for entertainment, and fights one of the Cell Juniors who attack him and his friends, but is saved by Gohan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 19, chapter ? After Gohan punches Cell in the stomach, he regurgitates Android #18 and Krillin cares for her comatose body while Gohan destroys Cell.

However, after learning of Goku's return from the afterlife to compete in the 25th Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai, he decides to also participate, also being encouraged to do so for the money by #18. During Goten and Trunks' match, Krillin worries that Trunks' energy attack will hit the crowd.Dragon Ball manga, volume 37, chapter 434 Krillin wins his sole match, against Pintar, during the competition with ease. After the Kai≈ç-shin enlists several of Krillin's friends to help him defeat the wizard Bobbidi, Krillin joins them, in doing so forfeiting his entry in the tournament, but is stopped from assisting any further thanks to Dabura turning him into stone with his spit.

Krillin tries stopping a pair of wrongdoers when he is knocked out by an arriving Gohan in his Saiyaman guise. Krillin agrees to train with Goku after some reluctance and the two travel to get Paradise Grass from an island, encountering large, physical versions of past enemies that Krillin becomes fearful of. The two are revealed to be in the \\"Forest of Fear\\", Krillin saving Goku from a phantom of Super Shenron that the two destroy together. Krillin is requested by Goku and Gohan for participation in the Tournament of Power; he accepts. Krillin eliminates Universe 4's Shosa and Majora before being eliminated himself by Frost. Krillin's shouts of encouragement for Android 18 contribute to her victory over Universe 2's Ribrianne, and he feeds Vegeta a Senzu Bean after his elimination by Universe 11's Jiren.  Voice actors  Krillin is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the original Japanese anime and in all related media. Toriyama chose Tanaka after hearing her portrayal of the protagonist Giovanni in the film Night on the Galactic Railroad. When Krillin and Yajirobe, another character voiced by Tanaka, appeared in the same scenes, she gave the latter a Nagoya dialect in order to distinguish them. Canadian actress-musician Wanda Nowicki performed the English voice of Krillin (here named Bongo) in the rare Harmony Gold dub of Mystical Adventure. When Dragon Ball Z received a short- lived English dub by Saban Entertainment, Funimation, and Ocean Productions in the mid 1990s, Krillin was voiced by Terry Klassen. He reprised his role in the Ocean dub of the latter half of the series produced by AB Groupe for European and Canadian markets. Another short-lived English dub produced by Harmony Gold in the late-1980s featured Wanda Nowicki as the voice of Krillin. In the Blue Water 2003 re-dub of Dragon Ball, he is voiced by Mike Thiessen. Dan Gascon voiced him in the Blue Water dub of Dragon Ball GT. When the series' full production was taken over by Funimation in the US, Krillin was voiced by Laurie Steele as a child in Dragon Ball and Sonny Strait as an adult in all media released to the US. Strait got cast as the role following his audition in Texas. He found the character's constant deaths amusing and thought him comical: \\"Krillin is the party. If you don‚Äôt wish back the party, you‚Äôre going to be bored.\\" Other English voice actors include Sharon Mann, Brian Beacock, and Julie Maddalena.  Abilities  Krillin has many abilities including super-strength, super-speed, and the ability to fly using his ki energy, known as .

Lacking the other protagonists' advantage of getting stronger every time he is injured, Krillin is however the strongest Earthling With a Big Power Increase In Dragon Ball super and was recognized as having great technique by Vegeta.  Appearances in other media  In a filler episode of Dragon Ball, Krillin trains with Kame-Sen'nin and after the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai, Krillin can be seen on a plane with his friends. In filler episodes of Dragon Ball Z, during the Saiyan arc, Krillin fails to tell Chi-Chi of Goku's passing after being tasked with informing her, though does inform Yamcha when coming to one of his baseball games followed by recruiting him for training with Kami, and trains for the Saiyans by facing members of their race from the past using the Pendulum Room. Before the Namek arc, Krillin encounters a group of children who help him find Namek and spends some time on a fake version of the planet searching for Dragon Balls during a distraction and preventing his ship from being stolen. After the Namek arc, Krillin is one of a few not affected by the Black Water Mist set by Garlic Jr., Krillin having to fight his friends before journeying to Kami's Lookout, where he appears to fall under the effects of the Black Water Mist, only to be revealed as faking as part of a plan by Piccolo. Krillin's near-death state by the hands of the Spice Boys, Spice and Vinegar, triggers Gohan's power boost and subsequent killing of the pair. During this time, he breaks up with Maron once he becomes convinced she deserves better than himself, learning afterward that she would have married him. During the Cell arc, he stops Cell from murdering a girl and her younger brother and while waiting for the Cell Games, celebrates Gohan's birthday. In the Boo arc, Krillin charges Boo after Boo escapes the Room of Spirit and Time, being easily defeated and attacks Boo again in the afterlife. After Boo's defeat, Krillin attends a gathering with his family.

In the 2002 game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai, Cell has a nightmare where he accidentally absorbs Krillin and becomes , the form making him weaker.Dragon Ball Z: Budokai In the 2015 video game Dragon Ball: Xenoverse, Krillin serves as a mentor to the player character, teaching his Kienzan. He also appears during Android 18's mentorship of the player, fighting them alongside her. In the Frieza arc, Krillin and Vegeta being defeated by Frieza, leaving Gohan alone to fight the tyrant, causes Goku to exit the healing chamber still wounded. In the final fight against Demigra, Krillin gives energy to the player. In the 2016 game Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, during the Frieza arc, the player assists Krillin in battling Zarbon, and Krillin later leaves the player to fight Lord Slug and Turles alone per the player's request. In the 2018 game Dragon Ball FighterZ, after clones of various heroes and villains from the series appear, Krillin investigates the origin of them before being knocked out by his own clone. Following Goku rescuing him, the two rescue various allies from clones until encountering Cell, who Krillin becomes aggressive toward for his defeat of Android 18. In June 1988, Krillin along with other Dragon Ball characters were featured in two public safety announcement shorts. The first was entitled , and the second called where he along with Kame-Sen'nin, Yamcha, and later Goku become volunteer fire fighters. Krillin also appears in the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover manga Cross Epoch where he and Tony Tony Chopper run the Kuri-Chopa Marine Train Coster. In 2003, he would appear in the interactive feature entitled . Where he and Gohan attempt to save visitors of at Fuji Television's orb section from drowning, while Goku battles Frieza. In the 2004 followup , Krillin is one of the seven Dragon Ball characters who delivers the Dragon Balls to restore the aqua city of Odaiba after Goku and Monkey D. Luffy's battle with Eneru. Krillin has performed many songs throughout the years. These songs feature his voice actor Mayumi Tanaka in character singing cheerfully about certain thing pertaining to Krillin. First with the song \\"Asa - Hiru - Yoru - Kimi - Boku\\" from the album Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection IV: Character Special released in 1990. Then with \\"Ichido wa Kekkon Shitai Manbo\\" from Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection 8: Character Special 2 released in 1991. Where he happily sings about the desire to get married. And the title track from Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection 17: Hippy Hoppy Shake!! released in 1995. Before and after Dragon Ball Z debuting in the U.S. in 1996, Krillin became a part of the country's pop culture. In 1994, the character was featured on the cover of Voodoo Glow Skulls' first full-length album Who Is, This Is?, though his face was removed in the 2012 digital re-release. The song \\"Blessing\\" by Chance the Rapper mentions Krillin referencing Android 18 to the lyricist's delight. Krillin appears in an episode of Mad watching the other Dragon Ball characters after they are drafted for the Oakland A's by Billy Beane in a parody of the film Moneyball.\\"Money Ball Z / Green Care Bear\\". Mad. November 21, 2011. Cartoon Network.  Reception  Krillin is a popular character in the series; in 2004 Japanese fans voted him the seventh most popular character. In January 2007, Oricon held a poll in which they asked Japanese fans of manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spin-off series. Krillin ranked third in the men's poll and sixth in the overall poll. In 2016, Krillin was ranked No. 3 on the saikoplus.com list 10 Most Popular Characters in Dragon Ball Z. When younger fans would belittle the character as weak, Krillin's voice actress Mayumi Tanaka said she would explain to them that Krillin and Yamcha are the strongest earthlings, the other characters are all aliens. She also said it was more fun to play Krillin when he was a dirty-minded bad kid, that she was not fond of him growing his hair out and was shocked when he died for the first time. Various publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Krillin's character, adding praise and criticism to his development and traits in the series. Anime News Network writer Carl Kimlinger liked Krillin and Goku's childhood, noting it to be the warmth that the later Dragon Ball Z anime does not have. Also believing the first anime to have more development than the sequel, Tim Jones from Them Anime Reviews cited how Krillin was not a friend to Goku when first introduced. David F. Smith of IGN comments that Krillin and #18's relationship really help make the storyline more interesting. Additionally, he liked Krillin's appearances in the fight against Cell as he has more screen time than the main character, Goku. Although Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment thought that Krillin had a drastic change in Dragon Ball GT, he mentioned that fans from the previous series would like some of its episodes due to the appearance of Krillin and other older characters.

For a tenant, rent is an expense. For students or parents, tuition is an expense. Buying food, clothing, furniture or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. An expense is a cost that is \\"paid\\" or \\"remitted\\", usually in exchange for something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is \\"expensive\\". Something that seems to cost little is \\"inexpensive\\". \\"Expenses of the table\\" are expenses of dining, refreshments, a feast, etc. In accounting, expense has a very specific meaning. It is an outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. This outflow of cash is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. Technically, an expense is an event in which an asset is used up or a liability is incurred. In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners' equity. The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as: Expense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former. Bookkeeping for expenses In double-entry bookkeeping, expenses are recorded as a debit to an expense account (an income statement account) and a credit to either an asset account or a liability account, which are balance sheet accounts. An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense. Cash flow In a cash flow statement (flow of funds statement), expenditures are divided into three categories: * Operating: Operational expense ‚Äì salary for employees * Investing: Capital expenditure ‚Äì buying equipment * Expenditures (financial) Financing expense ‚Äì interest expense for loans and bonds Whether a particular expenditure is classified as an expense, which is reported immediately on the business's income statement or whether it is classified as a capital expenditure (or an expenditure subject to depreciation) which is not an expense flow of funds statement. Though, these latter types of expenditures are reported as expenses when they are depreciated by businesses that use accrual-basis accounting- as most large businesses and all C corporations do. Defining an expense as capital or income using the most common interpretation depends upon its term. When an expense is seen as a purchase it alleviates this distinction. Soon after the purchase, (that which was expenses holds no value), then it is usually identified as an expense. It will be viewed as capital with life that should be amortized/depreciated and retained on the balance sheet if it retains value soon and long after the purchase. Deduction of business expenses under the United States tax code For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code permits the deduction of business expenses in the tax payable year in which those expenses are paid or incurred. This is in contrast to capital expendituresCapital expenditures must recovered over a period of years through depreciation and amortization. See also Expenses versus Capital Expenditures. that are paid or incurred to acquire an asset. Expenses are costs that do not acquire, improve, or prolong the life of an asset. For example, a person who buys a new truck for a business would be making a capital expenditure because they have acquired a new business-related asset. This cost could not be deducted in the current taxable year. However, the gas the person buys during that year to fuel that truck would be considered a deductible expense. The cost of purchasing gas does not improve or prolong the life of the truck but simply allows the truck to run.For more on this subject, see Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 170-73 (2d ed. 2007). Even if something qualifies as an expense, it is not necessarily deductible. As a general rule, expenses are deductible if they relate to a taxpayer's trade or business activity or if the expense is paid or incurred in the production or collection of income from an activity that does not rise to the level of a trade or business (investment activity). Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for business or trade expenses. In order to be a trade or business expense and qualify for a deduction, it must satisfy 5 elements in addition to qualifying as an expense. It must be (1) ordinary and (2) necessary (Welch v. Helvering defines this as necessary for the development of the business at least in that they were appropriate and helpful). Expenses paid to preserve one's reputation do not appear to qualify). In addition, it must be (3) paid or incurred during the taxable year. It must be paid (4) in carrying on (meaning not prior to the start of a business or in creating it) (5) a trade or business activity. To qualify as a trade or business activity, it must be continuous and regular, and profit must be the primary motive. An expense can be a loss or profit. But loss or profit need not really be an expense. Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for investment expenses. In addition to being an expense and satisfying elements 1-4 above, expenses are deductible as an investment activity under Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code if they are (1) for the production or collection of income, (2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, or (3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax. In investing, one controversy that mounted throughout 2002 and 2003 was whether companies should report the granting of stock options to employees as an expense on the income statement, or should not report this at all in the income statement, which is what had previously been the norm. Expense report An expense report is a form of document that contains all the expenses that an individual has incurred as a result of the business operation. For example, if the owner of a business travels to another location for a meeting, the cost of travel, the meals, and all other expenses that he/she has incurred may be added to the expense report. Consequently, these expenses will be considered business expenses and are tax deductible. Many businesses benefit from automated expense reports systems for expense management. Depending on the system chosen, these software solutions can reduce time costs, errors, and fraud.

To amortise a loan means \\"to kill it off\\". In accounting, amortisation refers to charging or writing off an intangible asset's cost as an operational expense over its estimated useful life to reduce a company's taxable income.  Etymology  The word comes from Middle English amortisen to kill, alienate in mortmain, from Anglo-French amorteser, alteration of amortir, from Vulgar Latin admortire \\"to kill\\", from Latin ad- and mort-, \\"death\\". Applications of amortisation *When used in the context of a home purchase, amortisation is the process by which loan principal decreases over the life of a loan, typically an amortizing loan. As each mortgage payment is made, part of the payment is applied as interest on the loan, and the remainder of the payment is applied towards reducing the principal. An amortisation schedule, a table detailing each periodic payment on a loan, shows the amounts of principal and interest and demonstrates how a loan's principal amount decreases over time. An amortisation schedule can be generated by an amortisation calculator. Negative amortisation is an amortisation schedule where the loan amount actually increases through not paying the full interest. *In business, amortization allocates a lump sum amount to different time periods, particularly for loans and other forms of finance, including related interest or other finance charges. Amortisation is also applied to capital expenditures of certain assets under accounting rules, particularly intangible assets, in a manner analogous to depreciation. *In tax law in the United States, amortization refers to the cost recovery system for intangible property. *In computer science, amortised analysis is a method of analyzing the execution cost of algorithms over a sequence of operations. *In the context of zoning regulations, amortisation refers to the time period a non-conforming property has to conform to a new zoning classification before the non-conforming use becomes prohibited. For example, if the city rezones property from industrial to residential and sets an amortisation period of one year, all property within the rezoned boundary must move from industrial use to residential use within one year. *In the context of Securitization the Joshua Curve relates to a unique amortisation profile that results in the innovative \\"horseshoe Shape\\" or \\"J Shape\\" weighted average life (\\"WAL\\") distribution. In other words, if the base case results in a WAL of 10.0 years, the stress case and performance case would both result in reduced WALs that are both less than 10.0 years due to accelerated amortisation.

While formerly considered a monotypic genus, a recent review has argued that some of the northeast African populations are a distinct species, E. poliophaeus (Blue Nile patas monkey), proposing in addition that the subspecies E. p. pyrrhonotus be elevated to full specific status, along with the formerly recognised subspecies E. p. baumstarki for the population in Tanzania.

It was formerly considered the only member of the genus Erythrocebus, but the Blue Nile patas monkey, previously synonymized with this species, was resurrected in 2018.  Taxonomy  There is some confusion surrounding the number of valid subspecies, with some listing four, and others listing two; the western Erythrocebus patas patas (Common patas; with a black nose) and the eastern Erythrocebus patas pyrrhonotus (Nisnas; with a white nose). Others, however, have suggested that at least some of the features used to separate these subspecies are merely variations in the female's facial pattern during pregnancy. On the other hand, the change in the nose during pregnancy occurs only in the West African populations.  Description  The male patas monkey grows to to in length, excluding the tail, which measures . Adult males are considerably larger than adult females, which average in length.Kurt J. Gron (2006), Primate Factsheets: Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) Taxonomy, Morphology, & Ecology. Accessed 2018 July 23. Q.v. for references. Adult males average 12.4 kg (27.3 lb) and adult females 6.5 kg (14.3 lb), showing a high degree of sexual dimorphism. Reaching speeds of , it is the fastest runner among the primates.. The life span in the wild can be up to about 20 years.  Distribution and habitat  It is found in many parts of central, western, and eastern Africa. It also has been introduced to Puerto Rico. The species avoids dense woodlands and lives in more open tropical savanna.  Behavior  The patas monkey lives in multi- female groups of up to 60 individuals (although much larger aggregations have been reported). The group contains just one adult male for most of the year. During the breeding season, there are multi-male influxes into the group. Once juvenile males reach sexual maturity (around the age of four years) they leave the group, usually joining all-male groups. The adult females in the group initiate movement of the group with the male following their lead. = Female social organization = Variation in the female social structure of patas monkeys has been observed across different populations. This variation may be dependent on food resources, as conflict between individuals is often a result of competition for limited resources. Higher rates of conflict over dense, but limited, food, such as fruit bushes, is associated with more stable, well defined dominance hierarchies than habitats with more diffuse resources, such as insects. Variation in the availability of these resources has been associated with variation in dominance hierarchies among females. Conflict among females has also shown the presence of recognition among matrilineal relatives. It has been observed that, shortly after conflicts among two females, patas monkeys often act differently toward each other than if they had not been in conflict. Females often ‚Äúreconcile‚Äù with each other by activities such as sitting together and grooming. While this reconciliatory behavior is observed even between unrelated individuals, it is most common among matrilineal relatives. Dominance structure has relatively little effect on the probability of reconciliation occurring, except that the alpha-female is the least reconciliatory of the females. Affiliation toward matrilineal relatives is common in other primates as well, such as vervet monkeys. = Male social organization = Mating in patas monkeys is seasonal and occurs during the wet season. During periods when females are not receptive, relatively stable groups with one adult resident male and several females are the norm. This leaves an excess of males that either form all male groups or live on their own. During the mating season, resident males may be chased away by invading solitary males. This usually results in the formation of multi- male, multi-female groups shortly thereafter, as more males invade a group. The new resident male does not chase away subordinate invading males, but rather focuses on mating with females. At the end of the mating season, one- male, multi-female groups stabilize. One male remains as the resident male and chases other males away. In some instances, submissive males are tolerated by the resident male for short periods of time; however, they rarely remain in the group for more than several days. Young males have been observed to leave their natal groups anywhere from two to four years of age. However, one study showed that most juveniles left before they were three, which is before most males reach sexual maturity. This contrasts with an earlier study in which juveniles were observed to leave later, at sexual maturity, indicating that there may be variation between groups. The reason young males leave their natal group is also contested. Dominant males have been observed to act aggressively toward younger males in captivity. However, observations of wild patas monkeys has shown young males leaving the group in which they were born without any aggressive behavior from the adult male. The juveniles, in the time shortly before they leave, spend increasingly less and less time with the adult females in the group. However, juvenile males do not change the amount of time they spend near the adult male. This may indicate weakening of matrilineal ties, rather than male aggression, as the main reason juveniles disperse from their natal group. = Alarm calls = Patas monkeys have several distinct alarm calls that warn members in the group of predators. Different alarm calls are given by different group members (i.e. adult females, adult males, juveniles, etc.) and certain alarm calls are distinctive of different types of predators. Unlike other primates, patas monkeys rarely take refuge from predators in trees. This is most likely the due to the relatively sparse tree cover in patas monkey habitats. While patas monkeys usually run on the ground away from predators, individuals have been observed to attack predators such as jackals and wildcats. This behavior has been observed in both males and females.  Diet  The patas monkey feeds on insects, gum, seeds, and tubers, a diet more characteristic of much smaller primates.

The normal operation period is the amount of time it takes for a company to turn inventory into cash. On a classified balance sheet, liabilities are separated between current and long-term liabilities to help users assess the company's financial standing in short-term and long-term periods. Long-term liabilities give users more information about the long-term prosperity of the company, while current liabilities inform the user of debt that the company owes in the current period. On a balance sheet, accounts are listed in order of liquidity, so long-term liabilities come after current liabilities. In addition, the specific long-term liability accounts are listed on the balance sheet in order of liquidity. Therefore, an account due within eighteen months would be listed before an account due within twenty-four months. Examples of long-term liabilities are bonds payable, long-term loans, capital leases, pension liabilities, post-retirement healthcare liabilities, deferred compensation, deferred revenues, deferred income taxes, and derivative liabilities.  Exceptions  If a liability is currently due in fewer than twelve months and is in the process of being refinanced so that it is due after a year, then a company can record this debt in long-term investments. Additionally, if a liability is to be covered by a long-term investment, it can be recorded as a long-term liability even if it is due in the current period. Still the long- term investment must be sufficient to cover the debt.

The most common way of accounting for petty cash expenditures is to use the imprest system. The initial fund would be created by issuing a cheque for the desired amount. An amount of $100 would typically be sufficient for most small business needs as the expenses to be covered are for small amounts. The bookkeeping entry for this initial fund would be to debit Petty Cash and credit bank account. This cheque would then be cashed to acquire the actual cash needed for payments. As expenditures are made, the custodian of the fund (a bookkeeper or a member of the administration staff) will reimburse employees and receive a petty cash voucher with a receipt/invoice attached in return. At any given time, the total of cash on hand plus reimbursed vouchers must equal the original fund. When the fund gets low, e.g. $20 remaining, the custodian requests a top up and submits the vouchers for reimbursement. Assuming the vouchers add up to $80, an $80 top up cheque is issued and an $80 debit towards office expenses is recorded. Once the cheque is cashed, the custodian again has cash at the original amount of $100. Audit controls Oversight of petty cash is important because of the potential for abuse. Examples of petty cash controls include a limit (such as 10% of the total fund) on disbursements and monthly audits by someone other than the custodian. Use of petty cash is sufficiently widespread that vouchers for use in reimbursement are available at any office supply store. The petty cash daybook is one of the daybooks used in bookkeeping and the double-entry bookkeeping system.

Weaver is a Californian man known by the nickname Handshake Man. Weaver has earned notoriety for frequently bypassing the US Secret Service and shaking the hand of the United States President. Weaver claims his handshakes are often used as a way of passing \\"notes from God\\" to the presidents. According to his site, Weaver is a born-again Christian who is married to Donna Weaver and has two children, Cindy and David. He also believes that God has directly spoken to him and calls himself a \\"modern-day prophet\\". In late 2008, Weaver stated that he would not attempt to shake Barack Obama's hand. Pre 2001 Richard C. Weaver claims to have shaken the hand of four US Presidents after Jimmy Carter. However, with little evidence of such events, it is unknown if these instances actually occurred. The only confirmed event was the 1997 inauguration of Bill Clinton where Weaver managed to shake Clinton's hand. (However, Weaver does have a picture on his website of himself meeting President George H. W. Bush). Despite the incident having led the Secret Service to prepare for his return, Weaver was able to bypass security and meet the then recently inaugurated George W. Bush in 2001. 2001 Presidential Inauguration On the January 20 inauguration event of 2001, Weaver was able to meet George W. Bush and hand him a coin after he had been sworn in as President. Weaver had a standing-room-only ticket that would only allow him access to the event. Despite having been shown tapes of a similar meeting between Weaver and former president Bill Clinton, the Secret Service were not able to catch him. Although Ari Fleischer insisted that the president was in no danger, The Capitol Police took the matter seriously as a breach of security. Post 2001 On February 6, 2003 Weaver attended the National Prayer Breakfast meeting and was able to hand Bush an eight-page typed letter about Iraq \\"from God\\". In 2005, Weaver was arrested on an outstanding warrant related to this event. Unverified Claims Richard C. Weaver's website makes a number of claims. According to his website, he created the Spiritual Revolution through Christ Inc. which was honored in a \\"Spiritual Revolution Day\\" by then Governor Ronald Reagan in 1971. He also claims on his site that in 1977 he started ministering to \\"six presidents, over half the current U.S. Senators, three Supreme Court Justices, many congressmen, and governors\\". There is also a claim to ministering to many pro athletes in baseball, football, and basketball. However, these claims have not been independently substantiated. December 8, 2009, CNN's website discusses an unreleased Secret Service document used for training purposes which discusses various instances where individuals have bypassed the Secret Service and gained access to the president. This document credits Mr. Weaver with four instances of having gained access to a president.

She outlived her husband, who was 32 years her senior, by over 35 years. Lady Baden-Powell became Chief Guide for Britain in 1918. Later the same year, at the Swanwick conference for Commissioners in October, she was presented with a gold Silver Fish, one of only two ever made. She was elected World Chief Guide in 1930. As well as making a major contribution to the development of the Guide/Girl Scout movements, she visited 111 countries during her life, attending Jamborees and national Guide and Scout associations. In 1932, she was created a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire by King George V. Background and early life Born in Chesterfield, England, Olave Soames was the third child and youngest daughter of brewery owner and artist Harold Soames (13 Aug 1855 ‚Äì 25 December 1918), of Gray Rigg, Lilliput, Dorset (descended from the landed gentry Soames family of Sheffield Park) and his wife Katherine Mary, daughter of George Hill.Burke's Landed Gentry 14th ed., ed. Alfred T. Butler, p. 1632. She was educated by her parents and by a number of governesses at home. She lived in seventeen homes in the first 23 years of her life. Olave became keen on outdoor sports including tennis, swimming, football, skating and canoeing, and also played the violin.\\"The Derbyshire Childhood of Olave, Lady Baden-Powell, G.B.E.\\" by Jill E. Armitage, B.A., F.I.P.D., M.I.D.D.A., Storforth Publications, 1994, Adult life =Marriage and children= Baden-Powell with her husband and their three children in 1917. In January 1912, Olave met Second Boer War hero and founder of the Scouts, Robert Baden-Powell, on an ocean liner (RMSP Arcadian) on the way via the Caribbean to New York to start a lecture tour. She was 23, he was 55, and they shared the same birthday. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation. They married on 30 October 1912 in a very private ceremony, in St. Peter's Church, Parkstone, her parish church. She was given away by her father. Apart from clergy, the only other people present were his brother and sister and Robert Kekewich, a close friend of his, her mother and brother, her brother-in-law and Miss Sie Bower, a close friend of hers.\\"Baden-Powell: Two lives of Hero\\" by William Hillcourt, Heineman, 1964, p. 335. The Scouts and Guides of England each donated a penny to buy the Baden-Powells a wedding gift of a car (not the Rolls-Royce called \\"Jam-Roll\\" that was presented to them in 1929). Olave's father helped financially with the purchase of Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire, as a family home where she lived with her husband from 29 January 1919 until 25 October 1938.\\"Baden-Powell:Two lives of Hero\\" by William Hillcourt, Heineman, 1964, pp. 356, 412. The Baden-Powells had three children ‚Äî a son and two daughters (who took the courtesy titles of Honourable in 1929; the son later succeeding his father as the 2nd Lord Baden-Powell upon his father's death in 1941): * Arthur Robert Peter Baden-Powell, later 2nd Baron Baden-Powell (30 October 1913 ‚Äì 9 December 1962), who married Carine Boardman (1913‚Äì1993), and they had two sons and a daughter; at Peter's death, the elder son Robert succeeded him as 3rd Baron Baden-Powell; the younger son, Michael Baden-Powell, and the daughter live in Australia; * The Hon. Heather Grace Baden-Powell (1 June 1915 ‚Äì 3 May 1986), who married John Hall King (4 Nov 1913 ‚Äì 2004), and they had two sons; and * The Hon. Betty St. Clair Baden-Powell, CBE (16 April 1917 ‚Äì 24 April 2004) who, like her mother, met her future husband on board ship, an older man (by a decade) who shared her birthday. She married, on 24 September 1936, Gervas Charles Robert Clay (16 April 1907 ‚Äì 18 April 2009). They had a daughter and three sons. Betty Clay was also prominent in the Guide Movement in Northern Rhodesia until they retired to England in 1964, when she became involved with the Girl Guides in England until her death. In addition, when Olave's sister, Auriol Davidson, n√©e Soames, died in 1919, Olave took her three nieces, Christian (1912‚Äì1975), Clare (1913‚Äì1980), and Yvonne, (1918-2000), into her family and brought them up as her own children. =War work= During 1915 and 1916, with World War I in progress, Olave assisted directly with the war effort in France. Robert had seen the usefulness of the YMCA's recreational huts for the soldiers and persuaded the Mercers' Company (of which he had been Master in 1912) to pay for such a hut at Val-de-Lievres, Calais. It was to be staffed by adults connected with Scouting. Olave was one of the team of five men and three women that staffed the hut at the start. She persuaded her mother to look after the children for the time she would be away. Olave left for France on 7 October 1915, when her second child was five months old. Her regular work in the Mercers' hut included serving cocoa and cigarettes and chatting to those who came in. She also recalled in her autobiography playing her violin and singing at the Christmas Concert. Olave also adopted a number of stray animals during her time in Val-de-Lievres. During this time, Robert had organised the Scouts to sponsor another recreational hut. Olave and two others started this hut at √âtaples after Christmas 1915. At the end of January, Olave was ordered home due to sickness, ending her three months in France. =Growing involvement in Scouting= Ewhurst Place Olave and Robert moved into Ewhurst Place , outside Robertsbridge in Sussex in April 1913. In June of that year, the 1st Ewhurst Scout Troop was inaugurated. Olave was the warranted Scoutmaster of this troop, assisted by the family's housemaid and the gardener. Olave accompanied Robert on many of his Scouting tours and to events. She also typed letters for him. In 1915, the Baden-Powells bought a small car, and after Robert taught her to drive, Olave often drove him to engagements. Although most famously connected with the Girl Guides, Olave's first offer to help them in 1914 was turned down. The Girl Guide movement had started after pressure from girls who wanted to become Scouts. It was set up by Robert Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell. After the reorganisation of the Girl Guides in 1915, Olave again offered to help, this time successfully, and she started organising Guiding in Sussex. She became the County Commissioner for Sussex in March 1916. In October 1916, the first conference for County Commissioners was held and it was here that the Commissioners unanimously requested that Olave take the role of Chief Commissioner ‚Äì she was just pregnant with her third child. Shortly before this she had organised a great number of women in other parts of Britain to take up roles in Guiding. In 1918, Olave was acclaimed Chief Guide, a title she much preferred to Chief Commissioner. =Recognition= Global awards In 1932, she was awarded the Dame Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) by King George V, in recognition of her volunteer work. Finland awarded her the Order of the White Rose of Finland, and Peru the Order of the Sun. In 1957 she was awarded both the 14th Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting,complete list and the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award. Standard Olave Baden- Powell was presented with a personal standard by the UK Girl Guide's County Commissioners. It was designed by Mrs Zigomala. Miss Kay-Shuttleworth supervised the making of the standard. > The Standard of Lady Baden-Powell, Chief Guide of the World, is blue (azure) > from the hoist to the fly. Nearest the hoist is the gold (or) trefoil; then > come two small hemispheres, showing a coloured map of the world, indicating > her post as Chief Guide. These are placed high to the left of the main fly, > which is divided throughout its length by two silver (argent) waves, amongst > which are shown three ships with black hulls and white sails, four dolphins > and the Gold Fish of the Chief Guide.

In the extreme fly the Baden-Powell crests > are embroidered. =Death of Robert Baden-Powell= In October 1938, Olave moved to the Outspan Hotel, Nyeri, Kenya, near her third cousin, Jack Soames, and the notorious Happy Valley set, with her husband, where he died, on 8 January 1941. Lord Erroll was in the funeral procession,\\"Lord Baden-Powell's funeral 1941\\"; Flikr just prior to his murder on 24 January 1941.The Umzindusi Letter, by Tim Topps; Troubador Publishing Ltd.; page 51. After her husband's death, Olave received thousands of letters of condolence. She was helped to reply to them all by Bertha Hines, the wife of David Hines, who was away fighting the Italian army that had invaded Ethiopia and Somalia. Often, Olave would watch Bertha's baby daughter, Penny, while Bertha typed reply letters.David Hines memoirs: see the (London) Daily Telegraph obituary 8 April 2000. =World War II= In 1942 she braved U-boat attacks to return to the UK and, as she had no home to return to, was allocated a grace and favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace, in which she lived from 1943 to 1976. Her own home, Pax Hill, had been commandeered and taken over by the Canadian military. Through World War II she toured the United Kingdom. She was on a visit when a V2 missile damaged her Hampton Court apartment in 1944. As soon as she could after D-Day, she went to France, toured throughout Europe as the war ended to help revive Guiding and Scouting. =After World War II= Lady Baden-Powell visiting Helsinki in 1960. To her left, Mrs. Helvi Sipil√§, to her right, Jarl Wahlstr√∂m. Olave led the Guide Movement worldwide for forty years, travelling all over the globe helping to establish and to encourage the Guide Movements in other countries, and bringing membership to over six and a half million worldwide. Olave was present in Washington, DC in 1962 for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Girl Scouts.Kathleen Weber was invited as a troop representative at the age of 12 to this event. Having suffered a heart attack in Australia in 1961, she was finally banned from travelling by her doctor at the age of 80 in 1970 when she was diagnosed with diabetes from which she eventually died. In 1968 the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) had given Olave a credit card to defray her travel costs. When she stopped travelling, the BSA asked her to use the card for 'keeping in touch'. This included paying for over 2000 Christmas cards she sent to those personally known to her. Having spent her later years in a grace-and-favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace, Olave died on 25 June 1977 at Birtley House, Bramley in Surrey, UK. Her ashes were taken to Kenya to be buried in the same grave as her husband's remains. She was survived by her two daughters, her son having predeceased her. Legacy Robert and Olave Baden-Powell's grave. The Olave Centre for Guides was built in north London in Olave's memory. This has the World Bureau and Pax Lodge in its grounds. Pax Lodge is one of WAGGGS' five World Centres. Scouts and Guides mark 22 February as B.-P. Day or World Thinking Day, the joint birthdays of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World. On that day in 2011, a Blue Plaque was unveiled near the site of the house in Chesterfield where she lived, by Derbyshire County Council following an Internet poll in which she received 18,026 votes out of 25,080 (72%), cf. 1,231 (5%) for George Stephenson (runner-up). The Olave Baden-Powell Bursary Fund was set up in 1979 from voluntary contributions in memory of Olave B-P. Annually awarded bursaries aim to allow girls in Girlguiding UK to further their interests and hobbies and realise their dreams. As a child, Olave learned the violin; her first violin she called Diana. It was a copy of a Stradivarius made by Messrs. Hill for the Paris Exhibition and many years later it was presented to the Guide Association. It is still available on loan to Guides who are seriously learning to play the violin prior to them acquiring their own instrument. See \\"The Derbyshire Childhood...\\" A movement was started in Australia, the idea being, \\"When you buy an ice-cream, buy one also for the Chief Guide\\", and this \\"Ice-cream Fund\\" raises a significant sum every year, sent to Olave B-P to gave away to various Guiding causes; one such was to provide doors for new Guide buildings.

He and his wife Rosalynn Carter partnered with Emory University just after his defeat in the 1980 U.S. Presidential elections. The center is located in a shared building adjacent to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum on of parkland, on the site of the razed neighborhood of Copenhill, two miles (3 km) from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The library and museum are owned and operated by the United States National Archives and Records Administration, while the Center is governed by a Board of Trustees, consisting of business leaders, educators, former government officials, and philanthropists. The Carter Center's goal is to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering, including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries. The center has many projects including election monitoring, supporting locally led state-building and democratic institution-building in various countries, mediating conflicts between warring states, and intervening with heads of states on behalf of victims of human rights abuses. It also leads disease eradication efforts, spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease, as well as controlling and treating onchocerciasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and malaria through awareness campaigns. In 2002, President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work ‚Äúto find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development‚Äù through the Carter Center.Norwegian Nobel Committee, 2002 Nobel Peace Prize announcement, , October 11, 2002, accessed December 19, 2008. In 2007, he wrote an autobiography entitled Beyond the White House: Waging Peace, Fighting Disease, Building Hope, which chronicles the first 25 years of The Carter Center. History The Center was founded in 1982 and dedicated in 1986 with William Foege as its executive director. In 1993, John Hardman was appointed executive director, and during the 1990s the Center received several multimillion-dollar donations to fight Guinea worm disease and to prevent blindness. In 1994, the center launched an initiative called \\"Not Even One\\" to fight child death by firearm. On October 2, 1995, The Rosalynn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum was held at The Carter Center. Governance The Center is governed by a board of trustees, which oversees the organization‚Äôs assets and property and promotes its objectives and goals. A community advisory group ‚Äì the Board of Councilors ‚Äì includes public and private-sector leaders who support The Carter Center and its activities in their communities and organizations. Members attend quarterly presentations on the Center‚Äôs work. CEO (Ret.) Ambassador Mary Ann Peters oversees the Center‚Äôs day-to-day operations and staff of 175. Center-based councils of eminent persons who offer guidance to or participate in Center activities include: the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication, and the Mental Health Task Force. The Carter Center also collaborates with other public and private organizations. Peace programs =Observing elections= The Carter Center performs election observation, sending teams of observers to determine the legitimacy of 101 elections in 39 countries since 1989.The Carter Center, The Carter Center: Waging Peace Through Elections, accessed September 19, 2010. Carter Center observers analyze election laws, assess voter education and registration processes, and evaluate fairness in campaigns. The presence of impartial election observers deters interference or fraud in the voting process, and reassures voters that they can safely and secretly cast their ballots and that vote tabulation will be conducted without tampering. Teams typically include 30-100 highly qualified impartial observers ‚Äì regional leaders, political scientists, regional specialists, and election observation professionals. The Carter Center sends observers only when invited by a country‚Äôs electoral authorities and welcomed by the major political parties. Observers do not interfere in the electoral process and do not represent the U.S. government.The Carter Center, \\"How does The Carter Center choose which elections to monitor?\\" , accessed on December 19, 2008. The Center played a key role ‚Äì with the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute ‚Äì in building consensus on a common set of international principles for election observation.United Nations, \\"Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and Code of Conduct for International Election Observers\\" , October 27, 2005, accessed on December 19, 2008. It is also leading the effort to develop effective methodologies for observing elections that employ new electronic voting technologies.Carter Center, \\"Developing a Methodology for Observing Electronic Voting\\", October 2007, accessed December 19, 2008. =Strengthening democracy beyond elections= The Carter Center supports the growth of democratic institutions to ensure that there is a respect for rule of law and human rights, that government decisions are open and transparent, and that everyone can have adequate resources to compete fairly for public office. For example, the Center is supporting the efforts of civic leaders in Ethiopia to convene discussions about the most pressing and contentious political and social issues facing the country, and in the Palestinian Territories, it maintains a small presence in Ramallah focused on the ongoing monitoring and analysis of critical issues of democratic development.Deborah Hakes, \\"Carter Center Field Office in Ramallah\\", May 4, 2007, accessed on December 19, 2008. Democratic initiatives in Latin America include support for regional access-to-information programs, creation of an inter-American support network, and reform of political campaign financing. The Center-based Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas plays an important role in accomplishing these objectives.Members of the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas, The Carter Center also promotes the dissemination to emerging democracies and regional organizations of models, lessons, and best practices for democratic governance. The goal is to empower those in transitioning countries who are trying to build stronger democratic institutions and practices. =Advancing human rights= The Carter Center believes all people are entitled to basic human rights. These rights include political rights, such as peace, freedom, and self-governance, as well as the social rights of health care, food, shelter, and economic opportunity. The Center actively supports human rights defenders around the world. In partnership with Human Rights First and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Center holds an annual human rights defenders policy forum hosted by President Carter in Atlanta.Carter Center Human Rights Defenders Initiative, , accessed December 19, 2008. President and Mrs. Carter have intervened with heads of state on behalf of human rights defenders and victims for more than 20 years. They often take their human rights concerns to heads of state in personal meetings and through letters. The Center and President Carter are strong supporters of the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. Both oppose the death penalty and urge its abolition in the U.S. =Mediating conflict= Recalling President Carter‚Äôs success in the White House negotiating the long-lasting peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, groups in conflict turn to The Carter Center to help them prevent and resolve conflict. Lacking any official authority, the Center has become a trusted broker for peace, serving as a channel for dialogue and negotiation. Recent examples include: * President Carter‚Äôs mission to North Korea in 1994, which paved the way for a U.S.-North Korea pact on nuclear issues.Jimmy Carter, \\"Solving the Korean Stalemate, One Step at a Time\\", New York Times, October 11, 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. * Assisting unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peace ‚Äì called the Geneva Accord ‚Äì in 2002-03.BBC News, \\"Moderates Launch Middle East Plan\\", December 1, 2003, accessed December 19, 2008. * Negotiation of the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and UgandaCarter Center Press Release, \\"Agreement Between Governments of Sudan and Uganda, Nairobi Agreement\\" , December 8, 1999, accessed on December 19, 2008. * President Carter‚Äôs mission to Haiti in 1994 with Senator Sam Nunn and the then former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell to avert a U.S.-led multinational invasion and restore to power Haiti‚Äôs democratically elected president.Larry Rohter, \\"SHOWDOWN WITH HAITI: DIPLOMACY; Carter, in Haiti, Pursues Peaceful Shift\\", New York Times, September 18, 1994, accessed on December 19, 2008. * President Carter‚Äôs historic trip to Cuba in 2002 to seek improved U.S.-Cuban relationsBBC News, \\"Lift Cuba embargo, Carter tells U.S.\\", May 15, 2002, accessed on December 19, 2008. * Negotiation of a cease-fire in 1995 in Sudan to allow humanitarian groups treat Guinea worm disease and river blindness and immunize children. * Holding summits in Egypt and Tunisia in 1995-96 to address violence in the Great Lakes region of AfricaCarter Center Press Release, \\"African Leaders Gather to Address Great Lakes Crisis\\" , May 2, 1996, accessed on December 19, 2008. * An agreement on the restoration of low-level diplomatic relations between Colombia and Ecuador under a deal brokered by the former president, as announced by the Carter Center on June 8, 2008. =Assisting China village elections= Since 1988, the Chinese government has authorized direct village elections to help maintain social and political order in the context of rapid economic reforms. At the invitation of China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Carter Center initiated a joint project in 1998 to standardize Chinese village election procedures and assist in training of election officials and elected National People‚Äôs Congress deputies. In 2011, the Carter Center decided to focus on advancing the US- China relationship, and since 2015 has been promoting greater Africa-U.S.-China cooperation. Health programs The Center has prevented the suffering of millions of people around the world from illnesses often ignored by others. Health programs seek to provide people with the information and access to services they need to treat their illnesses and take steps to prevent future spread of disease. An emphasis is placed on building partnerships for change among international agencies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations and on working with ministries of health to strengthen or establish permanent health care delivery systems in the poorest nations. During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter commented on what he felt is the greatest challenge the world faces: ‚ÄúAmong all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now 75 times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them. The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world‚Äôs unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, in the industrialized world there is a terrible absence of understanding or concern about those who are enduring lives of despair and hopelessness. We have not yet made the commitment to share with others an appreciable part of our excessive wealth. This is a necessary and potentially rewarding burden that we should all be willing to assume.\\" =Disease eradication efforts= The Carter Center began spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease worldwide in 1986. At the time, there were about 3.5 million annual cases of the disease in 20 countries in Africa and Asia. In 2016 there were 25 reported cases in three countries: South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia. Guinea worm disease is poised to be the first parasitic disease to be eradicated and the only disease to be eradicated without the use of vaccines or drugs. Within affected countries, the Center reinforces existing disease eradication programs by providing technical and financial assistance, as well as logistics and tools, such as donated filter cloth material, larvicide, and medical kits.Donald G. McNeil, Jr., \\"Dose of Tenacity Wears Down a Horrific Disease\\", New York Times, March 26, 2006, accessed February 2, 2014. The International Task Force for Disease Eradication has been based at The Carter Center since its formation in 1988. The group has reviewed more than 100 infectious diseases and identified six as potentially eradicable ‚Äì dracunculiasis, poliomyelitis, mumps, rubella, lymphatic filariasis, and cysticercosis. =Implementing disease control and treatment measures= Since 1996, the Center has been a leader in the fight against onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness ‚Äì a parasitic disease transmitted by the bites of black flies. The Center has worked to stop the spread of the disease in 11 countries across Africa and the Americas by helping residents and local health workers institute and sustain drug treatment programs and health education activities. The international river blindness campaign seeks to eliminate the disease from the Western Hemisphere by 2015.\\"Pan American Health Organization Passes Resolution to Interrupt Transmission of River Blindness in Latin America by 2012\\", , accessed on November 4, 2009. The Center has distributed more than 125 million doses of Mectizan (ivermectin) ‚Äì a drug donated by Merck & Co., Inc., that treats and prevents river blindness. Center health workers also prevent transmission of trachoma ‚Äì a bacterial infection that is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Trachoma is prevalent in places that lack the tools for basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation. The Center follows the World Health Organization‚Äôs four-pronged approach ‚Äì called the SAFE strategy ‚Äì to fight trachoma in six African countries.Paul M. Emerson, Matthew Burton, Anthony W. Solomon, Robin Bailey, & David Mabey, \\"The SAFE strategy for trachoma control: using operational research for policy, planning and implementation\\", WHO, August 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. The Trachoma Control Program is working to improve sanitation in those communities by building latrines, providing corrective surgery, distributing antibiotics, and educating communities on basic hygiene. , The Carter Center has helped to build more than one million latrines in its effort to fight trachoma. The latrines contain human waste, preventing it from serving as a breeding ground for the disease-carrying flies, thereby reducing one way the disease is spread.Mark Bixler, \\"Latrine program a hit: project deals with health, gender\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 5, 2005, accessed December 19, 2008. Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are mosquito-borne diseases also targeted by The Carter Center. The Center has distributed four million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets. It has also established drug distribution systems in Nigeria to treat and stem the spread of lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis.Carter Center, \\"New Malaria Program Blankets Areas of Ethiopia with Bed Nets\\", Carter Center News, June 12, 2007, accessed December 19, 2008. =Training public health workers= The Carter Center believes in building networks of village-based health care workers to treat people for various diseases at the same time. Emphasis is on helping national and local governments establish programs that they can sustain into the future. Since 1997, the Center established with the Ethiopian ministries of health and education the Ethiopia Public Health Training Initiative to improve academic training for health care personnel in Ethiopia and increase access to health care in rural communities throughout the country. =Strengthening agricultural production= In partnership with the Sasakawa Africa Association, the Center has worked since 1986 in 15 sub-Saharan African countries to teach 8-10 million small-scale farmers improved techniques that double or triple their crop yields.Sasakawa Africa Association, , accessed on December 19, 2008. The program promotes use of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, soil fertility, and environmentally friendly agronomic methods of crop production. It also supports efforts to construct quality grain storage to sustain market prices for the farmer and ensure greater food security, establish farmers' associations, and use quality food crops such as high- protein maize. =Reducing stigma of mental illness= Rosalynn Carter leads the Center‚Äôs efforts to fight stigma associated with mental illness. The Center works to improve U.S. public policies that can help prevent mental illnesses and increase equity in mental health care, holding an annual symposium with national leaders in mental health and other fields. The Center also seeks to raise public awareness of mental health issues globally through the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, which enable journalists to explore mental health issues. To date, more than 100 journalists have participated in the program.\\"The Carter Center Awards 2009-2010 Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism\\", , accessed on November 4, 2009. Accolades Mr. Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through The Carter Center. The Carter Center received the inaugural Delta Prize for Global Understanding in 1999 ‚Äì an award administered by the University of Georgia.\\"1999 Delta Prize Announcement: The Carter Center\\" , April 27, 1999, accessed December 19, 2008. In 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation presented The Carter Center with the Gates Award for Global Health.\\"2006 Gates Award for Global Health: The Carter Center\\" , 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. The center was awarded Hamdan Award for Volunteers in Humanitarian Medical Services for 2013-14. =Annual auction= The center holds an annual auction, which raised $1.6 million in 2013.  Controversy  = Alleged funding-based bias = Alan Dershowitz asserts that the Center's focus \\"is away from significant Arab abuses and on Israel's far less serious ones\\" and that this is influenced by the Center's receipt of donations from Arab sources.Alan M. Dershowitz, Ex-President for Sale, StandWithUs. One of the initial contributors to the Center was Bank of Commerce and Credit International founder Agha Hasan Abedi, who donated $500,000. Abedi and BCCI also donated $8 million to Carter's Global 2000 project. According to the Center, 3 percent of the total amount of contributions it has received since its founding in 1982 have been from donors in Mideast Arab nations.Background on the Carter Center's Middle East Funding, last accessed November 4, 2009 Of the donations from the Middle East, the Center states: \\"Seventy-eight percent of those funds have helped to support health programs in Africa, 14 percent have gone to the institution's endowment, 4 percent were for original construction of buildings at headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and 4 percent for projects to directly promote peace, such as specific election observations. = Venezuelan election = Some individuals have disputed the Center‚Äôs endorsement of the electoral process in the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004.J.

It attempts to determine the intensity or magnitude of customers' purchase intentions and translates that into a measure of actual buying behaviour. Logit analysis assumes that an unmet need in the marketplace has already been detected, and that the product has been designed to meet that need. The purpose of logit analysis is to quantify the potential sales of that product. It takes survey data on consumers' purchase intentions and converts it into actual purchase probabilities. Logit analysis defines the functional relationship between stated purchase intentions and preferences, and the actual probability of purchase. A preference regression is performed on the survey data. This is then modified with actual historical observations of purchase behavior. The resultant functional relationship defines purchase probability. This is the most useful of the purchase intention/rating translations because explicit measures of confidence level and statistical significance can be calculated. Other purchase intention/rating translations include the preference-rank translation and the intent scale translation. The logit function is the reciprocal function to the sigmoid logistic function.

Biography  Ioannou was born in Toronto. As a young child, she wrote fiction, but by her teen years, she wrote more poetry than fiction. In 1966 she received her bachelor's degree and a year later, her master's degree from the University of Toronto. Ioannou taught English at Bloor Collegiate Institute, for six years during the 1970s. In 1973, she was the Vice-President of the Ontario Council of Teachers of English. From 1980 to 1989, she served as Associate Editor of Cross-Canada Writers' Quarterly/Magazine, and into the 1990s, led poetry workshops for the Toronto Board of Education, Ryerson University, and University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies. In 1985, she founded the writers' resource Wordwrights Canada, and in 1988, created its Susan Ioannou poetry course, which until 2017 ran online as Lessons in Writing the Poem. Her poetry has inspired music by contemporary composers, Norwegian Gjermund Andreassen and Canadian Leslie Uyeda.  Work  Ioannou describes her process of writing poetry as \\"meditative\\" and that she draws from \\"details of everyday life.\\" Her poetry has been favorably reviewed by Mark Cochrane who describes her collection, Clarity between Clouds as a reboot of the \\"quest for clarity and solidity in a blurry and crumbling posthumanist epoch.\\" Ioannou's book of poems about minerals and rocks, Looking Through Stone: Poems About the Earth was distributed in Ontario schools as part of a specialist curriculum. Her interest in writing about geology grew when her son was completing his PhD work. Ioannou relates that she spent ten years learning and reading about geology and whenever something interested her, she tried to create a poem based on that idea. Of her 2016 poetry collection Looking for Light, reviewer Sharon Berg writes: \\"She has a grasp of the element of time that stretches beyond her own stand on this earth and her poetry manages both to enlighten and delight us.\\" Bibliography = Poetry = *Motherpoems - 1985, 2016 eBook, 2017 Kindle Paperback *Familiar Faces/Private Grief - 1986, 2016 eBook, 2017 Kindle Paperback *Clarity Between Clouds: Poems of Midlife - 1991, 2016 eBook *Where the Light Waits - 1996 *Read-Aloud Poems - 2001, 2011 PDF *Coming Home: An Old Love Story - 2004, 2011 PDF *Who Would Be a God?

It is a form of collagen used mainly for the clarification or fining of some beer and wine. It can also be cooked into a paste for specialised gluing purposes. The English word origin is from the obsolete Dutch huizenblaas ‚Äì huizen is a kind of sturgeon, and blaas is a bladder,(Chambers 20th century dictionary) or German hausenblase, meaning essentially the same. Although originally made exclusively from sturgeon, especially beluga, in 1795 an invention by William Murdoch facilitated a cheap substitute using cod. This was extensively used in Britain in place of Russian isinglass, and in the US hake was important. In modern British brewing all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from a limited range of tropical fish. The bladders, once removed from the fish, processed, and dried, are formed into various shapes for use.  Foods and drinks  Adding finings to a cask of beer Before the inexpensive production of gelatin and other competing products, isinglass was used in confectionery and desserts such as fruit jelly and blancmange. Isinglass finings are widely used as a processing aid in the British brewing industry to accelerate the fining, or clarification, of beer. It is used particularly in the production of cask-conditioned beers, although a few cask ales are available which are not fined using isinglass. The finings flocculate the live yeast in the beer into a jelly-like mass, which settles to the bottom of the cask. Left undisturbed, beer will clear naturally; the use of isinglass finings accelerates the process. Isinglass is sometimes used with an auxiliary fining, which further accelerates the process of sedimentation. Non-cask beers that are destined for kegs, cans, or bottles are often pasteurized and filtered. The yeast in these beers tends to settle to the bottom of the storage tank naturally, so the sediment from these beers can often be filtered without using isinglass. However, some breweries still use isinglass finings for non- cask beers, especially when attempting to repair bad batches. Although very little isinglass remains in the beer when it is drunk, many vegetarians consider beers that are processed with these finings (such as most cask- conditioned ales in the UK) to be unsuitable for vegetarian diets (although acceptable for pescetarians). According to global data in 2018, along with low-calorie beer and gluten-free beer, beers that are acceptable for these strict vegetarians are expected to grow in demand in the coming years. The demand increase is attributed to millennial consumers, and some companies have introduced vegetarian friendly options or done away with isinglass use. A beer-fining agent that is suitable for vegetarians is Irish moss, a type of red algae containing the polymer chemical carrageenan. However, carrageenan- based products (used in both the boiling process and after fermentation) primarily reduce hazes caused by proteins, but isinglass is used at the end of the brewing process, after fermentation, to remove yeast. Since the two fining agents act differently (on different haze-forming particles), they are not interchangeable, and some beers use both. Isinglass finings are also used in the production of kosher wines, although for reasons of kashrut, they are not derived from the beluga sturgeon, because this fish is not kosher. Whether the use of a nonkosher isinglass renders a beverage nonkosher is a matter of debate in Jewish law. Rabbi Yehezkel Landau, in Noda B'Yehuda, first edition, Yore Deah 26, for example, permits such beverages. This is the position followed by many kashrut-observant Jews today.  Egg preservative  Isinglass was used as a preservative in Britain in the 1940s before and during World War II. Isinglass from tins was dissolved into water, typically in a bucket. The resulting solution acted as an effective preservative for fresh eggs submerged in it.  Parchment and painting conservation  Isinglass is also used to help repair parchment and damage to paintings on canvas. Pieces of the best Russian isinglass are soaked overnight to soften and swell the dried material. Next, it is cooked slowly in a double boiler at 45 ¬∞C while being stirred. A small amount of gum tragacanth dissolved in water is added to the strained isinglass solution to act as an emulsifier. When repairing paint that is flaking from parchment, isinglass can be applied directly to an area which has been soaked with a small amount of ethanol. It is typically applied as a very tiny drop that is then guided, with the help of a binocular microscope, under the edges of flaking paint. It can also be used to coat tissue or goldbeater's skin. On paintings this can be used as a temporary backing to either canvas patches or filler until dried. Here, isinglass is similar to parchment size and other forms of gelatin, but it is unique in that as a dried film the adhesive can be reactivated with moisture. For this use, the isinglass is cooked with a few drops of glycerin or honey. This adhesive is advantageous in situations where minimal use of water is desired for the parchment as the isinglass can be reactivated with an ethanol-water mixture. It also has a greater adhesive strength than many other adhesives used for parchment repair.

It was designed by series creator Douglas Adams and Infocom's Steve Meretzky, and it was first released in 1984 for the Apple II, Macintosh, Commodore 64, CP/M, MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari 8-bit family, and Atari ST. It is Infocom's fourteenth game. Plot The game loosely mirrors a portion of the series' plot, representing most of the events in the first book. Arthur Dent wakes up one day to find his house about to be destroyed by a construction crew to make way for a new bypass. His friend Ford Prefect, who is secretly an extraterrestrial, helps to calm Arthur down and hitches them a ride on one of the ships in the approaching Vogon constructor fleet, moments before the fleet destroys the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. Aboard the ship, Arthur learns that Ford is a journalist for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and has been on Earth researching the planet for the Guide. The two are discovered by Vogons and subjected by the captain to a reading of his poetry. The two manage to survive this, and the Vogons throw them into the airlock and shoot them out into space. By a huge improbability, they are picked up in the last moment before they die of asphyxiation by the spacecraft Heart of Gold while it is traveling on Infinite Improbability Drive. After getting safely aboard the ship, Arthur and Ford meet Ford's friend Zaphod Beeblebrox, who had stolen the Heart of Gold as his first act of office as the Galactic President, as well as Arthur's friend Trillian (Tricia McMillan), whom Zaphod had picked up from a party on Earth. Zaphod wants to travel to the legendary planet of Magrathea, believing it to hold a great secret. At this point, Zaphod leaves the task of getting to Magrathea to the ship's computer Eddie, and he, Ford, and Trillian depart to the ship's sauna. Arthur finds Eddie incapable of getting to Magrathea without help. Arthur initially tries to help by supplying the Infinite Improbability Drive with a tea substitute from the ship's Nutrimatic device to serve as a source of Brownian motion, but this only causes Arthur to temporarily take on the consciousness of Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian in their respective pasts, and he must manipulate events such that items in these past periods are brought aboard the Heart of Gold in the present. Through this, Arthur gains enough parts as to replace the circuit board in the Nutrimatic so that it can produce real tea. This tea is powerful enough to power the Drive to get them to Magrathea, but in orbit, the ship is attacked by two missiles from the surface. Arthur employs the Drive again to change the missiles into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias, neutralizing the threat. The ship prepares to land, but the computer will not let them do so. Again, the other three head off to the sauna, leaving Arthur to figure out how to fix this. This requires Arthur to reach Marvin the Paranoid Android's closet on the ship in order to get the final tools needed to fix the computer and get it to land. The game ends as Arthur and the others are about to set foot on Magrathea. Gameplay Screenshot of the 30th anniversary edition of the game. The original text- based game is effectively presented in the top-left window, and additional graphical interface elements added for the anniversary edition. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a text adventure game in which the player, in the role of Arthur Dent, solves a number of puzzles to complete various objectives to win the game. This includes collecting and using a number of inventory items. The player has a limited variety of commands to observe, move about, and interact with the game's world, such as \`\\"look\\"\`, \`\\"inventory\\"\`, \`\\"north\\"\` (to move north), \`\\"take screwdriver\\"\`, or \`\\"put robe on hook\\"\`. Most commands will advance the game's turn counter, and some puzzles require the player to complete it within a fixed number of turns or else the game may end and require the player to restart at the beginning or a saved state; passive commands like \\"look\\" and \\"inventory\\", or mistyped or non-comprehended commands, do not count as turns. Once the player has acquired the eponymous Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a wide variety of topics can be asked about, some of which may be helpful in solving the game's puzzles. In both the game's 20th- and 30th-anniversary editions, the game's interface is augmented with graphics that help to map out the locations and other features, though the player is still required to type in all commands. Development =Feelies= Most Infocom games contained \\"feelies\\", bonus novelty items included to enhance the immersiveness of the game. The feelies provided with this game included: *A pin-on button with \\"Don't Panic!\\" printed in large, friendly letters *A small plastic packet containing \\"pocket fluff\\" (a cottonball) *Order for destruction of Arthur Dent's house *Order for destruction of Earth written in \\"Vogon\\" (actually an English cryptogram written in a thinly-disguised Greek alphabet. The text was nearly identical to that of the English Order for Destruction) *Official Microscopic Space Fleet (an empty plastic bag) *\\"Peril Sensitive Sunglasses\\" (a pair of opaque black cardboard \\"sunglasses\\") *How Many Times Has This Happened to You?, an advertising brochure for the fictional guidebook/encyclopedia The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy *\\"No tea: Just like the tea professional hitchhikers don't carry!\\" (in fact, nothing) =Remakes= For the 20th anniversary, the text- based game with some graphics appeared on the BBC. This was later expanded with additional graphics created by fans after a short contest. A 30th Anniversary of the game was released on the BBC's website, in March 2014, with an improved graphical interface and tweets sent out based on the player's typed-in actions. Reception The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was very successful. It sold 59,000 copies in 1984‚Äîin second place among Infocom games, after Zork I‚Äîand with 166,000 copies it was the company's best-selling title in 1985, more than twice as many as Wishbringer. Based on sales and market- share data, Video magazine listed the game fourth on its list of best selling video games in February 1985, and third on the best seller list in March 1985, with II Computing listing it sixth on the magazine's list of top Apple II games as of October‚ÄìNovember 1985. Its sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989. Hitchhiker ultimately sold 400,000 copies, and was one of the best-selling titles of its time. Video in March 1985 praised the game's fidelity to its source material, stating that \\"it survives the transition as wacky and spaced-out as ever\\". Though acknowledging that \\"there may be a few minor problems with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", the reviewer suggested that \\"the game is so engrossing, funny, and often so infuriatingly difficult that you'll hardly notice them\\". In May 1985 Antic called it an \\"extraordinary game\\" and \\"a step forward from Infocom's safe, established approach to game design\\" with \\"distinct and tangible\\" writing, \\"really the first stylistic departure since the Zork trilogy\\". The magazine stated that Hitchhiker was \\"not your run-of-the-mill text adventure\\" but promised that \\"the puzzles are tough, but follow a certain capricious, twisted internal logic\\". Compute! in June 1985 stated that the game \\"may well be Infocom's best effort to date\\", citing an effective adaptation of Adams's \\"comic absurdity\\", sense of humor, and \\"fascinating\\" story. The magazine \\"recommended [it] for all adventure gamers\\", and listed the game in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", stating that its humor distinguished Hitchhiker from other adventure games; \\"[Adams'] keen and literate wit make this game a joy\\". Compute! gave it the 1989 Compute! Choice Award for Role Playing/Adventure Game. In 1996, Computer Gaming World listed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at #42 among their top 150 best games of all-time, writing that \\"Douglas Adams' humor comes alive in this text adventure\\". Legacy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy gained a reputation for deviousness. Computer Gaming World reported on rumors that \\"several important people within the [video game] industry cannot (snicker, snicker!!!) even get out of [the] first room!\\" Perhaps the most notorious instance involved getting a Babel Fish out of a dispenser in the hold of the Vogon ship, which would translate the Vogon language to English. This tricky puzzle appeared early in the game and required the player to use a variety of obscure items in a specific fashion to create a Rube Goldberg-like chain of events, and the puzzle had to be \\"solved\\" within a limited number of turns. Failure to \\"solve\\" the Babel Fish puzzle did not kill the player, but rendered the remainder of the game unwinnable, as one subsequent puzzle requires the player to gain a passcode based on Vogon-written instructions, otherwise undecipherable without the Fish. That particular puzzle became so notorious for its difficulty that Infocom wound up selling T-shirts bearing the legend, \\"I got the Babel Fish!\\"Interview with Steve Meretzky, co-author of the Game from BBC ‚Äì Radio 4 Adams stated that the puzzle's difficulty, and the notable game play change that it begins, was intentional; \\"Just as the player gets comfortable in the narrow neck, the bottom drops out!\\" Another fiendish puzzle involved the ten tools scattered throughout the game's locations. One of the final puzzles involved Marvin asking for a particular tool to use in unjamming the ship's hatch. If the player failed to collect ten, Marvin invariably asked for one that was missing. Likewise, while the opening section of the game closely resembled the opening scenes of the original radio play and book, there are several actions not in the radio play or book that the player must perform to make the game winnable. Other puzzles are based so closely on the book or radio play as to be solvable only by those who are intimately familiar with Adams' work. In spite of all of this, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was rated as \\"Standard\\" difficulty by Infocom's rating system, though it was advertised to be of expert difficulty. The player is seldom given an actual purpose, apart from the implicit goal stated by the inventory item of \\"no tea\\". Much of the game is spent reacting to situations, such as the impending deaths variously threatened by bulldozers, matter-transference hangovers, the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, or nuclear missiles. Like many Infocom games, an InvisiClues booklet was available for this game, as a separate product. The Infocom version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy became a fan favorite; it was one of five top-selling Infocom games to be produced in Solid Gold versions, with a built- in hint system not included in the originals. The game was re-released by Activision in several collection packages before rights reverted to Adams, enabling The Digital Village to re-release it as a web-based Java applet. Originally published as a fund-raising tool on the 1997 Comic Relief website, it took up permanent residence on Adams' own website the following year. On 21 September 2004 the BBC launched the 20th Anniversary Edition to coincide with the initial radio broadcast of the Tertiary Phase. Sporting a Flash user interface, and illustrated by Rod Lord (who also produced the guide animations for the Hitchhiker's TV series), it won the Interactive BAFTA Award for Best Online Entertainment.\\"BBC leads interactive Bafta wins\\" from BBC News on 2 March 2005 Once BAFTA judging had completed, the BBC re-launched the game in two distinct versions to showcase new artwork for scenes and objects deliberately omitted from the first release. While both editions retain Rod Lord's illustrations, all placeholder graphics were replaced by artwork designed and sent in by contest participants. One edition includes the artwork of overall winner Nolan Worthington, the other features the work of runners- up. The original text-only version appeared in the Game On video games exhibition, which has toured museums worldwide since 2002, representing the text-based genre of video games. The game has 35 locations (or \\"rooms\\"). By some accounts, it only has 31 rooms, but 35 also counts the rooms that the player has to visit in the maze. =Sequel= A proposed sequel, Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which was to continue from the ending of the original, had problems from the start in 1985, until it was cancelled in 1989. This was due primarily down to the facts that there was \\"no solid game design, nobody to program it, and the backdrop of Infocom's larger economic problems\\".Waxy.org blog about the cancelled game by Andy Baio The beginning stages of the game were leaked in April 2008, however the majority of it had yet to be written by the time it was cancelled.Milliways, Hitchhiker sequel , Java applet from waxy.org The original Z-code story files can also be downloaded, although an interpreter that supports Z-Machine version 4 and version 6-story files is required.Release 15 of Milliways, Hitchhiker sequel from Waxy.org (Z-code)Release 184 of Milliways, Hitchhiker sequel from Waxy.org (Z-code) References External links *The Java version of the game on Douglas Adams website *20th Anniversary Edition by BBC *30th Anniversary Edition by BBC *Infocom Cabinet: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy at The Internet Archive * Category:1980s interactive fiction Category:1984 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Adventure games set in space Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Amstrad PCW games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari ST games Category:Commodore 16 and Plus/4 games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:CP/M games Category:DOS games Category:Mac OS games Category:Texas Instruments TI-99/4A games Category:TRS-80 games video game Category:Infocom games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games based on adaptations Category:Video games by Douglas Adams Category:Science fiction video games Category:Steve Meretzky games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)"},{"id":"265409","text":"Die Zeit (, literally \\"The Time\\") is a German national weekly newspaper published in Hamburg in Germany. The newspaper is generally considered to be among the German newspapers of record and is known for its long and extensive articles.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/business/global/14bild.html History The first edition of Die Zeit was first published in Hamburg on 21 February 1946. The founding publishers were Gerd Bucerius, Lovis H. Lorenz, Richard T√ºngel and Ewald Schmidt di Simoni. Another important founder was Marion Gr√§fin D√∂nhoff, who joined as an editor in 1946. She became publisher of Die Zeit from 1972 until her death in 2002, together from 1983 onwards with former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, later joined by Josef Joffe and former German federal secretary of culture Michael Naumann. The paper's publishing house, Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius in Hamburg, is owned by the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group and Dieter von Holtzbrinck Media. The paper is published weekly on Thursdays. As of 2018, Die Zeit has additional offices in Brussels, Dresden, Frankfurt, Moscow, New York, Paris, Istanbul, Washington, D.C. and Vienna. In 2018, it re-opened an office in Beijing.Andrea Shalal (May 7, 2018), German official voices concern over limits on foreign press in China Reuters  Orientation  The paper is considered to be highbrow. Its political direction is centrist and liberal, or left-liberal, but has oscillated a number of times between slightly left-leaning and slightly right-leaning. Die Zeit often publishes dossiers, essays, third-party articles and excerpts of lectures of different authors emphasising their points of view on a single aspect or topic in one or in consecutive issues. It is known for its very large physical paper format (Nordisch) and its long and detailed articles.  Print edition  = Sections and supplements = The Zeit is divided into different sections, some of which are: * Politik (English: politics) * Streit (English literally: fight) * Dossier (English: dossier) * Geschichte (English: history) * Wirtschaft (English: economy) * Wissen (English: Science) * Feuilleton (English: features) * Zeitmagazin = Appearance and printing = Hamburg crest used in edition 1 to 12 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; closed gate Hamburg crest used in edition 13 to 18 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; open gate Zeit masthead edition 13 to 18 (1946) Zeit masthead since edition 19 (1946) The masthead lettering in the weekly Die Zeit with its elegant font was designed by Carl Otto Czeschka in 1946. Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper The Times which shows the British national coat of arms in between The and Times. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder's self-conception which he published in an editorial called \\"Unsere Aufgabe (English: \\"Our Mission\\") on February 21, 1946. The very first version of Czeschka's design, which included the Hamburg crest, was used from the first edition (published on February 21, 1946) to the 12th edition (published on May 9, 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock's feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions' legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great Hamburg coat of arms by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a national emblem for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, Zeit Magazin changed its masthead on June 27, 1946, into the Coat of arms of Bremen: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by Wilhelm Kaisen, the mayor of Bremen. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef M√ºller-Marein who later became the editorial director of the Zeit. The design with the Bremer Schl√ºssel in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist Alfred Mahlau had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of the Zeit and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in Tiemann-Antiqua. The running texts are printed in Garamond, a font that is very frequently used in books. The Zeit did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional German orthography, which was led by Der Spiegel, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and Bild. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, the Zeit refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the Duden. The nordisch format, a trademark of the newspaper, has always been addressed in literature and cabaret‚Äîmostly in satirical form. According to Hanns Dieter H√ºsche the Zeit is \\"so gro√ü, wenn man die aufschl√§gt, muss der Nachbar gleich zum Zahnarzt (English literally: \\"so big, if you open it, the neighbour must go to the dentist immediately\\"). In reality however, the format is not bigger than that of a dozen other German newspapers. The Zeit is printed by the printers Frankfurter Societ√§ts- Druckerei GmbH in M√∂rfelden-Walldorf and Axel Springer SE in Ahrensburg. The Deutscher Pressevertrieb, based in Hamburg, is in charge of the distribution of the newspapers. = Zeitmagazin = The Zeitmagazin was first published as a supplement in 1970 and later discontinued in 1999. The Zeit then introduced the section Leben (English: Lifestyle). Since May 24 2007, the Zeit reintroduced the Zeitmagazin. For the supplement's 40th birthday, the Zeit published a 100-page anniversary issue, including 40 different covers - one for each year. = Circulation = The 1993 circulation of Die Zeit was 500,000 copies. With a circulation of 504,072 for the second half of 2012 and an estimated readership of slightly above 2 million, it is the most widely read German weekly newspaper. It reached 520,000 copies in the first quarter of 2013.  Zeit online  Logo Zeit Online 2017 Zeit Online is run by Zeit Online GmbH, a fully owned subsidiary of the publishing company Zeitverlag. The independent editorial office consists of around 70 editors, graphic designers and technicians. Upon February 1, 2009, Zeit Online, Tagesspiegel Online and zoomer.de were merged into Zeit Digital with one joint editorial office in Berlin. Only some editors as well as the technology and the marketing departments remained in Hamburg. Zoomer.de was discontinued in February 2009, and the editorial office of Tagesspiegel Online was handed back to Tagesspiegel in September 2009. In 2017, Die Zeit was among the most quoted sources in German Wikipedia. At present, it is one of the 100 most visited websites in Germany. Sections: The content is categorized into four section groups that each consist of one or more sections, as follows: \\\\- Politics, Economy and Society \\\\- Culture and Discovery \\\\- Knowledge & Digital \\\\- Sports Since April 2014, Zeit Online also has been publishing a local section for Hamburg. In a survey of German literature blogs, the literature section of Zeit Online was rated as the best portal, better than the literature section of Spiegel, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine amongst others. On 2 November 2012, Zeit online launched a Content API that developers can use. Website traffic: Up to 2017, the Zeit experienced a significant increase in clicks on their website. In March 2017, Z+ was launched and so was a payment model for the new product. Since then, some of the content has only been available after payment. In January 2019, the website was visited 75.1 million times. On average, 2,34 pages were opened per visit. Recent history: Gero von Randow, a former Zeit editor, was the editor-in-chief until February 2008. The journalist Wolfgang Blau took over his position in March of that year. Blau joined The Guardian in April 2013. Since 15 March 2013, Jochen Wegner has been in charge. He had been the editor-in-chief at Focus Online from 2006 to 2010. Being part of the same publishing group, Zeit and Berliner Tagesspiegel decided to cooperate in September 2006. Since then, they have been exchanging and sharing some of their online content. Zeit has similar relationships with other German online news portals such as the Handelsblatt and Golem.de. = Cooperations = In June 2008, Zeit Online started a cooperation with ZDF and broadcast their news in a display format called 100 Sekunden (English: 100 seconds). Starting 2018, the online presence of brand eins and Zeit Online were merged and are now marketed together.  Zuender  Between 2005 and 2009, Zeit Online introduced Zuender (English: igniter) which was an online platform for young adults in Germany between the ages of 16 and 25.  Zeit Campus Online  Zeit Campus Online started in 2006 as an online version of the printed magazine Zeit Campus.  St√∂rungsmelder  In 2007, Zeit Online started a cooperation with the music magazine Intro, the union Gesicht Zeigen! (English: show face) and the agency WE DO as well as the moderators Markus Kavka, Ole Tillmann and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf. The project is called St√∂rungsmelder (English: trouble report) and is directed against right-wing extremism.  Netz gegen Nazis  On May 5, 2008, Zeit Online started a project in cooperation with partners such as the German Football Association, the German Fire Department Association, the VZ-networks, the ZDF and the German Olympic Sports Confederation to start the online platform Netz gegen Nazis (English: web against Nazis). The web portal was subject to criticism from the journalists. This was based on the platform not providing new information and only arguing superficially. On 1 January 2009, die Zeit withdrew their contribution to the project and handed over administration to the Amadeu Antonio Foundation. The project has since been renamed to Belltower.News.  ze.tt  On 27 July 2015, the publishing house started a new online format called ze.tt, aimed at young readers who spend a large amount of time on social-media.  Zeitmagazin International  Zeit has published Zeitmagazin International (sometimes also referred to as The Berlin State of Mind) twice a year since 2013. It contains articles from the weekly magazine which accompanies the newspaper, translated into English.  English- language online presence  A selection of stories are published in English at www.zeit.de/english/index.  Controversy  = Big Brother Award = In June 2019, the Zeit Online was awarded with the Big Brother Award in the category consumer protection.

An example of tidal resonance. In oceanography, a tidal resonance occurs when the tide excites one of the resonant modes of the ocean. The effect is most striking when a continental shelf is about a quarter wavelength wide. Then an incident tidal wave can be reinforced by reflections between the coast and the shelf edge, the result producing a much higher tidal range at the coast. Famous examples of this effect are found in the Bay of Fundy, where the world's highest tides are reportedly found, and in the Bristol Channel. Less well known is Leaf Bay, part of Ungava Bay near the entrance of Hudson Strait (Canada), which has tides similar to those of the Bay of Fundy. Other resonant regions with large tides include the Patagonian Shelf and on the continental shelf of northwest Australia. Most of the resonant regions are also responsible for large fractions of the total amount of tidal energy dissipated in the oceans. Satellite altimeter data shows that the M2 tide dissipates approximately 2.5 TW, of which 261 GW is lost in the Hudson Bay complex, 208 GW on the European Shelves (including the Bristol Channel), 158 GW on the North-west Australian Shelf, 149 GW in the Yellow Sea and 112 GW on the Patagonian Shelf. Scale of the resonances The speed of long waves in the ocean is given, to a good approximation, by \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sqrt{g h}, where g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the depth of the ocean. For a typical continental shelf with a depth of 100 m, the speed is approximately 30 m/s. So if the tidal period is 12 hours, a quarter wavelength shelf will have a width of about 300 km. With a narrower shelf, there is still a resonance but it is mismatched to the frequency of the tides and so has less effect on tidal amplitudes. However the effect is still enough to partly explain why tides along a coast lying behind a continental shelf are often higher than at offshore islands in the deep ocean (one of the additional partly explanations being Green's law). Resonances also generate strong tidal currents and it is the turbulence caused by the currents which is responsible for the large amount of tidal energy dissipated in such regions. In the deep ocean, where the depth is typically 4000 m, the speed of long waves increases to approximately 200 m/s. The difference in speed, when compared to the shelf, is responsible for reflections at the continental shelf edge. Away from resonance this can reduce tidal energy moving onto the shelf. However near a resonant frequency the phase relationship, between the waves on the shelf and in the deep ocean, can have the effect of drawing energy onto the shelf. The increased speed of long waves in the deep ocean means that the tidal wavelength there is of order 10,000 km. As the ocean basins have a similar size, they also have the potential of being resonant. In practice deep ocean resonances are difficult to observe, probably because the deep ocean loses tidal energy too rapidly to the resonant shelves.

The most famous example is the Loch Ness Monster. Lake monsters' depictions are often similar to sea monsters. In the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, entities classified as \\"lake monsters\\", such as the Scottish Loch Ness Monster, the American Chessie, and the Swedish Storsj√∂odjuret under B11.3.1.1. (\\"dragon lives in lake\\"). Theories According to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sj√∂gren (1980), present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of water kelpies. Sj√∂gren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others. Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances; he concludes that the legendary kelpies evolved into the present day saurian lake-monsters since the discovery of dinosaurs and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art. The stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries. They've undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity's view of the world has changed. In many of these areas, especially around Loch Ness, Lake Champlain and the Okanagan Valley, these lake monsters have become important tourist draws. In Ben Radford and Joe Nickell's book Lake Monster Mysteries, the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to otter misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings. Then he overlaid the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water, very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. \\"This isn't speculation. I'm not making this up,\\" Nickell said. \\"I've spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens.\\" Clearly, not every lake monster sighting can be accounted for with otters, but it's an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled. Paul Barrett and Darren Naish note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water. There have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax, or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of Champ.

He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Early life and education Born in Bochum as the son of an iron works director, Schily grew up in a family of anthroposophists. His younger brother is Konrad Schily, an academic and also a politician. They spent their adolescence during the war in Bavaria. The family opposed Adolf Hitler.Roger Cohen (December 29, 1998), Schroder Aide Typifies New German Subtlety New York Times. In 1962, he passed his second state exam after having studied law and politics in Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin, thus being admitted to the bar; a year later, he opened his own law practice. On 2 June 1967 Schily went to a demonstration in Berlin against the violation of human rights in Iran. A student, Benno Ohnesorg, was shot dead by the police. He subsequently decided to represent the student's family.Roger Cohen (December 29, 1998), Schroder Aide Typifies New German Subtlety New York Times. In the 1970s, he became a public figure as a trial lawyer, defending several guerrilla activists of the left-wing Red Army Faction. In 1971, he represented his friend Horst Mahler (who much later would become an advocate of the fascist National Democratic Party); during the Stammheim trial (1975‚Äì1977), he was the only remaining attorney of Gudrun Ensslin. While he gained popularity and respect for acting according to his own moral principles, some accused him of supporting the radicals' goals. Political career =Founding member of the Green Party= Petra Kelly and Otto Schily after the 1983 federal election In 1980, Schily became founding member of the Green Party. In 1982, he joined other members of the Green Party for a meeting with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who offered to help groups allied with the European anti-nuclear movement to try to close United States military bases in Europe.John Vinocur (July 27, 1982), Qaddafi Urges Europeans to Try to Shut U.S. Bases New York Times. In the 1983 elections, Schily was elected to the German Bundestag and in the first electoral term in which the Greens were represented in parliament, he was one of the spokespersons of the parliamentary group, together with Petra Kelly and Marieluise Beck. In parliament, he became a leading exponent of the party's realist wing, which favored striving for a governing coalition with the Social Democrats following the 1987 elections. In 1986, he was the Greens' sole representative on a Bundestag committee investigating the so-called Flick affair.James M. Markham (February 23, 1986), Suddenly, Kohl Is On the Defensive New York Times. Due to the party's policy of rotating its representatives, he had to leave parliament in 1986, but he was re-elected in 1987. =Switch to the Social Democrats= Increasingly estranged from the fundamentalist wing of the Greens, particularly regarding alliances with larger parties, Schily left the party in 1989, resigned his seat in parliament, and joined the Social Democrats (SPD) instead - which he represented in the new Bundestag in 1990. In subsequent years, he was active in affairs of the former East Germany and in coordinating various legal policies of the SPD. Between 1994 and 1998, Schily served on the Committee on the Election of Judges (Wahlausschuss), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. He was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG). =Federal Minister of the Interior, 1998‚Äì2005= After Gerhard Schr√∂der became chancellor in 1998, he appointed Schily as Federal Minister of the Interior. He was the oldest member of the cabinet. During his time in office, Schily was frequently criticized for conservative policies, such as pushing through German anti-terrorist legislation after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, which were seen as contradictory to his earlier beliefs. Under the new legislation, his ministry moved against Metin Kaplan‚Äôs radical Islamic group in December 2001, banning it and 19 associated organizations and carrying out more than 200 raids in seven cities.Steven Erlanger (December 13, 2001), Germany, Under New Antiterrorist Law, Bans a Radical Muslim Group New York Times. Between 2001 and 2004, Schily led the government‚Äôs negotiations with the conservative opposition on a bill that made it easier for skilled workers to move to Germany but toughened controls on foreign militants.Steven Erlanger (December 13, 2001), Germany: Agreement On Immigration Bill New York Times. In 2004, he joined Italy in proposing the creation of the camps, possibly in Libya, to process potential immigrants and repatriate illegal arrivals to the EU.Hugh Williamson (September 30, 2004), Migrants' camps idea draws scorn on minister Financial Times. In 2001, the parliamentary opposition called for Schily‚Äôs resignation in light of revelations that his ministry had failed to inform the Federal Constitutional Court that a key witness in the government‚Äôs petition to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) had worked as an undercover agent for the domestic intelligence service; the failure to notify the court later resulted in the suspension of the proceedings.Kirsten Grieshaber (June 18, 2004), Otto Schily Refuses to Resign over NPD Case Deutsche Welle, January 25, 2002. In 2005, Schily again came under pressure for authorizing a raid on the newsroom of Cicero magazine after it had published information from a secret Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) report.Freedom of the Press: Germany - 2006 Country Report Freedom House. On 29 March 2007, Schily took responsibility for the handling of the case of Guantanamo detainee Murat Kurnaz, who was arrested in Pakistan in 2001, turned over to U.S. authorities and held at the U.S. prison camp in Cuba as a terror suspect. Kurnaz was released in 2006 and returned to Germany.\\"Ex- Interior Minister Takes Political Responsibility for Kurnaz Case\\" Deutsche Welle March 29, 2007. Accessed March 1, 2010 Following the 2005 elections and the formation of the new government of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Schily was succeeded in his post by Wolfgang Sch√§uble. Schily remained a member of parliament until 2009 and served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 2008, he caused headlines when the German Bundestag on 22 April fined him ‚Ç¨22,000 for failing to disclose the names of his law firm‚Äôs clients.Bundestag‚Äôs Schily fine gives Kallas a boost European Voice, April 30, 2008. Life after politics After serving as a minister, Schily became a supervisory board member of two companies for biometric technologies, raising questions as to whether or not he was capitalizing on his work as minister, regarding the implementation of biometric passports.\\"Germany Introduces Biometric Passports\\", Deutsche Welle.

EV Nova or EVN) is a video game developed by Ambrosia Software in collaboration with ATMOS. It is the third game in the Escape Velocity series of space trading and combat games. It was released on March 19, 2002 for Mac OS X and Mac OS 9, and later ported to Windows and released on July 11, 2003. The game's premise, set in a time period after mankind has discovered hyperspace technology, grants the player freedom to take missions, trade goods, steal from other ships, and enter one of six storylines. Originally a plug-in for Escape Velocity Override created by ATMOS, Nova development began with Ambrosia contracting ATMOS to make the plug-in the scenario for a new game. ATMOS developed the scenario and graphics, while Matt Burch developed the game engine. The game features six different mutually exclusive plot lines, but players have control to act as they will from the start of the game. Reception to the game praised the gameplay, plot, and ability to be replayed, but was critical of the lack of a soundtrack, repetitiveness, and pace and difficulty of the storylines. Gameplay and plot A typical in-game screen of Escape Velocity Nova. The player's shuttle is in the center, while a Federation ship is in battle above and to the left. At the right is a player interface. In Escape Velocity Nova, the player is placed in command of a shuttlecraft in space. The game is played from a top-down perspective in 2D. A tutorial is offered, but players are granted freedom to act as they will at the start. Players can earn money by purchasing and trading goods, taking missions transporting people or goods to various locations, or by stealing from other ships. The player's ship moves between systems of planets by using a hyperspace jump. At various planets, the player can take on missions and trade goods, buy new ships, or outfit their current ship with new weapons and accessories. Ship classes vary from shuttlecraft to large frigates. There are six different storylines within the game that can be played; each one is mutually exclusive and a new game must be begun to play a different story. A player's choices in the plot can impact the political alignment of the entire map. If players become strong enough, they can demand tribute from a system. Doing so will cause the system to deploy its fleet of ships, but should the player defeat the fleet, the system recognizes the player as its warlord and pays tribute. Escape Velocity Nova is a shareware game. Its status is enforced in game by a character named Captain Hector, who will continuously remind the player to pay their shareware fee. The game also supports plug-ins, allowing players to create their own ships and campaigns, but access to do so is disallowed if the shareware fee is not paid. Set in the year 1177 N.C., Escape Velocity Nova's plot begins long after mankind has begun to explore outer space. Years before, a person named Omata Kane designed a \\"hypergate\\" system connecting systems of human-inhabited worlds that had been discovered by colonists from Earth. Terrorists destroyed the hypergate in the Sol system, which damaged the entire network. With this isolation, warlords arose and fell in the various disconnected systems. The later invention of hyperspace technology allowed for the lost systems to be reconnected, and resulted in order. Centered around Earth and the Sol system is the Federation, while to the south is the Auroran Empire, categorized as \\"a savage race\\". Another group, called the Polaris, hold the east, while the north and west are unexplored territory. The player, having just purchased a shuttle, is cast out to begin a life as the captain of their own ship. Development Nova began as a plug-in for Ambrosia Software's Escape Velocity Override in July 1998. A group of students from Tasmania: Dafydd Williams, Jason Cook, and Scott Vardy were fans of Override and began working on a modding project called Override Nova. Their updates on the project were shared on Ambrosia Software's website forums, which caught the attention of Ambrosia employee Andrew Welch. Shortly afterward, the student group took the name ATMOS Software and signed a contract with Ambrosia to work on a new game. Ambrosia Software's Matt Burch developed the game engine, while Welch managed the project and ATMOS developed the graphics and scenario. Burch, who had programmed Escape Velocity and Override, programmed Nova while also working a second job as an engineer. In July 2000, Ambrosia contracted ATMOS to convert the plug-in into the scenario for Nova. Development of the game from Override took approximately 12 months, with an additional 8 months of beta testing. Escape Velocity Nova was released on March 19, 2002 for Mac, and received both OS X and OS 9 releases. Later that year was announced to be receiving a Windows port, which was released on July 11, 2003. A 2008 update for Mac was built as a universal binary with native support for Intel processors.  Reception  Escape Velocity Nova received praise for its gameplay and game design, especially in light of it being a shareware game. MacAddict gave Escape Velocity Nova its Editor's Choice Award. Reviewer Chris Barylick stated that the gameplay is essentially the same as its predecessors, Escape Velocity and Override. He called the game \\"more beautifully designed than you could expect a shareware game to be\\". Two years after the game's release, Barylick said the game was still worth the download. In a review for Inside Mac Games, Richard Porcher expressed that Nova's graphics were superior for a shareware game. Macworlds Peter Cohen lauded the combination of action-based space battles with adventure-style gaming. He noted the game made improvements over Nova's predecessors while stating that Ambrosia Software \\"has wisely left alone what ain't broken.\\" The game's story and game length received more mixed reviews. Porcher stated that Nova's strongest point is its ability to be replayed repeatedly, especially with support for plug-ins in the game. He also pointed out flaws with the storylines being too easy and the plot lines being mutually exclusive, but felt all would be addressed with plug-ins. PC Gamer's J.T. Trollman gave praise for the game's story writing but was critical of the game's lengthy repetition and time span between points in the story. NomaD of Russian website Absolute Games praised the game's large map and scenario, while also critical of the game's lack of a soundtrack. By contrast, MacNN was critical of the small universe size and dialogue, though it called the game \\"extraordinary\\" and praised the game's replayability.

Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species). The science began in the classical era, continuing in Early Modern times with work by Pierre Belon who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans. Comparative anatomy has provided evidence of common descent, and has assisted in the classification of animals.  History  Skeletons of humans and birds compared by Pierre Belon, 1555 The first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by early commentators with Alcmaeon of Croton. Leonardo da Vinci made notes for a planned anatomical treatise in which he intended to compare the hands of various animals including bears. Pierre Belon, a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on dolphin embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy. Andreas Vesalius Around the same time, Andreas Vesalius was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen's observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on animals such as apes, monkeys, and oxen. In fact, he entreated his students to do the following, in substitution for human skeletons, as cited by Edward Tyson : \\"‚ÄúIf you cant happen to see any of these, dissect an Ape, carefully view each Bone, &c.; ‚Ä¶‚Äù Then he advises what sort of Apes to make choice of, as most resembling a Man : And conclude ‚ÄúOne ought to know the Structure of all the Bones either in a Humane Body, or in an Apes ; ‚Äòtis best in both ; and then to go to the Anatomy of the Muscles.‚Äù\\" (Edward Tyson, Orang-Outang..., 1699, p. 59.) Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one's own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As Vesalius began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen. An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals which included humans. These observations were later used by Darwin as he formed his theory of Natural Selection. A drawing by Edward Tyson Edward Tyson is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that whales and dolphins are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that chimpanzees are more similar to humans than to monkeys because of their arms. Marco Aurelio Severino also compared various animals, including birds, in his Zootomia democritaea, one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like George Cuvier, Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and systematics of vertebrates, laying the foundation for Charles Darwin's work on evolution. An example of a 20th- century comparative anatomist is Victor Negus, who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like DNA sequencing, comparative anatomy together with embryology were the primary tools for understanding phylogeny, as exemplified by the work of Alfred Romer. Concepts Two major concepts of comparative anatomy are: # Homologous structures - structures (body parts/anatomy) which are similar in different species because the species have common descent and have evolved, usually divergently, from a shared ancestor. They may or may not perform the same function. An example is the forelimb structure shared by cats and whales. # Analogous structures - structures similar in different organisms because, in convergent evolution, they evolved in a similar environment, rather than were inherited from a recent common ancestor. They usually serve the same or similar purposes. An example is the streamlined torpedo body shape of porpoises and sharks. So even though they evolved from different ancestors, porpoises and sharks developed analogous structures as a result of their evolution in the same aquatic environment. This is known as a homoplasy. Uses Comparative anatomy has long served as evidence for evolution, now joined in that role by comparative genomics; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor. It also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal to form a wing, which is better-suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs' similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism's anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats. The rules for development of special characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by Karl Ernst von Baer as the laws now named after him.

It is a point genetic mutation of Pinot noir. Pinot noir is genetically unstable and will occasionally experience a point mutation in which a vine bears all black fruit except for one cane which produces white fruit. Origins and regional production An Oregon Pinot blanc. In Alsace, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, the wine produced from this grape is a full-bodied white. In Germany, where it is known as Wei√üer Burgunder or Wei√üburgunder, there were of Pinot blanc in 2018.Burgunderland Deutschland, Deutsches Weininstitut, retrieved 14 June 2020 The most powerful versions are usually made in Baden and Palatinate. In 2018, there were of Pinot blanc in France, with most of the plantations found in Alsace, where it is used for both still white wines and is the most common variety used for sparkling wine, Cr√©mant d'Alsace. Somewhat confusingly, the designation \\"Pinot blanc\\" for Alsace AOC wine does not necessarily mean that the wine is varietally pure Pinot blanc. (This is in difference to Pinot gris, which is a \\"true\\" varietal designation in Alsace.) Rather, the designation means that it is a white wine made from Pinot varieties. Under Alsace appellation rules, the varieties Pinot blanc, Auxerrois blanc, Pinot gris and Pinot noir (vinified white, without skin contact) may all be used,INAO: AOC Alsace appellation regulations, updated until February 16, 2006 but a blend of Pinot blanc and Auxerrois blanc is the most common. The most full-bodied \\"Pinot blanc\\" wines from Alsace, with a spicy and smokey character and moderate acidity, are probably dominated by Auxerrois grapes. Historically, Pinot blanc was used both in Burgundy and Champagne. It is still allowed in Bourgogne blanc blend and small amounts of Pinot blanc may in principle be blended into some Burgundy wines, but very small amounts are cultivated in either region. In the Champagne region, Pinot blanc is often called Blanc vrai. A Cr√©mant d'Alsace made from Pinot blanc. In the United States it is mainly produced in California. In the United States, many of the vines called Pinot blanc are actually a different variety, Melon de Bourgogne/Muscadet, that resembles Chardonnay when on the vine. This mistake was discovered around the mid-1980s by a French oenologist who was examining rootstock while visiting University of California, Davis, and now Pinot blanc purchased from a nursery will be the genuine article. The grape is also grown in Austria and Hungary as well as in Burgundy, France.L. Brenner, Fear of Wine, p. 69 (1995) In Canada, Pinot blanc is often used to make ice wine. Canada's Okanagan Valley has developed a reputation for Pinot blanc as its signature wine.http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-380-pinot-blanc Pinot blanc has also been confused with Chardonnay, and wineries often vinify it in a similar style, using barrel fermentation, new oak and malolactic fermentation. It can also be treated more lightly and made into a crisper wine that still has some ability to age. Relationship to other grapes During a series of trials between 1930 and 1935, Pinot blanc was crossed with Riesling to create the white Italian wine grape variety Manzoni bianco.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 469-471, 594-595 Allen Lane 2012 Wine characteristics In Alsace, Italy and Hungary, the wine produced from this grape is a full-bodied dry white wine while in Germany and Austria they can be either dry or sweet. One of the components of the wine Vin Santo can be Pinot blanc. A bottle of Pinot blanc (selected late harvest) from Meƒëimurje County, northern Croatia In France the grape is often blended with Klevner, sometimes referred to by locals as \\"true Pinot,\\" and Auxerrois grapes, in order to give it a more Alsatian flavor.Pinot blanc Wine Information, French Wine Guide in Alsace Bottles labeled Pinot Blanc offer fruity aromas, often of apple, citrus fruit, and floral characteristics. Bottles that are varietally pure, although more difficult to find, provide stronger floral characteristics, stone fruits and a headier minerality. Regardless of their exact composition, most wines under the label 'Pinot Blanc' are rather high in acidity and are vinified in tank, though more prestigious examples are fermented in large, 100% used oak barrels. Pinot blanc wines are usually made for immediate consumption. Names in other regions Pinot blanc's name varies by region. In Austria it may be bottled as Weissburgunder or Klevner. Weissburgunder is also used in the S√ºdtirol/Alto Adige region of north east Italy (also occasionally named so in Alsace) and in Germany. Hungary calls it Feh√©r Burgundi. Spain and Italy refer to it as Pinot bianco. In the Czech Republic it is known as Rulandsk√© B√≠l√©, in Slovakia Rulandsk√© Biele and in Croatia Pinot bijeli or Burgundac bijeli.

Sites are listed alphabetically by religion. Abrahamic religions The tomb of Abraham in 2006. Abrahamic religions are monotheistic faiths emphasizing and tracing their common origin to Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him. They constitute one of three major divisions in comparative religion, along with Indian religions (Dharmic) and East Asian religions (Taoic). The three major Abrahamic faiths (in chronological order) are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some strict definitions of what constitutes an Abrahamic religion include only these three faiths. However, there are many other religions incorporating Abrahamic doctrine, theology, genealogy and history into their own belief systems. =Bah√° º√≠ Faith and B√°bism= The Shrine of Bah√°'u'll√°h at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in Haifa, Israel, in 2007. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith is a monotheistic religion founded by Bah√°'u'll√°h in 19th century Persia, and consider their religion to progress from or succeed B√°bism or the B√°bi Faith (Persian: ÿ®ÿßÿ®€å Ÿáÿß B√°b√≠ h√°) founded by the B√°b earlier in the century ‚Äì emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind.

It contains the remains of Bah√°'u'll√°h and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahji. Bah√° º√≠s regard Acre (He.: ◊¢÷∑◊õ÷º◊ï÷π Akko; Ar.: ÿπŸÉŸëÿß  ªAkkƒÅ) itself as their holy city, mostly due to the fact that it serves as the location of Bah√°'u'll√°h and his family's many affairs. Within Acre, Bah√° º√≠ sites include the House of 'Abb√∫d, the House of 'Abdu'll√°h P√°sh√°, the Garden of Ridv√°n and the Prison cell of Bah√°'u'll√°h ‚Äì where Bah√°'u'll√°h was incarcerated. The second holiest site in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith ‚Äì which is also revered by the few remaining Azalis (post-Bah√° º√≠/B√°bi split followers of B√°bism, who number just several thousand worldwide) ‚Äì is the Shrine of the B√°b, located on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel.

Bah√°'u'll√°h decreed pilgrimage in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas to two places: the House of Bah√°'u'll√°h in Baghdad, Iraq and the House of the B√°b in Shiraz, Iran]. While these major pilgrimages were later replaced (at least in terms of religious significance) by 'Abdu'l-Bah√°, many Bah√° º√≠s still flocked to Bah√°'u'll√°h's home for pilgrimage until the house was confiscated by Muslim authorities hostile to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1922.

Map of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem. (Click to expand.) Located in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, the Edicule, also known as the Tomb of Christ, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the most holy site for many mainstream denominations within Christianity. The area of the Church is regarded as the site, according to their understanding, where Jesus Christ suffered, was crucified, died, buried and resurrected from the dead along a temporal pathway known as the Via Dolorosa (from the Latin; lit. \\"way of sorrows\\"). The first eight Stations of the Cross can be followed along the route leading up to the Church, inside of which are the final five Stations. The Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Roman Catholic Church, and Armenian Apostolic Church form the custodians of the Holy Sepulchre and collectively control the most holy pilgrimages within the church along with the Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches who also hold some chapels. Within the walls of the church are the many traditional locations for the events associated with the Passion and death of Jesus: The Stone of Unction (the anointing place of Christ's body), the Prison of Christ (where Jesus was held, incarcerated, before his Passion), a treasure room which holds relics including fragments of the True Cross, and of course Calvary or Golgotha (where Christ was crucified) and the Sepulchre itself ‚Äì to name a few. The entrance to the Garden Tomb in 2005. Many Protestant and nontrinitarian denominations regard the nearby Garden Tomb to be the actual crucifixion and resurrection site of Jesus. Still others have claimed that Jesus's tomb is in Japan, or is really located outside of East Jerusalem. Some individuals in the Ahmadiyya Muslim community regard Roza Bal in Srinagar, India, to be Jesus's authentic grave. The Altar of the Crucifixion (Golgotha or Calvary, the traditional site of the Crucifixion of Jesus in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem, in 2011. Other holy sites and shrines of pilgrimage exist in the Holy Land. In Jerusalem the Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount Zion Cenacle of the Last Supper and the Mount of Olives, as well as the Church of the Ascension prove spiritually important. Outside Jerusalem are pilgrimage places including the Sea of Galilee, as well as locations in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Capernaum: The ninth Stations of the Cross along the Via Dolorosa with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the background, in 2006. * Bethlehem: The location of the Church of the Nativity in Manger Square, where Jesus was born. * Capernaum: The town, bordering the Sea of Galilee, is cited in the Gospel of Luke where it was reported to have been the home of the apostles Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John, as well as the tax collector Matthew. In the Gospel of Matthew the town was reported to have been the home of Jesus. According to Luke , Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum on Sabbath. Jesus then healed a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil and healed a fever in Simon Peter's mother-in-law. According to Luke , it is also the place where a Roman Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. Capernaum is also mentioned in the Gospel of Mark , in which it is the location of the famous healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof to reach Jesus. According to several Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in the Galilee after he left the small mountainous hamlet of Nazareth . Capernaum has no obvious advantages over any other city in the area, so he probably chose it because it was the home of his first disciples, Simon (Peter) and Andrew. * Nazareth: The location of the Church of the Annunciation (in the Catholic tradition marks the site where the Archangel Gabriel announced the future birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary ), St. Gabriel's Church (an Orthodox alternative site for the Annunciation), the Synagogue Church (The Melkite Greek Catholic Church lays claim to this site, which is traditionally that of the synagogue where Jesus preached ), the Church of St. Joseph's Carpentry (occupies the traditional location for the workshop of Saint Joseph); the Mensa Christi Church (run by the Franciscan religious order, commemorates the traditional location where Jesus dined with the Apostles after his Resurrection), the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent (run by the Salesian religious order, occupies a hill overlooking the city), the Church of Christ (an Anglican church in Nazareth), and the Church of Our Lady of the Fright (marking the spot where Mary saw Jesus being taken to a cliff by the congregation of the synagogue and felt fear on his account). The \\"Jesus Trail\\" pilgrimage route connects many of the religious sites in Nazareth on a 60 km walking trail which ends in Capernaum. Other important locations identified with the life of Jesus include areas around the Sea of Galilee ‚Äì for instance Cana and the Church of the Multiplication in Tabgha ‚Äì as well as the Mount of Temptation (in the Judean desert), Mount Tabor, Jacob's Well, Bethany and Bethabara (on the Jordan River). The town of Sepphoris is where the Virgin Mary spent her childhood. Still other revered places may exist within or outside the Holy Land, involving localities associated with the lives of the Twelve Apostles, the Church Fathers, the relatives and ancestors of Jesus, saints, or other figures or events featured in both the Old Testament (sharing religious significance with Judaism or other Abrahamic faiths) and New Testament. The reverence held for these sites may vary depending on denomination.

File:Brotvermehrungskirche BW 1.JPGThe Church of the Multiplication in Tabgha in 2008. The church is allegedly built upon the site where Christ fed the multitude. Catholic Church Catholics, like many other Christians, regards the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. It also places emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum, and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and notes as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the Apostles. Mainstream Catholicism as a whole is represented by the Holy See (, \\"holy chair\\") of the Vatican City state (Italian: ),This is the name used in the state's founding document, the Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , article 26. a walled enclave within Rome, Italy. Inside the Vatican the largest church in history, St. Peter's Basilica (L.: Basilica Sancti Petri), is the location of the Papal office and the living quarters of the Pope (in the Apostolic Palace), as well as Vatican Hill ‚Äì atop which are Saint Peter's tomb and place of crucifixion, his throne, and his baldachin. Outside St. Peter's Square are many more churches throughout the Vatican and outlying Rome. One important landmark is the Sistine Chapel (L.: Sacellum Sixtinum; I.: Cappella Sistina), in which the Papal conclave takes place. Rome is the place from which Catholics believe the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church were formally founded and begun by Saint Peter (whom they consider to be the \\"Prince of the Apostles\\") as the appointed successor and first vicar of Christ. Thus while the Holy Sepulchre is still the most sanctified of places for Catholics, the Vatican is an extremely sacred place to the faithful (those of the Latin Church, as well as the Churches sui iuris) as the seat of their supreme authority on Earth. Important papal territories include the four major basilicas (L.: Basilica maior, pl. -es; excluding St. Peter's) ‚Äì namely the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (the ecumenical Catholic mother church), St. Peter's Basilica, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (containing the tomb of Paul the Apostle), and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Other locations of reverence for ardent Catholics include Marian shrines, particularly the localities of F√°tima and Lourdes, where miracles or apparitions attributed to the Virgin Mary took place.

Eastern Christianity Orthodox or Eastern Christians, like many other Christians, regard the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. They place emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and note as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the apostles and other saints. There are many shrines with the relics of Christian saints and martyrs which are sacred pilgrimage sites for Orthodox Christians as well. Historically, four of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire (the Pentarchy) represent the modern patriarchal centers of the majority of Orthodox churches. These are, namely, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem ‚Äì excluding Rome. Among the Orthodox, there are many monasteries and convents which are held in high honor and sacred veneration. =Eastern Orthodox Church= The coastline of Mount Athos in 2007. Church of St. George in Istanbul in 2007. If the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is taken to be one of the most prominent leaders in the Eastern Orthodox Communion, then St. George's Cathedral in Istanbul ‚Äì the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch ‚Äì may perhaps be one of the most important religious sites for Eastern Orthodox Christians. Also of particular importance to the Eastern Orthodox Church and particularly the Greek Orthodox Church is the peninsular Mount Athos, where the most masses in the world are celebrated daily in the Byzantine Rite. Mount Athos arguably comprises the largest community of Christian monastics, ascetics, and mystics (specifically hesychasts) in the world. It is home to twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch. =Oriental Orthodox churches= A road in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia leading to the Holy Trinity Cathedral, the patriarchate of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and a sacred place for members of the Rastafari movement. Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat, Armenia, in 2009. Oriental Orthodoxy is the faith of those Eastern Christian churches that recognize only three ecumenical councils ‚Äì the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople and the First Council of Ephesus. They rejected the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon (c. 451). Hence, these Oriental Orthodox Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches, Miaphysite Churches, or the Non-Chalcedonian Churches. These churches are generally not in communion with any of the multifarious Eastern Orthodox Churches but they are in dialogue for a return to unity.Syrian Orthodox Resources ‚Äì Middle Eastern Oriental Orthodox Common Declaration Despite the potentially confusing nomenclature (Oriental meaning Eastern), Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from those that are collectively referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises five basic groups: Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, and Armenian Apostolic churches.Oriental Orthodox Churches These churches, while being in communion with one another, are hierarchically independent.An Introduction to the Oriental Orthodox Churches The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church or Indian Orthodox church is technically autonomous, but still shares some ties with the Syriac Orthodox church. This being the case, each of the six communal churches has their own spiritual headquarters which act as the episcopal sees of their respective Popes or Patriarchs: * Armenian Apostolic ‚Äî Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin), Vagharshapat, Armenia * Coptic Orthodox ‚Äî St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbassia in Cairo, Egypt (formerly St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, Egypt) * Eritrean Orthodox ‚Äî Asmara, Eritrea * Ethiopian Orthodox ‚Äî Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (see also Rastafari movement) * Indian Orthodox ‚Äî Kottayam, India * Syriac Orthodox (includes the Malankara Church and other Saint Thomas Christians) ‚Äî Bab Tuma borough, Damascus, Syria (formerly Antioch; temporarily stationed in Homs, Mardin, et al.) ** The Syriac Patriarch himself resides in Dayro d-Mor Ephrem, a monastery near Damascus File:Saint Mark Cathedral, Cairo.jpgThe interior of St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Cairo, Egypt, in 2008. File:StMarkCathAlex.jpgThe interior of St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, Egypt, in 2006. Latter-day Saints The Holy of Holies as it appeared in the early 20th century. The Salt Lake Temple Latter-day Saints regard with reverence such places as the Garden Tomb and the Garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem, due their connections with the life and ministry of Jesus. Additionally, the most holy place for members of the mainstream LDS Church are the numerous temples around the world, particularly the \\"celestial room\\" located inside each temple. The purpose of these ordinance rooms is to act as a symbolic representation of the presence of God himself. Additionally, a room inside the Salt Lake Temple, designated as the Holy of Holies, is considered highly sacred due its primary function as a private meditation room for the church's president. Mormon homes are also treated as sacred areas due to the church's emphasis on the sacredness of family union and family-based ceremonies performed in LDS temples. On this subject, the Bible Dictionary in the LDS edition of the Bible states: Once a Mormon family starts dwelling in a home, a special prayer is given by the head of the family (or a close member of the church) asking for the residence to be a shelter against temptation, and dedicating the place to God as long as the family inhabits it. Other venerated sites for Latter-day Saints include historical locations throughout the United States, due to their particular connection to Mormon history and theology. Examples include the Sacred Grove (Palmyra, New York), the Kirtland Temple (Kirtland, Ohio) and Adam-ondi-Ahman (Daviess County, Missouri). However, no mandatory ceremonies are performed in such places. =Other LDS movement sects= Mormon breakaway sects, sub-sects and fundamentalist groups sometimes hold the belief that their particular church alone can claim true authority and succession from Joseph Smith, and that other LDS denominations are therefore incorrect or heretical. Thus many sites throughout the United States represent the spiritual headquarters' of these churches: For example, the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado, Texas at one time represented the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) base themselves in Bluffdale, Utah.

Rastafari movement An orthographic projection of Ethiopia in Africa. The Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian Orthodox Tawahedo cathedral which is also the burial place of Haile Selassie I. Ethiopia is of considerable importance as the setting of the life and death of Haile Selassie. Many Rastas consider Ethiopia the Promised Land. The city of Shashamane is particularly significant. In the capital of Addis Ababa Haile Selassie is buried in the Holy Trinity Cathedral (often called Kidist Selassie, from the Amharic), which is also a significant religious site for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians (see also Oriental Orthodox churches), as it doubles as the seat of the primate of their church. =Islam= Pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba during Hajj. The Kaaba, a cuboid structure located within the Masjid al-·∏§arƒÅm (Sacred Mosque) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, according to Islamic tradition was rebuilt by Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), and is one of the holiest places in Islam. During his life the Prophet Muhammad laid the Black Stone in one of the corners of the building. Many millions of Muslims visit Mecca and the surrounding areas each year during a pilgrimage known as the Hajj ‚Äì the fifth and final pillar of Islam ‚Äì during which they circumambulate the Kaaba as part of the ritual. Other significant areas within or surrounding Mecca include areas in which the Hajj takes place, including the Well of Zamzam, Mina and its bridge, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat. The second holiest place for Muslims is the Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, which is where the Prophet Muhammad is buried under the Green Dome. Caliphs Umar and Abu Bakr are also said to be buried in the Masjid al-Nabawi. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is a sacred place in Sunni traditions as the site from which Muhammad ascended to heaven in the Isra and Mi'raj and was also the first qibla. Mount Sinai also holds significance in Islam.Mount Sinai (Mount Moses) in the Sinai of Egypt Among Shias, the Imam Ali Mosque and Imam Husayn Shrine also hold high significance. Other sites in the Arabian Hejaz are associated with Muhammad: near Mecca, on the mountain of Jabal al-Nour the cave Hira is the place of the Prophet's first revelation. Many other former places of devotion that are historically associated with Muhammad were destroyed under the alleged anti-idolatrous policies of the Wahhabi Saudi government.

Druzism Jethro's Tomb in Tiberias, Israel Druzism is a highly distinguished sect of IsmƒÅ øƒ´li Shi'a Islam, practiced by the Druze community. Most Druze consider themselves Muslims, however most non-Druze Muslims (most Sunnis and many Shi'as) do not regard the Druze as practicing Islam ‚Äì and may even condemn their beliefs as shirk (polytheism). The Nabi Shu'ayb, or Tomb of Jethro, near Tiberias in Israel is the most important religious site for the Druze. They have held religious festivals there for centuries and it has been a place of annual pilgrimage.  Nation of Islam  Mosque Maryam is the international headquarters of the Nation of Islam. = Five Percent Nation = Five Percenters regard the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City as a place of spiritual importance, referring to the neighborhood as \\"Mecca\\". They also refer to the Brooklyn borough of New York as \\"Medina\\". Five Percenters hold a special annual event known as Show and Prove every June at the Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Harlem. =Judaism= Map of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. A modern diagram of the Kodesh Hakodashim, or the tabernacle at Solomon's Temple. The Kodesh Hakodashim, Judaism's Holy of Holies, was the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle in the time of Moses as described in the Torah; the term now refers to the space on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem where this sanctuary was located in the Temple in Jerusalem. (This location is often, but controversially, identified as being inaccessible within the footprint of the Islamic Dome of the Rock.) Historically, it could be entered by the High Priest only on Yom Kippur. Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism continue to regard the location as retaining some or all of its sanctity despite the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Entry into sanctified areas has been prohibited in recent times by powerful elements within traditional Judaism, and as a result many religious authorities prohibit or restrict entry into the Temple Mount by observant Jews. Today, Jews recognize the Jewish Quarter of the city, wherein the Mount is located, to be a location of profound spiritual importance. Within the area a stone artifact known as the Western Wall is paramount as the last standing remains of the temple. Along the wall notable featured include the Western Stone and Wilson's Arch. Beneath it a tunnel runs closer toward what was the original Kodesh Hakodashim, ending approximately 150 ft. inward at a place called Warren's Gate. In an alley the Muslim Quarter of the city is a semi-concelead section of the Wall called the Little Western Wall. Aerial view of the Western Wall in 2008. The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron is the second holiest site in Judaism. Other significant sites include a number of temples within the Jewish quarter of Old Jerusalem, namely the Hurva, Belz, Tiferet Yisrael and the Four Sephardic synagogues. The Beit El Synagogue is of special importance to students of Kaballah. The Biblical Mount Sinai is believed to be the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God ‚Äì although there is considerable debate as to the location of the mountain. (Scholarly opinion places it at either the mountain historically known as \\"Sinai\\" or Mount Seir.) =Samaritanism= Samaritans atop Mount Gerizim in 2006. Samaritanism is an Abrahamic or Semitic religion closely related to ‚Äì or by some considered an early derivative of ‚Äì Judaism, practiced by the Samaritan (Hebrew: ◊©◊ï◊û◊®◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù Shomronim, Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßŸÖÿ±ŸäŸàŸÜ as-SƒÅmariyy≈´n) ethnoreligious group, who mostly reside in the region of the Levant and claim ancestry to Israelites with connections to the ancient Eastern Mediterranean kingdom of Samaria. The Samaritan ethnoreligious group and the subsequent Samaritan religion are considered to be, demographically, the smallest of their kind in modern times, with the number of Samaritans worldwide totalling at just 712 as of late 2007. Adherents of Samaritanism consider a formation known as the Holy Rock, atop the summit of Mount Gerizim (Samaritan Hebrew: Ar-gar√≠zim, Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑ ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ≤ŸäŸÖ Jabal Jarizƒ´m, T.H.: ◊î÷∑◊® ◊í÷∞÷º◊®÷¥◊ñ÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù Har G…ôrizz√Æm, S.H.: ◊î÷∑◊® ◊í÷∞÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊ñ÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù Har G…ôrizzim; also romanized as Jirziem), to be their \\"holy of holies\\". This is comparable with the Temple Mount of Jerusalem as idealized and revered by mainstream Jews ‚Äì however Gerizim is located near the Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza (ÿßŸÑÿ∑Ÿäÿ®Ÿá), adjacent to the Palestinian city of Nablus (present-day Biblical Shechem), in the West Bank. Dharmic religions =Buddhism= Purported birthplace of the Buddha in Lumbini, Nepal, a holy shrine also for many non-Buddhists The Bodhi Tree at the Mahabodhi Temple in India. The tree was initially propagated from the Sri Maha Bodhi, which in turn is propagated from the original Bodhi Tree at this location. Lumbini is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Maya gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 563 BCE. Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha. Bodh Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India, is considered by many adherents of Buddhism to be their most holy site. Gautama, who achieved Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism. The Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment while sitting under a peepal tree, called the Bodhi tree, located in Bodhgaya. At this site of his purported enlightenment the Mahabodhi temple now stands. Every year, many Buddhists make pilgrimages from all over the world to visit and meditate at the temple. Shugend≈ç Pilgrims ascend the steps leading to the entrance of Sanzan Gosaiden temple in 2006, at the summit of Mount Haguro. Shugend≈ç is a small, syncretic, highly esoteric and ascetic sect or sub-sect of Buddhism (mostly related to, and often considered a distinct branch of the Tendai and Shingon schools) combining elements of Zen, Taoism, Koshint≈ç, Japanese folk animism and shamanism. The faith is traditionally believed to have been founded by the ≈õrama·πáa and mystic-sorcerer En no Gy≈çja in the 7th or 8th century. In the same manner as the religion of Shint≈ç, Shugend≈ç is largely relegated to Japan. The lay practitioners and monks of Shugend≈ç, called Shugenja or yamabushi respectively, venerate mountains as both spiritual areas and, along with nature as a whole, \\"natural ma·πá·∏çalas\\" . Adherents of Shugend≈ç consider the collective Three Mountains of Dewa (consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono), located in the remote Dewa Province of Japan, to be their most sacred of places. The three mountains are also sacred in Shint≈ç. =Hinduism= Situated on the banks of river Ganges, Varanasi attracts millions of Hindu pilgrims every year. Vysakha Pilgrimage of Kottiyoor, the pilgrimage in the hills of Western Ghats in Kerala commemorating Daksha yajna. The Indian cities of Varanasi, Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kanchipuram, Ujjain and Dwarka are said to be the major Pilgrim cities in Hinduism; as stated in the Vedas. Of these Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh is considered the Holiest ancient site and it is considered by many to be the most sacred place of pilgrimage for Hindus irrespective of denomination. Shaivas in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, consider Chidambaram as the heart of the world and temple of temples. Although all temples are referred to as kovil, the holy city of Chidambaram is the true kovil. All recitations of the Thirumurai (12 holy scriptures of Shaivism) begin and end with the phrase \\"Thirucchittrambalam\\" (the auspicious holy of holies: chidambaram). Vaishnavites on the other hand consider Sri Rangam as the holiest city and refer to it as the earthly Vaikunta. The \\"garbha griha\\" (literally womb-house or womb-chamber), the shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in an area that is in a separate building by itself inside the complex, is the most sacred site within the temple complex. The garbha griha usually contains the murti (idol or icon), the primary focus of prayer. In temples with a spire or vimana, this chamber is placed directly underneath it, and the two them form a main vertical axis of the temple. These together may be understood to represent the axis of the world through Mount Meru. The garbha griha is usually also on the main horizontal axis of the temple which generally is an east‚Äìwest axis. In those temples where there is also a cross-axis, the garbha griha is generally at their intersection. Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is a Hindu temple in the hill town of Tirumala, near Tirupati in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. It is around 600 km (370 mi) from Hyderabad, 138 km (86 mi) from Chennai and 291 km (181 mi) from Bangalore. The Tirumala Hill is 853m above sea level and is about 10.33 square miles (27 km2) in area. It comprises seven peaks, representing the seven heads of Adisesha, thus earning the name Seshachalam. The seven peaks are called Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabhadri, Narayanadri, and Venkatadri. The temple is on Venkatadri (also known as Venkatachala or Venkata Hill), the seventh peak, and is also known as the \\"Temple of Seven Hills\\". The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Venkateswara, a form of the Hindu god Vishnu. Venkateswara is known by other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa. The temple lies on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. The temple complex comprises a traditional temple building, with a number of modern queue and pilgrim lodging sites. The temple is the richest pilgrimage center, after the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, of any faith (at more than INR 50,000 crore) and the most-visited place of worship in the world. The temple is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily (30 to 40 million people annually on average), while on special occasions and festivals, like the annual Brahmotsavam, the number of pilgrims shoots up to 500,000, making it the most-visited holy place in the world. There are yearly pilgrimage gatherings such as Kumbh Mela Pilgrimage(3-year or 12),Enormous crowd at Kumbh Mela - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)Kumbh Mela (Hindu festival) - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Shabarimala Pilgrimage, Kottiyoor Vysakha Pilgrimage where in thousands of people gather in a certain period of a year for pilgrimage. =Jainism= Jain Temples at Parasnath Shikharji Hills - a view The Palitana temples on Mount Shatrunjaya, located by the city of Palitana, in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat, India are considered one of the holiest places for Jains. Jains believes that a visit to this group of temples is essential once in a lifetime to achieve nirvana or salvation, although many Jains frequent it many times in their lifestyle. Shikharji or ≈örƒ´ Sammed ≈öikharjƒ´ (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§¶ ‡§∂‡§ø‡§ñ‡§∞‡§ú‡•Ä), also known as the Parasnath Hill, located in Giridih district in Jharkhand, India, is a major Jain pilgrimage destination and is one of the most sacred place for Jains in the world. According to Jain belief, twenty of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (teachers of the Jains) attained Moksha (Nirvana) from this place. Parasnath Hill, with a height of 1,350 metres (4,430 ft)), is the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand. The number of Tirthankars who attained nirvana at Shri Sammet Shikharji is 20. For each of them there is a shrine on the hill. The hill is also known as Parasnath, a name derived from Parshva, the 23rd Tirthankara who attained Nirvana there. The present temple is not very old, although the idol in the main temple is ancient. The Sanskrit inscriptions at the foot of the images indicate that they were installed in the temple in 1678 AD. Archaeologists believe some of the existing temple edifices on Parasnath Hill date from 1765 AD although the place is of greater antiquity. It is certain that the present edifices replace older edifices, which were demolished. Jain temples are often pulled down and re-built. =Sikhism= Harmandir Sahib Harmandir Sahib, or Darbar Sahib (also known as the Golden Temple), is culturally the most important shrine in Sikhism, considered the spiritual and cultural centre of Sikhs. Located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is one of the oldest Sikh gurdwaras. It is located in the city of Amritsar, India, which was established by Guru Ram Das, the fourth guru of the Sikhs and the city was also built around the shrine, known as \\"Guru Di Nagri\\" meaning city of the Sikh Guru. It is made from white marble to keep the ground cool and pleasant. It was later laid with real Gold which was provided by the emperor of Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Another significant place is the village of Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. Each of Nankana Sahib's gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Dev's life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide. Punjab province of Pakistan is also the location of many important religious and historical sites for Sikhs, including the place of martyrdom of fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev. Many other important Sikh Shrines are located in the Punjab state of India as well as other parts in India. East Asian religions =Confucianism= The main sanctuary of the Temple of Confucius in Qufu. Confucianism is often regarded as either a religion, philosophy or quasi-religious system of beliefs based upon the teachings of the ancient Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius's philosophy stresses a firm sense of ethical and political order and how to achieve these ends in order to benefit society. While Confucianism is no longer as organized of an ideology as it once was, it still continues as a quasi-religious tradition and temples of Confucius exist throughout China. The most important is the Temple of Confucius in Confucius's hometown of Qufu. =Shinto= \\"Naik≈´, Ise Shrine\\" Ise Shrine is the formal home of Amaterasu ≈çmikami, the primary deity of Shinto and traditionally believed to be a direct ancestor of the Japanese Imperial Family. It is located in the city of Ise in Mie prefecture, Japan. Access is strictly limited, with the public allowed to see merely the thatched roofs of the central structures, hidden behind three tall wooden fences. The Ise Shrine is purportedly the home of the Sacred Mirror. =Taoism= Four sacred mountains of TaoismÔºö Wudang Mountains, in Shiyan, Hubei Province of China; Mount Qingcheng, in Dujiangyan, Sichuan Province; Mount Longhu, in Yingtan, Jiangxi Province; Mount Qiyun, in Huangshan, Anhui Province. =Tenrikyo= The worship hall complex surrounding the Jiba. Followers of Tenrikyo believe that creation of the world occurred at a point called the Jiba, in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture, Japan. A pillar called the Kanrodai is erected on the exact point of the Jiba, and a set of worship halls have been constructed around it. A sacred dance is performed around the Kanrodai during the monthly worship services, and the daily prayers of Tenrikyo practitioners are performed while facing the direction of the Jiba. As it is considered that humans were originally created at the Jiba, the greeting \\"welcome home\\" (okaeri nasai in Japanese) is commonly used by believers to greet visitors.  New religious movements (miscellaneous)  This section of the article contains a list of religious sites significant to new religious movements besides Rastafari and Tenrikyo, which are listed above in their relevant sections. =Neopaganism= Stonehenge, a site of pilgrimage for Druids Neo-Druidism Stonehenge is a site of religious significance in Neo-Druidism as Druids perform pilgrimage there. The first modern Druids to perform ceremonies at this site were the Ancient Order of Druids. =Thelema= Thelemites do not normally carry out pilgrimages, but a certain number of adherents of Thelema regard Egypt, and Cairo and Giza in particular, to be important. Notable destinations for Thelemites traveling to or in Egypt include the King's Chamber in the Pyramid of Khufu, which is part of the Giza Necropolis in Giza, the Egyptian Museum in the Cairo district of Boulaq, and Downtown Cairo. Other notable sites of historical or spiritual significance to many Thelemites are the now derelict Abbey of Thelema in the Sicilian city of Cefalu, Italy, and Boleskine House near Loch Ness in Scotland. Zoroastrianism Fire temple of Udvada Udvada is a town in Gujarat, renowned for its Zoroastrian Atash Behram. This place of worship is the oldest still- functioning example of its kind, and has established Udvada as a pilgrimage center for Zoroastrians the world over.

History  According to the party itself, the dissolution of the CPK and formation of the PDK was prompted by the need for broader unity against Vietnam, a unity which an explicit communist line would hamper. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea was the armed wing of the party, while the Patriotic and Democratic Front of the Great National Union of Kampuchea was a mass organization controlled by it. The General Secretary of the party at the time was Pol Pot. The party led the deposed Democratic Kampuchea government. Its followers were generally called Khmer Rouge. At the time of the formation of the PDK, the Khmer Rouge forces had been pushed back by the Vietnamese-backed KPRP government to an area near the Thai border. The PDK began cooperating with other anti-Vietnamese factions, and formed the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea in 1982. Although Pol Pot relinquished party leadership to Khieu Samphan in 1985, he continued to wield considerable influence over the movement. Ahead of the 1992/1993 elections, the PDK was largely succeeded by the Cambodian National Unity Party (aka CNUP),Arthur S. Banks, Thomas C. Muller, William Overstreet, Sean M.

Through its two principal tributaries, the North Santiam and the South Santiam rivers, it drains a large area of the Cascade Range at the eastern side of the Willamette Valley east of Salem and Corvallis. The main course of the river is short, formed in the Willamette Valley by the confluence of the North and South Santiam rivers on the border between Linn and Marion counties approximately northeast of Albany. It flows generally west-northwest in a slow meandering course to join the Willamette from the east approximately north of Albany. Both the North and South Santiam rise in high Cascades in eastern Linn County. The Middle Santiam River joins the South Santiam where the South Santiam is impounded to form Foster Lake. The North Santiam is impounded to form the deep Detroit Lake in the Cascades. The Santiam is a major source of water supply for Salem.

It is the home of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and a National Weather Service weather forecast office. Upton is located on eastern Long Island in Suffolk County, New York, in the United States. The town is so named because it was the site of the U.S. Army's Camp Upton, which was active from 1917 until 1920, and again from 1940 until 1946. During World War II, the camp was rebuilt primarily as an induction center for draftees. The Army was later to use the site as a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital for returning wounded. The 32 megawatt (MW) Long Island Solar Farm (LISF), located in Upton, is the largest photovoltaic array in the eastern United States. The LISF is made up of 164,312 solar panels which provide enough electricity for roughly 4,500 households. The project will cause the abatement of more than 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. It earned the Best Photovoltaic Project of Year Award from the New York Solar Energy Industries Association.

The most famous of Smith's poems,Hotz-Davies, Ingrid. \\"My Name is Finis: The Loneliness of Stevie Smith\\".

Cambridge University Press (1996) p.38. The poem was accompanied by one of Smith's drawings, as was common in her work. The poem's personal significance has been the topic of several pieces of literary criticism because Smith was treated for psychological problems. She contemplated suicide at the age of eight after what she described as a difficult childhood and her struggle with the fact that her father abandoned her.Walsh, Jessica. \\"Stevie Smith: Girl Interrupted\\"Papers on Language and Literature\\" Vol.40. Interpretations Like many of Smith's poems, \\"Not Waving but Drowning\\" is short, consisting of only twelve lines. The narrative takes place from a third-person perspective and describes the circumstances surrounding the \\"dead man\\" described in line one. In line five the poem suggests that the man who has died \\"always loved larking,\\" which causes his distress signals to be discounted. The image that Smith attached to the poem shows the form of a girl from the waist up with her wet hair hanging over her face. Although the image goes with a poem about a man drowning, the girl's expression appears incongruous with the text of the poem as it forms what Smith scholar Laura Severin describes as a \\"mysterious smile\\". Jannice Thaddeus suggests that the speaker of the poem, like other figures in Smith's works, changes from male to female as part of a theme of androgyny that exists in many of the poems found in Selected Poems.Thaddeus, Janice.\\"Stevie Smith and the Gleeful Macabre,\\" Contemporary Poetry Vol. 111, No. 4, 1978, pp. 36-49. Severin suggests that the figure might be Mary, a character in another poem by Smith titled \\"Cool as a Cucumber\\". The drawing was used as the accompanying image for the poem \\"The Frozen Lake\\" in Selected Poems, a self-edited compilation of Smith's works published in 1962.Severin, Laura. Stevie Smith's Resistant Antics. Univ. of Wisconsin Press (1997) p.71-72.Smith, Stevie. Collected PoemsNew Directions Publishing (1983) pp 393-396. Although Ingrid Hotz-Davies suggests that the \\"drowning man\\" is Smith herself, she also states that there are problems with reading the poem as a cry for help due to the humorous tone of the poem yet at the same time she also notes that the representational form of the poem \\"may easily be misread as a friendly wave of the hand\\". The poem's simple diction led Clive James to suggest that Smith attempted to write the poem so that the diction appeared ignorant of poetic convention yet was carefully crafted to appear more simple than it was. James describes the relationship between Smith and the speaker in \\"Not Waving but Drowning\\" by saying, \\"her poems, if they were pills to cure Melancholy, did not work for [Smith]. The best of them, however, worked like charms for everyone else.\\"James, Clive. As of This Writing. W. W. Norton & Company (2003) p.127. In other media The poem was not performed as part of the 1976 album Tears of Steel & the Clowning Calaveras released by Australian singer Jeannie Lewis (Track 4b), and recited by two actors: Lex Marinos as the \\"Narrator\\" (...but still he lay moaning), and Nick Lathouris as the \\"Dead Man\\" (I was too far out...) Australian ambient and alternative music group Not Drowning, Waving take their name from the poem. A track on Julian Cope's 1991 album Peggy Suicide was titled \\"Not Raving but Drowning\\" after the poem.Liner notes to album Peggy Suicide by Julian Cope. The poem was set to music by singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt on his debut album Little, with a spoken introduction from a Stevie Smith recording.

On December 2, 1980, Denali Wilderness was established within the park. Denali's landscape is a mix of forest at the lowest elevations, including deciduous taiga, with tundra at middle elevations, and glaciers, snow, and bare rock at the highest elevations. The longest glacier is the Kahiltna Glacier. Wintertime activities include dog sledding, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. The park received 594,660 recreational visitors in 2018. History =Prehistory and protohistory= Human habitation in the Denali Region extends to more than 11,000 years before the present, with documented sites just outside park boundaries dated to more than 8,000 years before present. However, relatively few archaeological sites have been documented within the park boundaries, owing to the region's high elevation, with harsh winter conditions and scarce resources compared to lower elevations in the area. The oldest site within park boundaries is the Teklanika River site, dated to about 7130 BC. More than 84 archaeological sites have been documented within the park. The sites are typically characterized as hunting camps rather than settlements, and provide little cultural context. The presence of Athabaskan peoples in the region is dated to 1,500 - 1,000 years before present on linguistic and archaeological evidence, while researchers have proposed that Athabaskans may have inhabited the area for thousands of years before then. The principal groups in the park area in the last 500 years include the Koyukon, Tanana and Dena'ina people.Norris, Vol. 1, pp. 2-3 =Establishment of the park= Park map In 1906, conservationist Charles Alexander Sheldon conceived the idea of preserving the Denali region as a national park. He presented the plan to his co-members of the Boone and Crockett Club. They decided that the political climate at the time was unfavorable for congressional action, and that the best hope of success rested on the approval and support from the Alaskans themselves. Sheldon wrote, \\"The first step was to secure the approval and cooperation of the delegate who represented Alaska in Congress.\\" In October 1915, Sheldon took up the matter with Dr. E. W. Nelson of the Biological Survey at Washington, D.C. and with George Bird Grinnell, with a purpose to introduce a suitable bill in the coming session of Congress. The matter was then taken to the Game Committee of the Boone and Crockett Club and, after a full discussion, it received the committee's full endorsement. On December 3, 1915, the plan was presented to Alaska's delegate, James Wickersham, who after some deliberation gave his approval. The plan then went to the Executive Committee of the Boone and Crockett Club and, on December 15, 1915, it was unanimously accepted. The plan was thereupon endorsed by the Club and presented to Stephen Mather, Assistant Secretary of the Interior in Washington, D.C., who immediately approved it. The bill was introduced in April 1916, by Delegate Wickersham in the House and by Senator Key Pittman of Nevada in the Senate. Much lobbying took place over the following year, and on February 19, 1917, the bill passed. On February 26, 1917, 11 years from its conception, the bill was signed in legislation by the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, thereby creating Mount McKinley National Park. A portion of Denali, excluding the summit, was included the original park boundary. On Thanksgiving Day in 1921, the Mount McKinley Park Hotel opened. In July 1923, President Warren Harding stopped at the hotel, on a tour of the length of the Alaska Railroad, during which he drove a golden spike signaling its completion at Nenana. Graphic of Denali Park History - Denali Visitor Center The hotel was the first thing visitors saw stepping down from the train. The flat-roofed, two-story log building featured exposed balconies, glass windows, and electric lights. Inside were two dozen guest rooms, a shop, lunch counter, kitchen, and storeroom. By the 1930s, there were reports of lice, dirty linen, drafty rooms, and marginal food, which led to the hotel eventually closing. In 1947, the park boundaries expanded to include the area of the hotel and railroad. After being abandoned for many years, the hotel was destroyed in 1950 by a fire. There was no road access to the park entrance until 1957, when the Denali Highway opened. In 1971, the George Parks Highway, under piecemeal construction for several years, was completed, providing direct highway connections to Anchorage and Fairbanks; park attendance greatly expanded: there were 5,000 visitors in 1956 and 25,000 visitors by 1958. The park was designated an international biosphere reserve in 1976. A separate Denali National Monument was proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978. =Naming controversy= Aerial view of Denali's summit The name of Mount McKinley National Park was subject to local criticism from the beginning of the park. The word Denali means \\"the high one\\" in the native Athabaskan language and refers to the mountain itself. The mountain was named after newly elected US president William McKinley in 1897 by local prospector William A. Dickey. The United States government formally adopted the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the bill creating Mount McKinley National Park into effect in 1917.Sheldon, Charles (1931). A History of The Boone and Crockett Club. Boone and Crockett Club. pp. 54‚Äì59. In 1980, Mount McKinley National Park was combined with Denali National Monument, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act named the combined unit the Denali National Park and Preserve. At that time the Alaska state Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali. However, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names did not recognize the change and continued to denote the official name as Mount McKinley. This situation lasted until Aug. 30, 2015, when President Barack Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to rename the mountain to Denali, using statutory authority to act on requests when the Board of Geographic Names does not do so in a \\"reasonable\\" time period.McKinley no more: North America's tallest peak to be renamed Denali. Martinson, Erica. Alaska Dispatch News, 30 August 2015 =1990s= In 1992, Christopher McCandless ventured into the Alaskan wilderness and settled in an abandoned bus in the park on the Stampede Trail at , near Lake Wentitika. He carried little food or equipment, and hoped to live simply for a time in solitude. Almost four months later, McCandless' starved remains were found, weighing only . His story has been widely publicized via articles, books, and films, and the bus where his remains were found has become a shrine attracting people from around the world. On September 24, 2020, the Museum of The North at the University of Alaska (Fairbanks) announced it became the permanent home of McCandless' 'Magic Bus 142' where it will be restored and an outdoor exhibit will be created. =2000s= On November 5, 2012, the United States Mint released the 15th of its America the Beautiful Quarters series, which honors Denali National Park. The coin's reverse side features a Dall sheep with Denali in the background. In September 2013, President Barack Obama signed the Denali National Park Improvement Act into law. Hundreds, if not thousands of people had promoted the law and put it through Congress. The statute allows the United States Department of the Interior to \\"issue permits for microhydroelectric projects in the Kantishna Hills area of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska\\"; it authorizes the Department of the Interior and a company called Doyon Tourism, Inc. to exchange some land in the area; it authorizes the National Park Service (NPS) to \\"issue permits to construct a natural gas pipeline in the Denali National Park\\"; and it renames the existing Talkeetna Ranger Station the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station. Geography Denali National Park and Preserve includes the central, highest portion of the Alaska Range, together with many of the glaciers and glacial valleys running southwards out of the range. To the north the park and preserve encompass the valleys of the McKinley, Toklat and Foraker Rivers, as well as the Kantishna and Wyoming Hills. The George Parks Highway runs along the eastern edge of the park, crossing the Alaska Range at the divide between the valleys of the Chultina River and the Nenana River. The entrance to the park is about south of Healy. The Denali Visitor Center and the park headquarters are located just inside the entrance. The park road parallels the Alaska Range for , ending at Kantishna. Preserve lands are located on the west side of the park, with one parcel encompassing areas of lakes in the Highpower Creek and Muddy River areas, and the second preserve area covering the southwest end of the high Alaska Range around Mount Dall. In contrast to the park, where hunting is prohibited or restricted to subsistence hunting by local residents, sport hunting is allowed in the preserve lands. =Vehicle access= The single road within the park The park is serviced by the long Denali Park Road, which begins at the George Parks Highway and continues to the west, ending at Kantishna. Located within the park, the Wilderness Access Center (which houses a small gift shop, a coffee stand, and an information desk) is the main location to arrange a bus trip into the park, or reserve/check-in for a campground site. All shuttle buses depart from here, as do some tours. The Denali Visitor Center is at mile marker 1.5 on the park road and is the main source of visitor information. Most ranger-led programs begin at the Denali Visitor Center. Other features include an exhibit hall. Within a short walking distance from the Visitor Center are a restaurant, a bookstore, the Murie Science and Learning Center, the Denali National Park railroad depot, and the McKinley National Park Airport. The Denali Park Road runs north of and roughly parallel to the imposing Alaska Range. Only a small fraction of the road is paved because permafrost and the freeze-thaw cycle would create a high cost for maintaining a paved road. The first of the road are available to private vehicles, allowing easy access to the Riley Creek and Savage River campgrounds. Private vehicle access is prohibited beyond the Savage River Bridge. There is a turn around for motorists at this point, as well as a nearby parking area for those who wish to hike the Savage River Loop Trail. Beyond this point, visitors must access the interior of the park through tour/shuttle buses. The tours travel from the initial boreal forests through tundra to the Toklat River or Kantishna. Several portions of the road run alongside sheer cliffs that drop hundreds of feet at the edges. There are no guardrails. As a result of the danger involved, and because most of the gravel road is only one lane wide, drivers must be trained in procedures for navigating the sharp mountain curves, and yielding the right-of-way to opposing buses and park vehicles. Road map with camping locations, visitor centers, and ranger stations There are four camping areas located within the interior of the park (Sanctuary River, Teklanika River, Igloo Creek, and Wonder Lake). Camper buses provide transportation to these campgrounds, but only passengers camping in the park can use these particular buses. At mile marker 53 on road is the Toklat River Contact Station. All shuttle and tour buses make a stop at Toklat River. The contact station features rest rooms, visitor information, and a small bookstore. Eielson Visitor Center is located four hours into the park on the road (at mile marker 66). It features restrooms, daily ranger-led programs during the summer, and on clear days, views of Denali and the Alaska Range. Wonder Lake and Kantishna are a six-hour bus ride from the Visitors Center. During the winter, only the portion of the Denali Park Road near the Visitors Center remains open. Kantishna features five lodges: the Denali Backcountry Lodge, Kantishna Roadhouse, Skyline Lodge, Camp Denali and North Face Lodge. Visitors can bypass the six hour bus ride and charter an air taxi flight to the Kantishna Airport. The Kantishna resorts have no TVs, and there is no cell phone service in the area. Lodging with services can be found in McKinley Park, one mile north of the park entrance on the George Parks Highway. Many hotels, restaurants, gift shops, and a convenience store are located in Denali Park. While the main park road goes straight through the middle of the Denali National Park Wilderness, the national preserve and portions of the park not designated wilderness are even more inaccessible. There are no roads extending out to the preserve areas, which are on the far west end of the park. The far north of the park, characterized by hills and rivers, is accessed by the Stampede Trail, a dirt road which effectively stops at the park boundary near the \\"Into the Wild\\" bus. The rugged south portion of the park, characterized by large glacier- filled canyons, is accessed by Petersville Road, a dirt road that stops about outside the park. The mountains can be accessed most easily by air taxis that land on the glaciers. Kantishna can also be reached by air taxi via the Purkeypile Airport, which is just outside the park boundary. Visitors who want to climb Denali need to obtain a climbing permit first, and go through an orientation as well. These can be found at the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station in Talkeetna, Alaska, about south of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. This center serves as the center of mountaineering operations. It is open year-round. Camping in the Savage River drainage =Wilderness= The Denali Wilderness is a wilderness area within Denali National Park and Preserve that protects the higher elevations of the central Alaska Range, including Denali. The wilderness comprises about one-third of the current national park and preserve‚Äî that correspond with the former park boundaries from 1917 to 1980. Geology Tectonic history Denali from Ruth Glacier Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central area of the Alaska Range, a mountain chain extending across Alaska. Its best-known geologic feature is Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley. Its elevation of makes it the highest mountain in North America. Its vertical relief (distance from base to peak) of is the highest of any mountain in the world. The mountain is still gaining about in height each year due to the continued convergence of the North American and Pacific Plates. The mountain is primarily made of granite, a hard rock that does not erode easily; this is why it has retained such a great height rather than being eroded. The park area is characterized by collision tectonics: over the past millions of years, exotic terranes in the Pacific Ocean have been moving toward the North American landmass and accreting, or attaching, to the area that now makes up Alaska. The oldest rocks in the park are part of the Yukon-Tanana terrane. They originated from ocean sediments deposited between 400 million and 1 billion years ago. The original rocks have been affected by the processes of regional metamorphism, folding, and faulting to form rocks such as schist, quartzite, phyllite, slate, marble, and limestone. The next oldest group of rocks is the Farewell terrane. It is composed of rocks from the Paleozoic era (250-500 million years old). The sediments that make up these rocks were deposited in a variety of marine environments, ranging from deep ocean basins to continental shelf areas. The abundant marine fossils are evidence that around 380 million years ago, this area had a warm, tropical climate. The Pingston, McKinley, and Chulitna terranes are the next oldest; they were deposited in the Mesozoic era. The rock types include marble, chert, limestone, shale, and sandstone. There are intrusions of igneous rocks, such as gabbro, diabase, and diorite. Special features include pillow basalts, which are formed when molten lava flows into water and a hard outer crust forms, making a puffy, pillow shaped feature; as well as an ophiolite sequence, which is a distinct sequence of rocks indicating that a section of oceanic crust has been uplifted and thrust onto a continental area. Polychrome Mountain Some of the youngest rocks in the park include the Kahiltna terrane, which is a flysch sequence (a sedimentary rock sequence deposited in a marine environment during the early stages of mountain building) formed about 100 million years ago, during late Cretaceous time. Another rock sequence is the McKinley Intrusive Sequence, which includes Denali. The Cantwell Volcanics include basalt and rhyolite flows, as well as ash deposits. An example can be seen at Polychrome Pass in the park.Harris, A.G., Tuttle, E., Tuttle S.D. Geology of National Parks. 6th ed. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company 2004. Mesozoic fossils include fossil trackways from therizinosaurids and hadrosaurids in the Cantwell Formation indicate the area was once an immigration point for dinosaurs traveling between Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous period. Studies of fossil plants from the same formation indicate the area was wet, with marshes and ponds throughout the region.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180806095216.htm Denali National Park and Preserve is located in an area of intense tectonic activity: the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American plate, creating the Denali fault system, which is a right-lateral strike-slip fault over long. This is a part of the larger fault system which includes the famous San Andreas Fault of California. Over 600 earthquakes occur in the park each year, helping seismologists to understand this fault system. Most of these earthquakes are too small to be felt, although two large earthquakes did occur in 2002. On October 23, 2002 a magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurred in the park, and on November 3, 2002, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred. These earthquakes did not cause a significant loss of life or property, since the area is very sparsely populated, but they did trigger thousands of landslides.National Park Service: Denali National Park and Preserve. Denali Rocks! The Geology of Denali National Park and Preserve: A Curriculum Guide for Grades 6-8. 2011. =Glaciers= The Kichatna Mountains in the southwestern portion of the preserve Glaciers cover about 16% of the 6 million acres of Denali National Park and Preserve. There are more extensive glaciers on the southeastern side of the range because more snow is dropped on this side from the moisture-bearing winds from the Gulf of Alaska. The 5 largest south-facing glaciers are Yentna ( long), Kahiltna (), Tokositna (), Ruth (), and Eldrige (). The Ruth glacier is thick. However, the largest glacier, Muldrow Glacier ( long), is located on the north side. Nonetheless, the northern side has smaller and shorter glaciers overall. Muldrow glacier has \\"surged\\" twice in the last hundred years. Surging means that it has moved forward for a short time at greatly increased speed, due to a build-up of water between the bottom of the glacier and the bedrock channel floating on the ice (due to hydrostatic pressure). At the upper ends of Denali's glaciers are steep-walled semicircular basins called cirques. Cirques form from freeze- thaw cycles of meltwater in the rocks above the glacier, and by glacial erosion and mass wasting occurring under the glacier. As cirques on the opposite sides of a ridge are cut deeper into the divide, they form a narrow, sharp, serrated ridge called an ar√™te. As the ar√™te wears away from glacial ice erosion, the low point between cirques is called a col (or if it is large, a pass). Cols are saddle-shaped depressions in the ridge between cirques. A spire-like sharp peak, the horn, forms when cirques cut back into a mountaintop from three or four sides. Glaciers deposit rock fragments, but the most notable of the depositions are the erratics, which are large rock fragments carried some distance from the source, found on glacial terraces and ridge tops in many places throughout Denali. Headquarter erratics are made of granite and can be the size of a house. Some erratics (like those from the Yanert Valley) are located away from their original location. Ruth Glacier and medial moraine - the dark stripe of debris down the middle Large amounts of rock debris are carried on, in, and beneath the ice as the glaciers move downslope. Lateral moraines are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride along the edge of the moving glaciers. When lateral moraines adjacent to each other join, they create medial moraines, which are also carried down on the surface of the moving ice. Braided meltwater streams heavily loaded with rock debris continually shift and intertwine their channels over valley floors. Valley trains are built up as streams drop quantities of poorly sorted sediment. Valley trains are long, narrow accumulations of glacial outwash, confined by valley walls. Kettles are formed when glacial retreat and melting is rapid, and blocks of ice are still buried under till. When the ice under the till melts, the till slumps in and forms depressions called kettles. When kettles fill with water, they are known as kettle lakes. Kettle lakes are visible near the Polychrome Overlook, the Teklanika rest stop and near Wonder Lake. =Permafrost= During the very cold Pleistocene climates, all of Denali was solidly frozen. The northern areas of the range still are very much frozen due to continued cold temperatures. Permanently frozen ground is known as permafrost. The permafrost is discontinuous in Denali due to differences in vegetation, temperatures, snow cover and hydrology. The active layer freezeing and thawing seasonally can be from to thick. The permafrost layer is located at between below the active layer. A stand of oddly leaning white spruce growing on a lower slope of Denali is called the Drunken Forest. The trees lean due to the soil sliding as a result of permafrost freeze/thaw oscillations triggered by differences in temperature, vegetation and hydrology. Shallow ponds in Denali are known as thaw lakes and cave-in lakes formed when water warmed by the sun forms basins in the underlying permafrost. These ponds deepen gradually during the summer and, if the temperature is high enough, they will grow in size as their rims collapse. Thermal expansion and contraction causes permafrost cracking. In the summer water fills these cracks and forms veins called ice wedges. These wedges enlarge with seasonal freezing/thawing cycles. Some ice wedges buried for centuries are revealed during excavations or landslides. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Denali National Park has a subarctic climate with cool summers (Dfc). The plant hardiness zone at Denali Visitor Center is 3a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -38.9 ¬∞F (-39.4 ¬∞C). Long winters are followed by short growing seasons. Eighty percent of the bird population returns after cold months, raising their young. Most mammals and other wildlife in the park spend the brief summer months preparing for winter and raising their young. Summers are usually cool and damp, but temperatures in the 70s are not rare. The weather is so unpredictable that there have even been instances of snow in August. The north and south side of the Alaskan Range have a completely different climate. The Gulf of Alaska carries moisture to the south side, but the mountains block water to the north side. This brings a drier climate and huge temperature fluctuations to the north. The south has transitional maritime continental climates, with moister, cooler summers and warmer winters. Ecology Alpine forest and lakes in Denali The Alaska Range is a mountainous expanse running through the entire park, strongly influencing the park's ecosystems. Vegetation in the park depends on the altitude. The treeline is at , causing most of the park to be a vast expanse of tundra. In the lowland areas of the park, such as the western sections surrounding Wonder Lake, spruces and willows dominate the forest. Most trees and shrubs do not reach full size, due to unfavorable climate and thin soils. There are three types of forest in the park: from lowest to highest, they are low brush bog, bottomland spruce-poplar forest, upland spruce-hardwood forest. The forest grows in a mosaic, due to periodic fires. In the tundra of the park, layers of topsoil collect on rotten fragmented rock moved by thousands of years of glacial activity. Mosses, ferns, grasses, and fungi grow on the topsoil. In areas of muskeg, tussocks form and may collect algae. The term 'muskeg' includes spongy waterlogged tussocks as well as deep pools of water covered by solid-looking moss. Wild blueberries and soap berries thrive in the tundra and provide the bears of Denali with the main part of their diet. Over 450 species of flowering plants fill the park and can be viewed in bloom throughout summer. Images of goldenrod, fireweed, lupine, bluebell, and gentian filling the valleys of Denali are often used on postcards and in artwork. brown bear (Ursus arctos) and cub on the park road Denali is home to a variety of North American birds and mammals, including an estimated 300-350 grizzly bears on the north side of the Alaska Range (70 bears per 1000 square miles) and an estimated 2,700 black bears (334 per 1,000 square miles). , park biologists were monitoring about 51 wolves in 13 packs (7.4 wolves per 1,000 square miles), while surveys estimated 2,230 caribou in 2013, and 1,477 moose in 2011.Large Mammals in Denali: How Many Are There?. nps.gov. National Park Service. July 18, 2019. Retrieved July 25, 2019. Dall sheep are often seen on mountainsides. Smaller animals such as coyotes, hoary marmots, shrews, Arctic ground squirrels, beavers, pikas, and snowshoe hares are seen in abundance. Red and Arctic fox species, martens, Canada lynx, and wolverines also inhabit the park, but are more rarely seen due to their elusive natures. Many migratory bird species reside in the park during late spring and summer. There are waxwings, Arctic warblers, pine grosbeaks, and wheatears, as well as ptarmigan and the tundra swan. Raptors include a variety of hawks, owls, and gyrfalcons, as well as the abundant but striking golden eagles. A caribou and tour bus on the park road Ten species of fish, including trout, salmon, and Arctic grayling, share the waters of the park. Because many of the rivers and lakes of Denali are fed by glaciers, glacial silt and cold temperatures slow the metabolism of the fish, preventing them from reaching normal sizes. A single amphibious species, the wood frog, also lives among the lakes of the park. Denali park rangers maintain a constant effort to keep the wildlife wild by limiting the interaction between humans and park animals. Feeding any animal is strictly forbidden, as it may cause adverse effects on the feeding habits of the creature. Visitors are encouraged to view animals from safe distances. In August 2012 the park experienced its first known fatal bear attack when a lone hiker apparently startled a large male grizzly while photographing it. Analysis of the scene and the hiker's camera strongly suggest he violated park regulations regarding backcountry bear encounters, which all permit holders are made aware of. Certain areas of the park are often closed due to uncommon wildlife activity, such as denning areas of wolves and bears or recent kill sites.

It was serialized in Young King OURs from 1996 to 2011, and its individual chapters were collected and published in tank≈çbon volumes by Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha. The series follows the attempts of Across, a \\"secret ideological organization\\", to conquer the city of Fukuoka as a first step towards world domination. The title character of the series, Excel, is a key member of the group who is working towards completing this goal, while the city is being defended by a shadowy government agency led by Dr. Kabapu. The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Victor Entertainment, which was taglined . Directed by Shinichi Watanabe and featuring animation from J.C.Staff, the series premiered on TV Tokyo in 1999. TV Tokyo only aired twenty-five of the series' twenty-six episodes, with the finale having been intentionally made too violent, obscene and long for broadcast on Japanese TV. As such, it was only included in the DVD release of the series, although it has since been broadcast in other markets. The series has enjoyed some critical success coupled with respectable sales. Plot Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world. The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and his young adult officers: the enthusiastic and energetically devoted Excel and the soft-spoken and prone to spitting out much blood and fainting Hyatt. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who they have deemed their emergency food supply. Excel and Hyatt are later joined by a snobbish but equally clueless rival officer of Across named Elgala. Living in the neighboring apartment are three guys: Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, who along with apartment neighbor and co-worker Matsuya, work for the Department of City Security. The Department's leader, Dr. Kabapu, also has a grandiose plan on stopping Across; he has the City Security workers dress in Super Sentai-like uniforms and sends them on different missions. Supporting Kabapu is an inventor Gojo Shiouji who likes little girls, and his gynoid Ropponmatsu, who later is deployed as two models. The series follows the daily interactions among the two groups. Il Palazzo would send the girls on their missions but the results are usually a failure with some explosive or catastrophic damage to the city. Kabapu would send the City Security workers on some equally ridiculous assignment which would also go wrong. Eventually Il Palazzo and Kabapu become aware of each other's manipulations and escalate their plans. Excel finds herself being replaced by an impersonator who heads the ILL Corporation. Massive amounts of money is spent on elections and politics. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans. The anime adaptation introduces some original characters: immigrant worker turned wandering spirit Pedro; alien mascot-like creatures called Puchuu; and The Great Will of the Macrocosm, the last of whom occasionally resets the storyline. The anime director Shinichi Watanabe cameos as an afro-wearing guy named Nabeshin, and a caricature of the manga artist also makes appearances. Production The series was created by Rikdo Koshi and based on a dojinshi he had previously created while in high school named . Excel Saga was created as an evolution of Daitenzin in order to develop the character of Excel, as well as to laugh off the vision of a depressed and pessimistic view of the world. Excel Saga is set in Fukuoka City and the names of characters and organisations are derived from local locations and buildings. Victor Entertainment contacted Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the two companies approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was \\"conveyed just as words\\", and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the \\"swirling, talking cosmos\\". He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that \\"Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan\\". The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted as long as they kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto. Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen to play the role of Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that \\"she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond\\". He also says, \\"at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch\\". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting \\"amazing\\" and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work. Media =Manga= The series began serialisation in Japan in 1996 in the monthly anthology Young King OURs and finished in August 2011. The individual chapters began being collected and published in tank≈çbon format by Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha in April 1997 and volume 27 was released on October 29, 2011. Viz Media licensed Excel Saga for an English-language release in North America and the first volume was released on August 13, 2003. Initially the series was published on an approximately bimonthly schedule, however the series had caught up with the Japanese release and the publishing schedule for volume 12 onwards was changed as a result. Volume 27 was released on January 14, 2014. The Viz edition includes a section called Oubliette, which consists of a sound effects guide and production and cultural notes. The series is also licensed for regional language releases in France by Kabuto and in Italy by Dynit. =Anime= Shinichi Watanabe dressed in the style of his 'Nabeshin' character. An anime adaption was produced by J.C.Staff and directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Twenty five episodes were broadcast on TV Tokyo between October 7, 1999 and March 30, 2000. At the publisher's request, the anime series follows a different storyline from the manga, however Rikdo was pleased with the adaptation. Victor Entertainment produced the music of the series, which was composed and arranged by Toshio Masuda and directed by Keiichi Nozaki. Director Shinichi Watanabe wrote the lyrics for the opening and closing themes,. The opening theme which were performed by Yumiko Kobayashi and Mikako Takahashi who were credited as The Excel‚ô•Girls . The lyrics for the opening theme were written \\"on the train, five minutes before the deadline\\". The closing theme was The two themes were released together as a CD single on November 3, 1999. A twenty-sixth episode, Going Too Far, was deliberately created to be too violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus. Watanabe commented that it \\"felt good to go past the limits of a TV series\\", although he thinks it \\"is not something that you should do too often\\". In Japan the series was released on 12 DVDs between March 1, 2000 and January 24, 2001. The series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The English adaptation initially starred Jessica Calvello, with Larissa Wolcott taking over the role after episode thirteen after Calvello had damaged her voice during production. In North America, ADV released the series on six DVDs between June 11, 2002 and April 8, 2003. A complete collection of the series was released on July 6, 2004 as Excel Saga - The Imperfect collection and re-released in different packaging on August 1, 2006 as Excel Saga - Complete Collection. In the UK, the series was first released between May 19, 2003 and March 15, 2004. A complete box set was later released as Excel Saga - Complete Box Set on July 2, 2007. The UK license for the series expired in January 2008. The series was broadcast on UK TV channel Rapture TV from January 2, 2007. On October 30, 2010, Excel Saga was re-licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment, who re-released the complete series to DVD on May 17, 2011. =Soundtracks= Several albums were released featuring music from the anime. () was released on January 1, 2000. The album was later released in North America on August 9, 2005. This was followed in Japan by () on March 23, 2000. A North American release followed on November 1, 2005. Reception Since its August 2003 release in North America, the manga has been among the 50 top-selling graphic novels on three occasions. The English-language reviews of the Excel Saga anime were broadly positive and enthusiastic. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network puts it in the same class as Airplane!, National Lampoon, Tex Avery, and Monty Python, adding that the \\"combination of character-based humor, outrageous slapstick farce, and a plot that is engaging if only for how weird it is make for a thoroughly enjoyable comedic experience\\". A contrary opinion is expressed by Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict, who says the series is \\"occasionally clever and funny,\\" but that \\"much of it is gratingly obnoxious\\". Many reviewers express displeasure with middle and later episodes, saying they were \\"more of the same,\\" that they had stale humor, that they were tiresome, or even painfully unfunny. Episodes fourteen through sixteen, starring the Ropponmatsus, bear the brunt of this criticism, but several reviewers consider episode seventeen, Animation USA, to be one of the best. Reviewers also agree that the series suffers from too much filler in its later episodes, with Crandol describing the show as spinning its wheels. Yegulalp reserves his harshest words for the unaired Going Too Far, calling it \\"pure, idiotic, wretched excess.\\" He goes on to say that the episode has \\"the feeling of trying to deliberately enrage the audience by resorting to the only tactics left: genuinely offensive subject matter.\\" Joel Cunningham at Digitally Obsessed disagrees, saying that the episode succeeds just in time, \\"with one of the series' funnier sight gags\\". The series generally receives high marks for technical aspects. Cunningham feels the animation is flat-out gorgeous, but Crandol considers it merely above average. In the latter's opinion, its quality wanes as the series progresses and increasingly relies on super- deforming the characters for comedic effect. ADV's release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly the Vid- Notes). Reviewers especially appreciated the English voice acting: Crandol calls it brilliant, and several note that Calvello and Wolcott were each able to capture Mitsuishi's Excel. Pearce, in contrast, found the English cast to be pretty bad and its Excel to be \\"dental drill shrill\\". Akadot's reviewer of the manga writes that \\"some of the strange events go on a little too long and do not have the impact that they do animated,\\" but that Rikdo's Excel Saga is \\"graced with fantastic visuals and a hilarious story,\\" and that the English edition is \\"a masterpiece of the translator's skill.\\" Barb Lien-Cooper from Comic World News concurs that the manga cannot keep pace with the anime, but she finds Excel herself to be wittier in the manga and that the manga's plots make more sense than the anime's. A reviewer of the French edition also praises Rikdo's work, noting that it is an \\"...easy read without problems of clarity\\".Full quotation : \\"En ce qui concerne la mise en page, celle-ci est particuli√®rement dynamique avec un encha√Ænement impressionnant de cases les unes sur les autres et qui laissent, malgr√© le nombre, une lecture facile et sans probl√®m de clart√©.\\" References External links *Official manga website of Viz Media *Official anime website of Madman Entertainment * Category:1995 manga Category:1999 anime television series Category:ADV Films Category:Funimation Category:J.C.Staff Category:Parody anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Surreal comedy anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Sh≈çnen Gah≈çsha manga Category:Viz Media manga ","title":"Excel Saga"},{"id":"265503","text":"Frontispiece may refer to: * Book frontispiece, a decorative illustration facing a book's title page * Frontispiece (architecture), the combination of elements that frame and decorate the main, or front, door to a building ","title":"Frontispiece"},{"id":"265505","text":"The term Carthaginian ( ) usually refers to a citizen of Ancient Carthage.

Myrtle, pohutukawa, bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus are some notable members of this group. All species are woody, contain essential oils, and have flower parts in multiples of four or five. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually entire (i.e., without a toothed margin). The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous.  Evolutionary history  Scientists hypothesize that the family Myrtaceae arose between sixty and fifty-six million years ago during the Paleocene era. Pollen fossils have been sourced to the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. The breakup of Gondwana during the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 Mya) geographically isolated disjunct taxa and allowed for rapid speciation: in particular, genera once considered members of the now-defunct Leptospermoideae alliance are now isolated within Oceania. Generally, experts agree that vicariance is responsible for the differentiation of Myrtaceae taxa, except in the cases of Leptospermum species now located on New Zealand and New Caledonia, islands which may have been submerged at the time of late Eocene differentiation.  Diversity  Recent estimates suggest the Myrtaceae include approximately 5,950 species in about 132 genera.Govaerts, R. et al. (12 additional authors). 2008. World Checklist of Myrtaceae. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. xv + 455 pp. The family has a wide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate regions of the world, and is common in many of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Genera with capsular fruits such as Eucalyptus, Corymbia, Angophora, Leptospermum, and Melaleuca are absent from the Americas, apart from Metrosideros in Chile and Argentina. Genera with fleshy fruits have their greatest concentrations in eastern Australia and Malesia (the Australasian realm) and the Neotropics. Eucalyptus is a dominant, nearly ubiquitous genus in the more mesic parts of Australia and extends north sporadically to the Philippines. Eucalyptus regnans is the tallest flowering plant in the world. Other important Australian genera are Callistemon (bottlebrushes), Syzygium, and Melaleuca (paperbarks). Species of the genus Osbornia, native to Australasia, are mangroves. Eugenia, Myrcia, and Calyptranthes are among the larger genera in the neotropics. Syzygium samarangense, with a cross section of the fruit Historically, the Myrtaceae were divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily Myrtoideae (about 75 genera) was recognized as having fleshy fruits and opposite, entire leaves. Most genera in this subfamily have one of three easily recognized types of embryos. The genera of Myrtoideae can be very difficult to distinguish in the absence of mature fruits. Myrtoideae are found worldwide in subtropical and tropical regions, with centers of diversity in the Neotropics, northeastern Australia, and Malesia. In contrast, subfamily Leptospermoideae (about 80 genera) was recognized as having dry, dehiscent fruits (capsules) and leaves arranged spirally or alternate. The Leptospermoideae are found mostly in Australasia, with a centre of diversity in Australia. Many genera in Western Australia have greatly reduced leaves and flowers typical of more xeric habitats.  Taxonomy  The division of Myrtaceae into Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae was challenged by a number of authors, including Johnson and Briggs (1984), who identified 14 tribes or clades within Myrtaceae, and found Myrtoideae to be polyphyletic. Molecular studies by several groups of authors, as of 2008, have confirmed the baccate (fleshy) fruits evolved twice from capsular fruits and, as such, the two-subfamily classification does not accurately portray the phylogenetic history of the family. Thus, many workers are now using a recent analysis by Wilson et al. (2001) as a starting point for further analyses of the family. This study pronounced both Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae invalid, but retained several smaller suballiances shown to be monophyletic through matK analysis. The genera Heteropyxis and Psiloxylon have been separated as separate families by many authors in the past as Heteropyxidaceae and Psiloxylaceae.Sytsma, Kenneth J. and Amy Litt. 2002. Tropical disjunctions in and among the Myrtaceae clade (Myrtaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, Psiloxylaceae, Vochysiaceae): Gondwanan vicariance or dispersal? (Abstract). Botany 2002 Conference, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, August 4‚Äì7, 2002. However, Wilson et al. included them in Myrtaceae. These two genera are presently believed to be the earliest arising and surviving lineages of Myrtaceae. The most recent classification recognizes 17 tribes and two subfamilies, Myrtoideae and Psiloxyloideae, based on a phylogenetic analysis of plastid DNA. Many new species are being described annually from throughout the range of Myrtaceae. Likewise, new genera are being described nearly yearly. Classification Following Wilson (2011)Wilson, P. G.

The total area is 100.7 km2. Yokosuka is the 11th most populous city in the Greater Tokyo Area, and the 12th in the Kant≈ç region. Geography Yokosuka occupies most of Miura Peninsula, and is bordered by the mouth of Tokyo Bay to the east and Sagami Bay on the Pacific Ocean on the west. =Surrounding municipalities= * Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama * Miura * Hayama * Zushi History =Pre-modern period= The area around present-day Yokosuka City has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools and shell middens from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the J≈çmon and Kofun periods at numerous locations in the area. During the Heian period, local warlord Muraoka Tamemichi established Kinugasa Castle in 1063. He became the ancestor of the Miura clan, which subsequently dominated eastern Sagami Province for the next several hundred years. The Miura clan supported Minamoto no Yoritomo in the foundation of the Kamakura shogunate, but were later annihilated by H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori in 1247. However, the family name was reassigned to a supporter of the H≈çj≈ç clan, and the Miura continued to rule Miura Peninsula through the Muromachi period until their defeat at Arai Castle in a 1518 attack by H≈çj≈ç S≈çun. Following the defeat of the Later H≈çj≈ç clan at the Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi transferred Tokugawa Ieyasu to take control over the Kant≈ç region, including Yokosuka in 1590. The adventurer William Adams (inspiration for a character in the novel Sh≈çgun), the first Briton to set foot in Japan, arrived at Uraga aboard the Dutch trading vessel Liefde in 1600. In 1612, he was granted the title of samurai and a fief in Hemi within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka, due to his services to the Tokugawa shogunate. A monument to William Adams (called Miura Anjin in Japanese) is a local landmark in Yokosuka. During the Edo period, Yokosuka tenry≈ç territory was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. Due to its strategic location at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, the Shogunate established the post of Uraga Bugy≈ç in 1720, and all shipping into the bay was required to stop for inspection. As concerns over the increasing number of incursions by foreign vessels and attempts to end Japan's self-imposed national seclusion policy, the Shogunate established a number of coastal artillery batteries around Yokosuka, including an outpost at ≈åtsu in 1842. However, despite these efforts, in 1853, United States naval Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Tokyo Bay with his fleet of Black Ships and came ashore at Kurihama, in southern Yokosuka, leading to the opening of diplomatic and trade relations between Japan and the United States. The Kanrin Maru sailed from Yokosuka in 1860 with the first Japanese diplomatic embassy to the United States in 1860. Construction of the Yokosuka arsenal c.1870 During the turbulent Bakumatsu period, the Shogunate selected Yokosuka as the site for a modern naval base (\\"Odaiba\\"), and hired the French engineer L√©once Verny in 1865 to oversee the development of shipbuilding facilities, beginning with Yokosuka Iron Foundry. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal became the first modern arsenal to be created in Japan. The construction of the arsenal was the central point of a global modern infrastructure, that was to prove an important first step for the modernization of Japan's industry. Modern buildings, the Hashirimizu waterway, foundries, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established. =Meiji period to present= After the Meiji Restoration, the arsenal was taken over by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the area of modern Yokosuka was reorganized into Uraga Town and numerous villages within Miura District, Kanagawa Prefecture. Yokosuka Village was elevated to town status in 1878 and was made the capital of Miura District. In 1889, the Yokosuka Line railway was opened, connecting Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo. Yokosuka was elevated to city status on February 15, 1907. From 1916, Oppama in Yokosuka was developed as the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal, and many of the combat aircraft subsequently operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were developed or tested at Yokosuka. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal also continued to expand in the early 20th century, and its production included battleships such as Yamashiro, and aircraft carriers such as Hiry≈´ and Sh≈çkaku. Smaller warships were constructed at the privately owned Uraga Dock Company. Yokosuka Naval District was the home port of the IJN 1st Fleet. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923 caused severe damage to Yokosuka, including the naval base which lost two years' operations of oil supplies. The city continued to expand in 1933 with the annexation of neighboring Kinugasa Village and Taura Town in 1933 and Kurihama Village in 1937. In 1943, the city also annexed the neighboring towns and villages of Uraga, Kitashimoura, Okusu, Nagai and Takeyama, as well as Zushi. U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka During World War II, Yokosuka was bombed on April 18, 1942 by American B-25 bombers in the Doolittle Raid with little damage as a retaliation to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Aside from minor sporadic tactical air raids by United States Navy aircraft, it was not bombed again during the war; however, from 1938 to 1945 more than 260 caves in more than 20 separate tunnel/cave networks were built throughout the area, with at least 27 kilometers of known tunnels within the grounds of Yokosuka Naval Base. Many more tunnels are scattered throughout the surrounding areas. During the war, these tunnels and caves provided areas in which work could be done in secrecy, safe from air attacks. A 500-bed hospital, a large electrical power generating facility, and a midget submarine factory and warehouse were among the many facilities built. American occupation forces landed at Yokosuka on August 30, 1945, after the surrender of Japan, and the naval base has been used by the US Navy since that time. The caves were used for storage and as an emergency shelter during the Korean War. From the 1950s, United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka has been home port for the United States Seventh Fleet, and played a critical support role in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Yokosuka was the site of many anti-war protests during the late 1960s and 1970s. The nuclear-powered USS George Washington, formerly based at Yokosuka, was the first U.S. nuclear-powered ship that had been permanently based in Japan. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force also operates a military port next to the American base, as well as numerous training facilities at scattered locations around the city. For those reasons, there are a few hundred Americans and a thousand Filipinos in Yokosuka. Yokosuka Museum of Art, design by Riken Yamamoto in 2007 In 2001, Yokosuka was designated as a core city, with increased autonomy from the central government. Economy Aside from the economic impact of its various military facilities, Yokosuka is also an industrial city, with factories operated by Nissan Motors and its affiliated subsidiaries employing thousands of local residents. The Nissan Leaf, Nissan Cube, and Nissan Juke models are assembled in the in Yokosuka. The factory began operations in 1961 where the Nissan Bluebird was originally built. Every May, there is a festival celebrating Japanese curry, which draws 50,000 attendees each year. The plant is adjacent to Nissan's Research and Development Center, the Oppama Proving Ground and the Oppama Wharf, from which Nissan ships vehicles made at Oppama and Nissan's other two Japanese vehicle assembly plants to other regions of Japan and overseas. The Yokosuka Research Park, established in 1997, is a major center for the Japanese telecommunications industry, and is where many of the wireless, mobile communications related companies have set up their research and development centers and joint testing facilities. Demographics Yokosuka's population is decreasing. Foreign citizens in Yokosuka are mainly Filipinos, Koreans, Chinese,and Americans.

Many of Yokosuka's public high schools, including Yokosuka High School, are operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education. The city operates one municipal high school, Yokosuka Sogo High School. Energy disasters On 26 October 2011 Yokosuka held its annual nuclear accident evacuation drill. This drill was first held in 2008 when the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington was employed at the US naval base near this city. About 70 people, residents and firefighters took part in the drill. Firefighters ordered the residents of the city to stay indoors, assuming abnormally high levels of radiation around the US base. Radioactive contamination was controlled in the emergency response center by city officials. The US Navy refused to take part in all this, because of the impossibility of radiation leaking outside the base. However, in December 2011 another drill was scheduled with Yokosuka and other cities to prepare for the possibility that people on board the ship might be exposed to radiation.NHK- world (26 October 2011)Yokosuka conducts nuclear accident drill One unintended consequence of anti-nuclear sentiment is the construction of coal fired power plants, which causes air pollution and worsens global warming. As of 2020, two coal-fired power plants are proposed to be built in Yokosuka, even despite the climate emergency. These coal-fired power plants are being built without a full environmental review, and local residents are suing the government of Japan over its construction. Environment minister Shinjir≈ç Koizumi has been \\"a target of the activists' wrath\\" because of his support for this project. Sister city relations Yokosuka has twin-town relationships with four other cities. They are (in chronological order): * Corpus Christi, Texas, United States (since 18 October 1962) * Brest, France (since 26 November 1970) * Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia (since 25 April 1979) * Medway, Kent, UK (since 26 August 1998) * Mazyr, Belarus (since 2008) Yokosuka has a friendship-city relationship with one city: * Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan (since 17 April 2005) Local attractions Sarushima is an uninhabited island in the Tokyo Bay, accessible by ferry from Yokosuka. The Mikasa, flagship of Admiral Togo at the Battle of Tsushima, built in Britain by Vickers, is preserved on dry land at Yokosuka. It is a museum, complete with actors dressed like members of the original crew, and can be visited for an entrance fee of 600 yen. The Club Alliance enlisted club, which lies just inside the main gate of Yokosuka Naval Base, opened in 1983. It replaced the old Club Alliance which was demolished to make way for the Prince Hotel. The old Club Alliance is where Ryudo Uzaki got his start playing rock and roll. \\"The Honch\\", a mecca for shopping and nightlife and located just outside the Yokosuka Naval Base's main gates, is a popular attraction for tourists and sailors stationed nearby, as well as local Japanese residents. The Yokosuka Arts Theatre, part of the Bay Square complex by Kenz≈ç Tange, is a venue for opera, orchestral concerts, chamber music, and films. Dobuita Street is situated in Yokosuka, close to the U.S naval base. Therefore, this High Street has a very American influence, with many shops accepting U.S dollars. In the evening the street turns into the local bar and club district for the area. A museum in memory of rock musician Hide, a native of Yokosuka, opened on July 20, 2000. It has been reported that Japan's former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, was influential in getting it built as he was a big fan of Hide's band X Japan. The museum stayed open, past its original three-year plan, for five years, before closing on 25 September 2005. Yokosuka is considered a place of origin of sukajan jackets. These embroidered satin bombers are a popular souvenir from the city, especially the more expensive, handmade ones. In popular culture Yokosuka, including Dobuita Street, is the setting for the 1999 video game Shenmue.

Additionally, Yokosuka is the location of the climactic battle in the Godzilla film Terror of Mechagodzilla. Yokosuka is a major location in the Arpeggio of Blue Steel franchise, where it serves as one of Japan's few remaining naval facilities, the only one equipped with a functional shipyard and maritime academy. Due to rising sea levels, the port is built above the ruins of the submerged original city's remains.

The first specimen was collected in 1839 and described by John Gould in 1844. Only a small number of specimens have been collected since; the last live capture was in 1875. Sub-fossil remains indicate that it had an extensive distribution around the semiarid coastal districts of Southwest Australia. The habitat of the broad-faced potoroo is almost entirely unknown, but, unlike its relatives, such as the long-nosed Potorous tridactylus and long-footed Potorous longipes, they do not seem to have lived in dense under-stories in forests. Preserved specimens indicate that it was smaller than other potoroos at around 300 millimetres (one foot) long with a 180 mm tail. Their weight is estimated at 800 grams. Their coat was grizzled with yellowish hairs above and greyish white below. Their body was similar in shape to that of other potoroids. Their ears were small and rounded, muzzle fairly short, and cheeks notably puffy.  Taxonomy  The first description was published by John Gould, using a specimen obtained by his collector John Gilbert at \\"Walyema Swamps near Northam, Western Australia\\". Gilbert visited this inland region while collecting around the recently established Swan River Colony. The site he referred to was determined to be Lake Walyormouring. The single specimen forwarded to Gould was presented to the Linnean Society of London, and the partial skull and skin of a female was deposited in the British Museum of Natural History. There were few collected after Gould's initial description. There was one animal collected by James Drummond and recorded in a letter in the 1840s, the collector George Masters prepared four specimens in the 1860s, presumably when he made a large collection of taxa at Mordup. The last collection of living Potorous platyops was in 1874, collected by William Webb and are now held at the Macleay Museum in Sydney. The curator and collector Hedley H. Finlayson described the remains of a potoroine animal found in a South Australian cave, which were similar to the potorous platyops. However, the bones were retrieved from a site far from where the potorous platyops was thought to be found, as well as the teeth being different than previously collections specimens. He ended up naming it as a new species, potorous morgani. The specimen was later identified as a potorous platyops. The skull that was studied and was held at a South Australian museum, amongst a deposit of multiple taxa from Kelly's Hill Caves, which was collected by A.M. Morgan. The specific epithet morgani refers to the collector. Finlayson's 1934 description recognised a close similarity to this species. When he obtained more specimens, which were collected at the same cave system on Kangaroo Island by Edith May, he obtained a second partial skull. Comparison of the dentition and other morphological characteristics was limited to works published by G. R. Waterhouse (1846), Oldfield Thomas (1888) and B. Arthur Bensley (1903) whose descriptions of P. platyops are recorded at the BMNH. Common names include broad-faced potoroo and a name from the Nyungar language, moda, which was recorded by Gilbert and noted in Gould's 1844 description as 'mor-da', and mort or moort by other ecologists writing shortly after its extinction. The name was obtained through an interview with Nyungar peoples at King George Sound by Gilbert. . Early records show that it was also named the broad-faced rat kangaroo.  Description  Illustration by H. C. Richter in Gould's Mammals of Australia (1863) The broad-faced potoroo is a member of the genus Potorous. It is described as having a relatively broad skull and shorter muzzle. The species is presumed to have become extinct sometime after the last recorded capture of the animal in 1875, and sometime before 1905. The colour of the pelage is greyish brown at the upper-side. Straw-yellow hairs are interspersed through the fur to give a streaked effect. The underside and the flanks are pale grey. The head and body are about 305 millimetres in length, while the tail is about 178 mm long. Their hind feet are about 54 mm in length and their weight is approximately 800 grams. Their noses are short and blunt, which is an unusual characteristic among potorines and is usually associated with species such as the rufous bettong (aepyprymnus rufescens) and the desert rat-kangaroo (caloprymnus campestris).  Ecology  The behaviour of the species has not been recorded, and nothing is known of its diet. The scant record of its habitat includes those provided by John Gilbert's informants, one of whom said \\"All I could glean of its habits was that it was killed in a thicket surrounding one of the salt lagoons in the interior\\". An assessment of documents prior to the twentieth century concluded the only ecological change to affect the population were anecdotal reports of a \\"disease\\", similar to one that had resulted in the sudden absence of similar species. A synthesis combining other historical evidence proposes what may have been an epizootic during the 1890s that precipitated their extinction.. No historical evidence could be found to link the conclusion of the South African collector Guy C. Shortridge, writing in 1910, that ecological changes such as bushfire or the introduction of cats were directly linked to the species decline. Guy Shortridge searched extensively for this species on his collecting expedition near Bremer Bay, finding Potorous gilbertii skulls at caves near Margaret River, but could only provide the historical details of this species provided to him in his 1910 report. The information he reported‚Äîassumed to be from Nyungar informants‚Äîwas that the species became extinct in 1905, were similar to the quokka in range and habits, and had been commonly found and often captured in large quantities. The remains were examined the following year, along with the remains of a dibbler, which was found along with the P. gilbertii remains in a deposit beneath a moving dune system. Another set of bones were found in an midden beneath a large peppermint (Agonis flexuosa), which was assumed to be the feeding roost of a predatory bird such as an owl. This site, near Hunter River, was partly preserved by a sand dune and included species introduced after the colonisation of Australia, possibly placing the date of these remains within recent history. Sub-fossil remains identified as P. platyops were also found in a survey of deposits on the Eyre Peninsula, accumulations that may have been middens of pre-colonial peoples of the region.  Distribution  The few records of live specimens are restricted to Southwest Australia. The species could have already been near-extinct when Gilbert obtained his specimen and no specific localities are known with any certainty. Sub-fossil remains indicate a wide distribution range, extending from the southern to the western regions of Australia, including Nullarbor Plains, and perhaps as far north as the Northwest Cape region. Remains have also been found on Kangaroo Island. There is some evidence that P. platyops, like the desert dwelling rat-kangaroo (Caloprymnus campestris), was already in decline when the invasive European rabbit became established in the species' former range.

Tokyo Bay is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Uraga Channel. Its old name was . The Tokyo Bay region is both the most populous and largest industrialized area in Japan. Names In ancient times, Japanese knew Tokyo Bay as the . By the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period (1568‚Äì1600) the area had become known as Edo Bay, a reference to the city of Edo. The bay took its present name of Tokyo Bay in modern times, after the Imperial court moved to Edo and renamed the city Tokyo in 1868. Geography Tokyo Bay and Greater Tokyo at night (2018) Tokyo Bay juts prominently into the Kant≈ç Plain. It is surrounded by the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula in Chiba Prefecture to the east and the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture to the west. The shore of Tokyo Bay consists of a diluvial plateau and is subject to rapid marine erosion. Sediments on the shore of the bay make for a smooth, continuous shoreline. =Boundaries= In a narrow sense, Tokyo Bay is the area north of the straight line from Cape Kannon on the west of Miura Peninsula to Cape Futtsu on the east B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. This area covers about in 2012, reclamation projects continue to slowly shrink the bay. In a broader sense, Tokyo Bay includes the Uraga Channel. By this definition the bay opens from an area north of the straight line from Cape Tsurugisaki on the east of Miura Peninsula to Cape Sunosaki on the west of the Boso Peninsula. This area covers about . The area of Tokyo Bay combined with the Uraga Channel covers . =Depth= The shoal between Cape Futtsu in Chiba Prefecture and Cape Honmaku in Yokohama is known as Nakanose, and has a depth of . North of this area the bay has a depth of and an uncomplicated underwater topography. Areas south of Nakanose are significantly deeper moving towards the Pacific Ocean. =Islands= The only natural island in Tokyo Bay is Sarushima () at Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. Sarushima was one of the locations fortified with coastal artillery during the Bakumatsu period and was subsequently incorporated into the Tokyo Bay Fortress during the Meiji period. The Imperial Japanese Navy maintained a degaussing station on the island until the end of World War II. The island is now uninhabited and is a marine park. Many artificial islands were built as naval fortifications in the Meiji and Taish≈ç periods. After World War II these islands were converted to residential or recreational use. Odaiba, also known as Daiba, was one of six artificial islands constructed in 1853 as a fortification to protect the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo, and was known as the Shinagawa Daiba. After World War II Odaiba was incorporated into Tokyo and redeveloped for commercial and recreational use. Before World War II, Yumenoshima was planned as an airfield (one of the largest in the world at the time), but after the US military expansion of Haneda Airport following World War II, the plan of the airfield fell through. The island briefly opened as a public beach before being repurposed and used as a landfill between 1957 and 1967 to dispose of the large quantities of garbage from the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The reclaimed land now hosts Yumenoshima Park with numerous recreational facilities. Hakkei Island (), formerly Landfill Number 14, was constructed in 1985 and is home to Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise. Other artificial islands include Heiwa, Katsushima, Sh≈çwa, Keihin, and Higashi≈çgi islands. =Rivers= Numerous rivers empty into Tokyo Bay, and all provide water for residential and industrial areas along the bay. The Tama and Sumida rivers empty into the bay at Tokyo. The Edo River empties into Tokyo Bay between Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture. The Obitsu and Y≈çr≈ç rivers empty into the bay in Chiba Prefecture. =Land reclamation= Land reclamation has been carried out along the coast of Tokyo Bay since the Meiji period. Areas along the shore with a depth of less than are simplest to carry out landfill, and sand from the floor of Tokyo Bay is used for these projects. The topography of the shoreline of Tokyo Bay differs greatly from that of the pre-modern period due to ongoing land reclamation projects. Tokyo Bay includes about of reclaimed land area in 2012. Aggregate household waste production is enormous in Greater Tokyo, there is little room for traditional garbage disposal sites; waste is rigorously sorted at the household, much of it is turned into ash and further recycled into bay landfill. =Bridges= The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line bridge-tunnel crosses Tokyo Bay between Kawasaki and Kisarazu; Tokyo-Wan Ferry also crosses the bay toward the Uraga Channel between Kurihama (in Yokosuka) and Kanaya (in Futtsu on the Chiba side). Development =Fishing= Tokyo Bay was a historical center of the fishing industry, a source of shellfish, and other aquaculture. These industries decreased with the industrialization of the Tokyo Bay region early in the 20th century, and almost completely ceased with the construction of the Keihin and Keiy≈ç industrial zones directly after World War II. =Ports= A number of Japan's most important ports are located in Tokyo Bay. The Port of Yokohama, the Port of Chiba, the Port of Tokyo, the Port of Kawasaki, the Port of Yokosuka, the Port of Kisarazu, rank not only as the busiest ports in Japan, but also in the Asia-Pacific Region. =Industrial zones= Industrial zones on Tokyo Bay were developed as early as the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912). The Keihin Industrial Zone was built on reclaimed land in Kanagawa Prefecture to the west of Tokyo. This was expanded to the Keiy≈ç Industrial Zone in Chiba Prefecture along the north and east coasts of Tokyo Bay after World War II. The development of the two zones has resulted in the largest industrialized area in Japan. The large-scale industrial zones of the coastal Tokyo region have caused significant air and water pollution. =Military facilities= The Port of Yokosuka contains the naval bases of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and the United States Forces Japan.

Background He was born at Buckhurst in Berkshire, the only surviving son of a minister, Revd. George Hunt,Lot details of a painting at Bonhams, depicting George Ward Hunt as a boy and his mother Emma and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1851, and 21 November of that year was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. Political career He finally entered the House of Commons in 1857 as Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire North, at the end of the year, having made several unsuccessful attempts previously. He was a Secretary to the Treasury from 1866 to 1868, in the ministry of the 14th Earl of Derby. He was then appointed to the Exchequer when Disraeli took office. By repute, when he presented his one and only Budget speech to parliament he discovered that he had left the ministerial \\"Red Box\\" containing it at home. This is said to be the start of the tradition that, when a Chancellor leaves for the House of Commons on Budget Day, he shows the assembled crowd the box by holding it aloft. Hunt was appointed to the Admiralty for Disraeli's second ministry, serving from 1874 until his death from gout in 1877. Although he was considered competent at finance, his turn at the Admiralty was, for a long time, not much admired. Recently however, this attitude has shifted.Eric J. Grove, The Royal Navy since 1815, p. 57-59. Family Hunt married Alice, daughter of the Right Reverend Robert Eden, Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness, in 1857. They had at least ten children, one of whom, Sir Allen Thomas Hunt, became an Admiral in the Royal Navy. Canada's Ward Hunt Island was named after him. His residence was Wadenhoe House in Northamptonshire. He died at Bad Homburg, Germany, in July 1877, on the eve of his 52nd birthday. His wife died in 1894.

The mountain is often referred to locally as just The Skirrid. The smaller hill of Ysgyryd Fach or \\"Little Skirrid\\" (270m) lies about 4.5 km / 2.5 mi to the south. It is 486 m or 1594 feet high and lies just to the north-east of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, about 10 miles from the English border. The Beacons Way passes along the ridge.  Geology  The distinctive landslip viewed from the south The distinctive shape of this Old Red Sandstone hill comprises a long ridge oriented nearly north‚Äìsouth, with a jagged western side resulting from ice age landslips . The upper slopes of the hill are composed of Devonian age sandstones assigned to the Senni Formation (formerly known as the \\"Senni Beds\\"). These overlie weaker mudstones of the St Maughans Formation - a situation which has contributed to the instability of the hill's steep flanks, resulting in a very large landslip at the northern end of the mountain, although the British Geological Survey map of the area (Abergavenny sheet) shows the landslide extending along the whole of the west side of the mountain. There are numerous other landslips of a similar nature on the nearby hills, although that on the Skirrid is perhaps the most well known owing to its visibility from several directions.British Geological Survey: memoir to Abergavenny geological map sheet 232 Some of the landslipped areas contain numerous jumbled blocks of sandstone, one of which is known as the \\"Devil's Table\\". The ridge is very similar in its rocky edge to that found on the Black Hill to the north in Herefordshire.  Cultural associations  The Welsh name Ysgyryd meaning 'split' or 'shattered' and Fawr meaning 'great' describes the hill's shape. There is a rich mythology attached to the mountain , including a distinctive stone known as the Devil's Table. According to legend, part of the mountain is said to have been broken off at the moment of the crucifixion of Jesus. There was a local tradition that earth from the Skirrid was holy and especially fertile, and it was taken away to be scattered on fields elsewhere, on coffins, and in the foundations of churches.Roy Palmer, The Folklore of (old) Monmouthshire, 1998, Pilgrimages were made, especially on Michaelmas Eve, to the summit.  History  Engraving c 1830 of The Sugar Loaf and Skyrrid mountains The Skirrid Mountain Inn In older literature the spelling Skyrrid is sometimes encountered and the mountain is also referred to locally as the Holy Mountain or Sacred Hill. The ruins of an Iron Age hill fort and a medi√¶val chapel, dedicated to St. Michael, lie at the summit. Rudolf Hess used to walk here when he was held prisoner at nearby Maindiff Court during the early 1940s. There is a pub called The Skirrid Mountain Inn just to the north of the mountain in Llanvihangel Crucorney, which claims to be one of the oldest pubs in Wales. This mountain site \\"...a stark barren monolith...\\" is also mentioned in the recent book by Pete \\"Snapper\\" Winner, Soldier 'I' - The Story of an SAS Hero; pp 39 as part of Sickener 2, his Selection for the SAS.  Ownership and access  Ysgyryd Fawr has belonged to the National Trust since 1939. The summit offers views of the Sugar Loaf to the west, and Blorenge to the south, and the ridge is easily accessed on foot from the car park beside the B4521 Ross Road shown on the Ordnance Survey maps. The ascent is steep initially through woods, but gradual thereafter as open ground is reached, and a fine walk along the spine of the mountain to the highest point at the north end of the mountain at the trig point and chapel; allow two hours for the completion and return in good weather. A rough path follows the perimeter of the hill at a much lower level, and can be used as a circular route.

The building is in Middletown Township. \\\\- The map indicates \\"Franklin Mint\\" The brand name was previously owned by Sequential Brands Group headquartered in New York City, New York. It is currently owned by Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV). The Franklin Mint sells coins, medals, jewelry, die- cast vehicles, dolls, sculpture and other collectibles. History For five decades The Franklin Mint produced and mass marketed \\"collectibles\\". Its product line began with manufacturing and marketing privately minted gold and silver commemorative rounds and medallions. In the 1970s and 1980s, Franklin Mint expanded operations to legal-tender coins, producing a combination of bullion and non-bullion proof and uncirculated coin sets of both small and large denominations for a number of countries, particularly Panama and various island states. One of its best numismatic sellers was the \\"Coin Sets of all Nations\\" series which included stamps and post marks of the respective nation on each set. Besides coins, other offerings included dolls, plates, knives, LP record sets and die-cast vehicles. Often emphasized in these media were influential historical figures or famous actors. Wildlife scenes were also a common feature. Many of these items were sold through magazine and television advertisement over the years. One of the LP sets was the 100 Greatest Recordings Of All Time, a collection of classical recordings selected by a panel of performers and conductors and pressed on translucent 180 gram deep red vinyl and packaged two LPs to each album. Each LP was set into a plastic carrier that touched only the center spindle hole and the rim. There were two rereleases of this set. The second used ordinary paper sleeves inside a foldout compartment to house the LPs. The third used a side-open box and paper sleeves. In all three sets the vinyl quality was the same. The Franklin Library The Franklin Library produced public domain classic books from its founding in 1973 until closing in 2000. Its books were designed and bound by The Sloves Organization, Ltd. Vehicles In 1983, after Warner Communications had purchased the Franklin Mint, the company entered the diecast vehicle market, starting with the 1935 Mercedes Benz 500K Roadster. Usually the cars were labeled as Franklin Mint Precision Models. In the following years, Franklin Mint produced more than 600 different issues of motorcycles, trucks and tractors besides automobiles. Additionally the Franklin Mint began manufacturing diecast aircraft. The Franklin Mint produced a large number of World War II 1:48 scale planes including the B-17 Flying Fortress, PBY Catalina, P-51 Mustang, and FW190. Changes in ownership The since demolished Franklin Mint Museum next to the former headquarters in Wawa, Pennsylvania. In 1980, Warner Communications (now part of WarnerMedia) purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Eastern Mountain Sports, a retailer that The Franklin Mint had acquired in the 1970s, as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API. API was renamed Roll International in 1993. During the early 2000s, Roll International wound down much of the Franklin Mint business. On August 31, 2006, Roll International Corp sold the remaining assets of The Franklin Mint to a group including private equity investors led by M. Moshe Malamud, David Salzman and Steven J. Sisskind, who have extensive experience in the art, collectibles, media, entertainment and direct marketing industries. The Franklin Mint brand was purchased in November 2013 by Sequential Brands Group. It was later acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV) in July 2020, a holding company that was founded by former Nasa scientist Alex Mehr and his business partner, serial entrepreneur Tai Lopez. Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund vs Franklin Mint Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was granted intellectual property rights over her image. In 1998, after refusing the Franklin Mint an official license to produce Diana merchandise, the fund sued the company, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates and jewelry. In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed on behalf of a dead person, but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate, and upon losing the case, was countersued by Franklin Mint in 2003. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Diana Memorial Fund agreeing to pay ¬£13.5 million to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to ¬£4 million in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.

It was used in the United Kingdom throughout the 20th century from the early 1920s. Unlike an ordinary callbox, its telephone was located behind a hinged door so it could be used from the outside, and the interior of the box was, in effect, a miniature police station for use by police officers to read and fill in reports, take meal breaks and even temporarily hold detainees until the arrival of transport. Police boxes predate the era of mobile telecommunications; nowadays members of the British police carry two-way radios and mobile phones rather than relying on fixed kiosks.. Most boxes are now disused or have been withdrawn from service. The typical police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary. A light on top of the box would flash to alert an officer that they were requested to contact the station. Members of the public could also use the phone Police boxes were usually blue, with the most notable exception being Glasgow, where they were red until the late 1960s. In addition to a telephone, they contained equipment such as an incident book, a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit. The blue police box is often associated with the science fiction television programme Doctor Who, in which the protagonist's time machine, a TARDIS, is in the shape of a 1960s British police box. History =United States= The first police telephone was installed in Albany, New York in 1877, one year after Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. Call boxes for use by both police and trusted members of the public were first installed in Chicago in 1880, initially housed in kiosks to protect the inner signal boxes from the weather and to limit access to them so as to discourage false alarms.\\"History of the Chicago Police\\", John Joseph Flinn & John Elbert Wilkie (1887). In 1883, Washington, D.C. installed its own system; Detroit installed police call boxes in 1884, and in 1885, Boston followed suit. These were direct line telephones usually placed inside a metal box on a post which could often be accessed by a key or breaking a glass panel. In Chicago, the telephones were restricted to police use, but the boxes also contained a dial mechanism which members of the public could use to signal different types of alarms via telegraph: there were 11 signals, including \\"Police Wagon Required\\", \\"Thieves\\", \\"Forgers\\", \\"Murder\\", \\"Accident\\", \\"Fire\\" and \\"Drunkard\\". =United Kingdom= An 1894 advertisement for the \\"Glasgow Style Police Signal Box System\\", sold by the National Telephone Company The first public police telephones in Britain were introduced in Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, as well as a mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police. Rectangular, wooden, garden shed style police boxes were introduced in Sunderland in 1923 by Chief Constable Frederick J. Crawley, and then in Newcastle in 1925 when he took over as Chief Constable there. Crawley was arguably the first proponent (at least in Britain) of the concept of the police box as a miniature police station rather than just a communications point, including unrestricted access to the telephone by the general public for contacting police, ambulance, and fire services.\\"Decentralization and the Police Box System\\", by Frederick James Crawley; Police Journal, Vol. 1 (1928). His well-publicised success with these boxes, and the revised policing methods they allowed, soon led to the adoption of similar police box systems in many of the larger cities in the north of England, including Manchester and Sheffield. The Metropolitan Police (Met) introduced police boxes throughout London between 1928 and 1937, and the design that later became the most well- known was created by the Met's own surveyor and architect, Gilbert MacKenzie Trench, in 1929. Initially, two competing prototype designs were installed on the newly built Becontree Estate in December 1928, with the winning builder being contracted to erect 43 boxes made of wood with concrete roofs in the final Trench pattern as part of experimental installations in the Richmond and Wood Green sub-divisions, which were completed in December 1929 and January 1930 respectively.\\"The Rise and Fall of the Police Box\\", John Bunker (October 2011). Their success resulted in the widespread adoption of the system throughout Greater London over the next eight years using newer models of the Mackenzie Trench design now made completely of concrete for increased durability, save the doors, which were still made of teak. Constables complained that the concrete boxes were extremely cold and damp compared to their wooden predecessors, so provisions were made for more powerful heaters. For use by officers, the interiors of the boxes normally contained a stool, a table with drawer, a brush and duster, a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit, and a small electric heater. Like the 19th and early 20th century Glaswegian boxes, the London police boxes had a light at the top of each box, which would flash as a signal to police officers indicating that they should contact the station. By 1953, there were 685 police boxes on the streets of Greater London,Stewart: 8. with an additional 72 smaller police posts, also designed by Trench, used in the inner divisions where there was no space for the larger kiosks. Between 1923 and 1960 the police box and/or post system had been adopted by most of the provincial police forces throughout Great Britain. The design and construction of the police boxes used in each system were at the discretion of each individual force, and consequently varied a great deal from location to location, but the police pillars/posts were usually one of three successive models provided by the General Post Office (GPO). Police boxes continued to play an important role in police work until the late 1960s to early 1970s, when they were phased out following the introduction of personal radios. As the main functions of the boxes were superseded by the rise of portable telecommunications devices like the walkie-talkie and the near universal access by the public to telephones and the 999 emergency number, very few police boxes remain in Britain today. Some have been converted into High Street coffee bars. These are common in Edinburgh, though the city also has dozens that remain untouched ‚Äî most in various states of disrepair. Edinburgh's boxes are relatively large, and are of a rectangular plan, with a design by Ebenezer James MacRae, who was inspired by the city's abundance of neoclassical architecture. At their peak there were 86 scattered around the city. In 2012, Lothian and Borders Police sold a further 22, leaving them owning 20. The red police box, as seen at the Glasgow Museum of Transport Beginning in 1933, a slightly simplified version of the Met's police box design was also used by the City of Glasgow Police when its old cast-iron police boxes were replaced by an expanded Crawley type of integrated police box system. This was done as part of the restructuring of the force brought about by Percy Sillitoe after he was appointed Chief Constable at the end of 1931. Like the cast-iron boxes before them, the new concrete boxes continued to be painted red until the popularity of Doctor Who prompted a change to blue in the late 1960s. In 1994, Strathclyde Police decided to scrap the remaining Glasgow police boxes. However, owing to the intervention of the Civil Defence & Emergency Service Preservation Trust and the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, some police boxes were retained and remain today as part of Glasgow's architectural heritage. At least four remain--on Great Western Road (at the corner of Byres Road); Buchanan Street (at the corner of Royal Bank Place); Wilson Street (at the intersection of Glassford Street, completely restored); and one near the corner of Cathedral Square (at the corner of Castle Street, also restored). There was also a red police box preserved in the Glasgow Museum of Transport but this was returned to the Civil Defence Trust after Glasgow City Council decided it did not fit in with the new Transport Museum. The police boxes in Glasgow on Great Western Road, Cathedral Square, and Buchanan Street are currently under licence to a Glasgow-based coffee outlet. , only the Great Western Road and Buchanan Street boxes have been transformed to dispense beverages, and restrictions are enforced by the Civil Defence & Emergency Service Preservation Trust to prevent the exterior of the boxes from being modified beyond the trademarked design. The Civil Defence & Emergency Service Preservation Trust now manages 11 of the UK's last Gilbert Mackenzie Trench police boxes on behalf of a private collector. Another blue police box of this style is preserved at the National Tramway Museum, Crich, Derbyshire. One of the trust's boxes stands outside the Kent Police Museum in Chatham, Kent, Kent Police Museum and another at Grampian Transport Museum. An original MacKenzie Trench box exists in the grounds of the Metropolitan Police College (Peel Centre) at Hendon. There is no public access, but it can easily be seen from a Northern line tube train travelling from Colindale to Hendon Central (on the left hand side). In the City of London, there are eight non- functioning police \\"call posts\\" still in place which are Grade II listed buildings. The City of London Police versions were cast iron rectangular posts, as the streets are too narrow for full sized boxes. One compartment contained the telephone and another locked compartment held a first aid kit. Fifty posts were installed in the \\"Square Mile\\" from 1907; they were in use until 1988. On Thursday 18 April 1996, a new police box based on the Mackenzie Trench design was unveiled outside the Earl's Court tube station in London, equipped with CCTV cameras and a telephone to contact police. The telephone ceased to function in April 2000 when London's telephone numbers were changed, but the box remained, despite the fact that funding for its upkeep and maintenance had long since been exhausted. In March 2005, the Metropolitan Police resumed funding the refurbishment and maintenance of the box. Glasgow introduced a new design of police boxes in 2005. The new boxes are not booths but rather computerized kiosks that connect the caller to a police CCTV control room operator. They stand 10 feet in height with a chrome finish and act as 24-hour information points, with three screens providing information on crime prevention, police force recruitment and tourist information. Manchester also has Help Points similar to those in Glasgow, which contain a siren that is activated upon the emergency button being pressed; this also causes CCTV cameras nearby to focus on the Help Point. Liverpool has structures similar to police boxes, known as police Help Points, which are essentially an intercom box with a push button mounted below a CCTV camera on a post with a direct line to the police. Boscombe in Bournemouth opened its own old-style police box in April 2014 in a bid to tackle crime in the area. The box contains a yellow phone for when it is not staffed by police, along with security cameras and a defibrillator. In Doctor Who prop used from 2010 to 2017 seen at BBC Television Centre The BBC science-fiction television series Doctor Who features a time machine, the TARDIS, disguised as a Mackenzie Trench-style police box. In the show, although a TARDIS is normally capable of disguising itself to blend into its surroundings, the ship's \\"chameleon circuit\\" broke down in England in 1963, and left the TARDIS seen most often in the show stuck as a police box, except for a brief period in one adventure seen in 1985. Doctor Who was originally broadcast from 1963 to 1989; as police boxes were phased out in the 1970s, over time the image of the blue police box became associated as much with Doctor Who as with the police. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the blue police box design in merchandising associated with Doctor Who. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim, maintaining that they owned the rights to the police box image. In 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC, arguing that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police‚Äîor any other police force‚Äîhad ever registered the image as a trademark. In addition, the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police. The series was revived in 2005, and the police box continues to feature prominently in almost every episode. Although the dimensions and colour of the TARDIS used in the series have changed many times, none of the BBC props has been a faithful replica of the original MacKenzie Trench model. This has been explained within the context of the show that chameleon circuits tend to display a bit of \\"drift\\" if left in the same setting for too long, and in any case the circuit of the Doctor's TARDIS is malfunctioning. This was acknowledged in the episode \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" which had the Twelfth Doctor meet the First Doctor, and had the original incarnation and Bill Potts point out the visible differences between the modern and original TARDISes.

An Account of the Life, Lectures and Writings of William Cullen, M.D. Volume 1. William Blackwood & T. Cadell, 1832. Cullen was also a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment. He was David Hume's physician and friend, and on intimate terms with Adam Smith, Lord Kames (with whom he discussed theoretical and practical aspects of husbandry), Joseph Black, John Millar, and Adam Ferguson, among others. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1746‚Äì47), President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1773‚Äì1775) and First Physician to the King in Scotland (1773‚Äì1790).Doig, A., Ferguson, J. P. S., Milne, I. A., and Passmore, R. William Cullen and the Eighteenth Century Medical World. Edinburgh University Press, 1993, pp. xii‚Äìxiii. He was also, incidentally, one of the prime movers in obtaining a royal charter for the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, resulting in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Cullen was a beloved teacher, and many of his students became influential figures in their own right. His best-known students‚Äîmany of whom continued to correspond with him during his long life‚Äîincluded (in addition to Joseph Black, who became his colleague) Benjamin Rush, a central figure in the founding of the United States of America; John Morgan, who founded the first medical school in the American colonies (the Medical School at the College of Philadelphia); William Withering, the discoverer of digitalis; Sir Gilbert Blane, medical reformer of the Royal Navy; and John Coakley Lettsom, the philanthropist and founder of the Medical Society of London.Doig, A., Ferguson, J. P. S., Milne, I. A., and Passmore, R. William Cullen and the Eighteenth Century Medical World. Edinburgh University Press, 1993, esp. pp. 40‚Äì55. Special mention must be made of Cullen's student-turned-opponent, John Brown, who developed the medical system known as Brunonianism, which rivalled Cullen's. This was to have immense influence, especially in Italy and Germany, during the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century.Bynum, W.F. and Porter, Roy. Brunonianism in Britain and Europe. Medical History, Supplement No. 8 (1988), pp. ix‚Äìx. Cullen was also a successful author. He published a number of medical textbooks, mostly for the use of his students, though they were popular throughout Europe and the American colonies as well. His best known work was First Lines of the Practice of Physic, which was published in a series of editions between 1777 and 1784.Doig, A., Ferguson, J. P. S., Milne, I. A., and Passmore, R. William Cullen and the Eighteenth Century Medical World. Edinburgh University Press, 1993, esp. pp. 34‚Äì39. Early life Cullen was born in Hamilton, Lanarkshire.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf His father William was a lawyer retained by the Duke of Hamilton as factor, and his mother was Elizabeth Roberton of Whistlebury. He studied at the Old Grammar School of Hamilton (renamed in 1848 The Hamilton Academy), then, in 1726, began a General Studies arts course at the University of Glasgow. He began his medical training as apprentice to John Paisley, a Glasgow apothecary surgeon, then spent 1729 as surgeon on a merchant vessel trading between London and the West Indies. After two years as assistant apothecary to Mr Murray of Henrietta Street, London, he returned to Scotland in 1732 to establish himself in general medical practice in the parish of Shotts, Lanarkshire. From 1734 to 1736 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he became interested in chemistry, and was one of the founders of the Royal Medical Society in his first year of study. In 1736 he began medical practice in Hamilton, where he rapidly acquired a high reputation. He also continued his study of the natural sciences, especially of chemistry. From 1737 to 1740 William Hunter was his resident pupil, and at one time they proposed to enter into partnership. In 1740 Cullen was awarded the degree of MD from Glasgow University. In 1741, he married and started his family. He became ordinary medical attendant to James Douglas, 5th Duke of Hamilton (1703‚Äì43), his family, and his livestock. In 1744, following the Duke's death, the Cullens moved to Glasgow. In Glasgow he gave extramural lectures for the University, on physiology, botany, materia medica, and chemistry. His great abilities, enthusiasm, and use of practical demonstrations for instruction, made him a successful and highly popular teacher, attracting large classes. At the same time he also maintained a medical practice. In 1747, Cullen was awarded Britain's first independent lectureship in Chemistry and was elected President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In 1748 while in Glasgow, Cullen invented the basis for modern refrigeration, although is not credited with a usable application. In 1751 he was appointed Professor of the Practice of Medicine, although he continued to lecture on chemistry. Edinburgh In 1755 he was enticed by Lord Kames to become Professor of Chemistry and Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. It was in Edinburgh, in 1756, that he gave the first documented public demonstration of artificial refrigeration.William Cullen, Of the Cold Produced by Evaporating Fluids and of Some Other Means of Producing Cold, in Essays and Observations Physical and Literary Read Before a Society in Edinburgh and Published by Them, II, (Edinburgh 1756) Cullen used a pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surroundings. This created a small amount of ice, but the process found no commercial application. From 1757 he delivered lectures on clinical medicine in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. On the death of Charles Alston in 1760, Cullen at the request of the students undertook to finish his course of lectures on materia medica; he delivered an entirely new course, notes of which were published in an unauthorised edition in 1771, but which he re-wrote and issued as A Treatise on Materia Medica in 1789. On the death of Robert Whytt, the professor of the institutes of medicine, Cullen accepted the chair, at the same time resigning that of chemistry. In the same year, he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of the practice of physic (medicine), but subsequently an arrangement was made between him and John Gregory, the successful candidate, by which they both agreed to deliver alternate courses on the theory and practice of medicine. This arrangement continued until the sudden death of Gregory in 1773. Cullen was then appointed sole professor of the practice of physic, and he continued in this office until a few months before his death. In 1783 Cullen (together with his sons) was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died on 5 February 1790 at his home Ormiston HillWilliamson's Street Directory 1784 in Kirknewton, West Lothian, and is buried in the churchyard there. His son Robert lies with him. Influence Cullen taught many students who would go on to influential careers in British science. Indeed, a large number of the doctors who taught in Edinburgh's medical school from the 1790s to 1810s had studied with him, including the chemist Joseph Black, the anatomist Alexander Monro Secundus, and the naturalist John Walker. Cullen's emphasis on the practical benefits of chemistry made his ideas popular amongst farmers, industrialists, naturalists and doctors alike. His influence on these fields was felt through the writings of his students, particularly in the books of John Anderson, the 'Aberdeen Agricola', and the lectures given by Joseph Black and John Walker from the 1770s to 1790s. By studying the symptoms of diseases, Cullen classified diseases into different classes. One class of diseases was called \\"neuroses.\\"  Medical practice  In the 18th century, there were three primary professions in medicine: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, although the barriers among them were starting to become blurred. William Cullen practiced as all three. Because medical practitioners were not as established as they are now, patients generally took advice from a myriad of sources, including personal experience, books, and several consultations. Furthermore, because the diagnostic tools were not as advanced, patient history was the primary and most important information for the physicians to diagnose their patients. There were no strict government regulations in place for physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. As a result, to become successful in the medical marketplace depended more on social skills than on medical expertise, similar to other forms of businesses. Cullen was one of the more successful physicians because of his shrewdness in handling difficult patients. Teaching at the University and seeing patients at the Edinburgh Infirmary as charity also helped Cullen become more famous. Many of Cullen's consultations were done through written letters sent by patients from Scottish cities and towns. Cullen managed his consultations with great efficiency; he usually read the letters early in the morning and his secretary-amanuensis would record and mail back his responses. He then went around Edinburgh to visit patients. This form of epistolary consultations was often limited by the literacy and socioeconomic status of the patients. Patients who would write letters to Cullen were usually in the upper and middle class. Besides letters from patients, he also consulted physicians, often students he had taught. Based on how his letters were written, Cullen was most likely a \\"tactful and compassionate practitioner.\\" Like many physicians in his time, Cullen would often prescribe therapeutics \\"to support the patient's endangered constitution and assist the body's natural healing tendencies.\\" This is because medical practitioners at the time mostly believed that diseases and illnesses were unique to different patients depending on their constitutions.  Medical teaching  According to Rocca, Cullen was known for systemizing and promoting medical knowledge rather than producing original research. Despite the lack of original work, some believed that Cullen's attempt to organize existing knowledge was actually a sign of his \\"practical sagacity\\" as a practitioner. He was a lecturer for more than forty years. In order to understand Cullen's medical teaching at the time, it is important to understand Cullen's conception of \\"system\\" as he taught it in his classes. Cullen described a system as \\"an organised body of opinions on particular topics in the medical curriculum.\\" He also referred to system as the principles in his book First Lines of the Practice of Physic. There were many possible reasons behind Cullen's emphasis of the system of medicine. In the 18th century, a period of Scottish Enlightenment, there were competing theories about the mechanisms of the human body and the causes of diseases proposed by different professors, who competed for students' teaching fees. Thus, having an underlying system of medical knowledge was a practical way to organize the knowledge coherently for the students. Like many prominent medical figures in the 18th century, William Cullen took a great interest in the nervous system. He defined the nervous system as an \\"animated machine\\" whose main function is to \\"perform a variety of motions,\\" communicate and interact with \\"external bodies.\\" Cullen believed that the nervous system was composed of four elements: the medullary substance, consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the membranous nerves, the sensory nerves, and the muscular fibers. Cullen's understanding of the nervous system was also influenced by his contemporaries, one of whom was Albrecht von Haller (1708‚Äì1777). Haller proposed that tissues, including muscles, were characterized by \\"irritability\\" (or contractility), while nerves were characterized by \\"sensibility\\" (or feeling). Using Haller's characterization, Cullen defined disease \\"as an excess or deficiency of sensibility.\\" However, Cullen interpreted sensibility as \\"muscle mobility and vigour\\" and diseases were caused by the imbalance of irritability and sensibility. Based on this definition of disease, his therapeutics \\"either stimulated or sedated the nervous system.\\" He categorized diseases into four main classes: pyrexiae, neuroses, cachexiae, and locales. Within the classes were nineteen orders and 132 genera. The four orders of neuroses were comata, adynamiae, spasmi and vesaniae. Comata was defined as \\"a diminution of voluntary motion, with sleep, or a deprivation of the senses.\\" Adynamiae is defined as \\"a diminution of the involuntary motions, whether vital or natural.\\" Spasmi was defined as \\"irregular motions of the muscles or muscular fibers.\\" Vesaniae was defined as \\"disorders of the judgement without any pyrexia or coma.\\" Cullen's emphasis on the importance of the nervous system was driven by the understanding that the nervous system controls the human body and therefore, \\"all diseases may, in some sense, be called affections of the nervous system, because, in almost every disease, the nerves are more or less hurt.\\" Although Cullen's nosology did not last very long, Cullen's influential teachings on medical knowledge and his attempt to systematize and generalize medical knowledge were integral parts of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment. Family In 1741 he married Anne (or Anna) Johnstone (died 1786). He was father to the judge Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen and to the physician Henry Cullen. Cullen's eldest son Robert became a Scottish judge in 1796 under the title of Lord Cullen later Baron Cullen, and was known for his powers of mimicry. Publications Because of the wide popularity of Cullen's work, many of his publications were translated into a multitude of languages across Europe. Cullen's most popular and successful work was his medical textbook First Lines of the Practice of Physic, published in two volumes in 1777 and expanded with each edition until it reached four volumes in its final edition (1784). His first book-length publication was Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae (1769), Cullen's very influential nosology, or classification of diseases. His next publication was also a medical textbook, and it dealt with the Institutions of medicine, i.e. medical theory. Its full title was Institutions of Medicine. Part I. Physiology (1772) because it focused on physiology, which was traditionally only one part of the Institutions (pathology and therapeutics were also essential parts of medical theory). It went through two more editions (1777 & 1785). Work on his magnum opus, First Lines of Practice of Physic, occupied much of his time in the 1770s and 1780s, but he did manage one final publication. This was his two volume A Treatise of the Materia Medica (1789), which was highly valued by other medical practitioners throughout Europe. Thus, the following works, with their dates of publication (including multiple editions), comprise the majority of Cullen's oevre: *Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae (1769; 1771; 1780; 1785) * Lectures on the Materia medica. 2nd Ed.

They are trees, or sometimes shrubs, in the order Fagales. Members of this family are native to the Americas, Eurasia, and Southeast Asia. The nine or ten genera in the family have a total of around 50 species, and include the commercially important nut-producing trees walnut (Juglans), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and hickory (Carya). The Persian walnut, Juglans regia, is one of the major nut crops of the world. Walnut, hickory, and gaulin are also valuable timber trees while pecan wood is also valued as cooking fuel. Description Members of the walnut family have large, aromatic leaves that are usually alternate, but opposite in Alfaroa and Oreomunnea. The leaves are pinnately compound or ternate, and usually 20‚Äì100 cm long. The trees are wind-pollinated, and the flowers are usually arranged in catkins. Some fruits are borderline and difficult to categorize. Hickory nuts (Carya) and walnuts (Juglans) grow within an outer husk; these fruits are sometimes considered to be drupes or drupaceous nuts, rather than true botanical nuts. \\"Tryma\\" is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes. The fruits of the Juglandaceae are often confused with drupes but are accessory fruit because the outer covering of the fruit is technically an involucre and thus not morphologically part of the carpel; this means it cannot be a drupe but is instead a drupe-like nut. These odd nuts fall into two different types: in the walnut genus (Juglans), it is a pseudodrupe and in the hickory genus (Carya), it is a tryma.John Derek Bewley, Michael Black, Peter Halmer (2006) The Encyclopedia of Seeds: Science, Technology And Uses Taxonomy The known living genera are grouped into subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes as follows: * Subfamily Rhoipteleoideae Reveal ** Rhoiptelea Diels & Hand.-Mazz. 1932 * Subfamily Engelhardioideae Iljinskaya 1990 ** Alfaroa Standl. 1927‚Äîgaulin ** Engelhardia Lesch. ex Blume 1825‚Äì1826‚Äîcheo ** Oreomunnea Oerst. 1856 * Subfamily Juglandoideae Eaton 1836 ** Tribe Platycaryeae Nakai 1933 *** Platycarya Siebold & Zucc. 1843 ** Tribe Juglandeae Rchb. 1832 *** Subtribe Caryinae D.E.

It is located approximately southeast of the state capital, Hobart. The site forms part of the Australian Convict Sites, a World Heritage property consisting of 11 remnant penal sites originally built within the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries on fertile Australian coastal strips. Collectively, these sites, including Port Arthur, are described by UNESCO as \\"...the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.\\" In 1996, the town was the scene of the Port Arthur Massacre, the worst mass murder event in post- colonial Australian history. Location Port Arthur is located about southeast of the state capital, Hobart, on the Tasman Peninsula. The scenic drive from Hobart, via the Tasman Highway to Sorell and the Arthur Highway to Port Arthur, takes around 90 minutes. Transport from Hobart to the site is also available via bus or ferry, and various companies offer day tours from Hobart. At the , Port Arthur had a population of 251. This was down from 499 in 2006. History Port Arthur was named after George Arthur, the lieutenant governor of Van Diemen's Land. The settlement started as a timber station in 1830, but it is best known for being a penal colony. From 1833 until 1853, it was the destination for those deemed the most hardened of convicted British criminals, those who were secondary offenders having reoffended after their arrival in Australia. Rebellious personalities from other convict stations were also sent there. In addition, Port Arthur had some of the strictest security measures of the British penal system. Port Arthur was one example of the \\"Separate Prison Typology\\" (sometimes known as the model prison), which emerged from Jeremy Bentham's theories and his panopticon. The prison was completed in 1853, but then extended in 1855. The layout of the prison was fairly symmetrical. It was a cross shape with exercise yards at each corner. The prisoner wings were each connected to the surveillance core of the prison, as well as the chapel in the centre hall.The \\"Separate\\" or \\"Model\\" prison, Port Arthur ‚Äì Ian Brand From this surveillance hub, each wing could be clearly seen, although individual cells could not. This is how the Separate Prison at Port Arthur differed from the original theory of the panopticon. The Separate Prison System also signaled a shift from physical punishment to psychological punishment. The hard corporal punishment, such as whippings, used in other penal stations was thought to only serve to harden criminals, and did nothing to turn them from their immoral ways. For example, food was used to reward well-behaved prisoners and as punishment for troublemakers. As a reward, a prisoner could receive larger amounts of food or even luxury items such as tea, sugar, and tobacco. As punishment, the prisoners would receive the bare minimum of bread and water.Anderson, Margaret (2007)\\"'A Mill to Grind Rogues Honest.'.\\" Australian Historical Studies 38, no. 129: 158. Under this system of punishment, the \\"Silent System\\" was implemented in the building. Here, prisoners were hooded and made to stay silent; this was supposed to allow time for the prisoner to reflect upon the actions which had brought him there. Many of the prisoners in the Separate Prison developed mental illness from the lack of light and sound. This was an unintended outcome, although the asylum was built right next to the Separate Prison. In many ways, Port Arthur was the model for many of the penal reform movement, despite shipping, housing, and slave-labour use of convicts being as harsh, or worse, than others stations around the nation. The peninsula on which Port Arthur is located is a naturally secure site by being surrounded by water (rumoured by the administration to be shark-infested). The 30-m-wide isthmus of Eaglehawk Neck that was the only connection to the mainland was fenced and guarded by soldiers, man traps, and half-starved dogs. Contact between visiting seamen and prisoners was barred. Ships had to check in their sails and oars upon landing to prevent any escapes. However, many attempts were made, and some were successful. Boats were seized and rowed or sailed long distances to freedom. Shore-based and ship-based whaling was banned in the area to prevent convicts trying to escape in the boats. Officers at Port Arthur sometimes set out in their own boats and attempted to catch whales. This may have been more for sport than as a commercial activity.Katheryn Evans,Shore-based whaling in Tasmania historical research project, Volume 2; site histories, Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service, Hobart, 1993, p. 36. In 1836, a tramway was established between Taranna and a jetty in Long Bay, north of Port Arthur. The sole propulsion was convicts.\\"The Convict Tramway at Port Arthur\\" Eardley, Gifford Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April 1954 pp3740. One of the last remaining sections of the tramway can be viewed at the Federation Chocolate Factory at Taranna. Smooth Island in Norfolk Bay was most likely used to grow fresh vegetables for the Port Arthur penal settlement. Port Arthur was sold as an inescapable prison, much like the later Alcatraz Island in the United States. Some prisoners were not discouraged by this, and tried to escape. Martin Cash successfully escaped along with two others. One of the most infamous incidents, simply for its bizarreness, was the escape attempt of one George \\"Billy\\" Hunt. Hunt disguised himself using a kangaroo hide and tried to flee across the Neck, but the half-starved guards on duty tried to shoot him to supplement their meager rations. When he noticed them sighting him up, Hunt threw off his disguise and surrendered, receiving 150 lashes. Port Arthur was also the destination for juvenile convicts, receiving many boys, some as young as nine. The boys were separated from the main convict population and kept on Point Puer, the British Empire's second boys' prison.Gorton & Ramsland Carter's Barracks experience Like the adults, the boys were used in hard labour such as stone cutting and construction. One of the buildings constructed was one of Australia's first nondenominational churches, built in a gothic style. Attendance of the weekly Sunday service was compulsory for the prison population. Critics of the new system noted that this and other measures seemed to have negligible impact on reformation. The archeology found in Port Arthur shows that people living there participated in the mundane, material necessities of life. Not only did the people living there help prepare food, but they also participated in recreational activities such as smoking and hunting. Despite its reputation as a pioneering institution for the new, enlightened view of imprisonment, Port Arthur was still in reality as harsh and brutal as other penal settlements. Some critics might even suggest that its use of psychological punishment, compounded with no hope of escape, made it one of the worst. Some tales suggest that prisoners committed murder (an offence punishable by death) just to escape the desolation of life at the camp. The Isle of the Dead was the destination for all who died inside the prison camps. Of the 1646 graves recorded to exist there, only 180, those of prison staff and military personnel, are marked. The prison closed in 1877. Tourism development Before Port Arthur was abandoned as a prison in 1877, some people saw the potential tourist attraction. David Burn, who visited the prison in 1842, was awed by the peninsula's beauty and believed that many would come to visit it.Davidson, Jim (October,1995), \\"Port Arthur: A tourist history.\\" Australian Historical Studies 26, no. 105, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed 23 September 2010). This opinion was not shared by all. For example, Anthony Trollope in 1872 declared that no man desired to see the \\"strange ruins\\" of Port Arthur. After the prison closed, much of the property was put up for auction. However, most of the property was not sold until 1889. By this time, the area had become increasingly popular and the prison buildings were in decay. As the Hobart Mercury proclaimed, \\"the buildings themselves are fast going to decay, and in a few years will attract nobody; for they will be ruins without anything to make them worthy of respect, or even remembrance.\\" The decay was seen as something positive, as the Tasmanian population wished to distance themselves from the dark image of Port Arthur. Those who bought Port Arthur property began tearing down the buildings, the destruction was furthered by the fires of 1895 and 1897, which destroyed the old prison house, and earth tremors. In place of the Prison Port Arthur, the town of Carnarvon was born. The town was named after the British Secretary of State and the population was said to be \\"refined and intellectual\\". The town brought in many visitors as they encouraged boating, fishing, and shooting in the natural beauty of the peninsula. They again wished to remove the negative connotation attached to the area. Despite this wish, the haunting stories of Port Arthur prisoners and circulating ghost stories brought popularity to the remaining prison ruins. This was helped by the popular novels For the Term of His Natural Life (1874) by Marcus Clarke and The Broad Arrow (1859) by Caroline Leakey, which concerned themselves about convicts in Port Arthur. Port Arthur, Tasmania as a tourist place In 1927, tourism had grown to the point where the area's name was reverted to Port Arthur. In 1916, the Scenery Preservation Board (SPB) was established to take the management of Port Arthur out of the hands of the locals. By the 1970s, the National Parks and Wildlife Service began managing the site. In 1979, funding was received to preserve the site as a tourist destination, due to its historical significance. The \\"working\\" elements of the Port Arthur community, such as the post office and municipal offices, were moved to nearby Nubeena. Several sandstone structures, built by convicts working under hard labour conditions, were cleaned of ivy overgrowth and restored to a condition similar to their appearance in the 19th century. Buildings include the \\"Model Prison\\", the Guard Tower, the Church, and the remnants of the main penitentiary. The buildings are surrounded by lush, green parkland. The mass graves on the Isle of the Dead also attract visitors. Point Puer, across the harbour from the main settlement, was the site of the first boys' reformatory in the British Empire. Boys sent there were given some basic education, and taught trade skills. =Conservation management= Since 1987, the site has been managed by the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority,Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority , Port Arthur Historic Site with conservation works funded by the Tasmanian government and the admission fees paid by visitors. Volunteer groups have been working at the building sites of Point Puer to help researchers gain a better understanding of the history of the boys' prison. The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO inscribed the Port Arthur Historic Site and the Coal Mines Historic Site onto the World Heritage Register on 31 July 2010, as part of the Australian Convict Sites World Heritage property. Port Arthur is one of Australia's most visited historical sites, receiving over 250,000 visitors each year. Massacre On 28 April 1996, the Port Arthur historic site was the location of a massacre. The perpetrator murdered 35 people and wounded 23 more before being captured by the Special Operations Group. The killing spree led to a national restriction on high capacity semiautomatic shotguns and rifles. The perpetrator, 28-year-old Martin Bryant, was subsequently convicted, and is currently serving 35 life sentences plus 1,035 years without parole in the psychiatric wing of Risdon Prison in Hobart, Tasmania.

The first specimen of Turkish coal was brought from Ereƒüli to Istanbul in 1822, but nothing was done for exploration and exploitation of this coal. However, in 1829, another specimen of coal was brought to Istanbul by Uzun (Long) Mehmet, a sailor and native of the village of Kestaneci, near Ereƒüli. This time attention was given to the discovery and the sailor received a reward of a life pension, but before he could benefit from this reward he was murdered. The first miners requested and delivered from the Austrian Government are the Austrian Croats known to have been employed in the Ereƒüli Coal Mines. The correspondence between Istanbul and the embassy in Vienna show that coal production in the Ereƒüli Basin predates the March 1837 request by 18 months and that production started around September 1835.History Of Zonguldak (tr) An investigation of Hazine-i Hassa (Ottoman Imperial Treasury Department) records in the Ottoman archives shows that regular mining activities in the Ereƒüli Basin started in February 1841. This is confirmed by a newspaper article published in the 14 February 1841 issue of Ceride-i Havadis. Ereƒüli Coal Company, chartered by six partners (Ahmed Fethi Pasha, Rƒ±za Pasha, Safveti Pasha, Tahir Bey Efendi, Izzet Pasha and Mustafa Efendi), excavated the coal in the Ereƒüli Coal Basin, initially under the auspices of Darphane-i Amire and later transferred to Hazine-i Hassa when the latter was established in 1849.Zonguldak Province (tr) =Timeline of the administration of the Ereƒüli coal mines after 1845= *1848-1854 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1849-1854 English (and Galata goldsmiths) Coal Company‚Äôs Management *1854-1856 Temporary administration by the English during the Crimean war *1856-1861 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1856-1859 Operated by Trust Administration *1859-1860 Operated by Zafiropulos *1860-1861 Operated by the English Coal Company *1861-1865 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1865-1908 Administered by the Ministry of Navy *1865-1882 Operated by Shipbuilding Administration *1882-1940 Operated by local and foreign capital companies *1908-1909 Administered by Nafia Nezareti (Ministry of Public Works) *1909-1920 Administered by the Ministry of Forestry, Agriculture and Mineral Trade *1914-1922 Period of World War I and the National Liberation War *1920-1940 Administered by the Ministry of Economics *1926-1940 Operated by T√ºrkiye ƒ∞≈ü Bankasƒ± (Ankara) *1937-1940 Operated by ETIBANK (Ankara) and EKI *1940-1957 Administered by ETIBANK and EKI (Ereƒüli Komurleri Isletmesi - Zonguldak) *1957-1984 Administered by TKI (Ankara) *1984‚Äìpresent Administered by TTK (Turkiye Ta≈ükomuru Kurumu - Zonguldak) In 1851, the Company‚Äôs production fields are mentioned in the accounting records as \\"coal mines administered by the Company under the irade-i seniyye in Ereƒüli, Amasra and various places\\". \\"Various places\\" mentioned in the records are not known for sure.

Its seat is Muƒüla, about inland, while some of Turkey's largest holiday resorts, such as Bodrum, √ñl√ºdeniz, Marmaris and Fethiye, are on the coast in Muƒüla. Etymology The original name of Muƒüla is open for discussion. Various sources refer to the city as Mogola, Mobella or Mobolia. Geography At , Muƒüla's coastline is the longest among the Provinces of Turkey and longer than many countries' coastlines, (even without taking any small islands into account). Important is the Dat√ßa Peninsula. As well as the sea, Muƒüla has two large lakes, Lake Bafa in the district of Milas and Lake K√∂yceƒüiz. The landscape consists of pot-shaped small plains surrounded by mountains, formed by depressions in the Neogene. These include the plain of the city of Muƒüla itself, Ye≈üilyurt, Ula, G√ºlaƒüzƒ±, Yerkesik, Akkaya, and Yenice). Until the recent building of highways, transport from these plains to either the coast or inland was quite arduous, and thus each locality remained an isolated culture of its own. Contact with the outside world was through one of the three difficult passes: northwest to Milas, north to the Menderes plain through G√∂kbel, or northeast to Tavas. The economy of Muƒüla relies mainly on tourism (on the coast), and agriculture, forestry and marble quarries inland. Coast in Muƒüla province (near Dalaman). Typical Muƒüla coastal scene. Typical Muƒüla inland landscape. Agriculture in Muƒüla is rich and varied; the province is one of Turkey's largest producers of honey, pine- forest honey in particular and citrus fruits are grown in Ortaca, Fethiye, Dalaman and Dalyan. The province is the second center of marble industry in Turkey after Afyonkarahisar in terms of quantity, variety and quality. Other mineral exploitation includes coal-mining in Yataƒüan and chrome in Fethiye. Other industry in the province includes the SEKA paper mill in Dalaman, However Muƒüla is by no means an industrialised province. =Environment= Despite court decisions upheld by the ECHR, , Yataƒüan, Yenik√∂y and Kemerk√∂y coal-fired power stations continue to pollute. =Transportation= The following are aspects about transportation in Muƒüla province: * There are two airports in Dalaman and Milas-Bodrum, serving domestic and international flights and catering to the tourism industry. * There are yacht marinas in Bodrum, Marmaris, Fethiye and G√ºll√ºk. * There are many privately run bus connections to ƒ∞zmir, Antalya, Ankara, Istanbul and other major cities in Turkey from Muƒüla and directly from the coastal resorts. History In ancient times in Anatolia, the region between the Menderes (Meander) and Dalaman (Indus) rivers in the south was called Caria. The inhabitants were Carians and Leleges. In his Iliad, Homer describes the Carians as natives of Anatolia, defending their country against Greeks in joint campaigns in collaboration with the Trojans. A major city of ancient Caria, Muƒüla is known to have been occupied by raiding parties of Egyptians, Assyrians and Scythians, until eventually the area was settled by Ancient Greek colonists. The Greeks inhabited this coast for a long time building prominent cities, such as Knidos (at the end of the Dat√ßa Peninsula) and Bodrum (Halicarnassos), as well as many smaller towns along the coast, on the Bodrum Peninsula and inland, including in the district of Fethiye the cities of Telmessos, Xanthos, Patara and Tlos. Eventually the coast was conquered by Persians who were in turn removed by Alexander the Great, bringing an end to the satrapy of Caria. In 1261, Menteshe Bey, founder of the Beylik (principality) that carried his name, with its capital in Milas and nearby Be√ßin, established his rule over the region of Muƒüla as well. The beys of Menteshe held the city until 1390 and this, the first Turkish state in the region, achieved a high level of cultural development, its buildings remaining to this day. The province also became a significant naval power, trading with the Aegean Islands, Crete and as far as Venice and Egypt. Turkish settlement during the Menteshe period usually took place through migrations along the K√ºtahya-Tavas axis. In 1390, Muƒüla was taken over by the Ottoman Empire. However, just twelve years later, Tamerlane and his forces defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara, and returned control of the region to its former rulers, the Menteshe Beys, as he did for other Anatolian beyliks. Muƒüla was brought back under Ottoman control by Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror, in 1451. One of the most important events in the area during the Ottoman period was the well-recorded campaign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent against Rhodes, which was launched from Marmaris. = Archaeology = With this long history Muƒüla is rich in ancient ruins, with over 100 excavated sites including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Letoon, near Fethiye. In 2018, archaeologists unearthed a 2,300-year-old rock sepulchre of an ancient Greek boxer called Diagoras of Rhodes on a hill in the Turgut village, Muƒüla province, Marmaris. This unusual pyramid tomb was considered to belong to a holy person by the local people. The shrine, used as a pilgrimage by locals until the 1970s, also has the potential to be the only pyramid grave in Turkey. Excavation team also discovered an inscription with these words: ‚ÄúI will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave\\". Notable people The following are notable residents of Muƒüla province: * Herodotus of Halicarnassos, historian * Turgut Reis Seaman * Basil Zaharoff, Arms dealer born in Muƒüla * Osman Hamdi Bey Painter had his summer residence in Yataƒüan * ≈û√ºkr√º Kaya, Minister of the Interior under Atat√ºrk, born in ƒ∞stank√∂y * Mustafa Muƒülalƒ±, Turkish War of Independence general * Yunus Nadi Abalƒ±oƒülu, Founder of Cumhuriyet newspaper and key supporter of Atat√ºrk, from Fethiye * Zihni Derin, Agriculturalist responsible for planting tea in the Eastern Black Sea region, from Muƒüla * Necati √áiller, father of Prime Minister Tansu √áiller, governor of Istanbul in the 1950s, from Milas * Cevat ≈ûakir Kabaaƒüa√ßlƒ±, writer of The \\"Fisherman of Halicarnasoss\\" and his student ≈ûadan G√∂kovalƒ± * Nail √áakƒ±rhan, architect of the Akyaka √áakƒ±rhan houses and winner of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture * Janet Aky√ºz Mattei Amateur astronomer and president of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), of Bodrum. * Zeki M√ºren, Singer and fixture of the Bodrum nightclub scene for many years * Poet Can Y√ºcel is buried in Dat√ßa, his home in his final years * Former President Kenan Evren lived in Marmaris after he retired until his death. Districts thumb  Politics  The Republican People's Party (CHP), Turkey's principal center- left party has a traditionally strong presence across the political landscape of Muƒüla Province, closely followed by the traditional center-right represented by the Democrat Party (DP) in Turkey's politics, although the incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP) obtained the first place in the ballots cast during the last national-scale elections that were the 2004 local elections, with 31,25% of the votes. The overall percentage for the province was 26,3% for the CHP, and 20,98% for the DP during the same elections. The rightist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), campaigning on Turkish nationalism had obtained a further 9,5% (especially in the Fethiye district). The other parties registered less significant percentages.

The X-ray housing is turned by 90¬∞ for a chest radiograph An X-ray generator is a device that produces X-rays. Together with an X-ray detector, it is commonly used in a variety of applications including medicine, X-ray fluorescence, electronic assembly inspection, and measurement of material thickness in manufacturing operations. In medical applications, X-ray generators are used by radiographers to acquire x-ray images of the internal structures (e.g., bones) of living organisms, and also in sterilization. Structure GemX-160 - Portable Wireless Controlled Battery Powered X-ray Generator for use in Non Destructive Testing and Security. XR150 - Portable pulsed X-ray Battery Powered X-ray Generator used in Security. An X-ray generator generally contains an X-ray tube to produce the X-rays. Possibly, radioisotopes can also be used to generate X-rays.Page 442 in: An X-ray tube is a simple vacuum tube that contains a cathode, which directs a stream of electrons into a vacuum, and an anode, which collects the electrons and is made of tungsten to evacuate the heat generated by the collision. When the electrons collide with the target, about 1% of the resulting energy is emitted as X-rays, with the remaining 99% released as heat. Due to the high energy of the electrons that reach relativistic speeds the target is usually made of tungsten even if other material can be used particularly in XRF applications. An X-ray generator also needs to contain a cooling system to cool the anode; many X-ray generators use water or oil recirculating systems.\\"X-ray Generators\\", NDT Resource Center. Page fetched April 21, 2011. =Medical imaging= Acquisition of projectional radiography, with an X-ray generator and a detector. In medical imaging applications, an X-ray machine has a control console that is used by a radiologic technologist to select X-ray attributes suitable for the specific exam, a power supply that creates and produces the desired kVp (peak kilovoltage), mA (milliamperes, sometimes referred to as mAs which is actually mA multiplied by the desired exposure length) for the X-ray tube, and the X-ray tube itself. History The discovery of X-rays came from experimenting with Crookes tubes, an early experimental electrical discharge tube invented by English physicist William Crookes around 1869-1875. In 1895, Wilhelm R√∂ntgen discovered X-rays emanating from Crookes tubes and the many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent. One of the first X-ray photographs was made of the hand of R√∂ntgen's wife. The image displayed both her wedding ring and bones. On January 18, 1896 an X-ray machine was formally displayed by Henry Louis Smith. A fully functioning unit was introduced to the public at the 1904 World's Fair by Clarence Dally. In the 1940s and 1950s, X-ray machines were used in stores to help sell footwear. These were known as Shoe-fitting fluoroscopes. However, as the harmful effects of X-ray radiation were properly considered, they finally fell out of use. Shoe-fitting use of the device was first banned by the state of Pennsylvania in 1957. (They were more a clever marketing tool to attract customers, rather than a fitting aid.) Together with Robert J. Van de Graaff, John G. Trump developed one of the first million-volt X-ray generators. Overview An X-ray imaging system consists of a generator control console where the operator selects desired techniques to obtain a quality readable image(kVp, mA and exposure time), an x-ray generator which controls the x-ray tube current, x-ray tube kilovoltage and x-ray emitting exposure time, an X-ray tube that converts the kilovoltage and mA into actual x-rays and an image detection system which can be either a film (analog technology) or a digital capture system and a PACS. Applications X-ray machines are used in health care for visualising bone structures, during surgeries (especially orthopedic) to assist surgeons in reattaching broken bones with screws or structural plates, assisting cardiologists in locating blocked arteries and guiding stent placements or performing angioplasties and for other dense tissues such as tumours. Non-medicinal applications include security and material analysis. =Medicine= Mobile fluoroscopy units can produce images continuously. The main fields in which x-ray machines are used in medicine are radiography, radiotherapy, and fluoroscopic-type procedures. Radiography is generally used for fast, highly penetrating images, and is usually used in areas with a high bone content but can also be used to look for tumors such as with mammography imaging. Some forms of radiography include: *orthopantomogram ‚Äî a panoramic x-ray of the jaw showing all the teeth at once *mammography ‚Äî x-rays of breast tissue *tomography ‚Äî x-ray imaging in sections In fluoroscopy, imaging of the digestive tract is done with the help of a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate, which is opaque to X-rays. Radiotherapy ‚Äî the use of x-ray radiation to treat malignant and benign cancer cells, a non-imaging application Fluoroscopy is used in cases where real-time visualization is necessary (and is most commonly encountered in everyday life at airport security). Some medical applications of fluoroscopy include: *angiography ‚Äî used to examine blood vessels in real time along with the placement of stents and other procedures to repair blocked arteries. *barium enema ‚Äî a procedure used to examine problems of the colon and lower gastrointestinal tract *barium swallow ‚Äî similar to a barium enema, but used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract *biopsy ‚Äî the removal of tissue for examination *Pain Management - used to visually see and guide needles for administering/injecting pain medications, steroids or pain blocking medications throughout the spinal region. *Orthopedic procedures - used to guide placement and removal of bone structure reinforcement plates, rods and fastening hardware used to aide the healing process and alignment of bone structures healing properly together. X-rays are highly penetrating, ionizing radiation, therefore X-ray machines are used to take pictures of dense tissues such as bones and teeth. This is because bones absorb the radiation more than the less dense soft tissue. X-rays from a source pass through the body and onto a photographic cassette. Areas where radiation is absorbed show up as lighter shades of grey (closer to white). This can be used to diagnose broken or fractured bones. = Security = Hand-luggage inspection machine at Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport. X-ray machines are used to screen objects non-invasively. Luggage at airports and student baggage at some schools are examined for possible weapons, including bombs. Prices of these Luggage X-rays vary from $50,000 to $300,000. The main parts of an X-ray Baggage Inspection System are the generator used to generate x-rays, the detector to detect radiation after passing through the baggage, signal processor unit (usually a PC) to process the incoming signal from the detector, and a conveyor system for moving baggage into the system. Portable pulsed X-ray Battery Powered X-ray Generator used in Security as shown in the figure provides EOD responders safer analysis of any possible target hazard.  Operation  When baggage is placed on the conveyor, it is moved into the machine by the operator. There is an infrared transmitter and receiver assembly to detect the baggage when it enters the tunnel. This assembly gives the signal to switch on the generator and signal processing system. The signal processing system processes incoming signals from the detector and reproduce an image based upon the type of material and material density inside the baggage. This image is then sent to the display unit.  Color classification  X-ray image of a backpack. Organic and inorganic materials are discriminated in using dual energy techniques. The colour of the image displayed depends upon the material and material density : organic material such as paper, clothes and most explosives are displayed in orange. Mixed materials such as aluminum are displayed in green. Inorganic materials such as copper are displayed in blue and non-penetrable items are displayed in black (some machines display this as a yellowish green or red). The darkness of the color depends upon the density or thickness of the material. The material density determination is achieved by two-layer detector. The layers of the detector pixels are separated with a strip of metal. The metal absorbs soft rays, letting the shorter, more penetrating wavelengths through to the bottom layer of detectors, turning the detector to a crude two-band spectrometer. Advances in X-ray technology Public Affairs Detachment, April 21, 2011, www.army.mil. Fetched from URL on April 25, 2011. A film of carbon nanotubes (as a cathode) that emits electrons at room temperature when exposed to an electrical field has been fashioned into an X-ray device. An array of these emitters can be placed around a target item to be scanned and the images from each emitter can be assembled by computer software to provide a 3-dimensional image of the target in a fraction of the time it takes using a conventional X-ray device. The system also allows rapid, precise control, enabling prospective physiological gated imaging. Engineers at the University of Missouri (MU), Columbia, have invented a compact source of x-rays and other forms of radiation. The radiation source is the size of a stick of gum and could be used to create portable x-ray scanners. A prototype handheld x-ray scanner using the source could be manufactured in as soon as three years.

There has been much speculation about the origins of the Igbo people, as it is unknown how exactly the group came to form. Geographically, the Igbo homeland is divided into two unequal sections by the Niger River ‚Äì an eastern (which is the larger of the two) and a western section. The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa. The Igbo language is a part of the Niger- Congo language family. It is divided into numerous regional dialects, and somewhat mutually intelligible with the larger \\"Igboid\\" cluster. The Igbo homeland straddles the lower Niger River, east and south of the Edoid and Idomoid groups, and west of the Ibibioid (Cross River) cluster. In rural Nigeria, Igbo people work mostly as craftsmen, farmers and traders. The most important crop is the yam. Other staple crops include cassava and taro. Before British colonial rule in the 20th century, the Igbo were a politically fragmented group, with a number of centralized chiefdoms such as Nri, Aro Confederacy, Agbor and Onitsha. Frederick Lugard introduced the Eze system of \\"Warrant Chiefs\\". Unaffected by the Fulani War and the resulting spread of Islam in Nigeria in the 19th century, they became overwhelmingly Christian under colonization. In the wake of decolonisation, the Igbo developed a strong sense of ethnic identity. During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967‚Äì1970 the Igbo territories seceded as the short-lived Republic of Biafra. MASSOB, a sectarian organization formed in 1999, continues a non-violent struggle for an independent Igbo state. Large ethnic Igbo populations are found in Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as outside Africa.  Definition and subgroups  \\"Igbo\\" as an ethnic identity developed comparatively recently, in the context of decolonisation and the Nigerian Civil War. The various Igbo- speaking communities were historically fragmented and decentralised; in the opinion of Chinua Achebe (2000), Igbo identity should be placed somewhere between a \\"tribe\\" and a \\"nation\\". Since the defeat of the Republic of Biafra in 1970, the Igbo are sometimes classed as a \\"stateless nation\\".  History  = Prehistory = The Igboid languages form a cluster within the Volta‚ÄìNiger phylum, most likely grouped with Yoruboid and Edoid.Williamson & Blench (2000) 'Niger‚ÄìCongo', in Heine & Nurse, African Languages. The greatest differentiation within the Igboid group is between the Ekpeye and the rest. Williamson (2002) argues that based on this pattern, proto-Igboid migration would have moved down the Niger from a more northern area in the savannah and first settled close to the delta, with a secondary center of Igbo proper more to the north, in the Awka area.Kay Williamson in Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa, F. N. Anozie, Nwanna Nzewunwa (eds.), The Early History of the Niger Delta (1988) 92f. Pottery dated at around 2500 BC showing similarities with later Igbo work was found at Nsukka in the 1970s, along with pottery and tools at nearby Ibagwa; the traditions of the Umueri clan have as their source the Anambra valley. In the 1970s the Owerri, Okigwe, Orlu, Awgu, Udi and Awka divisions were determined to constitute \\"an Igbo heartland\\" from the linguistic and cultural evidence.; excerpted in \\"Cultural Harmony I: Igboland‚Äîthe World of Man and the World of Spirits\\", section 4 of Kalu Ogbaa, ed., Understanding Things Fall Apart (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1999; ), pp. 83‚Äì85. Genetic studies have shown the Igbo to cluster most closely with other Niger- Congo-speaking peoples. The predominant Y-chromosmoal haplogroup is E1b1a1-M2.M191/P86 positive samples occurred in tested populations of Annang (38.3%), Ibibio (45.6%), Efik (45%), and Igbo (54.3%). = Nri Kingdom = Bronze from the ninth century town of Igbo Ukwu, now at the British Museum The Nri people of Igbo land have a creation myth which is one of the many creation myths that exist in various parts of Igbo land. The Nri and Aguleri people are in the territory of the Umueri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure Eri. Eri's origins are unclear, though he has been described as a \\"sky being\\" sent by Chukwu (God). He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra. The historian Elizabeth Allo Isichei says \\"Nri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan, [are] a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri.\\" Archaeological evidence suggests that Nri influence in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century, and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled the region around 948 with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century. The first Eze Nri (King of Nri) √åfiku√°nim followed directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043. At least one historian puts √åfiku√°nim's reign much later, around 1225 AD. > Each king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor, Eri. Each king is > a ritual reproduction of Eri. The initiation rite of a new king shows that > the ritual process of becoming Ezenri (Nri priest-king) follows closely the > path traced by the hero in establishing the Nri kingdom. :‚Äî E. Elochukwu > Uzukwu An Igbo man with facial scarifications, known as ichi, early 20th century The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, a sort of theocratic state, that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had seven types of taboos which included human (such as the birth of twins), animal (such as killing or eating of pythons), object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administration, all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide by the rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth, the Eze Nri. = Traditional society = Traditional Igbo political organization was based on a quasi-democratic republican system of government. In tight knit communities, this system guaranteed its citizens equality, as opposed to a feudalist system with a king ruling over subjects. This government system was witnessed by the Portuguese who first arrived and met with the Igbo people in the 15th century. With the exception of a few notable Igbo towns such as Onitsha, which had kings called Obi, and places like the Nri Kingdom and Arochukwu, which had priest kings; Igbo communities and area governments were overwhelmingly ruled solely by a republican consultative assembly of the common people. Communities were usually governed and administered by a council of elders. Three Igbo women in the early 20th century Although title holders were respected because of their accomplishments and capabilities, they were never revered as kings, but often performed special functions given to them by such assemblies. This way of governing was immensely different from most other communities of Western Africa, and only shared by the Ewe of Ghana. Umunna are a form of patrilineage maintained by the Igbo. Law starts with the Umunna which is a male line of descent from a founding ancestor (who the line is sometimes named after) with groups of compounds containing closely related families headed by the eldest male member. The Umunna can be seen as the most important pillar of Igbo society. It was also a culture in which gender was re-constructed and performed according to social need, ‚Äúwhere gender and sex did not coincide. Instead, gender was flexible and fluid, allowing women to become men and men to become women‚Äù Mathematics in indigenous Igbo society is evident in their calendar, banking system and strategic betting game called Okwe. In their indigenous calendar, a week had four days, a month consisted of seven weeks and 13 months made a year. In the last month, an extra day was added. This calendar is still used in indigenous Igbo villages and towns to determine market days. They settled law matters via mediators, and their banking system for loans and savings, called Isusu, is also still used. The Igbo new year, starting with the month ·ªåÃÅnw·∫°ÃÅ MÃÄb·ª•ÃÅ () occurs on the third week of February, although the traditional start of the year for many Igbo communities is around springtime in ·ªåÃÅnw·∫°ÃÅ √Ågw·ª•ÃÅ (June). Used as a ceremonial script by secret societies, the Igbo have an indigenous ideographic set of symbols called Nsibidi, originating from the neighboring Ejagham people. Igbo people produced bronzes from as early as the 9th century, some of which have been found at the town of Igbo Ukwu, Anambra state. A system of indentured servitude existed among the Igbo before and after the encounter with Europeans. Indentured service in Igbo areas was described by Olaudah Equiano in his memoir. He describes the conditions of the slaves in his community of Essaka, and points out the difference between the treatment of slaves under the Igbo in Essaka, and those in the custody of Europeans in West Indies: > ...but how different was their condition from that of the slaves in the West > Indies! With us, they do no more work than other members of the > community,... even their master;... (except that they were not permitted to > eat with those... free-born;) and there was scarce any other difference > between them,... Some of these slaves have... slaves under them as their own > property... for their own use. The Niger coast became an area of contact between African and European traders in 1434. The Portuguese were the first to make contact with the Igbo people. At this time in history, there was more of an emphasis on trade as opposed to empire building; consequently, the Portuguese engaged in trading Igbo slaves. Then the Dutch came into the picture, and finally the British after that. The slave trade ended in 1807, so the Europeans started to shift their focus away from trade and into industry. The British, in particular, sought to extend their imperialistic influence into Igboland. Prior to European contact, Igbo trade routes stretched as far as Mecca, Medina and Jeddah on the continent. = Transatlantic slave trade and diaspora = Chambers (2002) argued that many of the slaves taken from the Bight of Biafra across the Middle Passage would have been Igbo. These slaves were usually sold to Europeans by the Aro Confederacy, who kidnapped or bought slaves from Igbo villages in the hinterland. Igbo slaves may have not been victims of slave-raiding wars or expeditions, but perhaps debtors or Igbo people who committed within their communities alleged crimes. With the goal for freedom, enslaved Igbo people were known to the British colonists as being rebellious and having a high rate of suicide to escape slavery. There is evidence that traders sought Igbo women. Igbo women were paired with Coromantee (Akan) men to subdue the men because of the belief that the women were bound to their first-born sons‚Äô birthplace. It is alleged that European slave traders were fairly well informed about various African ethnicities, leading to slavers' targeting certain ethnic groups which plantation owners preferred. Particular desired ethnic groups consequently became fairly concentrated in certain parts of the Americas. The Igbo were dispersed to colonies such as Jamaica, Cuba, Saint- Domingue, Barbados, the future United States, Belize and Trinidad and Tobago, among others. Elements of Igbo culture can still be found in these places. For example, in Jamaican Patois, the Igbo word unu, meaning \\"you\\" plural, is still used. \\"Red Ibo\\" (or \\"red eboe\\") describes a black person with fair or \\"yellowish\\" skin. This term had originated from the reported prevalence of these skin tones among the Igbo but eastern Nigerian influences may not be strictly Igbo. The word Bim, a colloquial term for Barbados, was commonly used among enslaved Barbadians (Bajans). This word is said to have derived from b√©m in the Igbo language meaning 'my place or people', but may have other origins (see: Barbados etymology). A section of Belize City was named Eboe Town after its Igbo inhabitants. In the United States, the Igbo were imported to the Chesapeake Bay colonies and states of Maryland and Virginia, where they constituted the largest group of Africans. Since the late 20th century, a wave of Nigerian immigrants, mostly English and Igbo-speaking, have settled in Maryland, attracted to its strong professional job market. They were also imported to the southern borders of Georgia and South Carolina considered the low country and where Gulluh culture still preserves African traditions of its ancestors. Today, there is an area called Ebo landing . The story surrounding the name is how Igbo were brought to the area and when they got off of the ship, they collectively tried to drown themselves rather than be slaves. That point is on Igbo landing. = Colonial period = The 19th-century British colonization effort in present-day Nigeria and increased encounters between the Igbo and other ethnicities near the Niger River led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. The Igbo proved decisive and enthusiastic in their embrace of Christianity and Western education. Due to the incompatibility of the Igbo decentralized style of government and the centralized system including the appointment of warrant chiefs required for British indirect rule, British colonial rule was marked with open conflicts and much tension. Under British colonial rule, the diversity within each of Nigeria's major ethnic groups slowly decreased and distinctions between the Igbo and other large ethnic groups, such as the Hausa and the Yoruba, became sharper. Colonial rule transformed Igbo society, as portrayed in Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart. British rule brought about changes in culture, such as the introduction of Warrant Chiefs as Eze (indigenous rulers) where there were no such monarchies. Christian missionaries introduced aspects of European ideology into Igbo society and culture, sometimes shunning parts of the culture. The rumours that the Igbo women were being assessed for taxation sparked off the 1929 Igbo Women's War in Aba (also known as the 1929 Aba Riots), a massive revolt of women never encountered before in Igbo history. Aspects of Igbo culture such as construction of houses, education and religion changed following colonialism. The tradition of building houses out of mud walls and thatched roofs ended as the people shifted to materials such as cement blocks for houses and zinc roofs. Roads for vehicles were built. Buildings such as hospitals and schools were erected in many parts of Igboland. Along with these changes, electricity and running water were installed in the early 20th century. With electricity, new technology such as radios and televisions were adopted, and have become commonplace in most Igbo households. = Nigerian Civil War = Flag of the Republic of Biafra (1967‚Äì1970), sometimes regarded as the ethnic flag of the Igbo A series of ethnic clashes between Northern Muslims and the Igbo, and other ethnic groups of Eastern Nigeria Region living in Northern Nigeria took place between 1966 and 1967. Elements in the army had assassinated the Nigerian military head of state General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi (29 July 1966) and peace negotiations failed between the military government that deposed Ironsi and the regional government of Eastern Nigeria at the Aburi Talks in Ghana in 1967. These events led to a regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria deciding that the region should secede and proclaim the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967. Late General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu made this declaration and became the head of state of the new republic. The resultant war, which became known as the Nigerian Civil War or the Nigerian-Biafran War, lasted from July 6, 1967 until January 15, 1970, after which the federal government re-absorbed Biafra into Nigeria. Several million Eastern Nigerians died from the pogroms against them, such as the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom where between 10,000 and 30,000 Igbo people were killed. Many homes, schools, and hospitals were destroyed in the conflict, as well. On top of this, the federal government of Nigeria denied Igbo people access to their savings placed in Nigerian banks and provided them with little compensation. The war also led to a great deal of discrimination against the Igbo people at the hands of other ethnic groups. In their struggle, the people of Biafra earned the respect of figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre and John Lennon, who returned his British honor, MBE, partly in protest against British collusion in the Nigeria-Biafra war. The former President of Biafra, late General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, stated that the three years of freedom allowed his people to become the most civilized and most technologically-advanced black people in the world. In July 2007, Odumegwu- Ojukwu renewed calls for the secession of the Biafran state as a sovereign entity. = Recent history (1970 to present) = Some Igbo subgroups, such as the Ikwerre, started dissociating themselves from the larger Igbo population after the war. In the post-war era, people of eastern Nigeria changed the names of both people and places to non-Igbo-sounding words. For instance, the town of Igbuzo was anglicized to Ibusa. Due to discrimination, many Igbo had trouble finding employment, and during the early 1970s, the Igbo became one of the poorest ethnic groups in Nigeria. Igbo rebuilt their cities by themselves without any contribution from the Federal government of Nigeria. This led to the establishment of new factories in southern Nigeria. Many Igbo people eventually took government positions, although many were engaged in private business. Since the early 21st century, there has been a wave of Nigerian Igbo immigration to other African countries, Europe, and the Americas. Archives A series of black and white, silent films about the Igbo people made by George Basden in the 1920s and 1930s are held in the British Empire and Commonwealth Collection at Bristol Archives (Ref. 2006/070).online catalogue  Political organization  The 1930s saw the rise of Igbo unions in the cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt. Later, the Ibo Federal Union (renamed the Ibo State Union in 1948) emerged as an umbrella pan-ethnic organization. Headed by Nnamdi Azikiwe, it was closely associated with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), which he co-founded with Herbert Macaulay. The aim of the organization was the improvement and advancement (such as in education) of the Igbo and their indigenous land and included an Igbo \\"national anthem\\" with a plan for an Igbo bank. In 1978 after Olusegun Obasanjo's military regime lifted the ban on independent political activity, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo organization was formed, an elite umbrella organization which speaks on behalf of the Igbo people. Their main concerns are the marginalization of the Igbo people in Nigerian politics and the neglect of indigenous Igbo territory in social amenities and development of infrastructure. Other groups which protest the perceived marginalization of the Igbo people are the Igbo Peoples Congress (IPC). Even before the 20th century there were numerous Igbo unions and organizations existing around the world, such as the Igbo union in Bathurst, Gambia in 1842, founded by a prominent Igbo trader and ex-soldier named Thomas Refell. Another was the union founded by the Igbo community in Freetown, Sierra Leone by 1860, of which Africanus Horton, a surgeon, scientist and soldier, was an active member. Decades after the Nigerian-Biafran war, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), a secessionist group, was founded in September 1999 by Ralph Uwazurike for the goal of an independent Igbo state. Since its creation, there have been several conflicts between its members and the Nigerian government, resulting in the death of members. After the 2015 Nigerian general elections a group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) became the most prominent vocal group for the agitation of the creation of an independent state of Biafra through a radio station named Radio Biafra. For the promotion of the Igbo language and culture, the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture (SPILC) was founded in 1949 by Frederick Chidozie Ogbalu, and has since created a standard dialect for Igbo.  Culture  Anklet beaten from a solid brass bar of the type once fashionable among Igbo women. Now in the collection of Wolverhampton Art Gallery. The leg-tube extends approx 7 cm each side of the 35 cm disc. Igbo culture includes the various customs, practices and traditions of the people. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people's visual art, use of language, music and dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and language dialects. Because of their various subgroups, the variety of their culture is heightened further. =Language and literature= Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is perhaps the most popular and renowned novel that deals with the Igbo and their traditional life. The Igbo language was used by John Goldsmith as an example to justify deviating from the classical linear model of phonology as laid out in The Sound Pattern of English. It is written in the Roman script as well as the Nsibidi formalized ideograms, which is used by the Ekpe society and Okonko fraternity, but is no longer widely used. Nsibidi ideography existed among the Igbo before the 16th century, but died out after it became popular among secret societies, who made Nsibidi a secret form of communication. Igbo language is difficult because of the huge number of dialects, its richness in prefixes and suffixes and its heavy intonation. Igbo is a tonal language and there are hundreds of different Igbo dialects and Igboid languages, such as the Ikwerre and Ekpeye languages. In 1939, Dr. Ida C. Ward led a research expedition on Igbo dialects which could possibly be used as a basis of a standard Igbo dialect, also known as Central Igbo. This dialect included that of the Owerri and Umuahia groups, including the Ohuhu dialect. This proposed dialect was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, publishers, and Cambridge University. In 1789, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano was published in London, England, written by Olaudah Equiano, a former slave. The book featured 79 Igbo words. In the first and second chapter, the book illustrates various aspects of Igbo life based on Olaudah Equiano's life in his hometown of Essaka. Although the book was one of the first books published to include Igbo material, Geschichte der Mission der evangelischen Br√ºder auf den caraibischen Inseln St. Thomas, St. Croix und S. Jan (), published in 1777, written by the German missionary C. G. A. Oldendorp, was the first book to publish any Igbo material. Perhaps the most popular and renowned novel that deals with the Igbo and their traditional life was the 1959 book by Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart. The novel concerns influences of British colonialism and Christian missionaries on a traditional Igbo community during an unspecified time in the late nineteenth or early 20th century. Most of the novel is set in Umuofia, one of nine villages on the lower Niger. = Performing arts = The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, igba, and ichaka. Another popular musical form among the Igbo is Highlife. A widely popular musical genre in West Africa, Highlife is a fusion of jazz and traditional music. The modern Igbo highlife is seen in the works of Dr Sir Warrior, Oliver De Coque, Bright Chimezie and Chief Osita Osadebe, who were among the most popular Igbo highlife musicians of the 20th century. Masking is one of the most common art styles in Igboland and is linked strongly with Igbo traditional music. A mask can be made of wood or fabric, along with other materials including iron and vegetation. Masks have a variety of uses, mainly in social satires, religious rituals, secret society initiations (such as the Ekpe society) and public festivals, which now include Christmas time celebrations. Some of the best known include the Agbogho Mmuo () masks of the Northern Igbo which represent the spirits of deceased maidens and their mothers with masks symbolizing beauty and Ijele. Other impressive masks include Northern Igbo Ijele masks. At high, Ijele masks consist of platforms in diameter, supporting figures made of coloured cloth and representing everyday scenes with objects such as leopards. Ijele masks are used for honoring the dead to ensure the continuity and well- being of the community and are only seen on rare occasions such as the death of a prominent figure in the community. There are many Igbo dance styles, but perhaps, Igbo dance is best known for its Atilogwu dance troops. These performances include acrobatic stunts such as high kicks and cartwheels, with each rhythm from the indigenous instruments indicating a movement to the dancer. = Visual art and architecture = There is such variety among Igbo groups that it is not possible to define a general Igbo art style. Igbo art is known for various types of masquerade, masks and outfits symbolising people, animals, or abstract conceptions. Bronze castings found in the town of Igbo Ukwu from the 9th century, constitute the earliest sculptures discovered in Igboland. Here, the grave of a well-established man of distinction and a ritual store, dating from the 9th century AD, contained both chased copper objects and elaborate castings of leaded bronze. Along with these bronzes were 165,000 glass beads said to have originated in Egypt, Venice and India. Some popular Igbo art styles include Uli designs. The majority of the Igbo carve and use masks, although the function of masks vary from community to community. Thatching with palm leaf mats, early 20th century Traditional Igbo house/room from the Anambra area, 1967 Igbo art is noted for Mbari architecture. Mbari houses of the Owerri-Igbo are large opened-sided square planned shelters. They house many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi (deity) and Ala, the earth goddess, with other deities of thunder and water). Other sculptures are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), animals, legendary creatures and ancestors. Mbari houses take years to build in what is regarded as a sacred process. When new ones are constructed, old ones are left to decay. Everyday houses were made of mud and thatched roofs with bare earth floors with carved design doors. Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior. These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women. One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the town of Nsude, in Abaja, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60 ft. in circumference and 3 ft. in height. The next stack was 45 ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.Basden, G. S. (1966). Among the Ibos of Nigeria, 1912. Psychology Press. p. 109. . = Religion and rites of passage = The Holy Ghost depicted as a dove on a relief in Onitsha Most Igbo are Christian. Christianity was first introduced to the Igbo people through European colonization in 1857. The Igbo people were hesitant to convert to Christianity initially because they believed the gods of their native religion would bring disaster to them. However, Christianity gradually gained converts in Igbo land, mainly through the work of church agents. These men built schools and focused on persuading the youth to adopt Christian values. The Igbo people today are known as the ethnic group that has adopted Christianity the most in all of Africa. The Igbo people were unaffected by the Islamic jihad waged in Nigeria in the 19th century, but a small minority converted to Islam in the 20th century. There is also a small population of Igbo Jews,Njemanze PC. Igbo Mediators of Yahweh Culture of Life. London: Xlibris, 2015 some of whom merely identifying as Jews, while others having converted to Judaism. These draw their inspiration from Olaudah Equiano, a Christian-educated freed slave who remarked in his autobiography of 1789 on \\"the strong analogy which... appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in Genesis‚Äîan analogy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other.\\" Equiano's speculation has given rise to a great debate on the origins of the Igbo. Native religion The Igbo traditional religion is known as Odinani. The supreme deity is called Chukwu (\\"great spirit\\"); Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things on Earth. They believe the Cosmos is divided into four complex parts: creation, known as Okike; supernatural forces or deities called Alusi; Mmuo, which are spirits; and Uwa, the world. Chukwu is the supreme deity in Odinani as he is the creator, and the Igbo people believe that all things come from him and that everything on earth, heaven and the rest of the spiritual world is under his control. Linguistic studies of the Igbo language suggest that the name Chukwu is a compound of the Igbo words Chi (spiritual being) and Ukwu (great in size). Each individual is born with a spiritual guide/guardian angel or guardian principle, \\"Chi\\", unique to each individual and the individual's fate and destiny is determined by their Chi. Thus the Igbos say that the siblings may come of the same mother but no two people have the same Chi and thus different destinies for all. Alusi, alternatively known as Arusi or Arushi (depending on dialect), are minor deities that are worshiped and served in Odinani. There are many different Alusi, each with its own purpose. When an individual deity is no longer needed, or becomes too violent, it is discarded. Wooden sculpture of Ikenga, an Alusi, in the British Museum The Igbo have traditionally believed in reincarnation. People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behavior, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female. Children are not allowed to call elders by their names without using an honorific (as this is considered disrespectful). As a sign of respect, children are required to greet elders when seeing them for the first time in the day. Children usually add the Igbo honorifics Mazi or Dede before an elder's name when addressing them.  Burials  After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased's finest garments. Animal sacrifices may be offered and the dead person is well perfumed. Burial usually follows within 24 hours of death. In the 21st century, the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence. Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is determined by an individual's age, gender and status in society. Children are buried in hiding and out of sight; their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights. A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin: in a garden or a farm-area that belonged to her father. In the 21st century, a majority of the Igbo bury their dead in the western way, although it is not uncommon for burials to be practiced in the traditional Igbo ways.  Marriage  The process of marrying usually involves asking the young woman's consent, introducing the woman to the man's family and the same for the man to the woman's family, testing the bride's character, checking the woman's family background, and paying the brides' wealth. Typically speaking, bride wealth is more symbolic. Nonetheless, kola nuts, wine, goats, and chickens, among other things, are listed in the proposal, as well. Negotiating the bride wealth can also take more than one day, giving both parties time for a ceremonial feast. Marriages were sometimes arranged from birth through negotiation of the two families. However, after a series of interviews conducted in the 1990s with 250 Igbo women, it was found that 94.4% of that sample population disapproved of arranged marriages. A modern Igbo wedding, Nnewi, Nigeria In the past, many Igbo men practiced polygamy. The polygamous family is made up of a man and his wives and all their children. Men sometimes married multiple wives for economic reasons so as to have more people in the family, including children, to help on farms. Christian and civil marriages have changed the Igbo family since colonization. Igbo people now tend to enter monogamous courtships and create nuclear families, mainly because of Western influence. Some Western marriage customs, such as weddings in a church, take place either before or after the lgbo cultural traditional marriage. = Attire = Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing, as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private parts. Because of this purpose, children were often nude from birth until the beginning of their adolescence‚Äîthe time they were considered to have something to hide.Uli body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body. Men wearing contemporary Isiagu with the ceremonial Igbo men's hat okpu agu Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa. This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads. Both men and women wore wrappers. Men would wear loin cloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming. In Olaudah Equiano's narrative, Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka: > Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous > wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of > which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor. We beat this wood > into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women perfume > themselves. :‚Äî Olaudah Equiano As colonialism became more influential, the Igbo adapted their dress customs. Clothing worn before colonialism became \\"traditional\\" and worn on cultural occasions. Modern Igbo traditional attire, for men, is generally made up of the Isiagu top, which resembles the Dashiki worn by other African groups. Isiagu (or Ishi agu) is usually patterned with lions' heads embroidered over the clothing and can be a plain colour. It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either a ceremonial title holders hat or with the conventional striped men's hat known as Okpu Agu. For women, a puffed sleeve blouse along with two wrappers and a head tie are worn. An Igbo chief in his Cultural Attire = Cuisine = Yam porridge (or yam pottage) is an Igbo dish known as awa·ªã. The yam is very important to the Igbo as the staple crop. It is known for its resiliency (a yam can remain fully edible for six months without refrigeration), but it can also be very versatile in terms of its incorporation into different dishes. Yams can be fried, roasted, boiled, or made into a potage with tomatoes and herbs. The cultivation of yams is most commonly carried out by men, as women tend to focus on other crops. There are celebrations such as the New yam festival () which are held for the harvesting of the yam. During the festival, yam is eaten throughout the communities as celebration. Yam tubers are shown off by individuals as a sign of success and wealth. Rice has replaced yam for many ceremonial occasions. Other indigenous foods include cassava, garri, maize and plantains. Soups or stews are included in a typical meal, prepared with a vegetable (such as okra, of which the word derives from the Igbo language, Okwuru) to which pieces of fish, chicken, beef, or goat meat are added. Jollof rice is popular throughout West Africa and Palm wine is a popular alcoholic traditional beverage.  Demographics  = Nigeria = The Igbo people are natively found in Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Benue, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, Delta and Rivers State. The Igbo language is predominant throughout these areas, although Nigerian English (the national language) is spoken as well. Prominent towns and cities in Igboland include Aba, Enugu (considered the 'Igbo capital'), Onitsha, Owerri, Abakaliki, Asaba, and Port Harcourt among others. A significant number of Igbo people have migrated to other parts of Nigeria, such as the cities of Lagos, Abuja, and Kano. The official data on the population of ethnic groups in Nigeria continues to be controversial as a minority of these groups have claimed that the government deliberately deflates the official population of one group, to give the other numerical superiority. The CIA World Factbook puts the Igbo population of Nigeria at 24% of a total population of 177 million, or approximate 42 million people. Southeastern Nigeria, which is inhabited primarily by the Igbo, is the most densely populated area in Nigeria, and possibly in all of Africa. Most ethnicities that inhabit southeastern Nigeria, such as the closely related Efik and Ibibio people, are sometimes regarded as Igbo by other Nigerians and ethnographers who are not well informed about the southeast. = Diaspora = New Yam festival in Dublin, Ireland After the Nigerian-Biafran War, many Igbo people emigrated out of the indigenous Igbo homeland in southeastern Nigeria due to an absence of federal presence, lack of jobs, and poor infrastructure. In recent decades the Igbo region of Nigeria has suffered from frequent environmental damage mainly related to the oil industry. Igbo people have moved to both Nigerian cities such as Lagos and Abuja, and other countries such as Gabon, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Prominent Igbo communities outside Africa include those of London in the United Kingdom and Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. in the United States. About 21,000 Igbo people were recorded in Ghana in 1969, while as small number (8,680) lived on Bioko island in 2002. Small numbers live in Japan, making up the majority of the Nigerian immigrant population based in Tokyo. A large amount of the African population of Guangdong, China, is Igbo-speaking and are mainly businessmen trading between factories in China and southeastern Nigeria, particularly Enugu. Other Igbo immigrants are found in the Americas (Igbo Canadian, Igbo American and elsewhere;. 19,520 identify as Nigerian, 61,430 identify as black. In the 2003 PBS programme African American Lives, Bishop T. D. Jakes had his DNA analyzed; his Y chromosome showed that he is descended from the Igbo. American actors Forest Whitaker, Paul Robeson, and Blair Underwood have traced their genealogy back to the Igbo people.

A committed Stalinist, Th√§lmann played a major role during the political instability of the Weimar Republic, especially in its final years, when the KPD explicitly sought to overthrow the liberal democracy of the republic. Under his leadership the KPD became intimately associated with the government of the Soviet Union and the policies of Joseph Stalin, and from 1928 the party was largely controlled and funded by Stalin's government. The KPD under Th√§lmann's leadership regarded the Social Democratic Party (SPD) as its main adversary and the party adopted the position that the social democrats were \\"social fascists.\\" Th√§lmann was also leader of the paramilitary Roter Frontk√§mpferbund (which was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats in 1929). In 1932 he established Antifaschistische Aktion or Antifa, which concentrated its attacks on the recently formed social democratic paramilitary organization Iron Front. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1933 and held in solitary confinement for eleven years; for political reasons, Stalin did not seek his release when he entered into the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Germany, and Th√§lmann's party rival Walter Ulbricht ignored requests to plead on his behalf. Many of Th√§lmann's closest associates who had emigrated to the Soviet Union were executed during the Great Purge of the 1930s.

On 4 April 1887, his sister Frieda was born (died 8 July 1967 in Hamburg). In March 1892, Th√§lmann's parents were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison, because they had fenced stolen goods or had taken them for debt payment.Hamburgischer Correspondent und Hamburgische B√∂rsen-Halle, Morgenausgabe, 5. M√§rz 1892. Ernst and Frieda were placed in separate foster families. Th√§lmann's parents were released early; his mother in May, and his father in October 1893. His parents' offense was used 36 years later in the campaign against Ernst Th√§lmann. From 1893 to 1900, Th√§lmann attended elementary school. He later described history, natural history, folklore, mathematics, gymnastics and sports as his favorite subjects. However, he did not like religion. In the mid-1890s, his parents opened a vegetable, coal and wagon shop in Eilbek,Ernst Th√§lmann: Gek√ºrzter Lebenslauf, aus dem Stegreif niedergelegt, stilistisch deshalb nicht ganz einwandfrei. 1935, In: Institut f√ºr Marxismus-Leninismus beim ZK der SED (Hrsg.): Ernst Th√§lmann: Briefe ‚Äì Erinnerungen. Dietz Verlag, Berlin 1986. a suburb of Hamburg. The young Ernst worked in the business after school and did his schoolwork in the morning before classes started. Despite this burden, Th√§lmann was a good student who enjoyed learning. He wanted to become a teacher or to learn a trade, but his parents refused to lend him financial support. He had to continue working in his parents' business, causing much sorrow and conflict with his parents. Therefore, he sought a job as an unskilled worker in the port. Here the ten-year-old Th√§lmann came in contact with the port workers on strike from November 1896 till February 1897 in the bitter labor dispute known as the Hamburg Docker's Strike 1896/97.Institut f√ºr Marxismus-Leninismus beim Zentralkomitee der SED (Autorenkollektiv): Ernst Th√§lmann. Eine Biographie. Dietz, Berlin 1980.  Leaving home; World War I; desertion  At the beginning of 1902, he left home. He first he lived in an emergency shelter, later in a basement apartment, and in 1904 he was fireman on the steam-powered freight ship AMERIKA which also traveled to the USA. He was a Social Democratic Party member during 1903. On 1 February 1904, he joined the Central Union of Trade, transport and traffic workers of Germany and ascended to the chairman of the 'Department carters'. In 1913, he supported a call of Rosa Luxemburg for a mass strike as a means of action of the SPD to enforce political demands. From 1913 to 1914, he worked for a laundry as a coachman. In January 1915, one day before he was called up for military service in World War I, he married Rosa Koch. He was posted to the artillery on the western front, where he stayed till the end of the war, on personal account taking part in the Battle of Champagne (1915‚Äì1916), the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Battle of Arras (1917), the Second Battle of the Aisne (1917), the Battle of Cambrai (1917) (1917), and the Battle of Soissons (1918). For his service, Th√§lmann received the Iron cross Second Class, the Hanseatic Cross and Wound Badge (twice). Towards the end of 1917, he became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). In late October 1918, while on home leave from the front, Th√§lmann deserted together with four fellow soldiers. On 9 November 1918, he wrote in his diary on the Western Front, \\"...did a bunk from the Front with 4 comrades at 2 o'clock.\\"Branko Lazitch and Milorad Drachkovitch, \\"Ernst Th√§lmann\\" in Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, Palo Alto: Hoover Institution Press, 1986  Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD)  Ernst Th√§lmann on the front page of a KPD newspaper, the Saxon Workers' News, during the 1925 presidential election. The caption reads \\"Ernst Th√§lmann: the Red President!\\" After his desertion, he was active in the German Revolution in Hamburg that began on 29th October 1918. From March 1919, he was chairman of the USPD in Hamburg, a member of the Hamburg Parliament, and worked as a relief worker in the Hamburg city park before taking up a well-paying job at the employment office. There, he rose to the rank of Inspector. When the USPD split over the question whether to join the Communist International (Comintern), Th√§lmann sided with the pro-Communist faction which merged with the KPD in November 1920, and in the following December Th√§lmann was elected to the KPD's Central Committee. In March 1921 he was fired from his job at the employment office due to his political activities. That summer Th√§lmann was a representative of the KPD to the Congress of the Comintern in Moscow and met Vladimir Lenin personally.Norman LaPorte: The Rise of Ernst Th√§lmann and the Hamburg Left 1921-1923, in: Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart 2017, pp. 131. In June 1922, terrorists from the ultranationalist group Organisation Consul threw a hand grenade into his ground floor flat, but the assassination attempt failed and he survived. Th√§lmann helped to organise the Hamburg Uprising of October 1923Timeline of Ernst Th√§lmann's life (in German), at the Lebendiges Museum Online (LEMO): https://www.dhm.de/lemo/biografie/ernst-thaelmann \\\\-- it failed, however, and Th√§lmann was forced to go in hiding. After Lenin's death in late January 1924, Th√§lmann visited Moscow and maintained a guard of honour at his bier. From February 1924 he was deputy chairman of the KPD and, from May, a Reichstag member. At the 5th Congress of the Comintern in July 1924 he was elected to the Comintern executive committee and a short time later to its steering committee. In February 1925 he became chairman of the KPD's paramilitary organisation, the Roter Frontk√§mpferbund (RFB) (although this organisation was banned as an extremist organisation by the governing social democrats in 1929, after the events of Blutmai (\\"Bloody May\\", see below)). In October 1925 Th√§lmann became chairman of the KPD and thus a candidate for the German Presidency. Th√§lmann's candidacy in the second round of the presidential election split the centre-left vote, ensuring that the conservative Paul von Hindenburg defeated the Centre Party's Wilhelm Marx.David Priestand, Red Flag: A History of Communism, New York: Grove Press, 2009 In October 1926 Th√§lmann supported the dockers' strike in his home town of Hamburg. He saw this as an act of solidarity with the British miners' strike which had started on 1 May, although that strike had been profitable for the Hamburg Docks as an alternative supplier of coal. In 1928 during the Wittorf affair he was ousted from the party central committee for trying to cover up embezzlement by John Wittorf, a party official and prot√©g√© (and a close friend) of Th√§lmann. However, Stalin intervened and had Th√§lmann reinstated, signalling the beginning of a purge and completing the \\"Stalinization\\" of the KPD.Eric D. Weitz, Creating German Communism, 1890‚Äì1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997 = KPD vs. SPD = Ernst Th√§lmann statue in Weimar Th√§lmann, Ernst and Thorez, Maurice ‚Äì Paris-Berlin, 1932 During World War I and the Weimar Republic, the KPD competed for leadership of the working class with the more moderate Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), particularly after the latter supported German involvement in the War. At the 12th party congress of the KPD in June 1929 in Berlin-Wedding, Th√§lmann adopted a policy of confrontation with the SPD. This followed the events of \\"Bloody May\\", in which 32 people were killed by the police in an attempt to suppress demonstrations which had been banned by the Interior Minister, Carl Severing, a Social Democrat. Th√§lmann's KPD thus fought the SPD as its main political enemy, acting according to the Comintern policy which declared Social Democrats to be \\"social fascists\\". This made it difficult for the two leftist parties to work together against the emergence of Adolf Hitler.David Priestand, Red Flag: A History of Communism',' New York: Grove Press, 2009 The KPD under Th√§lmann declared that \\"fighting fascism means fighting the SPD just as much as it means fighting Hitler and the parties of Br√ºning.\\" Th√§lmann declared in December 1931 that \\"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest\\" of social democrats. By 1927, Karl Kilbom, the Comintern representative to Germany, had started to combat this ultra-leftist tendency within the German Communist Party, but found Stalin machinating against his efforts. In March 1932, Th√§lmann was once again a candidate for the German Presidency, against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler. The KPD's slogan was \\"A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war.\\" Th√§lmann returned as a candidate in the second round of the election, as it was permitted by the German electoral law, but his vote count lessened from 4,983,000 (13.2%), in the first round, to 3,707,000 (10.2%). After the National Socialists came to power in January 1933, Th√§lmann proposed, to no avail, that the SPD and KPD should organise a general strike to topple National Socialist rule together. In February 1933, a Central Committee meeting of the then already banned KPD took place at the \\"Sporthaus Ziegenhals\\" in K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, near Berlin, where Th√§lmann had called for the violent overthrow of Hitler's government. (The Comintern's guidelines on social democracy as ‚Äúsocial fascism‚Äù remained in force until 1935 when the Comintern officially switched to endorsing a ‚Äúpopular front‚Äù of socialists, liberals and even conservatives against the Nazi threat -- an attempt to win over the leftist elements of the Nazi Party, especially the SA, who largely came from a working-class background and supported socialist economic policies. By that time, however, Hitler and the National Socialists had risen to power and the KPD had been largely destroyed.) After the Reichstag Fire on 27th of February, 1933, the Nazi Party targeted members of the KPD and other left-wing opponents of the regime in a new wave of violence and arrests; although having gone underground yet again, Th√§lmann was arrested and imprisoned together with his personal secretary Werner Hirsch on the 3rd of March, 1933.  Imprisonment and execution  On the afternoon of the 3rd of March, 1933, eight officers of Police Station 121 arrested Th√§lmann at his self-appointed safehouse, the home of Hans and Martha Kluczynski in Berlin- Charlottenburg. Although the main police informant was a neighbor of the Kluczynskis, Hermann Hilliges,Siehe Eberhard Czichon, Heinz Marohn: Th√§lmann. Ein Report. Berlin 2010, Band 1, S. 683. at least four other people informed the police of the connection between the Kluczynskis and Th√§lmann in the days before the latter's arrest).Ronald Sassning: Th√§lmann, Wehner, Kattner, Mielke. Schwierige Wahrheiten. In: UTOPIE kreativ. Nr. 114 (April 2000), S. 362‚Äì375, S. 364 f. Th√§lmann had used the Kluczynskis' home occasionally for several years, but started fully residing there in January 1933. Although it wasn't among the six illegal residences that the military-political apparatus of the KPD had prepared for Th√§lmann, it was not considered known to the police.Siehe Czichon, Marohn: Th√§lmann. Band 2, S. 717. During imprisonment, Th√§lmann managed to smuggle out detailed descriptions of his treatment in writing: \\"They ordered me to take off my pants and then two men grabbed me by the back of the neck and placed me across a footstool. A uniformed Gestapo officer with a whip of hippopotamus hide in his hand then beat my buttocks with measured strokes. Driven wild with pain I repeatedly screamed at the top of my lungs. Then they held my mouth shut for a while and hit me in the face, and with a whip across the chest and back. I then collapsed, rolled on the floor, always kept my face down and no longer replied to any of their questions.\\" After the German‚ÄìSoviet Non-Aggression Pact and Germany's invasion of Poland of 1939 -- and despite Th√§lmann's loyalty to Stalin during his time leading the KPD -- Moscow pragmatically removed a slogan for the 1939 International Youth Day which read in part, \\"Long live Comrade Th√§lmann!\\" and replaced it with, \\"Long live the wise foreign policy of the Soviet Union, guided by Comrade Stalin's instructions.\\" As it turned out, Th√§lmann's long- time party rival Walter Ulbricht had ignored several requests for help from Th√§lmann's family when the thawing in German‚ÄìSoviet relations could have made a release possible, preferring to let Th√§lmann remain imprisoned. Fellow German Communist, Wilhelm Pieck had managed to escape to the Soviet Union and in July 1936 he issued a statement calling for the release of Th√§lmann: \\"If we succeeded in raising a tremendous storm of protest throughout the world, it will be possible to break down the prison walls and as in the case of Dimitrov, deliver Th√§lmann from the clutches of the Fascist hangmen. The fact that Ernst Th√§lmann has got to spend his fiftieth birthday in the gaols of Hitler-Fascism is an urgent reminder to all the anti-Fascists of the whole world that they must intensify to the utmost their campaign for the release of Th√§lmann and the many thousands of imprisoned victims of the White Terror.\\" However, these attempts at raising publicity for his plight were in vain; during the 1930s, numerous German communists who had been close to Th√§lmann had been murdered in Stalin's camps.Regina Scheer: \\"Im Schatten des Denkmals.\\" Berliner Zeitung. 14 August 2004. Th√§lmann spent over eleven years in solitary confinement. In August 1944, he was transferred from Bautzen prison to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was shot on the 18th August on the personal order of Adolf Hitler.Notizzettel von Heinrich Himmler, Reichsf√ºhrer SS, von einer Besprechung mit Adolf Hitler in der Wolfsschanze, 14. August 1944 im Ausstellungskasten 4/31 in der ehemaligen Effektenkammer des KZ Buchenwald: \\"12. Th√§lmann ist zu exekutieren\\". His body was immediately cremated. Shortly after, the National Socialists claimed in an announcement that, together with Rudolf Breitscheid, Th√§lmann had died in an Allied bombing attack on 23 August.Reiner Orth: Walter Hummelsheim und der Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus.

Th√§lmann's tomb in Berlin In 1935, the former town of Ostheim in Ukraine was renamed Telmanove (Donetsk Oblast). After 1945, Th√§lmann and other leading communists who had been murdered, such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were widely honoured in East Germany, with many schools, streets, factories and the like named after them. Many of these names were changed after German reunification, but streets and squares named after Th√§lmann remain in Berlin, Hamburg, Greifswald and Frankfurt an der Oder. The East German pioneer organisation was named the Ernst Th√§lmann Pioneer Organisation in his memory. Members pledged that \\"Ernst Th√§lmann is my role model ... I promise to learn to work and fight [struggle] as Ernst Th√§lmann teaches\\". Tr∆∞·ªùng THPT Ernst Th√§lmann (Ernst Th√§lmann High School) in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City In the 1950s, a two-part East German film, Ernst Th√§lmann, was produced. In 1972, Cuba named a small island, Cayo Ernesto Thaelmann, after him. One of the main traffic arteries of Soviet Riga was named Ernsta Tƒìlma≈Üa iela after him on completion in 1981; however, soon after Latvia had regained independence in 1991 it was renamed KƒÅrƒºa Ulma≈Üa gatve, after pre-WWII prime minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. In Ho Chi Minh City, the secondary school THPT Ernst Thalmann (Ten L∆° Man) was named after him. The British Communist composer and activist Cornelius Cardew named his Th√§lmann Variations for piano in Th√§lmann's memory. The VEB Ernst Th√§lmann Waffenfabrik, an East German weapons factory in Suhl (formerly Simson), was named after Th√§lmann (until 1990).

It is specifically designed for disruptive inmates who are security risks to other inmates, the prison staff, or the prison itself. It is mostly employed for violations of discipline, such as violence against others, or as a measure of protection for inmates whose safety is threatened by other inmates.Bottos, Shauna. 2007. Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada. According to a 2017 review study, \\"a robust scientific literature has established the negative psychological effects of solitary confinement\\", leading to \\"an emerging consensus among correctional as well as professional, mental health, legal, and human rights organizations to drastically limit the use of solitary confinement.\\" The United Nations considers solitary confinement exceeding 15 days to be torture.  History  Subterranean cells at Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia The practice of solitary confinement traces its origins back to the 19th century when Quakers in Pennsylvania used this method as a substitution for public punishments. Research surrounding the possible psychological and physiological effects of solitary confinement dates back to the 1830s. When the new prison discipline of separate confinement was introduced at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia in 1829, commentators attributed the high rates of mental breakdown to the system of isolating prisoners in their cells. Charles Dickens, who visited the Philadelphia Penitentiary during his travels to America, described the \\"slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body\\". Prison records from the Denmark institute in 1870 to 1920 indicate that staff noticed inmates were exhibiting signs of mental illnesses while in isolation, revealing that the persistent problem has been around for decades. In the twentieth century, Scandinavian countries such as Denmark have extensively used solitary confinement for prisoners in pretrial detention with the stated goal of preventing them from interfering in the investigation. Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik was held in solitary confinement, partly to protect him from other inmates. However, his complaint was partially upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2016. The first comment by the Supreme Court of the United States about solitary confinement's effect on prisoner mental status was made in 1890 (In re Medley 134 U.S. 160). In it the court found that the use of solitary confinement produced reduced mental and physical capabilities. The use of solitary confinement increased greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to avoid spread of the virus in prisons.  Use  The practice is used when a prisoner is considered dangerous to themselves or to others, is suspected of organizing or being engaged in illegal activities outside of the prison, or, as in the case of a prisoner such as a child molester or a witness, is at a high risk of being harmed by other inmates. The latter example is a form of protective custody. Solitary confinement is also the norm in supermax prisons, where prisoners who are deemed dangerous or of high risk are held. By country or region =Australia= Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in Australian English as \\"the Slot\\" or \\"the Pound\\". = United States = =Europe= Solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure for prisoners in Europe was largely reduced or eliminated during the twentieth century. The European Court of Human Rights has three labels for solitary confinement: complete sensory isolation, total social isolation and relative social isolation. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, or CPT, defines solitary confinement as \\"whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately from other prisoners, for example, as a result of court decision, as a disciplinary sanction imposed within the prison system, as a preventive administrative measure or for the protection of the prisoner concerned\\". The CPT \\"considers that solitary confinement should only be imposed in exceptional circumstances, as a last resort and for the shortest possible time\\".Solitary confinement of prisonersExtract from the 21st General Report of the CPT, published in 2011 In Italy, a person sentenced to more than one life sentence is required to serve a period of between 6 months to 3 years in solitary confinement during the daytime only.  United Kingdom  Solitary cells at High Royds Hospital, Menston, West Yorkshire In 2004, only 40 out of 75,000 inmates held in England and Wales were placed in solitary confinement cells. In the United Kingdom, the state has a duty to \\"set the highest standards of care\\" when it limits the liberties of children. Frances Crook is one of many to believe that incarceration and solitary confinement are the harshest forms of possible punishments and \\"should only be taken as a last resort\\". Because children are still mentally developing, incarceration also should not encourage them to commit more violent crimes. The penal system has been cited as failing to protect juveniles in custody. In the United Kingdom, 29 children died in penal custody between 1990 and 2006: \\"Some 41% of the children in custody were officially designated as being vulnerable\\". That is attributed to the fact that isolation and physical restraint are used as the first response to punish them for simple rule infractions. Moreover, Frances Crook argues that these punitive policies not only violate their basic rights but also leave the children mentally unstable and left with illnesses that are often ignored. Overall, the solitary confinement of youth is considered to be counterproductive because the ‚Äúrestrictive environment... and intense regulation of children‚Äù aggravates them, instead of addressing the issue of rehabilitation. Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in British English as \\"the block\\", \\"The Segregation Unit\\" or \\"the cooler\\". = Venezuela = The headquarters for the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) in Plaza Venezuela, Caracas, have an underground detention facility that has been dubbed La Tumba (The Tomb). The facility is located at the place that the underground parking for the Metro Caracas was to be located. The cells are two by three meters that have a cement bed, white walls, security cameras, no windows, and barred doors, with cells aligned next to one another so that there is no interaction between prisoners. Such conditions have caused prisoners to become very ill, but they are denied medical treatment. Bright lights in the cells are kept on so that prisoners lose their sense of time, with the only sounds heard being from the nearby Caracas Metro trains. Those who visit the prisoners are subjected to strip searches by multiple SEBIN personnel. Allegations of torture in La Tumba, specifically white torture, are also common, with some prisoners attempting to commit suicide. Those conditions according to the NGO Justice and Process are intended to make prisoners plead guilty to the crimes that they are accused of.  Effects  There is a scholarly consensus that solitary confinement is seriously harmful, which has led to a growing movement to abolish it. = Psychiatric = Solitary cell at Fort Christiansv√¶rn, United States Virgin Islands Physicians have concluded that for those inmates who enter the prison already diagnosed with a mental illness, the punishment of solitary confinement is extremely dangerous in that the inmates are more susceptible to exacerbating the symptoms. Research indicates that the psychological effects of solitary confirement may encompass \\"anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis.\\" A main issue with isolating prisoners who are known to have mental illnesses is that it prevents the inmates from ever possibly recovering. Instead, many \\"mentally ill prisoners decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization.\\" It is also noted that if a prisoner is restrained from interacting with the individuals they wish to have contact with they exhibit similar effects. The lack of human contact, and the sensory deprivation that often go with solitary confinement, can have a severe negative impact on a prisoner's mental state that may lead to certain mental illnesses such as depression, permanent or semi-permanent changes to brain physiology, an existential crisis, and death. Direct link to audio file. A 2013 systematic review published in Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica concluded that solitary confinement was \\"associated with negative effects on mental health.\\" Self- harm According to a March 2014 article in American Journal of Public Health, \\"Inmates in jails and prisons attempt to harm themselves in many ways, resulting in outcomes ranging from trivial to fatal.\\" Self harm was seven times higher among the inmates where seven percent of the jail population was confined in isolation. Fifty-three percent of all acts of self harm took place in jail. \\"Self-harm\\" included, but was not limited to, cutting, banging heads, self-amputations of fingers or testicles. These inmates were in bare cells, and were prone to jumping off their beds head first into the floor or even biting through their veins in their wrists. A main issue within the prison system and solitary confinement is the high number of inmates who turn to self-harm. One study has shown that \\"inmates ever assigned to solitary confinement were 3.2 times as likely to commit an act of self-harm per 1,000 days at some time during their incarceration as those never assigned to solitary.\\" The study has concluded that there is a direct correlation between inmates who self-harm and inmates that are punished into solitary confinement. Many of the inmates look to self-harm as a way to \\"avoid the rigors of solitary confinement.\\" Mental health professionals ran a series of tests that ultimately concluded that \\"self-harm and potentially fatal self-harm associated with solitary confinement was higher independent of mental illness status and age group.\\" =Physical= Solitary confinement has been reported to cause hypertension, headaches and migraines, profuse sweating, dizziness, and heart palpitations. Many inmates also experience extreme weight loss due to digestion complications and abdominal pain. Many of these symptoms are due to the intense anxiety and sensory deprivation. Inmates can also experience neck and back pain and muscle stiffness due to long periods of little to no physical activity. These symptoms often worsen with repeated visit to solitary confinement. =Social= Some sociologists argue that prisons create a unique social environment that do not allow inmates to create strong social ties outside or inside of prison life. Men are more likely to become frustrated, and therefore more mentally unstable when keeping up with family outside of prisons. Extreme forms of solitary confinement and isolation can affect the larger society as a whole. The resocialization of newly released inmates who spent an unreasonable amount of time in solitary confinement and thus suffer from serious mental illnesses is a huge dilemma for society to face. The effects of isolation unfortunately do not stop once the inmate has been released. After release from segregated housing, psychological effects have the ability to sabotage a prisoner's potential to successfully return to the community and adjust back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô life. The inmates are often startled easily, and avoid crowds and public places. They seek out confined small spaces because the public areas overwhelm their sensory stimulation. Criticism =Ineffectiveness= In 2002, the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America, chaired by John Joseph Gibbons and Nicholas Katzenbach found that: \\"The increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release.\\" Solitary confinement has been traditionally used as a behavioral reform of isolating prisoners physically, emotionally and mentally in order to control and change inmate behavior. Recently arrived inmates are more likely to violate prison rules than their inmate counterparts and thus are more likely to be put in solitary confinement. Additionally, individual attributes and environmental factors combine to increase an inmate's likelihood of being put into solitary confinement. =Torture= Solitary confinement is considered to be a form of psychological torture with measurable long-term physiological effects when the period of confinement is longer than a few weeks or is continued indefinitely. . This is the study of 57 Yugoslav POWs referenced in Atul Gawande's 2009 New Yorker article. In October 2011, UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. M√©ndez, told the General Assembly's third committee, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs, that the practice could amount to torture: \\"Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.\\" In November 2014. the United Nations Committee Against Torture stated that full isolation for 22‚Äì23 hours a day in super-maximum security prisons is unacceptable.http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf The United Nations have also banned the use of solitary confinement for longer than 15 days. =Political use= Solitary cells at Museum of Underground Prisoners, used by the government of Mandatory Palestine Solitary confinement has been used in brainwashing efforts and against political dissidents in countries such as South Africa and Myanmar. In immigration detention centers, reports have surfaced concerning its use against detainees in order to keep those knowledgeable about their rights away from other detainees. In the prison-industrial complex itself, reports of solitary confinement as punishment in work labor prisons have also summoned much criticism. One issue prison reform activists have fought against is the use of Security Housing Units (extreme forms of solitary confinement). They argue that they do not rehabilitate inmates but rather serve only to cause inmates psychological harm. Further reports of placing prisoners into solitary confinement based on sexual orientation, race and religion have been an ongoing but very contentious subject in the last century. =Access to healthcare= Research has shown that the routine features of prison can make huge demands on limited coping resources. After prison many ex-convicts with mental illness do not receive adequate treatment for their mental health issues, because health services turn them away. This is caused by restrictive policies or lack of resources for treating the formerly incarcerated individual. In a study focusing on women and adolescent men, those who had health insurance, received mental health services, or had a job were less likely to return to jail. However, very few of the 1,000 individuals in this study received support from mental health services. =Ethics= Treating mentally ill patients by sentencing them into solitary confinement has captured the attention of human rights experts who conclude that \\"solitary confinement may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\\" that violates rights specifically targeting cruel, inhuman treatment. Health care professionals and organizations recognize the fact that solitary confinement is not ethical, yet the segregating treatment fails to come to a halt. \\"Experience demonstrates that prisons can operate safely and securely without putting inmates with mental illness in typical conditions of segregation.\\" Despite this and medical professionals' obligations, segregation policies have not changed because mental health clinics believe that \\"isolation is necessary for security reasons.\\" In fact, many believe that it is ethical for physicians to help those in confinement but that the physicians should also be trying to stop the abuse. If they cannot do so they are expected to undertake public advocacy. Legality The legality of solitary confinement has been frequently challenged over the past sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed. Much of the legal discussion concerning solitary confinement has centered on whether or not it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While international law has generally begun to discourage solitary confinement's use in penal institutions, opponents of solitary confinement have been less successful at challenging it within the United States legal system. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other UN bodies have stated that the solitary confinement (physical and social isolation of 22‚Äì24 hours per day for 1 day or more) of young people under age 18, for any duration, constitutes cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. The documented psychological effects led one Texas judge in a 2001 suit to rule that \\"Solitary confinement units are virtual incubators of psychoses‚Äîseeding illness in otherwise healthy inmates and exacerbating illness in those already suffering from mental infirmities.\\"Ruiz v. Johnson, 154 F.Supp.2d 975 (S.D.Tex.2001) In fact, as of 2016, there have been thirty-five U.S. Supreme Court cases petitioning solitary confinement. =International law= Throughout the twentieth century, the United Nations' stance on solitary confinement has become increasingly oppositional. International law has reflected this change, and UN monitoring has led to a major reduction of solitary confinement. In 1949, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Although the Declaration is non-binding, the basic human rights outlined within it have served as the foundation of customary international law. The relevance of the Declaration to solitary confinement is found in Article 5, which states that \\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN.org) Thus, if solitary confinement is believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, then the country practicing solitary confinement is violating the provisions set by the UDHR. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), effective 1976, reiterates the fifth article of the UDHR; Article 7 of the ICCPR identically states, \\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\" Because the ICCPR is a legally binding agreement, any nation that is signatory to the covenant would be violating international law if it practiced torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. At the time that the UDHR and ICCPR were adopted, solitary confinement was not yet believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Its practice, therefore, was not believed to violate international law. This changed, however, after the UN definition of torture was outlined in detail in the 1984 Convention Against Torture (CAT); Article 1.1 of the CAT states that torture is \\"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person\\" for any reason such as obtaining information or punishment, and Article 16 of the same convention prohibits \\"other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\". Based on these provisions, many members of the UN began to believe that solitary confinement's detrimental psychological effects could, indeed, constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, if not, torture. In the years following the CAT, UN representatives \\"have publicly decried the use of solitary confinement as a violation of the CAT and ICCPR,\\" as well as the UDHR. In more recent years, UN representatives have strengthened their efforts to stop solitary confinement from being used worldwide. The urgency with which representatives have undertaken these efforts is largely due to the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture, Manfred Nowak and Juan M√©ndez. Nowak and M√©ndez have both \\"repeatedly unequivocally stated that prolonged solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture\\". Nowak and M√©ndez have been especially critical of long-term or prolonged solitary confinement, which they define as lasting fifteen days or more. Their authority and explicit characterization of solitary confinement as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment has led the UN to include long-term to indefinite solitary confinement in the group of practices that violate the provisions outlined in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT. Solitary confinement lasting for a short period of time, however, is allowed under international law when used as a last resort, though Nowak, Mendez, and many other UN representatives believe that the practice should be abolished altogether. According to a law review article by Elizabeth Vasiliades, America's detention system is far below the basic minimum standards for treatment of prisoners under international law and has caused an international human rights concern: \\"U.S. solitary confinement practices contravene international treaty law, violate established international norms, and do not represent sound foreign policy.\\" Opposition and protests The 2013 California prisoner hunger strike saw approximately 29,000 prisoners protesting conditions. This statewide hunger strike reaching 2/3 of California's prisons began with the organizing of inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison. On 11 July 2011, prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison began a hunger strike to \\"protest torturous conditions in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) there...\\" and to advocate for procedural and policy changes like the termination of the \\"debriefing process\\" which forces prisoners \\"to name themselves or others as gang members as a condition of access to food or release from isolation\\". Nearly 7,000 inmates throughout the California prison system stood in solidarity with these Pelican State Bay prisoners in 2011 by also refusing their food. Also in solidarity with the 2011 Pelican Bay prisoners on strike is the Bay Area coalition of grassroots organizations known as the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity coalition. This coalition has aided the prisoners in their strike by providing a legal support force for their negotiations with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and by creating and running a media based platform to raise support and awareness for the strikers and their demands among the general public. Solitary confinement has served as a site of inspiration for protest-organizing against its use in and outside of prisons and conversely, as a response tactic for prisons to react to the protest-organizing of its prisoners. In March 2014, authorities at the Northwest Detention Center in Washington relegated multiple detainees to solitary confinement units after their participation in protests for the improvement of conditions within the facility and in solidarity with activist organizing against deportation escalations outside of the facility. Alternatives and reform =Possible alternatives= Scrutiny of super-maximum security prisons and the institutionalization of solitary confinement is accompanied by suggestions for alternative methods. One alternative is to administer medical treatment for disorderly inmates who display signs of mental illness. The Correction Department of New York City implemented plans to transfer mentally ill inmates to an internal facility for further help rather than solitary confinement in 2013. Dora B. Schriro, correction commissioner, said that treatment would help turn a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù policy into a program to promote success in jail and the outside world. A second alternative is to deal with long-term inmates by promoting familial and social relationships through the encouragement of visitations which may help boost morale. Carl Kummerlowe believes that familial counseling and support may be useful for inmates nearing the end of a long-term sentence that may otherwise exhibit signs of aggression. This alternative would help inmates cope with extreme long term sentences in prisons such as those harbored in Pelican Bay. A third alternative would involve regular reevaluation and accelerated transition of isolated inmates back to prison population to help curb long-term effects of solitary confinement. These alternative methods suggest a more restorative justice approach to handling high-security offenders. =Recent reform= Many states such as Colorado, Mississippi, and Maine have implemented plans to reduce use of supermax prisons and solitary confinement and have begun to show signs of reform. Joseph Ponte, Corrections Commissioner of Maine, cut supermax prison population by half. Colorado has announced reforms to limit the use of solitary confinement in prisons following a study that showed significant levels of confinement and isolation in prisons. Washington has also showed signs of decreased use of solitary confinement, low segregation of overall prison population, and emphasis on alternative methods. Women  Studies have shown the effects of solitary confinement to be detrimental to all inmates, but solitary confinement of women has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Rates for women in the United States are roughly comparable to those for men, and about 20% of prisoners are in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career.

There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The housing tenure of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale public housing, to owner occupancy within what is legally a condominium (strata title or commonhold), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see leasehold estate). Terminology =\\"Flat\\" vs \\"apartment\\"= Both words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and bathroom. In some parts of the world, the word apartment refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word flat means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house. In other places the terms are interchangeable. The term apartment is favored in North America (although in some cities flat is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor). In the UK, the term apartment is more usual in professional real estate and architectural circles where otherwise the term flat is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment). In some countries, the word \\"unit\\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business suites. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \\"This building has three units\\" or \\"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\\", but not \\"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\\". Some buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors. =By housing tenure= Low-income housing of the St. James Town neighborhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada Housing Development Board flats in Punggol, Singapore (Condominium, public housing, owner-occupancy, etc.) Tenement law refers to the feudal basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \\"Messuage or Tenement\\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property. In the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a housing cooperative, in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a condominium, whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older houses are sometimes divided into apartments. The word apartment denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium. In England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the freehold of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease. This arrangement is commonly known as a \\"share of freehold\\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible. =By size of the unit= Bachelor apartment, one-bedroom, etc.; see below. =By size of the building= High-rise buildings in the English Bay area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada A low-rise building of flats above shops in F√°tima, Portugal Apartment buildings are multi-story buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an apartment building, apartment complex, flat complex, block of flats, tower block, high-rise or, occasionally, mansion block (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a residential tower, apartment tower, or block of flats in Australia. A high-rise building is defined by its height differently in various jurisdictions. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper, although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper. High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the elevator (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their structural system usually is made of reinforced concrete and steel. A low-rise building and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. Emporis defines a low-rise as \\"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\\" The city of Toronto defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid- rise%20study.pdf =By country= An apartment house in Kuopio, Finland In American English, the distinction between rental apartments and condominiums is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the cooperative apartment building (or \\"co-op\\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S. In British English the usual word is \\"flat\\", but apartment is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as Belgravia and Hampstead. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a tenement, a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere. In India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts. Australian English and New Zealand English traditionally used the term flat (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms unit or apartment. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even semi-detached houses. In Australia, the terms \\"unit\\", \\"flat\\" and \\"apartment\\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \\"apartments\\", as the term \\"flats\\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it. In South African English, an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building. In Malaysian English, flat often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,Categories of Homes in Malaysia. while apartment is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums. In Japanese English loanwords (Wasei-eigo), the term apartment (apaato) is used for lower-income housing and mansion (manshon) is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment. This use of the term mansion has a parallel with British English's mansion block, a term denoting prestigious apartment buildings from the Victorian and Edwardian, which usually feature an ornate facade and large, high-ceilinged flats with period features. Danchi is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as public housing by government authorities. See Housing in Japan. Types and characteristics =Studio apartment= Studio apartment in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet The smallest self- contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US and Canada, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \\"one room\\" (wonroom) refers to a studio apartment. A bedsit is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed- sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a House in multiple occupation. =Garden apartment (US)= Merriam-Webster defines a garden apartment in American English as \\"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\\" The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a townhouse: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack elevators. However, the first \\"garden apartment\\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.New York City Garden Apartments retrieved 17 October 2009Hogan, Meghan. Eden in the City Preservation Magazine online, 2006-09-22. Article on preservation of early United States garden apartment buildings. Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under each apartment. The interior grounds are often landscaped. =Garden flat (UK)= Georgian terraced townhouses. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the use of \\"garden flat\\" in British English as \\"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \\"Garden flat\\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large Georgian or Victorian townhouse was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as an area, often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \\"tradesman's entrance\\" via the area stairs. This \\"lower ground floor\\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \\"garden flat\\". One American term for this arrangement is an English basement. =Basement apartment= Generally on the lowest floor of a building. =Secondary suite= When part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self- contained dwelling may be known as an \\"in-law apartment\\", \\"annexe\\", or \\"granny flat\\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \\"basement suites\\". Another term is an \\"accessory dwelling unit\\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds. =Salon apartment= Salon apartment is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in Belgrade and in certain towns in Yugoslavia in the first decades of the 20th century.Alfireviƒá ƒêorƒëe, Simonoviƒá Alfireviƒá San—òa. ‚Äû'Salon' apartment in Serbia between the two world wars: Reassessing the rationale behind the term‚Äù. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Beograd), Iss. 44 (2017), pp. 7-13. () The structure of the apartments included centrally located anteroom with a combined function of the dining room and one or more salon areas. Most of these apartments were built in Belgrade (Serbia), along with the first examples of apartments popularly named 'salon apartments', with the concept of spatial and functional organization later spreading to other larger urban centers in Yugoslavia.Kekoviƒá, A., Petroviƒá, M. (2011) Functional zones of flats in the period of Art Moderne in Ni≈° (1930-1941). Facta universitatis - series: Architecture and Civil Engineering, vol. 9, br. 3, str. 495-499 =Maisonette= Maisonette (a corruption of , French for \\"little house\\" and originally the spelling in English as well, but which has since fallen into disuse) has no strict definition, but the OED suggests \\"a part of a residential building which is occupied separately, usually on more than one floor and having its own outside entrance.\\" It differs from a flat in having, usually, more than one floor, with a staircase internal to the dwelling leading from the entrance floor to the upper (or, in some cases, lower) other floor. This is a very common arrangement in much post-war British housing (especially, but not exclusively, public housing) serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed. It also allows for apartments, even when accessed by a corridor, to have windows on both sides of the building. A maisonette could encompass Tyneside flats, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey terrace. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat. \\"Maisonette\\" could also stretch to cottage flats, also known as 'four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland. =One dwelling with two storeys= Plan of scissor flats. The vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \\"flat\\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \\"maisonette\\", as above. Some housing in the United Kingdom, both public and private, was designed as scissor section flats. On a grander level, penthouses may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury. Two storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \\"townhouses\\" in some countries (though not usually in Britain). =Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings= A triple-decker in New England. Dingbat MaryJane \\"Duplex\\" refers to two separate units with a common demising wall or floor-ceiling assembly. Duplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate‚Äîreferred to as 'duplex', indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. Groups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.). Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See Three-decker (house) In the United States, regional forms have developed, see vernacular architecture. In Milwaukee, a Polish flat or \\"raised cottage\\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings. In the Sun Belt, boxy small apartment buildings called dingbats, often with carports below, sprang up from the 1950s. In the United Kingdom the term duplex is rare, but sometimes used as a modern, upmarket alternative for a maisonette. Buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are instead known as semi-detached, or colloquially a semi. This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion. =Loft apartment= The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago This type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people squatting. These loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success. An industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a loft, although some modern lofts are built by design. =Penthouse= An apartment located on the top floor of a high- rise apartment building. =Communal apartment= In Russia, a communal apartment (¬´–∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∞–ª–∫–∞¬ª) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre- Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis. =Serviced apartment= Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India A \\"serviced apartment\\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self- contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a hotel. Like guests semi- permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired. A feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \\"lock-up and leave\\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either freehold or leasehold. =Facilities= Laundry Room Apartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with his own furniture. Serviced apartments, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and kitchen utensils, and maid service. Laundry facilities may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental leases often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment. On or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of mailboxes are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the mail carrier. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment. =Various= Mid-rise One-plus-five style apartment buildings in Austin, Texas. In more urban areas, apartments close to the downtown area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or public transportation. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas. Moving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two- bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.) Small apartments often have only one entrance. Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby. In many American cities, the One-plus-five style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the International Building Code; these buildings typically feature four wood- framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs. Historical examples =Pre-Columbian Americas= The Puebloan peoples of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century. In the Classic Period Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards. Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole, in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman insulae. =Ancient Rome= Ostia In ancient Rome, the insulae (singular insula) were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of Romans (the plebs) dwelled. The floor at ground level was used for tabernas, shops and businesses, with living space on the higher floors. Insulae in Rome and other imperial cities reached up to ten or more stories,Gregory S. Aldrete: Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia, 2004, , p.79f. some with more than 200 stairs.Martial, Epigrams, 27 Several emperors, beginning with Augustus (r. 30 BC ‚Äì 14 AD), attempted to establish limits of 20‚Äì25 m for multi-storey buildings, but met with only limited success.Strabo, 5.3.7Alexander G. McKay: R√∂mische H√§user, Villen und Pal√§ste, Feldmeilen 1984, p. 231 The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper stories were rented out to the lower classes. Surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyri indicate that seven-story buildings even existed in provincial towns, such as in 3rd century Hermopolis in Roman Egypt.Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke, C√§cilia Fluck, G√ºnter Vittmann: √Ñgyptens sp√§te Bl√ºte. Die R√∂mer am Nil, Mainz 2004, , p.29 =Ancient and medieval Egypt= During the medieval Arabic-Islamic period, the Egyptian capital of Fustat (Old Cairo) housed many high-rise residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. In the 10th century, Al-Muqaddasi described them as resembling minarets, and stated that the majority of Fustat's population lived in these multi-storey apartment buildings, each one housing more than 200 people. In the 11th century, Nasir Khusraw described some of these apartment buildings rising up to fourteen stories, with roof gardens on the top storey complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigating them. By the 16th century, the current Cairo also had high-rise apartment buildings, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. =Yemen= Mudbrick-made tower houses in Shibam, Wadi Hadhramaut, Yemen High-rise apartment buildings were built in the Yemeni city of Shibam in the 16th century. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud bricks, but about 500 of them are tower houses, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two apartments.Old Walled City of Shibam, UNESCO World Heritage Centre Shibam has been called \\"Manhattan of the desert\\". Some of them were over high, thus being the tallest mudbrick apartment buildings in the world to this day. =Ancient China= The Hakka people in southern China adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible, in the form of Weilongwu (Âõ¥ÈæôÂ±ã) and Tulou (ÂúüÊ•º). The latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings, between three and five stories high and housing up to eighty families. Current examples =England= In London, by the time of the 2011 census, 52 per cent of all homes were flats.Housing in London - The evidence base for The London Housing strategy - December 2012 Many of these were built as Georgian or Victorian houses and subsequently divided up. Many others were built as council flats. Many tower blocks were built after the Second World War. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or housing estates. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \\"flat above a shop\\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house‚Äîeven if this was a small terraced house‚Äîwhile the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room. During the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a in the capital. The traditional London town house was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular. The first mansion flats in England were: *Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and James Knowles designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out Victoria Street at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the Victoria Palace Theatre. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \\"houses\\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included Sir Arthur Sullivan and Lord Alfred Tennyson, whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, 1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea, developed most of the mansion blocks on Prince of Wales Drive, London. *Albert Hall Mansions, designed by Richard Norman Shaw in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success. =Scotland= Tenement in Edinburgh, Scotland (1893) Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882 In Scotland, the term \\"tenement\\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older retirees, and by absentee landlords, often for rental to students after they leave halls of residence managed by their institution. The National Trust for Scotland Tenement House (Glasgow) is a historic house museum offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago. During the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in Scotland's industrial cities, although they were very common in the Old Town in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of sandstone or granite, Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \\"back-to-back\\" terraces of brick.) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a close or stair‚Äîboth referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in Aberdeen in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \\"back green\\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \\"factor\\". In Glasgow, where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large extended families would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The Glasgow Corporation made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the Cleland Testimonial were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following World War I when Housing Acts sought to provide \\"homes fit for heroes\\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as Knightswood, were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a slum clearance programme initiated to clear areas such as the Calton and the Garngad. After World War II, more ambitious plans, known as the Bruce Plan, were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of New Towns.Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M. The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow. London: Penguin Books, 1990 Houses and Mansions: Domestic Architecture of Glasgow's South Side 2008-06-03 Again, economic considerations meant that many of the planned \\"New Town\\" amenities were never built in these areas. These housing estates, known as \\"schemes\\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as Castlemilk, were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and public houses (\\"deserts with windows\\", as Billy Connolly once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition‚Äîthe Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable‚Äîbut fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement. In 1970 a team from Strathclyde University demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms. The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the Old Swan Corner, Pollokshaws. Thereafter, Housing Action Areas were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \\"stone cleaning\\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \\"grey\\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980sGlasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975 and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \\"universally admired architectural\\" style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a ¬£96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building Wednesday 31 May 2006. =United States= The Chestnut Hill, an 1899 apartment house in Newton, Massachusetts Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York Tenement buildings in Manhattan's Lower East Side In 1839, the first New York City tenement was built, and soon became breeding grounds for outlaws, juvenile delinquents, and organized crime. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their price gouging rent. How the Other Half Lives notes one tenement district: > Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason.

He knew intuitively what to expect. The result > showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly. Many campaigners, such as Upton Sinclair and Jacob Riis, pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the New York State Tenement House Act was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President Harry S. Truman signed the Housing Act of 1949 to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor. The Dakota (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements. Some significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s. Among them were groundbreaking designs in the 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments (1951), New Century Guild (1961), Marina City (1964) and Lake Point Tower (1968). In the United States, \\"tenement\\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \\"walk-ups\\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \\"dingbat\\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa√ßades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath. Property classes In the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help investors and real estate brokers speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows: Class A properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. White-collar workers live in them and are usually renters by choice. Class B properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity. Class C properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \\"for life\\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises. Class D properties house many Section 8 (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas. =Canada= Apartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as condominiums instead of apartments‚Äîboth are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability. The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010. =Australia= Gold Coast in Queensland is dominated by apartments. The Canterbury in St Kilda, Victoria is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia. One Central Park, Sydney, which features vertical hanging gardens and sustainable green design Apartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a body corporate or \\"owners corporation\\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through strata title. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply loan to value ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the big four Australian banks will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings. In Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for DINKY, yuppies, university students and more recently empty nesters, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In Melbourne and Sydney apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers. Australia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. Terrace houses were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the Parliament of Queensland as part of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885. The earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of Sydney and Melbourne as the response to fast rising land values‚Äìboth cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in Potts Point, and The Canterbury Flats in St Kilda. Melbourne Mansions on Collins Street, Melbourne (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self- contained apartment buildings are in the St Kilda area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914‚Äîthe oldest surviving buildings contained flats). Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives. During the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and South Yarra), Sydney (particularly in areas such as Potts Point, Darlinghust and Kings Cross) and in Brisbane (in areas such as New Farm, Fortitude Valley and Spring Hill). Post-World War II, with the Australian Dream apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups. The main exceptions were Sydney and the Gold Coast, Queensland where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views (Sydney Harbour and beaches such as Bondi) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings. In other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to public housing. Public housing in Australia was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the Housing Commission of Victoria) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included Fitzroy, Flemington, Collingwood, Carlton, Richmond and Prahran. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like Redfern. In the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in Brisbane (along the Brisbane River) and Perth (along the Swan River). In Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the gentrification of the inner city, a fashion became New York \\"loft\\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of adaptive reuse extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as Teneriffe, Queensland and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as Ultimo. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies (Postcode 3000), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the Melbourne 2030 planning policy. Urban renewal areas like Docklands, Southbank, St Kilda Road and Port Melbourne are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne. Despite their size, other smaller cities including Canberra, Darwin, Townsville, Cairns, Newcastle, Wollongong, Adelaide and Geelong have begun building apartments in the 2000s. Today, residential buildings Eureka Tower and Q1 are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in inner city areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs. Some Australian cities, such as Gold Coast, Queensland, are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers. =Yugoslavia= The development of residential architecture in Yugoslavia during the period of socialism had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \\"pack\\" as many residential units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.Lojanica, V., Ristiƒá, J., Meƒëo, V. (2011) Multi‚Äìfamily Housing Architecture in Belgrade: Models and Development, in Proceedings from the International Conference on Architecture and Design INTERCAD. Vienna: Technical University, pp. 5-13. As a consequence of these aspirations, the following concepts emerged, making the core of housing research: (a) apartments with an extended circulation area, (b) apartments with a central sanitary core, (c) apartments with a circular connection and (d) apartments with extended perspectives (\\"an enfilade‚Äù).Alfireviƒá ƒêorƒëe, Simonoviƒá Alfireviƒá Sanja. ‚Äû‚ÄôSocialist Apartment‚Äô in Yugoslavia: Paradigm or Tendency?‚Äù.

The process of humanizing housing was not characteristic only in the Yugoslav context; similar ideas also appeared in other socialist countries of that period, as in the example of pre-fabricated housing construction in the Soviet Union (Khrushchyovka), Czechoslovakia (Panel√°k), Hungary (Panelh√°z) and East Germany (Plattenbau).Jovanoviƒá J., Grbiƒá J., Petroviƒá, D.

Nolita is situated in Lower Manhattan, bounded on the north by Houston Street, on the east by the Bowery, on the south roughly by Broome Street, and on the west by Lafayette Street. It lies east of SoHo, south of NoHo, west of the Lower East Side, and north of Little Italy and Chinatown.\\"Neighborhood Profile: Nolita & Little Italy\\" on the New York magazine website History and description The neighborhood was long regarded as part of Little Italy, but has lost its recognizable Italian character in recent decades because of rapidly rising rents. The Feast of San Gennaro, dedicated to Saint Januarius (\\"pope of Naples\\"), is held in the neighborhood every year following Labor Day, on Mulberry Street between Houston and Grand Streets. The feast, as recreated on Elizabeth Street between Prince and Houston Streets, was featured in the film The Godfather Part II. In the second half of the 1990s, the neighborhood saw an influx of yuppies and an explosion of expensive retail boutiques and restaurants and bars. After unsuccessful tries to pitch it as part of SoHo, real estate promoters and others came up with several different names for consideration for this newly upscale neighborhood. The name that stuck, as documented in an article on May 5, 1996 in the New York Times City Section debating various monikers for the newly trendy area, was Nolita, an abbreviation for North of Little Italy. This name follows the portmanteau pattern started by SoHo (South of Houston Street) and TriBeCa (Triangle Below Canal Street). The neighborhood includes St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, at the intersection of Mulberry, Mott, and Prince Streets, which opened in 1815 and was rebuilt in 1868 after a fire., p.42 The cornerstone was laid on June 8, 1809.

He worked as Tony Blair's spokesman and campaign director (1994‚Äì1997), then as Downing Street Press Secretary (1997‚Äì2000) for Blair, who was then Labour Prime Minister. He then became Downing Street Director of Communications and spokesman for the Labour Party (2000‚Äì2003). He returned as campaign director for Blair's third election win in 2005. In the run-up to the Iraq War, Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the \\"September Dossier\\" in September 2002 and the \\"Iraq Dossier\\" (nicknamed \\"Dodgy Dossier\\") in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over possible weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq, and were criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Campbell was directly accused by the media of 'sexing up' the intelligence case, but was cleared by a number of inquiries. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered on Campbell's orders to be consistent with a speech given by George W. Bush and statements by other United States officials. He is the editor at large of The New European and chief interviewer for GQ magazine. He continues to act as a consultant strategist and as an ambassador for Time To Change and other mental health charities. He was an adviser to the People's Vote campaign, demanding a public vote on the final Brexit deal. Since his work for Blair, Campbell has continued to act as a freelance advisor to a number of governments and political parties, including the Prime Minister of Albania.On Brexit, Trump, trust and whither politics , 29 April 2017, Retrieved 8 May 2017. He published his sixteenth book in 2020. Early life Campbell was born on 25 May 1957 in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, son of a Scottish veterinary surgeon, Donald Campbell, and his wife Elizabeth. Campbell's parents had moved to Keighley when his father became a partner in a local veterinary practice. Donald was a Gaelic-speaker from the island of Tiree; his wife was from Ayrshire. Campbell grew up with two older brothers, Donald and Graeme, and a younger sister, Elizabeth. He attended Bradford Grammar School for a short period of time, followed by City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied modern languages, French and German, for which he received an upper second (2:1). Campbell is an Emeritus Professor in Media at Cambridge University. In the late 1970s, Campbell spent time teaching in a secondary school in Nice as part of his academic degree course. While hitchhiking back to the city from Aix-en-Provence, he learned of the Belgian singer Jacques Brel's death and shared stories with the Belgian lorry driver who had picked him up, leading to a lifelong interest in Brel's music. After leaving university Campbell spent some months busking, as well as training as a roulette dealer at the Golden Nugget Casino on Shaftesbury Avenue, before being accepted as a trainee reporter with the Mirror Group Newspapers. His first published work was Inter- City Ditties, his winning entry to a readers' competition in Forum, the journalistic counterpart to Penthouse magazine. This led to a lengthy stint writing pieces for the magazine with such titles as \\"Busking with Bagpipes\\" and \\"The Riviera Gigolo\\", written in a style calculated to lead readers at the time to believe they were descriptions of his own sexual exploits. As part of the Mirror Group training scheme Campbell spent a year at a local weekly paper and he quickly became the sports editor at the Tavistock Times, writing a column called 'Campbell's Corner'. It was while he was at the Tavistock Times he met his partner Fiona Millar, with whom he has three children; two sons (born November 1987 and July 1989) and a daughter, comedian Grace Campbell (born May 1994).10 O'Clock Live, 8 February 2012 However, his first significant contribution to the news pages was coverage of the Penlee lifeboat disaster in December 1981, while a trainee on the Plymouth-based Sunday Independent, then owned by Mirror Group Newspapers. National newspapers In 1982 Campbell moved to the London office of the Daily Mirror, Fleet Street's sole remaining big-circulation supporter of the Labour Party. He became a political correspondent, then in 1986 moving to Today, a full-colour tabloid newspaper which was at the time trying to turn leftward, where he worked as a news editor. His rapid rise and its accompanying stress led to alcohol abuse.\\"Cracking Up\\". BBC Two television documentary written and presented by Alastair Campbell. Broadcast Sunday, 12 October 2008. =Alcoholism and depression= While accompanying Neil Kinnock's tour of Scotland in 1986 he began to display increasingly erratic behaviour, including dumping his hire car in the Rosyth Dockyard. He continued on that day, following Kinnock on to Perth, Falkirk and finally Hamilton where he had a nervous breakdown and was arrested by two Special Branch detectives. Police contacted his partner and following her calls to friends in Scotland the police let a family friend take Campbell to Ross Hall Hospital, a private BMI hospital in Glasgow where she and her father visited him. Over the next five days as an in-patient he was given medication to calm him, and he realised that he had an alcohol problem after seeing a psychiatrist. Campbell said that from that day onwards he counted each day that he did not drink alcohol, and did not stop counting until he had reached thousands. Campbell returned to England, preferring to stay with friends near Cheltenham, rather than return to London (and his partner) where he did not feel safe. His condition continued with a phase of depression, and he was reluctant to seek further medical help. He eventually cooperated with treatment from his family doctor. =Return to work= Campbell's first son was born in 1987. He returned to the Daily Mirror, where he eventually became political editor. He was a close adviser to Neil Kinnock, going on holiday with the Kinnocks, and worked closely with Mirror publisher Robert Maxwell. Shortly after Maxwell drowned in November 1991, Campbell punched The Guardian journalist Michael White after White joked about \\"Captain Bob, Bob, Bob...bobbing\\" in the Atlantic Ocean, referring to where the tycoon's body had been recovered. Campbell later put this down to stress over uncertainty as to whether he and his colleagues would lose their jobs. After leaving the Mirror in 1993, Campbell became political editor of Today. He was working there when Labour leader John Smith died in 1994. Campbell was a well- known face and helped to interview the three candidates for Labour Party leader; it later became known he had already formed links with Tony Blair. Politics and government LSE series 'From Kennedy to Blair,' 7 July 2003 Shortly after Tony Blair was elected as Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, Campbell left Today to become Blair's press secretary. Having recovered and become teetotal, he told Blair about his alcoholism, which Blair did not see as a problem. In his autobiography, Blair would later reveal that Campbell had coined the name \\"New Labour\\" and described Campbell as a \\"genius\\". Campbell wrote the speech that led to the party's review of Clause IV and the birth of \\"New Labour\\". In addition to being press spokesman, Campbell was Blair's speechwriter and chief strategist. He oversaw new co-ordination and rebuttal systems which gave birth to a communications machine which became both feared and respected, and the model for modern communications in politics and business. He earned a reputation for ruthless news management which made him many enemies in the media. But even the Conservatives conceded they were partly defeated by their inability to find someone to match him. Campbell played an important role in the run-up to the 1997 general election, working with Peter Mandelson to co-ordinate Labour's successful election campaign. He also worked hard to win support from the national media for the Labour Party, particularly from newspapers that for many years had been anti-Labour. By March 1997, many of the leading newspapers‚Äîincluding The Sun, once a staunch Thatcherite paper; had declared their support for Labour. Campbell moved into government when Labour won the general election in May 1997 and served as the Prime Minister's chief press secretary until 2000. In government, he implemented many radical changes to both procedure and operational management. He persuaded Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler that government communications had to be modernised, and the government set up the Mountfield Review. He created a Strategic Communications Unit which gave Downing Street the power to co-ordinate all government activity, using what became known as \\"the grid\\" as its main apparatus. He set up a rapid rebuttal unit similar to the one he had used in opposition. He put Downing Street briefings on record for the first time, and although he was only identified as \\"The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman\\", he became one of the most high-profile and written about figures in British politics, earning the epithet \\"the real deputy Prime Minister\\". He opened briefings to the foreign media, among a raft of modernisation and efficiency strategies he introduced. BBC documentary maker Michael Cockerell produced a full-length documentary about Campbell's media operation, News From Number Ten, which Cockerell said attracted more coverage than any of the other films he made. Campbell attacked the news media for their obsession with him, and eventually began to pull back from frontline work and delegated direct briefing of the media to others, but, if anything, his profile continued to grow. He then moved to the post of Prime Minister's Director of Communications which gave him a strategic role in overseeing government communications. He was sponsored by US President George W. Bush to complete the London Marathon in aid of leukaemia research charity, Bloodwise. Campbell was part of Tony Blair's core team that conducted the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and he has been honoured by several Irish universities for his role in the peace process. He became a close friend of, among others, Martin McGuinness, and attended his funeral in 2017. It emerged McGuinness was helping Campbell with a novel which had an IRA active service unit as part of the plot. He was seconded to overhaul the communications of NATO during the Kosovo crisis, when US President Bill Clinton feared NATO was losing the propaganda war against the Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá regime. The general in charge of the military operation, Wesley Clark, credited Campbell with bringing order and discipline to NATO communications, and freeing the military to do its job. Campbell became a central figure in the handling of the aftermath of Princess Diana's death, after the head of The Royal Household, the Earl of Airlie, asked Tony Blair to second Campbell to help prepare the funeral, saying they knew it would have to be different. Campbell is widely reported to have coined the phrase \\"the people‚Äôs princess\\" and also to have persuaded The Queen to make her broadcast to the nation more personal, not least by using the phrase \\"speaking as a grandmother\\". Campbell's character appears in the 2006 film The Queen, though he has said most of it was made up. He oversaw Tony Blair's successful 2001 general election campaign for re- election and also returned to assist with the successful 2005 general election campaign. =Iraq War= In the run-up to the Iraq War, Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the \\"September Dossier\\" in September 2002 and the \\"Iraq Dossier\\" (nicknamed \\"Dodgy Dossier\\") in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over possible weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. Both have been criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered on Campbell's orders to be consistent with a speech given by George W. Bush and statements by other United States officials. On 9 September 2002, Campbell sent a memo to Sir John Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, in which Campbell directed that the British dossier be \\"one that complements rather than conflicts with\\" the US claims. Later in 2003, commenting on WMDs in Iraq, Campbell said, \\"Come on, you don't seriously think we won't find anything?\\". He resigned in August 2003 during the Hutton Inquiry into the death of Dr. David Kelly. Kelly's view that the government exaggerated the Iraqi threat in the Iraq Dossier, told to BBC journalists Andrew Gilligan and Susan Watts, had led to Campbell battling with the BBC. When Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon revealed to Campbell that Kelly had talked to the BBC, Campbell had then decided, in his own words, to use this fact to \\"fuck Gilligan\\". The counsel for the Kelly family said to Lord Hutton: 'The family invite the inquiry to find that the government made a deliberate decision to use Dr Kelly as a pawn as part of its strategy in its battle with the BBC.' Campbell claimed in June 2013 that Tony Blair had \\"greater commitment to wartime truth than Winston Churchill\\". Campbell gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 12 January 2011. Campbell has been the subject of six inquiries in total and, as of 2011, defended 'every word' of the dossier. Later career Campbell with cricketers Ian Botham, Bob Willis and David Gower, and politician James Erskine. Campbell worked again for the Labour Party as Campaign Director in the run-up to their third consecutive victory at the 2005 general election. Campbell also acted as an adviser to Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband at the 2010 and the 2015 general elections. Sir Clive Woodward recruited Campbell to manage relations with the press for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005. Campbell wrote a column for The Times during the tour. Throughout his time in Downing Street, Campbell kept a diary which reportedly totalled some two million words. Selected extracts, titled The Blair Years, were published on 9 July 2007. Subsequent press coverage of the book's release included coverage of what Campbell had chosen to leave out, particularly in respect of the relationship between Blair and his Chancellor and successor, Gordon Brown. Campbell expressed an intention to one day publish the diaries in fuller form, and indicated in the introduction to the book that he did not wish to make matters harder for Brown in his new role as Prime Minister, or to damage the Labour Party. In 2003 and 2004, he ran a series for The Times newspapers, analysing greatness in sport to answer the question \\"Who is the greatest sports star of all time?\\" Though his conclusion was Muhammad Ali, as part of the process; he interviewed and profiled sports stars from around the world, including Ian Botham, Nick Faldo, Ben Ainslie, Michael Phelps, Martina Navratilova, Shane Warne, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Charlton and Lance Armstrong. Campbell later said that he \\"fell hook, line and sinker\\" for the Armstrong legend. He subsequently worked with Armstrong, campaigning for cancer charities, but drew criticism from Armstrong's nemesis David Walsh for being so supportive and defending him so passionately. Campbell later said that Walsh had been right. In 2006 and 2007, Campbell took part in Soccer Aid as part of the Rest of the World team. He appeared alongside Diego Maradona and Paul Gascoigne to raise money for UNICEF. In 2007, he appeared on Comic Relief Does The Apprentice as project manager, having several clashes with Piers Morgan including his comment of \\"again?\\" when Morgan got fired, which went viral. Campbell has his own website and blog, as well as several pages on social networking websites. He uses these platforms to discuss British politics and other topics close to his heart. So far, Campbell's commentaries and views have garnered media attention and generated interest among various online communities. In October 2008, he broadcast the personal story of his mental illness in a television documentary partly to reduce the stigma of that illness. He has written a novel on the subject entitled All in the Mind. Campbell appeared as a mentor in the BBC Two series The Speaker in April 2009 offering his advice on persuasive speaking. Campbell famously clashed with Adam Boulton on Sky News about the result of the 2010 general election, with the latter being reduced to shouting over both Campbell and the show's presenter. Campbell made his first appearance on the BBC One political discussion programme Question Time on 27 May 2010. At the opening of the edition, presenter David Dimbleby said that the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would not allow a frontbench member of the government to appear on the show unless Campbell was dropped. The BBC refused to do this. The government later accused the BBC of behaving improperly for allowing Campbell to appear as a more in-depth version of his diaries was due to be published the following week, and a Downing Street spokesman told The Guardian, \\"Campbell seemed to be on because he's flogging a book next week, so the BBC haven't behaved entirely properly here.\\" Campbell said that he had waited until Labour were in opposition before appearing on the show and that the date was a coincidence as it was the only time he was free. He suggested the discord was part of a Conservative anti-BBC agenda. The minister who had been scheduled to appear was the then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws who Campbell produced a picture of during the programme. Three days later, Laws resigned his post following revelations about possible irregularities in his expenses claims in The Telegraph the day before. Campbell appeared on BBC's Top Gear in July 2010 where he was booed by the audience but set a time of 1:47 around the Top Gear test track in the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment. He also took part in the 2011 Channel Four television series Jamie's Dream School. In June 2012, he was guest presenter of Have I Got News For You In 2011, Campbell contacted the Metropolitan Police with suspicions that his phone was hacked by the News of the World in 2003. He subsequently received damages, part of which he used to sponsor the Burnley FC women's team. Campbell presented and narrated the edition of 20 February 2012 of BBC current affairs programme Panorama, which was entitled \\"Britain's Hidden Alcoholics\\". In 2012, Campbell made his first appearance in an acting role with a small part in an episode of the BBC drama Accused. In May 2012, Campbell took a role at PR agency Portland Communications, at the invitation of Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. Along with Tony Blair, Campbell has also provided consultancy services to the government of Kazakhstan on \\"questions of social economic modernisation.\\" = Return to journalism = In January 2014, Campbell announced that he was joining British GQ with a brief to conduct interviews with figures from \\"politics... sport, business, culture, (and) other aspects of life that I find interesting\\", succeeding Piers Morgan. In his role at GQ Campbell has interviewed a wide range of people, including Jose Mourinho, Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold Mario Balotelli, Mo Farah and Usain Bolt from the world of sport and Tony Blair, Sadiq Khan, Nicola Sturgeon, George Osborne, John McDonnell, John Bercow, and Chuka Umunna from the world of politics, as well as conducting in depth interviews with many other figures from public life, including Archbishop Justin Welby, Garry Kasparov and Rachel Riley. In 2017, he conducted an interview with Prince William. In March 2017, GQ began to film the interviews to use as part of their digital platform, beginning with an interview with Owen Jones, and then Tony Blair. When Jeremy Corbyn was interviewed for the magazine in late 2017, he did so on the condition that Campbell would not be the interviewer. In May 2016 the International Business Times website announced that Campbell had joined them as a columnist. In March 2017 the newspaper The New European announced that it had appointed Campbell as editor-at-large. In May 2019, he announced that he and his daughter Grace, a comedian and feminist, had launched a joint podcast, Football, Feminism and Everything In Between; a series of interviews with figures from politics, sport and other walks of life. Their first interview with Ed Miliband was followed by Rachel Riley, Jamie Carragher, Kelly Holmes and Maro Itoje. When Government Adviser Dominic Cummings broke government guidelines to visit Durham, Campbell urged his social media followers to write to all Tory MPs asking for their view, and published a 50,000 word analysis of what he called 'Organised Hypocrisy' on his website based on the responses he collated. = People's Vote campaign = Alastair Campbell speaking at an anti-Brexit rally in Parliament Square, London on 25 March 2017 Campbell stated immediately after the UK's referendum on membership to the European Union in June 2016 that he thought it was \\"the worst decision Britain had made in his lifetime\\" and would do what he could to change people's minds. In addition to establishing The New European, he was one of the early movers in the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. In 2018 Campbell became part of the top table team at the People's Vote campaign fighting for a referendum on the Brexit deal. This included overseeing the production of campaign films including one written by and starring his daughter Grace, called The Brexit Special, for which Campbell persuaded actor Richard Wilson to revive his most famous character, Victor Meldrew. In 2018 Campbell worked for the People's Vote campaign's planning and organisation of a march on Parliament on 20 October, which drew an estimated 250,000 people onto the streets. The march was described by the media as the second biggest ever, after the protest against the Iraq war in 2003. He helped organize and spoke at a second march and rally attended by an estimated million people in October 2019, on the day Boris Johnson called a rare Saturday sitting in Parliament to back his Brexit deal. In July 2017, he was invited to speak at the French National Assembly to the newly elected MPs of President Emmanuel Macron's victorious En Marche party, Campbell having met and advised Macron during the campaign. He urged the French to be patient with the United Kingdom and to give them a chance to change course and reverse Brexit. He said Macron had been bolder than Tony Blair in setting up a new party and leading it to power within little over a year. Campbell wrote a piece criticising the chairman of Open Britain, Roland Rudd, after Rudd unilaterally decided to sack two key campaign officials on the eve of the 2019 general election. = Mental health activism = Campbell's experience with depression was recalled in a BBC documentary called Cracking Up. He has since then been a prominent supporter and advocate for the mental health anti-stigma campaign Time to Change. In November 2017, he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in recognition of his work in breaking down the stigma surrounding mental illness and promoting the importance of psychiatry. Campbell took part in the Mental Health Foundation's takeover of Channel Four for Mental Health Awareness Week 2017, acting as a celebrity continuity announcer. For the Mental Health Awareness Week two years later he broadcast a documentary on BBC Two, Alastair Campbell: Depression and Me, exploring different ways of dealing and coping with depression. It was part of a BBC series drawing attention to different mental health conditions. In 2019 he was appointed Global Ambassador to Australians for Mental Health, a new umbrella organisation fighting for better services. He made numerous media appearances and caused controversy by saying on the Australian version of Question Time, the ABC's Q&A;, that Donald Trump and fellow populists were \\"sowing the seeds of fascism\\". He followed that by writing a book, Living Better, on his struggle with depression, announcing it would be published in May 2020. = Expulsion from Labour Party = On 28 May 2019, Campbell announced that he had been expelled from the Labour Party after voting for the Liberal Democrats in that month's European elections, and that he would appeal the decision. He also questioned the speed of his expulsion compared to the treatment of Labour colleagues accused of anti-semitism. In response, shadow minister Dawn Butler stated that it was common knowledge that voting for another party would result in automatic exclusion. He was a long- standing critic of Labour's Brexit strategy and in the May 2019 European elections, he voted Liberal Democrat as a protest vote. He announced this after the polls had closed in interviews on TV and radio covering the results as they came in. He said he did so, in common with many others, to persuade Labour unequivocally to back a People's Vote. Two days later, by email, he was expelled from the Party, a move which provoked a major media storm in which many other Labour members outed themselves as having voted for parties other than Labour, including Cherie Blair, Charles Clarke, Bob Ainsworth and Betty Boothroyd. A hashtag #ExpelMeToo trended on Twitter as ordinary members expressed their support for Campbell. He immediately appealed the decision, saying tactical voting was not a breach of the rule under which he had been expelled, and arguing that unless all others who had acted as he did were expelled he also had a case for discrimination. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson condemned the expulsion as \\"spiteful\\" and a number of senior MPs immediately called for the decision to be reversed, and an amnesty of all who voted against Labour in the European elections. In July 2019, in the week Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, Campbell penned a 3,500 word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn saying he no longer wished to be re-admitted to the party, despite legal advice saying he would win a court case against his expulsion. He called on Corbyn to step down and cited his \\"failure\\" on Brexit, antisemitism, broader policy and \\"above all the failure to develop and execute a strategy\\". The story was broken in The Guardian and the full letter published in The New European. Corbyn said he was \\"disappointed\\", prompting Campbell to ask why he had been expelled. Campbell voted Labour in the 2019 general election, having been part of a failed tactical voting campaign aimed at preventing Boris Johnson from winning a majority.  Personal life  Campbell has described himself as a pro-faith atheist, and his statement ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt do God‚Äô is one of his most repeated soundbites. Yet despite this, he was asked in late-2017 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, whom Campbell had interviewed for GQ, to contribute to his book on the meaning of Christmas. In August 2016 Campbell's older brother, Donald, a schizophrenic, died at the age of 62 due to complications resulting from his illness. Campbell has talked extensively about how Donald, the Principal's official bagpiper at Glasgow University and a competitor in high-level Piobaireachd competitions, had inspired him to fight for better mental health services and understanding, and to become the ambassador for several mental health charities. When Campbell was a boy, he would go over the county border to Lancashire to watch Burnley F.C. with his father. He remains a lifelong Burnley supporter and writes about their exploits in a column called \\"Turf Moor Diaries\\" for the FanHouse UK football blog. He is regularly involved in events with the club. He was heavily involved in rescuing the club from potential bankruptcy, gaining the support of many high-profile public figures. He was one of the founders of the University College of Football Business, based at Burnley's stadium. Campbell plays the bagpipes to relieve stress in his spare time. In December 2017, a musical project he was involved in won the Community Award at the 'Na Trads' traditional Scottish music awards. He had played the bagpipes at a concert in Glasgow earlier in the year, staged entirely by musicians with links to Tiree. The Tiree Community Songbook was made into a CD, which won a Community award at the Traditional Music awards. He is a keen runner, cyclist, swimmer and triathlete. He raised over half a million pounds for charity running the London Marathon in 2003. In his 60s he developed an interest in cold water swimming. He was a prominent critic of the U.K. government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also of the media and Opposition failure to hold the government to account. He was signed up by TheArticle.Com and wrote for them and others a number of incisive articles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he performed on the bagpipes in a charity song written by Martin Gillespie of Scottish band Skerryvore, Everyday Heroes, which topped the iTunes download charts within hours of release. All proceeds from sales went to the NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal. Earlier, a film of Campbell serenading his next door neighbour, nurse Matilda Bridge as she come home from work, had millions of views and garnered media coverage around the world. It started a trend of pipers playing around the country during weekly ‚Äòclap for the NHS‚Äô events. He has never married his long-term partner, citing his being non-religious, and her being a feminist.  Stage and screen portrayals  A regular feature of comedy programme Bremner, Bird and Fortune was a satirical version of Campbell's discussions with Tony Blair, in which Rory Bremner played Blair and Andrew Dunn played Campbell. In 2005, Campbell was played by Jonathan Cake in the Channel 4 television film The Government Inspector, based on the David Kelly Case. The following year, he was portrayed by Mark Bazeley in the Stephen Frears film The Queen ‚Äì a role reprised by Bazeley in 2010 follow-up The Special Relationship, also written by Peter Morgan but this time directed by Richard Loncraine. Alex Jennings, who portrayed Prince Charles in The Queen, portrayed Campbell in the television drama A Very Social Secretary. In an episode of Dead Ringers his close relationship with Tony Blair is satirised in an imaginary scenario where Blair is divorcing his wife. He is asked if it will be difficult to sack the person he most loves and cherishes replying \\"I'm not sacking Alastair Campbell\\". It is also widely believed that the character of Malcolm Tucker from the BBC political satire comedy The Thick of It is loosely based on Campbell. Tucker is famous for his short fuse and use of very strong language. In an interview with Mark Kermode on BBC2's The Culture Show, Campbell denied that the two are similar in any relevant way, but admitted to his liberal use of profanities in the workplace. The interview descended into argument with Campbell accusing the likes of Mark Kermode and the show's creator Armando Iannucci of being responsible for people's cynicism with modern politics. Honours * He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (FRCPsych) on 6 November 2017. * He was awarded the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage by the Philosophical Society of Trinity College Dublin on 16 October 2019. * He has on a number of occasions turned down the opportunity to sit in the House of Lords. In 2010, Gordon Brown offered him a senior ministerial position alongside a peerage, but Campbell is a long-standing opponent of the House of Lords. Published books Campbell has published a number of books including seven volumes of memoirs. In February 2018, he wrote, with Paul Fletcher, a novel on football and terrorism in the 1970s, Saturday Bloody Saturday. The book has a front cover quote from commentator John Motson describing it as \\"the best football novel I have ever read\\". *The Blair Years (2008). Arrow. *All in the Mind (2008).

He created simulations of nuclear explosions for the purposes of scientific inquiry, as well as for improving the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. A federal grand jury indicted him on charges of stealing secrets about the U.S. nuclear arsenal for the People's Republic of China (PRC) in December 1999. After federal investigators were unable to prove these initial accusations, the government conducted a separate investigation and was ultimately only able to charge Lee with improper handling of restricted data, one of the original 59 indictment counts, to which he pleaded guilty as part of a plea settlement. In June 2006, Lee received $1.6 million from the federal government and five media organizations as part of a settlement of a civil suit he had filed against them for leaking his name to the press before any formal charges had been filed against him. Federal judge James A. Parker eventually apologized to Lee for denying him bail and putting him in solitary confinement, and excoriated the government for misconduct and misrepresentations to the court.Wen Ho Lee, Helen Zia (2001), My Country Versus Me: The first-hand account by the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of being a spy, Hyperion  Early life  Wen Ho Lee was born on December 21, 1939 to a Hoklo family in Taiwan during Japanese rule. He graduated from Keelung High School in the northern part of the island in 1959, after which he attended National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering in 1963. In My Country Versus Me, Lee describes life as being harsh. His father died when Lee was very young. His mother suffered from asthma and eventually committed suicide so that she would not 'burden' the family. He was a young boy in Taiwan when Republic of China (ROC) forces violently suppressed the February 28 Incident of 1947. Taiwan was placed under martial law; his brother died when he was a conscript and his commanding officers allegedly wouldn't allow him to take medicine. Lee, however, overcame these odds. He had what he describes as a wonderful teacher in the 6th grade who encouraged his intellectual abilities. Eventually he made his way to university, where he became interested in fluid dynamics and studied mechanical engineering at the university. Graduate education and career Lee came to the United States in 1965 to continue his studies in mechanical engineering at Texas A&M; University. He received his doctorate in mechanical engineering with the specialization in fluid mechanics in 1969 and became a U.S. citizen in 1974. He was employed at industrial and government research firms before he moved to New Mexico in 1978. He worked as a scientist in weapons design at Los Alamos National Laboratory in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics from that year until 1999. He created simulation software for nuclear explosions, which were used to gain scientific understanding and help maintain the safety and reliability of the US nuclear weapons arsenal.  Government investigation  Lee was publicly named by United States Department of Energy officials, including Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, as a suspect in the theft of classified nuclear-related documents from Los Alamos. Richardson was criticized by the Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry by not testifying in front of Congress sooner. Richardson was less than truthful in his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress.Christopher McCaleb, Ian, \\"Richardson says FBI has determined drives did not leave Los Alamos\\" , CNN, June 21, 2000. On December 10, 1999, Lee was arrested, indicted on 59 counts, and jailed in solitary confinement without bail for 278 days until September 13, 2000, when he accepted a plea bargain from the federal government. Lee was released on time served after the government's case against him could not be proven. He was ultimately charged with only one count of mishandling sensitive documents that did not require pre-trial solitary confinement, while the other 58 counts were dropped. President Bill Clinton issued a public apology to Lee over his treatment by the federal government during the investigation. Lee filed a lawsuit to gain the names of public officials who had leaked his name to journalists before charges had been filed against him. It raised issues similar to those in the Valerie Plame affair, of whether journalists should have to reveal their anonymous sources in a court of law. Lee's lawsuit was settled by the federal government in 2006 just before the Supreme Court was set to decide whether to hear the case. The federal judge who heard the case during an earlier appeal said that \\"top decision makers in the executive branch...have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen.\\" =Operation Kindred Spirit= After an intelligence agent from the People's Republic of China (PRC) gave U.S. agents papers which indicated that they knew the design of a particularly modern U.S. nuclear warhead (the W-88), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started an investigation codenamed \\"Operation Kindred Spirit\\" to look into how China could have obtained that design. In 1982, Lee was recorded on a wiretap speaking with another Taiwanese-American scientist who had been accused of espionage. Lee offered to the scientist to find out who had turned him in. When confronted by the FBI about this incident, Lee said he did not know the scientist, until the FBI demonstrated proof of the conversation. Despite some evidence that could have kept the case open, the FBI closed this file on Lee in 1984. Lee did not get the attention of the FBI again for 12 years until 1998. The FBI had lost the file on Lee from the 1983 and 1984 meetings with him, and had to reconstruct the information. In 1994, a delegation of Chinese scientists visited Los Alamos National Laboratory in an unannounced capacity for a meeting. One of the scientists visiting was Dr. Hu Side, the head of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics. He also was credited with the design of the small, W88-like weapon. However, despite the visit being unannounced, Lee showed up to the meeting uninvited. This alarmed LANL officials who contacted the FBI, which opened up another investigation of Lee. On December 23, 1998 Lee was given a polygraph test by Wackenhut, a DOE contractor. He was not told of the reason why, other than that it involved his latest trip to China to escort his nephew. During the questioning, he admitted that he had, in fact, met with Dr. Hu Side in a hotel room in 1988 and that Side had asked him for classified information, which he refused to discuss. Lee admitted that he failed to report this contact and approach by individuals requesting classified information as required by security regulations. He was told that he passed the test, but was stripped of his Q clearance to the LANL's classified X Division section. Although he questioned the action against him, Lee went along, deleting the classified information he held on his computers, and moved to the T (unclassified) clearance zone. He was later subjected to three more polygraph tests before being told by the FBI agents that re-evaluation of the test results showed that Lee had failed all of them. In January, The Wall Street Journal ran an article on the investigation, headlined \\"China Got Secret Data on U.S. Warhead -- Chief Suspect Is a Scientist at Weapons Laboratory of Energy Department,\\" without naming a suspect. On March 6, The New York Times published an article on the W-88 case, \\"China Stole Nuclear Secrets for Bombs, U.S. Aides Say,\\"James Risen and Jeff Gerth (March 6, 1999), \\"BREACH AT LOS ALAMOS: A special report.; China Stole Nuclear Secrets For Bombs, U.S. Aides Say\\" (includes extensive corrections), The New York Times again without naming the suspect. Government officials had requested the newspaper delay publication, and The New York Times held back publication for one day, saying it would consider a further delay if asked personally by the F.B.I. director, who did not act on the request.MATTHEW PURDY (Feb. 4, 2001), \\"The Making of a Suspect: The Case of Wen Ho Lee\\", The New York Times Matthew Purdy with James Sterngold (Feb. 5, 2001), \\"The Prosecution Unravels: The Case of Wen Ho Lee\\", The New York Times The F.B.I. interviewed Dr. Lee on March 5, and he consented to a search of his office. On March 8, 1999, Lee was fired from his job at Los Alamos National Laboratory on accounts of failure to maintain classified information securely. However, FBI investigators soon determined that the design data the PRC had obtained could not have come from the Los Alamos Lab, because it related to information that would only have been available to someone like a so-called \\"downstream\\" contractor, meaning one involved in the final warhead production process, and this information was only created after the weapon design left the LANL. Even though this left Wen Ho Lee apparently in the clear, the FBI continued its attempt to find evidence to implicate Lee in committing espionage for the PRC. There were 60 agents and more assigned to Lee's case, working to prove that he was a spy. The FBI conducted a search of Lee's house on April 10, seizing any item related to computers or computing, as well as anything that had notations written in Chinese. The FBI and the Department of Energy then decided to conduct a full forensic examination of Lee's office computer. The examination of Lee's computer determined that he had backed up his work files, which were restricted though not classified, onto tapes, and had also transferred these files from a system used for processing classified data onto another, also secure, system designated for unclassified data. After the FBI discovered Lee's transfer, they revoked his badge access and clearance, including his ability to access the data from the unclassified but secure network. Lee then requested from a colleague in another part of Los Alamos to be allowed to use his computer, at which time he transferred the data to a third unclassified computer network. The government then retroactively redesignated the data Lee had copied, changing it from its former designation of \\"PARD\\" (Protect As Restricted Data), which was just above the \\"Unclassified\\" designation and contained 99 percent unclassified data, to a new designation of \\"Secret\\" (which was treated on a higher security level than PARD), giving them the crime that the government needed for a formal charge. Indictment, imprisonment and release The Department of Justice constructed its case around the only real evidence of malfeasance, the downloading of the restricted information.James Risen and Jeff Gerth (March 6, 1999), \\"BREACH AT LOS ALAMOS: A special report.; China Stole Nuclear Secrets For Bombs, U.S. Aides Say\\" (includes extensive corrections), The New York Times It ultimately employed an unusual strategy of trying to prove that in addition to illegally handling information, Dr. Lee had an \\"intent to injure\\" the United States by denying it the exclusivity of the nuclear information. Lee was indicted on 59 counts, 39 of which were for mishandling information under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and 20 of which were for lesser violations of the Espionage Act. (The original Atomic Energy Act, a.k.a. the McMahon Act, was passed in response to the case of Cambridge physicist Alan Nunn MayJeevan Vasagar (27 Jan 2003), \\"Spy's deathbed confession: Atom physicist tells how secrets given to Soviet Union\\", The Guardian (UK) after he confessed to giving Manhattan Project secrets to the USSR.) Janet Reno confirmed with CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh that if the presiding judge rules that the government must reveal in open court what specifically was on the tapes, the prosecution would have to plea out the case or risk jeopardizing state secrets. Dr. Lee spent nine months incarcerated in solitary confinement with limited access to family. His treatment, which included constant shackling, was inconsistent with treatment of other prisoners at the Santa Fe County detention facility, and became a source of great controversy for the DOJ.

(Bound) 22416 - INVESTIGATION AND TREATMENT OF WEN HO LEE, U.S. House of Representatives proceedings in Congressional Record In September 2000, Judge Parker ruled that the government was required to disclose the information on the tapes. According to Louis Freeh and Janet Reno, they were left with no option but to plea out Dr. Lee in order to find out where the missing tapes were, and not risk sensitive government information by bringing it to trial. Dr. Lee was freed, and at plea he admitted to having made copies of the tapes which he later destroyed, according to his book My Country Versus Me, and other sources.Wen Ho Lee, Helen Zia (2001), My Country Versus Me: The first-hand account by the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of being a spy, HyperionWen Ho Lee, Helen Zia (2001), My Country Versus Me: The first-hand account by the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of being a spy, HyperionWen Ho Lee, Helen Zia (2001), My Country Versus Me: The first-hand account by the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of being a spy (excerpt), Hyperion Lee pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegal \\"retention\\" of \\"national defense information.\\" In return, the government released him from jail and dropped the other 58 counts against him. Judge Parker apologized to Dr. Lee for the unfair manner in which he was treated. The judge also regretted being misled by the executive branch into ordering Dr. Lee's detention, stating that he was led astray by the Department of Justice, by its FBI, and by its United States attorney. He formally denounced the government for abuse of power in its prosecution of the case.NYTimes (Sept. 14, 2000), \\"Statement by Judge in Los Alamos Case, With Apology for Abuse of Power\\", The New York Times Jeremy Wu (March 12, 2018), \\"Revisiting Judge Parker‚Äôs Apology to Dr. Wen Ho Lee\\", Linkedin Later, President Bill Clinton remarked that he had been \\"troubled\\" by the way Dr. Lee was treated.Paul Farhi (June 3, 2006), \\"U.S., Media Settle With Wen Ho Lee\\", The Washington Post, p. A1 Matthew Purdy (Feb. 4, 2001), \\"The Making of a Suspect: The Case of Wen Ho Lee\\", The New York Times Matthew Purdy with James Sterngold (Feb. 5, 2001), \\"The Prosecution Unravels: The Case of Wen Ho Lee\\", The New York Times Post-release Lee is now retired and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with his wife. He also has two grown children - a son, and a daughter, Alberta, who at one time was an intern at Los Alamos Laboratory. In 2003, he wrote a memoir, My Country Versus Me, in which he describes his love of classical music, literature, poetry, fishing in the mountains of New Mexico, and his dedication to organic gardening. He also charges that his Asian ethnicity was a primary factor behind his prosecution by the government. As evidence of such racial profiling, he cited cases of several scientists of non-Han Chinese ancestry who were responsible for similar security transgressions but were able to continue their careers. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh categorically denied these charges. Lee was awarded a $1.6 million settlement from the U.S. federal government and five news organizations for privacy violations. A condition of the United States portion of the settlement, $895,000, is that it is to be applied only to lawyer's fees and the taxes on the media's payments, since the government insisted that they would not pay anything that would be perceived as damages to Lee. He has published an applied physics textbook that he started writing while still in prison. In media The 2001 play The Legacy Codes, by American playwright Cherylene Lee, deals with the Wen Ho Lee case. The short story \\"Amnesty\\" in the 2005 edition of Octavia Butler's collection Bloodchild and Other Stories was inspired by the government's treatment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. The 2007 play Yellow Face by Asian-American playwright David Henry Hwang places this incident in the context of a greater number of cases dealing with racial profiling against Asians, particularly the Chinese during the 1980s. The 2010 short film The Profile and its animated remake (the 2017 short film Disk 44), both by American film maker Ray Arthur Wang, are inspired by the Wen Ho Lee case.

History Little Italy on Mulberry Street used to extend as far south as Worth Street, as far north as Houston Street, as far west as Lafayette Street, and as far east as Bowery. It is now only three blocks on Mulberry Street. Little Italy originated as Mulberry Bend. Jacob Riis described Mulberry Bend as \\"the foul core of New York's slums.\\"Tonelli, Bill. \\"Arrivederci, Little Italy.\\" New York. September 27, 2004. p. 1. Retrieved on April 10, 2013. During this time period \\"Immigrants of the late 19th century usually settled in ethnic neighborhoods\\". Therefore, the \\"mass immigration from Italy during the 1880s\\" led to the large settlement of Italian immigrants in lower Manhattan. The results of such migration had created an \\"influx of Italian immigrants\\" which had \\"led to the commercial gathering of their dwelling and business\\". Bill Tonelli from New York magazine said, \\"Once, Little Italy was like an insular Neapolitan village re-created on these shores, with its own language, customs, and financial and cultural institutions.\\" Little Italy was not the largest Italian neighborhood in New York City, as East Harlem (or Italian Harlem) had a larger Italian population. Tonelli said that Little Italy \\"was perhaps the city's poorest Italian neighborhood\\". In 1910 Little Italy had almost 10,000 Italians; that was the peak of the community's Italian population. At the turn of the 20th century over 90% of the residents of the Fourteenth Ward were of Italian birth or origins. Tonnelli said that it meant \\"that residents began moving out to more spacious digs almost as soon as they arrived.\\" Such a vastly growing community impacted the \\"U.S. labor movement in the 20th century\\" by making up much of the labor population in the garment industry\\". After World War II, many residents of the Lower East Side began moving to Brooklyn, Staten Island, eastern Long Island, and New Jersey. Chinese immigrants became an increased presence after the U.S. Immigration Act of 1965 removed immigration restrictions, and the Manhattan Chinatown to Little Italy's south expanded. In 2004, Tonelli said, \\"You can go back 30 years and find newspaper clips chronicling the expansion of Chinatown and mourning the loss of Little Italy.\\" Prior to 2004, several upscale businesses entered the northern portion of the area between Houston and Kenmare Street. Tonelli said \\"Real-estate prices zoomed, making it even tougher for the old- timers‚Äîresidents and businesspeople alike‚Äîto hang on.\\" After the September 11 attacks in 2001, areas below Houston Street were cut off for the rest of the fall of 2001. The San Gennaro feast, scheduled for September 13, was postponed. Business from the Financial District dropped severely, due to the closure of Park Row, which connected Chinatown and the Civic Center; as a result, residents in Little Italy and Chinatown suffered. Tonelli said the post-9/11 events \\"strangely enough, ended up motivating all these newfangled efforts to save what's left of the old neighborhood.\\" In 2004 Tonelli said \\"Today, Little Italy is a veneer‚Äî50 or so restaurants and caf√©s catering to tourists, covering a dense neighborhood of tenements shared by recent Chinese immigrants, young Americans who can't afford Soho, and a few remaining real live Italians.\\" This sentiment has also been echoed by Italian culture and heritage website ItalianAware. The site has called the dominance of Italians in the area, \\"relatively short lived.\\" It attributes this to the quick financial prosperity many Italians achieved, which afforded them the opportunity to leave the cramped neighborhood for areas in Brooklyn and Queens. The site also goes on to state that the area is currently referred to as Little Italy more out of nostalgia than as a reflection of a true ethnic population. In 2010, Little Italy and Chinatown were listed in a single historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Little Italy, by this point, was shrinking rapidly.  Demographic changes Italian football team won the 2006 FIFA World Cup The New York Times sent its reporters to characterize the Little Italy/Mulberry neighborhood in May 1896: > They are laborers; toilers in all grades of manual work; they are artisans, > they are junkman, and here, too, dwell the rag pickers. ... There is a > monster colony of Italians who might be termed the commercial or shop > keeping community of the Latins. Here are all sorts of stores, pensions, > groceries, fruit emporiums, tailors, shoemakers, wine merchants, importers, > musical instrument makers. ... There are notaries, lawyers, doctors, > apothecaries, undertakers. ... There are more bankers among the Italians > than among any other foreigners except the Germans in the city.Staff (May > 31, 1896) \\"Little Italy in New-York\\" The New York Times p.32 As of the 2000 U.S. Census, 1,211 residents claiming Italian ancestry lived in three census tracts that make up Little Italy. Those residents comprise 8.25% of the population in the community, which is similar to the proportion of those of Italian ancestry throughout New York City. Bill Tonelli of New York magazine contrasted Little Italy with the Manhattan Chinatown; in 2000, of the residents of the portions of Chinatown south of Grand Street, 81% were of Chinese origins. In 2004, Tonelli revisited the issue, saying, \\"Little Italy may always endure as an open-air theme park of nineteenth- and twentieth- century European immigration to the Lower East Side ... But you'll spend a long time in the neighborhood before you hear anyone speak Italian, and then the speaker will be a tourist from Milan.\\"Tonelli, Bill. \\"Arrivederci, Little Italy.\\" New York. September 27, 2004. p. 2. Retrieved on April 10, 2013. Tonelli added, \\"You have to slow your gaze to find the neighbors in this neighborhood, because they're so overwhelmed and outnumbered by the tourists. But once you focus, you can see them, standing (or sitting) in the interstices, taking in the scene, like the group of men, mostly senior citizens, loitering contentedly under an awning on Mulberry Street.\\" Cultural attractions Mulberry Street in Little Italy Little Italy was home to dozens of restaurants that serve authentic Italian cuisine, but between March 2013 and March 2014, eight eateries closed down.http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/rent_hikes_forcing_little_italy_restaurants_to_close.php Since 2004, Sorrento Lactalis funds neighborhood cultural events in Little Italy. The Feast of San Gennaro originally was once only a one-day religious commemoration. It began in September 1926 with the new arrival of immigrants from Naples. The Italian immigrants congregated along Mulberry Street in Manhattan's Little Italy to celebrate San Gennaro as the Patron Saint of Naples. The Feast of San Gennaro is a large street fair, lasting 11 days, that takes place every September along Mulberry Street between Houston and Canal Streets.Little Italy New York City The festival is an annual celebration of Italian culture and the Italian-American community. In 1995 Mort Berkowitz became the professional manager of a community group that had been formed to take over management of the San Gennaro feast. Since then, Berkowitz became involved in other recreational activities in Little Italy, including the summer, Carnevale, Columbus Day, and Christmas events. Richard Alba, a sociologist and professor at University at Albany, SUNY, said, \\"The fascinating part here is the way in which ethnic tourism‚Äînot only by Italian Americans but by people who want to see an authentic urban village‚Äîkeeps these neighborhoods going.\\" Organized crime and the Mafia Little Italy residents have seen organized crime since the early 20th century.

According to the Irish Independent, Delaney's best-selling memoir of life as an Irish diplomat \\"ruffled feathers\\" within the Irish diplomatic corps. Education and career Delaney attended University College Dublin (UCD). He was Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society from 1985 to 1986. He served Ireland as a diplomat from 1987 until 1995. After leaving the diplomatic corps, he became a full-time author. His first novel, The Casting of Mr. O'Shaughnessy was published in 1995, and republished in 2002. The eponymous character of Mr O'Shaughnessy was, in the author's own words, \\"partly, but quite obviously, based on the career of the colourful Se√°n McBride\\". His next book, an account of his eight years as a diplomat, An Accidental Diplomat: My Years in the Irish Foreign Service 1987‚Äì1995 was widely discussed. Irish journalist Thomas O'Dwyer describes Delaney's wit as \\"wicked\\" and his 2001 book An Accidental Diplomat as having been, \\"a runaway bestseller.\\" Delaney writes for the Irish Independent, and on an occasional basis for The Irish Times and other outlets. In 2004 Delaney was named editor of the Dublin news and opinion magazine, Magill Magazine, a position that continued until its closure in 2009. In 2009 Delaney published a book focusing on the life of his late father, the sculptor Edward Delaney entitled Breaking the Mould. The Daily Mail credits Delaney with playing a key role in securing for the Irish Museum of Modern Art the opportunity to purchase a major collection of modern art being deaccessioned by the Bank of Ireland before it was put up for auction on the private market in 2010. Delaney is the first cousin of Richie Boucher, chief executive of the Bank of Ireland at the time (their mothers are sisters.) O'Shaughnessy hoax In 1986, Delaney applied for a government pension to be granted to Cornelius O'Shaughnessy, fictional hero of Delaney's novel The Casting of Mr. O'Shaughnessy, on the basis of the character's participation in the 1921 Irish War of Independence. Singer Gavin Friday lent Delaney the name and service details of his own grandfather, an actual veteran of 1921, to serve as the fictional O'Shaughnessy's commanding officer in the application. Delaney cited sufficient plausible historic detail in the application which attracted the personal attention of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Haughey asked Secretary of Defense Michael J. Noonan to review the case, and three months later the government sent Delaney the appropriate service medals and approved the pension. Delaney revealed the hoax before the pension was actually paid. Accidental Diplomat According to The Times of London, Delaney's Accidental Diplomat, \\"lifted the lid on the internal workings of the Department of Foreign Affairs.\\" The book was serialised in The Sunday Times which described Delaney as \\"spilling the diplomatic beans.\\" According to the Irish Times, Delaney's memoir was a \\"surprise bestseller.\\" Columnist In 2011, a Delaney column in the Sunday Independent in which he argued that the gay rights movement is \\"overreaching\\" in seeking the \\"right to marry, to adopt children, and to intimidate opponents into silence,\\" touched off a media flap. Those who criticised Delaney's column included actor Charlie Condou writing in The Guardian. Personal life Delaney is married, with children. Delaney's oldest child, Ciaran Wolfe Delaney, is named for Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone.

Henry James and John Galsworthy were among the firm's early authors. Background and early life Gerald Duckworth by Harry Furniss Duckworth was a son of Herbert Duckworth, a London barrister, by his wife Julia Jackson. His middle name, de l'Etang, was the surname of one of his mother's ancestors, Antoine de l'Etang, a page to Queen Marie Antoinette. His mother was a niece of Julia Margaret Cameron, the photographer, after whom she was named. Duckworth's father died before his birth, and when he was eight his mother married the author Leslie Stephen, and had four more children: Virginia Stephen, later the author Virginia Woolf, the painter Vanessa Bell, and two sons, Thoby and Adrian Stephen. Woolf eventually accused Gerald and his elder brother, George, of having sexually abused her and Vanessa when they were children and teenagers.Virginia Woolf, \\"A Sketch of the Past\\", in Moments of Being (London: Hogarth Press, 1985), p. 69.Roger Poole, The Unknown Virginia Woolf (Cambridge University Press, 1978), pp. 27‚Äì34. Woolf published her first two novels with her brother's help before forming the Hogarth Press. Gerald Duckworth was educated at Eton College and Clare College, Cambridge. Career In 1898, Duckworth founded the publishing company which bears his name, Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd, in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. In his first year, 1898‚Äì1899, he published Henry James's In the Cage; Leslie Stephen's English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century; Jocelyn by John Sinjohn, a pseudonym of John Galsworthy; a translation of August Strindberg's Der Vater; and Mother Goose in Prose, the first children's book by L. Frank Baum, and the first book illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. (Baum's most famous work, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was published in Chicago a year later.) Edward Garnett (whose son David would marry Duckworth's niece Angelica Bell) was Duckworth's reader for nearly twenty years. The firm published W. H. Hudson, Charles M. Doughty, D. H. Lawrence, Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, and most of the work of Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, and Sacheverell Sitwell. It published all of John Galsworthy's plays between 1909 and 1929. In 1929, Galsworthy was shocked that Duckworth required him to sign all 1,250 copies of a limited edition of his collected plays. But when told he would get a royalty of 15s. 9d. per copy, he set up his watch and said: \\"Let's see how long it takes me to earn ¬£984 7s. 6d.\\" Duckworth died in Milan, Italy, in 1937, but the firm continued to thrive. It marked its centenary in 1998, but then ran into financial troubles in 2003. It was bought out by Peter Mayer, although it has continued to publish under the name of Duckworth. Representations Three portraits of Duckworth are held by the National Portrait Gallery. Anthony Powell became Duckworth's literary editor in 1926, and the publisher Judkins & Judkins in his novel What's become of Waring? (1939) is modelled on Duckworth's. Family On 2 March 1921, Duckworth married Cecil Alice Scott- Chad (born 1891), the daughter of Charles Scott-Chad, a barrister, and cousin of the footballing barrister George Scott-Chad. She and Duckworth had no children. Duckworth's older brother Sir George Herbert Duckworth (1868‚Äì1934) was private secretary to Austen Chamberlain. He became the grandfather of Anthony Duckworth-Chad. His sister Stella (1869‚Äì1897) married John Waller Hills, but died three months later.

The pulleys are assembled to form blocks and then blocks are paired so that one is fixed and one moves with the load. The rope is threaded through the pulleys to provide mechanical advantage that amplifies the force applied to the rope.Ned Pelger, ConstructionKnowledge.net Hero of Alexandria described cranes formed from assemblies of pulleys in the first century. Illustrated versions of Hero's Mechanica (a book on raising heavy weights) show early block and tackle systems.A. P. Usher, A History of Mechanical Inventions, Harvard University Press, 1929 (Dover Publications, revised edition, 2011, )  Overview  Various ways of rigging a tackle. All these are \\"rove to disadvantage\\" (see below). A block is a set of pulleys or sheaves mounted on a single frame. An assembly of blocks with a rope threaded through the pulleys is called tackle. The process of threading ropes through blocks is called \\"reeving\\", and a threaded block and tackle is said to have been \\"rove\\".wiktionary:reeve A block and tackle system amplifies the tension force in the rope to lift heavy loads. They are common on boats and sailing ships, where tasks are often performed manually. In the diagram shown here, the number of rope sections of the tackles shown is as follows: * Gun tackle: 2 * Luff tackle: 3 * Double tackle: 4 * Gyn tackle: 5 * Threefold purchase: 6 Note that the gun tackle, double tackle and threefold purchase all have the same number of pulleys in both blocks (one, two and three, respectively) whereas the Luff tackle and Gyn tackle have mis-matched blocks with differing numbers of pulleys.  Mechanical advantage  A gun tackle has a single pulley in both the fixed and moving blocks with 2 rope parts (n) supporting the load (FB) of 100 N. The mechanical advantage is 2, requiring a force of only 50 N to lift the load. A block and tackle is characterized by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load. Its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load. The mechanical advantage of a tackle dictates how much easier it is to haul or lift the load. If frictional losses are neglected, the mechanical advantage of a block and tackle is equal to the number of parts in the line that either attach to or run through the moving blocks‚Äîin other words, the number of supporting rope sections. An ideal block and tackle with a moving block supported by n rope sections has the mechanical advantage (MA), MA = \\\\frac{F_B}{F_A} = n,\\\\\\\\! where FA is the hauling (or input) force and FB is the load. Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block. If there are n of these parts of the rope supporting the load FB, then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be FB/n. This means the input force on the rope is FA=FB/n. Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor n. A double tackle has two pulleys in both the fixed and moving blocks with four rope parts (n) supporting the load (FB) of 100 N. The mechanical advantage is 4, requiring a force of only 25 N to lift the load. Image:Pulley1a.svgSeparation of the pulleys in the gun tackle show the force balance that results in a rope tension of W/2. Image:Pulley3a.svgSeparation of the pulleys in the double tackle show the force balance that results in a rope tension of W/4. Ideal mechanical advantage correlates directly with velocity ratio. The velocity ratio of a tackle is the ratio between the velocity of the hauling line to that of the hauled load. A line with a mechanical advantage of 4 has a velocity ratio of 4:1. In other words, to raise a load at 1 metre per second, the hauling part of the rope must be pulled at 4 metres per second. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a double tackle is 4. =Rove to (dis)advantage= The mechanical advantage of any tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load. In this case the block and tackle is said to be \\"rove to advantage.\\"sccheadquarters.com seamanship reference * \\"Rove to advantage\\" ‚Äì where the pull on the rope is in the same direction as that in which the load is to be moved. The hauling part is pulled from the moving block. * \\"Rove to disadvantage\\" ‚Äì where the pull on the rope is in the opposite direction to that in which the load is to be moved. The hauling part is pulled from the fixed block. Diagram 3 shows three rope parts supporting the load W, which means the tension in the rope is W/3. Thus, the mechanical advantage is three-to-one. By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle. Image:Pulley2.svgDiagram 3: The gun tackle \\"rove to advantage\\" has the rope attached to the moving pulley. The tension in the rope is W/3 yielding an advantage of three. Image:Pulley2a.svgDiagram 3a: The Luff tackle adds a fixed pulley \\"rove to disadvantage.\\" The tension in the rope remains W/3 yielding an advantage of three. The decision of which to use depends on pragmatic considerations for the total ergonomics of working with a particular situation. Reeving to advantage is the most efficient use of equipment and resources. For example, if the load is to be hauled parallel to the ground, reeving to advantage enables the pulling force to be in the direction of the load movement, allowing obstacles to be managed more easily. Reeving to disadvantage adds an extra sheave to change the direction of the pulling line, which increases friction losses without improving the velocity ratio. Situations in which reeving to disadvantage may be more desirable include lifting from a fixed point overhead; the additional pulley allows pulling downwards instead of upwards so that the weight of the lifter can offset the weight of the load. = Friction = Wooden block on a sailing ship. The formula used to find the effort required to raise a given weight using a block and fall: F_a =\\\\frac{L}{N} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\textit{eff}} where F_a is the force applied to the hauling part of the line (the input force), L is the weight of the load (the output force), N is the ideal mechanical advantage of the system (which is the same as the number of segments of line extending from the moving block), and \\\\textit{eff} is the mechanical efficiency of the system (equal to one for an ideal frictionless system; a fraction less than one for real-world systems with energy losses due to friction and other causes). If S is the number of sheaves in the purchase, and there is a roughly x% loss of efficiency at each sheave due to friction, then:Notes on cargo work: Kemp and Young. 3rd Edition. Page 4 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\textit{eff}} \\\\approx 1 + S \\\\frac{x}{100}. This approximation is more accurate for smaller values of S and x. A more precise estimate of efficiency is possible by use of the sheave friction factor, K (which may be obtainable from the manufacturer or published tables). The relevant equation is: \\\\textit{eff} = \\\\frac{K^N-1}{K^S N (K-1)}. Typical K values are 1.04 for roller bearing sheaves and 1.09 for plain bearing sheaves (with wire rope). The increased force produced by a tackle is offset by both the increased length of rope needed and the friction in the system. In order to raise a block and tackle with a mechanical advantage of 6 a distance of 1 metre, it is necessary to pull 6 metres of rope through the blocks. Frictional losses also mean there is a practical point at which the benefit of adding a further sheave is offset by the incremental increase in friction which would require additional force to be applied in order to lift the load. Too much friction may result in the tackle not allowing the load to be released easily,Friction may mean that the rope in a tackle \\"bunches\\" and jams when the force is released if the tackle has too much friction for the load to balance, or that the tackle does not \\"lower\\" the load or by the reduction in force needed to move the load being judged insufficient because undue friction has to be overcome as well.  Mid-line attachment When installing a block on an existing line, it is often inconvenient at best to thread the rope through the block to be added. *Open blocks have a space wide enough between the fixed cheeks to be able to slide the pulley over the rope. These can be extremely small and light while retaining significant strength due to the lack of moving parts. *A swing cheek block a special kind of block which can be opened to engage with a bight, without the necessity to thread the rope through the block or remove the load from the end of the rope. The snatch block is also the load lifting pulley in certain arrangements, such as during use in a recovery operation. Three snatch blocks showing the ‚Äòsnatch‚Äô in the closed, opened, and securely moused Swing-Cheek blocks may be roughly divided into two categories: * Swing cheek pulleys: used for light loads or redirection of forces, usually with a single pulley wheel (though multiple sheaves/cheeks are not uncommon) and an attachment point (or several) for a carabiner or sling. The cheeks are not fixed or locked in position aside from the device used to secure them to the load or rigging point. Examples of use (in an arborocultural setting) include: tail minding/tending, and for setting a rigging point in the tree above the cut to take place - a positive rigging situation. *Snatch or Impact Blocks: used for heavier loads and more dynamic rigging, the cheeks of these blocks are fixed in place with a pin which locks into the opposite cheek. This pin may form part of the axle for a second pulley, which is secured to the load or rigging point with a soft sling, rather than a solid device such as a shackle. This allows for more even distribution of forces to the faces where the forces will be applied, as opposed to a carabiner or shackle, where the forces are applied more strongly to corners and edges, increasing risk of deformation or damage. Examples of use (again, in relation to tree care) may include setting a block below the current cut, resulting in a 'negative' rigging situation, in which shock loads can be significant - especially if removing large sections of vertical stem.

Such railway stations are typically used in air-rail alliances or code sharing agreements (commonly known as \\"Rail Fly\\") between airlines and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process.

Puck is a defunct magazine, the first successful humor magazine in the United States of colorful cartoons, caricatures and political satire of the issues of the day. It was founded in 1871 as a German-language publication by Joseph Keppler, an Austrian-born cartoonist. It was published from 1871 until 1918. Puck's first English- language edition was published in 1877, covering issues like New York City's Tammany Hall, presidential politics, and social issues of late 19th century to early 20th centuries. A collection of Puck cartoons dating from 1879 to 1903 is maintained by the Special Collections Research Center within the Gelman Library of The George Washington University.Guide to the Samuel Halperin Puck and Judge Cartoon Collection, 1879‚Äì1903, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University The Library of Congress also has an extensive collection of Puck Magazine prints online. The Florida Atlantic University Libraries Special Collections Department also maintains a collection of both English and German edition Puck cartoons dating from 1878 to 1916. History The weekly magazine was founded by Joseph Keppler in St. Louis. It began publishing German language periodicals in March 1871, though initially the German-language periodical publication failed. After working with Leslie's Illustrated Weekly in New York‚Äîa well-established magazine at the time‚ÄîKeppler created a satirical magazine called Puck, originally published in German. In 1877, after gaining wide support for an English version of Puck, Keppler published its first issue in English. The first English edition was 16 pages long and was sold for 16 cents. Puck gained notoriety for its witty, humorous cartoons and was the first to publish weekly cartoons using chromolithography in place of wood engraving, offering three cartoons instead of one. In its early years of publication, Puck's cartoons were largely printed in black and white, though later editions featured colorful, eye-catching lithographic prints in vivid color. The English language magazine continued in operation for more than 40 years under several owners and editors, until it was bought by the William Randolph Hearst company in 1916 (ironically, one 1906 cartoon mocked Hearst's bid for Congress with his newspapers' cartoon characters). The publication lasted two more years; the final edition was distributed September 5, 1918. A typical 32-page issue contained a full-color political cartoon on the front cover and a color non-political cartoon or comic strip on the back cover. There was always a double-page color centerfold, usually on a political topic. There were numerous black-and-white cartoons used to illustrate humorous anecdotes. A page of editorials commented on the issues of the day, and the last few pages were devoted to advertisements. \\"Puckish\\" means \\"childishly mischievous\\". This led Shakespeare's Puck character (from A Midsummer Night's Dream) to be recast as a charming near-naked boy and used as the title of the magazine. The magazine consisted of 16 pages measuring 10 inches by 13.5 inches with front and back covers in color and a color double-page centerfold. The cover always quoted Puck saying, \\"What fools these mortals be!\\" The jaunty symbol of Puck is conceived as a putto in a top hat who admires himself in a hand-mirror. He appears not only on the magazine covers but over the entrance to the Puck Building in New York's Nolita neighborhood, where the magazine was published, as well. In May 1893, Puck Press published A Selection of Cartoons from Puck by Joseph Keppler (1877‚Äì1892) featuring 56 cartoons chosen by Keppler as his best work. Also during 1893, Keppler temporarily moved to Chicago and published a smaller-format, 12-page version of Puck from the Chicago World's Fair grounds. Shortly thereafter, Joseph Keppler died, and Henry Cuyler Bunner, editor of Puck since 1877 continued the magazine until his own death in 1896. Harry Leon Wilson replaced Bunner and remained editor until he resigned in 1902. Joseph Keppler Jr. then became the editor. Years after its conclusion, the \\"Puck\\" name and slogan were revived as part of the Comic Weekly Sunday comic section that ran on Hearst's newspaper chain beginning in September 1931 and continuing until the 1970s. It was then revived again by Hearst's Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which folded in 1989. =Distinguished contributors= Over the years, Puck employed many early cartoonists of note, including, Louis Dalrymple, Bernhard Gillam, Friedrich Graetz, Livingston Hopkins, Frederick Burr Opper, Louis Glackens, Albert Levering, Frank Nankivell, J. S. Pughe, Rose O'Neill, Charles Taylor, James Albert Wales, and Eugene Zimmerman.

JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a \`.jar\` file extension. Design A JAR file allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy an entire application, including its classes and their associated resources, in a single request. JAR file elements may be compressed, shortening download times. A JAR file may contain a manifest file, that is located at \`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\`. The entries in the manifest file describe how to use the JAR file. For instance, a Classpath entry can be used to specify other JAR files to load with the JAR.  Extraction  The contents of a JAR file may be extracted using any standard decompression software, or the \`jar\` command line utility: \\"\`jar -xf foo.jar\`\\".  Security  Developers can digitally sign JAR files. In that case, the signature information becomes part of the embedded manifest file. The JAR itself is not signed, but instead every file inside the archive is listed along with its checksum; it is these checksums that are signed. Multiple entities may sign the JAR file, changing the JAR file itself with each signing, although the signed files themselves remain valid. When the Java runtime loads signed JAR files, it can validate the signatures and refuse to load classes that do not match the signature. It can also support 'sealed' packages, in which the Classloader will only permit Java classes to be loaded into the same package if they are all signed by the same entities. This prevents malicious code from being inserted into an existing package, and so gaining access to package-scoped classes and data. The content of JAR files may be obfuscated to make reverse engineering more difficult. Executable JAR files An executable Java program can be packaged in a JAR file, along with any libraries the program uses. Executable JAR files have the manifest specifying the entry point class with \`Main-Class: myPrograms.MyClass\` and an explicit Class-Path (and the -cp argument is ignored). Some operating systems can run these directly when clicked. The typical invocation is \`java -jar foo.jar\` from a command line. Native launchers can be created on most platforms. For instance, Microsoft Windows users who prefer having Windows EXE files can use tools such as JSmooth, Launch4J, WinRun4J or Nullsoft Scriptable Install System to wrap single JAR files into executables. Manifest A manifest file is a metadata file contained within a JAR. It defines extension and package-related data. It contains name-value pairs organized in sections. If a JAR file is intended to be used as an executable file, the manifest file specifies the main class of the application. The manifest file is named \`MANIFEST.MF\`. The manifest directory has to be the first entry of the compressed archive. =Specifications= The manifest appears at the canonical location \`META- INF/MANIFEST.MF\`. There can be only one manifest file in an archive and it must be at that location. The content of the manifest file in a JAR file created with version 1.0 of the Java Development Kit is the following. Manifest-Version: 1.0 The name is separated from its value by a colon. The default manifest shows that it conforms to version 1.0 of the manifest specification. The manifest can contain information about the other files that are packaged in the archive. Manifest contents depend on the intended use for the JAR file. The default manifest file makes no assumptions about what information it should record about other files, so its single line contains data only about itself. It should be encoded in UTF-8. Special-Purpose Manifest Headers JAR files created only for the purpose of archiving do not use the \`MANIFEST.MF\` file. Most uses of JAR files go beyond simple archiving and compression and require special information in the manifest file. Applications  If an application is contained in a JAR file, the Java Virtual Machine needs to know the application's entry point. An entry point is any class with a \`public static void main(String[] args)\` method. This information is provided in the Main-Class header, which has the general form: Main-Class: com.example.MyClassName In this example \`com.example.MyClassName.main()\` executes at application launch. Package Sealing Optionally, a package within a JAR file can be sealed, which means that all classes defined in that package are archived in the same JAR file. A package might be sealed to ensure version consistency among the classes in the software or as a security measure. To seal a package, a Name entry needs to appear, followed by a Sealed header, such as: Name: myCompany/myPackage/ Sealed: true The Name header's value is the package's relative pathname. Note that it ends with a '/' to distinguish it from a filename. Any headers following a Name header, without any intervening blank lines, apply to the file or package specified in the Name header. In the above example, because the \`Sealed\` header occurs after the \`Name: myCompany/myPackage\` header with no intervening blank lines, the \`Sealed\` header applies (only) to the package \`myCompany/myPackage\`. =Package Versioning= Several manifest headers hold versioning information. One set of headers can be assigned to each package. The versioning headers appear directly beneath the Name header for the package. This example shows all the versioning headers: Name: java/util/ Specification-Title: \\"Java Utility Classes\\" Specification-Version: \\"1.2\\" Specification-Vendor: \\"Sun Microsystems, Inc.\\". Implementation-Title: \\"java.util\\" Implementation-Version: \\"build57\\" Implementation-Vendor: \\"Sun Microsystems, Inc.\\" =Dependencies= The \`MANIFEST.MF\` file can be used to specify all the classes that must be loaded for an application to be able to run.the sun servlet specification, page 72 (servlet-2_4-fr-spec.pdf). See also the Java Tech Notes. Note that Class-Path entries are delimited with spaces, not with the system path delimiter: Class-Path: . pkg1.jar path/to/pkg2.jar Apache Ant Zip/JAR support The Apache Ant build tool has its own package to read and write Zip and JAR archives, including support for Unix filesystem extensions. The org.apache.tools.zip package is released under the Apache Software Foundation license and is designed to be usable outside Ant.  Related formats  Several related file formats build on the JAR format: * WAR (Web application archive) files, also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes, JavaServer Pages and other objects for Web Applications. * RAR (resource adapter archive) files (not to be confused with the RAR file format), also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes and other objects for J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) applications. * EAR (enterprise archive) files provide composite Java archives that combine XML files, Java classes and other objects including JAR, WAR and RAR Java archive files for Enterprise Applications. * SAR (service archive) is similar to EAR. It provides a \`service.xml\` file and accompanying JAR files. * APK (Android application package), a variant of the Java archive format, is used for Android applications. * AAR (Android archive) is used for distribution of Android libraries, typically via Maven. * PAR (plan archive) - supported by Eclipse Virgo OSGi application server, allows the deployment of multi-bundle OSGi applications as a single archive and provides isolation from other PAR-based applications deployed in the same server. * KAR (Karaf archive) - supported by Apache Karaf OSGi application server, allows the deployment of multi-bundle, multi-feature OSGi applications.

The set of all global variables is known as the global environment or global state. In compiled languages, global variables are generally static variables, whose extent (lifetime) is the entire runtime of the program, though in interpreted languages (including command-line interpreters), global variables are generally dynamically allocated when declared, since they are not known ahead of time. In some languages, all variables are global, or global by default, while in most modern languages variables have limited scope, generally lexical scope, though global variables are often available by declaring a variable at the top level of the program. In other languages, however, global variables do not exist; these are generally modular programming languages that enforce a module structure, or class-based object- oriented programming languages that enforce a class structure. Use Interaction mechanisms with global variables are called global environment (see also global state) mechanisms. The global environment paradigm is contrasted with the local environment paradigm, where all variables are local with no shared memory (and therefore all interactions can be reconducted to message passing). Global variables are used extensively to pass information between sections of code that do not share a caller/callee relation like concurrent threads and signal handlers. Languages (including C) where each file defines an implicit namespace eliminate most of the problems seen with languages with a global namespace though some problems may persist without proper encapsulation. Without proper locking (such as with a mutex), code using global variables will not be thread-safe except for read only values in protected memory. Environment variables Environment variables are a facility provided by some operating systems. Within the OS's shell (ksh in Unix, bash in Linux, COMMAND.COM in DOS and CMD.EXE in Windows) they are a kind of variable: for instance, in unix and related systems an ordinary variable becomes an environment variable when the \`export\` keyword is used. Program code other than shells has to access them by API calls, such as \`getenv()\` and \`setenv()\`. They are local to the process in which they were set. That means if we open two terminal windows (Two different processes running shell) and change value of environment variable in one window, that change will not be seen by other window. When a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by forking, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child replaces itself with the program to be called. Child processes therefore cannot use environment variables to communicate with their peers, avoiding the action at a distance problem. Global-only and global-by- default A number of non-structured languages, such as (early versions of) BASIC, COBOL and Fortran I (1956) only provide global variables. Fortran II (1958) introduced subroutines with local variables, and the COMMON keyword for accessing global variables. Usage of COMMON in FORTRAN continued in FORTRAN 77, and influenced later languages such as PL/SQL. Named COMMON groups for globals behave somewhat like structured namespaces. Variables are also global by default in FORTH, Lua, Perl, and most shells. By language =C and C++= The C language does not have a \`global\` keyword. However, variables declared outside a function have \\"file scope,\\" meaning they are visible within the file. Variables declared with file scope are visible between their declaration and the end of the compilation unit (\`.c\` file) (unless shadowed by a like-named object in a nearer scope, such as a local variable); and they implicitly have external linkage and are thus visible to not only the \`.c\` file or compilation unit containing their declarations but also to every other compilation unit that is linked to form the complete program. External linkage, however, is not sufficient for such a variable's use in other files: for a compilation unit to correctly access such a global variable, it will need to know its type. This is accomplished by declaring the variable in each file using the \`extern\` keyword. (It will be declared in each file but may be defined in only one.) Such \`extern\` declarations are often placed in a shared header file, since it is common practice for all .c files in a project to include at least one \`.h\` file: the standard header file \`errno.h\` is an example, making the \`errno\` variable accessible to all modules in a project. Where this global access mechanism is judged problematic, it can be disabled using the \`static\` keyword which restricts a variable to file scope, and will cause attempts to import it with \`extern\` to raise a compilation (or linking) error.C in a Nutshell, P.Prinz & T Crawford, 2006, O'Reilly, Ch 11 An example of a \\"global\\" variable in C: #include // This is the file-scope variable (with internal linkage), visible only in // this compilation unit. static int shared = 3; // This one has external linkage (not limited to this compilation unit). extern int over_shared; // Also internal linkage. int over_shared_too = 2; static void ChangeShared() { // Reference to the file-scope variable in a function. shared = 5; } static void LocalShadow() { // Local variable that will hide the global of the same name. int shared; // This will affect only the local variable and will have no effect on the // file-scope variable of the same name. shared = 1000; } static void ParamShadow(int shared) { // This will affect only the parameter and will have no effect on the file- // scope variable of the same name. shared = -shared; } int main() { // Reference to the file-scope variable. printf(\\"%d \\", shared); ChangeShared(); printf(\\"%d \\", shared); LocalShadow(); printf(\\"%d \\", shared); ParamShadow(1); printf(\\"%d \\", shared); return 0; } As the variable is an external one, there is no need to pass it as a parameter to use it in a function besides main. It belongs to every function in the module. The output will be: 3 5 5 5 = Java = Some languages, like Java, don't have global variables. In Java, all variables that are not local variables are fields of a class. Hence all variables are in the scope of either a class or a method. In Java, static fields (also known as class variables) exist independently of any instances of the class and one copy is shared among all instances; hence public static fields are used for many of the same purposes as global variables in other languages because of their similar \\"sharing\\" behavior: public class Global { public static int a; } = PHP = PHP has a \`global\` keyword and a number of unusual ways of using global variables. Variables declared outside functions have file scope (which is for most purposes the widest scope). However, they are not accessible inside functions unless imported with the \`global\` keyword (i.e., the keyword accesses global variables, it does not declare them). However, some predefined variables, known as superglobals are always accessible. They are all arrays. A general purpose one is the \`$GLOBALS\` superglobal, which contains all the variables defined out of function scope. Changes to its elements change the original variables, and additions create new variables. The superglobals \`$_POST\` and \`$_GET\` are widely used in web programming. =Other languages= * In Python and MATLAB a global variable can be declared anywhere with the \`global\` keyword. * Ruby's global variables are distinguished by a '\`$\`' sigil. A number of predefined globals exist, for instance \`$$\` is the current process ID.

This policy implementation was solidified by the actual Act in 1992. The Act's main sponsors were Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for the House of Representatives and Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) for the Senate. The Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 was passed on May 21, 1992 by the Senate, and passed by the House of Representatives on August 10, 1992. President George H. W. Bush signed it into law on October 9, 1992. The Chinese Student Protection Act became Public Law 102-404, 106 Stat. 1969. The Chinese Student Protection Act established permanent residence for Chinese nationals that came to the United States from June 5, 1989 to April 11, 1990. The Act was targeted towards students. The CSPA was prompted by the political repression the Chinese faced after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Chinese students who were in the United States during the time of the protests participated in TV interviews, demonstration rallies, and were featured in newspaper articles. Chinese nationals were eligible to apply for permanent residency, even with expired passports. Over the years, the Act granted green cards to an estimated number of 54,000 Chinese nationals.See Offset in the Per-Country Numerical Level for China-Mainland Born Immigrant Visas in FY 2007 annual report. The green cards were called \\"blood cards\\" by the Chinese, as a ‚Äúpejorative term for the green cards awarded to their countrymen who, by virtue of their presence in the U.S. at the time, were eligible for the Chinese Student Protection Act.‚Äù Criticisms and Pitfalls of the Act Although CSPA was enacted to prevent political persecution of Chinese students, the act also extended its protection to immigrants that came to America illegally, with which many Americans disagreed. Additionally, the permanent resident statute of the Act subtracted spots for Chinese immigrants to come in later years. The Executive Director of Asia Watch, a large human- rights organization presence in China, spoke out against the CSPA, calling it unnecessary. According to the Executive Director, the only students that may have needed protection from their native country would be those that participated in televised or advertised speeches and those who wrote articles. A document from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization noted, ‚ÄúAccording to a cable from the U.S. Consul in Shanghai, China, over 120 returning [students]‚Ä¶ who had come to China for various reasons were interviewed [as they prepared to go back to the U.S.]. Not one of them reported a problem.‚Äù These students that returned home for a visit during the time that this Act was in effect were still eligible to apply for green cards. Bills Related to the Act October 23, 1997 H.R. 2728, a bill to extend the provisions of the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 to certain aliens who entered the United States without inspection. In summary, the bill wished to grant more Chinese students after the original 1992 Act status. This bill also included that the number of Chinese allowed to enter the country not be lowered due to this bill. The bill was to be cited as the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1997, and was brought before the House of Representatives. The bill was introduced through the Judiciary Committee, but no action was taken. June 4, 2009 S. 1182, a bill to amend the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, would ‚Äúeliminate the provision requiring the reduction of annual People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under such Act.‚Äù The bill was read twice in the Senate and referred to the Judiciary Committee but no other action was made. 2017 Bills entitled \\"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2017\\" were introduced into the House (H.R. 392) and Senate (S. 281) of the 115th United States Congress. These bills would amend the CSPA ‚Äúto eliminate the provision requiring the reduction of annual Chinese immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under such Act.‚Äù Effects on the Chinese in America Studies show that the Chinese benefited from the CSPA. ‚ÄúAmong those with at least a Bachelor‚Äôs degree, workers from mainland China experienced hourly earnings gains of 18 percent during the 1990s relative to the control group. The relative gain was 21 percent among mainland Chinese women and 16 percent among mainland Chinese men. Relative employment rates rose substantially post-CSPA for mainland Chinese male and female college graduates.‚Äù (Institute for International Integration Studies, Trinity College Dublin) Effects on the United States Labor Market Despite the critiques of the CSPA, studies have shown that there was a largely positive impact in the area of beneficiaries' labor market. Theoretically, benefits for recipients of CSPA work eligibility include higher income, flexibility, the ability to work legally, and possibility for longer-term employment.Chinese Immigrants in the U.S. Labor Market: Effects of Post-Tiananmen Immigration Policy (IZA DP No. 6287), p. 4. ‚ÄúThe CSPA appears to have raised the employment rate by 7 percentage points among college-graduate PRC immigrants relative to those from Hong Kong, controlling for other factors, and to have boosted relative hourly earnings growth by 17 to 24 percent.‚Äù (Institute for International Integration Studies) Women and highly educated immigrants benefited most.

She was the first ship sunk by the ironclad CSS Virginia. Cumberland began in the pages of a Congressional Act. Congress passed in 1816 \\"An act for the gradual increase of the Navy of the United States.\\" The act called for the U.S. to build several ships-of-the-line and several new frigates, of which Cumberland was to be one. Money issues, however, prevented Cumberland from being finished in a timely manner. It was not until Secretary of the Navy Abel Parker Upshur came to office that the ship was finished. A war scare with Britain led Upshur to order the completion of several wooden sailing ships and for the construction of new steam powered ships. Designed by famed American designer William Doughty, Cumberland was one a series of frigates in a class called the Raritan-class. The design borrowed heavily from older American frigate designs such as Constitution and Chesapeake. Specifically, Doughty liked the idea of giving a frigate more guns than European designs called for. As a result, he called for Cumberland and her sister ships to have a fully armed spar deck, along with guns on the gun deck. The result was a heavily armed, 50-gun warship. First Mediterranean cruise She was launched on 24 May 1842 by Boston Navy Yard. Her first commanding officer was Captain Samuel Livingston Breese, and her first service was as flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron from 1843 to 1845 where she had among her officers men like Foote (who served as executive officer) and Dahlgren (who served as a flag aide to Commodore Joseph Smith). The ship sailed to several parts of the Mediterranean including Port Mahon (homeport for U.S. Navy ships operating in the Mediterranean at this time), Genoa, Naples, Toulon, Jaffa, and Alexandria. The cruise was largely uneventful, though there was a diplomatic scuffle with the Sultan of Morocco who refused to recognize the newly appointed American ambassador. The incident possibly was the result of the Sultan being misled by the outgoing American ambassador who did not want to leave his post. Smith cleared up the misunderstanding and the new ambassador assumed his duties. The most notable event was Foote's successful effort to ban the grog ration. He believed it was a grand success in turning sailors into harder working, upstanding men. It later became Department policy in 1862 and it is still in effect to this day (with some exceptions.) Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War As the ship was being made ready for a second trip to the Mediterranean, the Secretary of the Navy ordered the vessel to Mexico to assist in a show of force off the coast of Vera Cruz. Here she was flagship of the Home Squadron between February and December 1846, serving in the Gulf of Mexico during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War under the command of Cmdre. David Conner and Capt. Thomas Dulay. Capt. French Forrest later took command when Dulay fell ill. Other notable officers in this cruise were future Civil War rivals Raphael Semmes and John Winslow. The ship oversaw the blockade of the eastern Mexican coast for most of the war. She participated in several aborted attacks on Mexican ports, before running aground on 28 July off the coast of Alvarado. The ship was freed and her ship's company later participated in a raid on Tabasco. The grounding damaged her enough to force her to retire to Norfolk for repairs. Her crew, however, stayed behind and swapped ships with the crew of the sister frigate Raritan, which had been at sea for three years. The old crew participated in the Siege of Veracruz as part of the Naval battery. Cumberland returned to Mexico just as a ceasefire was in place. Commodore Matthew C. Perry took over as flag officer from Conner. From Cumberland, Perry was instructed by the Polk Administration to assist settlers fleeing a major Mayan insurrection (known as the Caste War of Yucat√°n). Perry was also ordered to enforce the Monroe Doctrine and keep Spanish and English forces from interfering. With no realistic way to assist the settlers Perry partially ignored the order when Spanish warships arrived from Cuba loaded with guns, bullets, and money. Perry left the region when he read that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had been ratified. Second Mediterranean cruise Cumberland made her second cruise to the Mediterranean from 1849‚Äì1851. Notable officers on board during the second and third cruises to the Mediterranean included Louis M. Goldsborough, John H. Upshur, Silas Stringham, Andrew A. Harwood, John Worden (future commanding of officer of ), and naval surgeon Dr. Edward Squibb (co-founder of the company now known as Bristol-Myers Squibb). Cumberlands primary mission during these two cruises was to uphold American neutrality during a very turbulent period in European history by assisting American diplomats, merchants, and increasingly large number of American missionaries. The ship made visits to La Spezia (the U.S. Navy's new overseas homeport after being expelled from Port Mahon), Naples, Trieste, and Brindisi. At one point police in Naples boarded the ship based on a false rumor that Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi was on board. The ship also sailed to the eastern half the Mediterranean and visited Athens, Beirut, and Alexandria. Third Mediterranean cruise Cumberland holding a grand ball in the harbor of La Spezia, Kingdom of Sardinia, 1853 The third Mediterranean cruise departed from Boston on May 8, 1852. During the third cruise, the ship worked closely with diplomat and early environmentalist George Perkins Marsh who was serving as American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Marsh needed Cumberlands help in dealing with zealous Greek priests who were harassing American missionaries, notably Rev. Jonas King. Cmdre. Stringham and Marsh met with Greek monarch King Otto and stopped the harassment. Marsh needed Cumberland a second time when the powers of Europe were about to clash in the Crimean War. Stringham invited any American on board who felt they needed protection or assistance. Abd-ul-Mejid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, invited Stringham and Marsh for an official visit to determine the position of the U.S. in a possible war with Russia. Both Stringham and Marsh expressed their sympathies to the Sultan but maintained American neutrality on the subject. According to the autobiography of James Edward Watters (a crew member), during the third Cruise of the USS Cumberland in the Mediterranean, while the USS Cumberland was at Constantinople, \\"the Turkish garrison, in firing a salute, by mistake fired a shotted gun, the shot striking the water not a great distance from our boat. The Commodore (Stringham) said to the Captain (Goldsberry), 'Put an Officer in a boat and send him ashore to ask whether they want that salute returned the way they gave.' the officer started but was met an Officer (of the Turkish garrison) who apologized saying it was a mistake.\\"Autobiography of James Edward Watters, (1830-1902) ( The third was long even by 19th century standards. Due to a lack of sailors to man a replacement ship, SecNav James C. Dobbin did not recall Cumberland until the ship had been at sea for three years. The ship returned home to the Boston (MA) Navy Yard (AKA Charleston Navy Yard) in June, 1855. Conversion Depiction of Cumberland after her conversion from a frigate to a sloop of war. From 1855‚Äì1857, Cumberland was razeed at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston. From his office in Washington, D.C., John Lenthall, the Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, directed the changes to the ship. The Navy gave her new weapons in the form of 24 Dahlgren smoothbore cannons (22 x IX-inch and 2 x X-inch). By razeeing the ship, Cumberland got an extension of life. The Navy made her a lighter ship and thus slightly faster. Specifically, the shipyard workers removed the spar deck guns and lowered the bulwarks, decreasing the weight of the ship and reducing the crew and supply needs heavily. This move was assisted by the revolution in naval weapons that provided more powerful guns (and thus needing fewer guns). While steam powered ships were entering the fleet, there was still a need for all the sail ships. As late as 1860, Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey suggested that all Potomac-class frigates be razeed. Africa/slave trade patrol From 1857‚Äì1859, she cruised on the coast of Africa as flagship of the African Squadron patrolling for the suppression of the slave trade. Like many U.S. Navy ships in Africa, Cumberland employed a number of Krooman (indigenous Africans who lived on the western coast) to serve as scouts, interpreters, and fishermen. The ship's surgeons had to deal with a number of issues, including an outbreak of smallpox. Cumberland boarded several dozen merchant ships. Her crew almost seized one, the schooner Cortez, after shackles and known slave trading items had been found on the deck of the schooner, a slave trading holding pen had been spotted in the distance, the ship's papers were highly suspect, and the ship was far from any port. Cumberlands boarding officer, however, chose not seize the ship possibly realizing the legal difficulty of bringing slave traders to trial without overwhelming evidence. Cortez was later captured by HMS Arrow in 1858 off the coast of Cuba. Otherwise, the ship served as the squadron's supply vessel providing supplies to the other three ships in the squadron, the sloops-of-war Dale, Vincennes, and Marion and served as roving diplomat along the three thousand mile coast line. Home Squadron After her return from Africa, Cumberland became flagship of the Home Squadron in 1860. She made a return trip to Vera Cruz, which was in the middle of a civil war. The Navy recalled her to Hampton Roads, VA when domestic issues in the U.S. took a turn for the worse. American Civil War At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Cumberland was at the Gosport Navy Yard, with orders to monitor the situation in Norfolk and Portsmouth. After the attack on Fort Sumter, the ship's company was ordered to gather up or destroy U.S. Government property. This included several crates of small arms and possibly (not yet confirmed) gold from the U.S. Customs House in Norfolk. The company was also ordered to spike all 3,000 guns at the Navy Yard within just a few hours. This latter task was impossible, given that only 100 sailors were assigned to the task. Sailors from the Yard and the barracks ship Pennsylvania boarded Cumberland as a part of the evacuation. She was towed out of the yard by the steam sloop Pawnee, escaping destruction when other ships there were scuttled and burned by Union forces on 20 April 1861 to prevent their capture. She sailed back to Boston for repairs. The aft 10-inch Dahlgren was removed and replaced with what many officers referred to as a 70-pounder rifle. This gun did not exist in the Navy's inventory at the time. It was possibly a , Parrott rifle. CSS Virginia ramming and sinking Cumberland, 1862. She sailed back to Hampton Roads and took up station as a blockader, serving in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron until 8 March 1862. The sloop-of-war engaged Confederate forces in several minor actions in Hampton Roads and captured many small ships in the harbor. Additionally, Cumberland was a part of the expedition that captured the forts at Cape Hatteras. Cumberland was rammed and sunk in an engagement with the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia (formerly ) at Newport News, Virginia on 8 March 1862. The engagement known as the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads between the two ships is considered to be a turning point in the history of world naval affairs as it showed the advantage of steam- powered, armored ships over sail-powered wooden hulled ships. Because of Cumberland, Virginia lost two of her guns, her ram, and suffered some internal damage. Congress later recognized that Cumberland did more damage to Virginia than the U.S. Navy's ironclad Monitor, which did battle with Virginia the next day. One of the men who died aboard Cumberland was Navy chaplain John L. Lenhart, a Methodist minister. He was the first Navy chaplain to lose his life in battle.At the following webpage, scroll down to \\"Chaplain John L. Lenhart ‚Ä¢ Civil War ‚Ä¢ 1805‚Äì1862\\". The battle with Virginia was commemorated in a poem On Board the Cumberland that was illustrated by F. O. C. Darley.\\"On board the Cumberland (7 March 1862.)\\" by George H. Baker, in War Pictures; A selection of war lyrics with illustrations on wood F. O. C. Darley. 1866 Salvage Cumberland became an archaeological site the moment she sank to a watery grave, in that the federal government almost immediately solicited work from salvage companies to secure valuable items from the shipwreck. In his memoir, When the Yankees Came, Virginia resident George Benjamin West described some post-war work on Cumberland: Cumberland wreck. Image taken by a joint U.S. Navy/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expedition. Occasional salvage of the shipwrecks continued into the early 20th century. In 1909, part of Cumberlands anchor chain was recovered and sent to the museum of the Confederacy in Richmond (Newport News Daily Press, 12 November 1909). In 1981, the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) contracted with Underwater Archaeological Joint Ventures (UAJV), a private firm based in Yorktown, VA. UAJV team members consulted local watermen (whose oyster dredges had picked up artifacts for years) to help locate the ships. This information and a remote sensing survey, led archaeologists to two significant wrecks. The recovery of numerous artifacts confirmed that these shipwrecks were most likely Cumberland and CSS Florida. Artifacts recovered included fasteners, fittings, apothecary vessels, a ship's bell (from Cumberland), cannon fuses and other ordnance items. The artifacts proved the NUMA/UAJV team had indeed found Cumberland and Florida. Most of the artifacts from this NUMA/UAJV excavation are on exhibit at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum in Norfolk, VA (Newport News Daily Press, 8 March 1987). Cumberland today Cumberland is currently a ship wreck under the protection of several Federal laws including the Sunken Military Craft Act of 2005, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, and the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution (which gives the U.S. Government exclusive rights to its own property). Federal courts have upheld these laws and the U.S. Government's exclusive rights to its own ships. Since her sinking, the ship has been the subject of many expeditions. Some of these expeditions have been in violation of Federal law and artifacts were seized by Federal agents. Many artifacts from these expeditions (both legal and illegal) are at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum. Wreck is facing west to east, with the bow of the vessel slightly above the floor of Hampton Roads.

These forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. See also Theurgy.  Supplication or prayer  As a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon God, a god, goddess, or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for worship, this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the Lord's Prayer. All religions in general use invoking prayers, liturgies, or hymns; see for example the mantras in Hinduism and Buddhism, the Egyptian Coming Out by Day (aka Book of the Dead), the Orphic Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in cuneiform characters on clay tablets, addressed to Shamash, Ishtar, and other deities. In Islam, Invocation () is a prayer of supplication or request. Muslims regard this as a profound act of worship. Muhammad is reported to have said, \\"Dua is the very essence of worship.\\" = As alternative to prayer = An invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of Tulsa. Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in South Portland, Maine. In this usage, it is comparable to an affirmation as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking oaths of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or non-belief.  A form of possession  The word \\"possession\\" is used here in its neutral form to mean \\"a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another\\". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'. This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with demonic possession. In some religious traditions including Paganism, Shamanism and Wicca, \\"invocation\\" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from \\"evocation\\", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, Aleister Crowley states that > To \\"invoke\\" is to \\"call in\\", just as to \\"evoke\\" is to \\"call forth\\". This is > the essential difference between the two branches of Magick. In invocation, > the macrocosm floods the consciousness. In evocation, the magician, having > become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.Aleister Crowley, Magick, Book 4, > p.147 Possessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a religious vision). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan Charge of the Goddess is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the ritual of Drawing Down the Moon. The ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to loa possession in the Vodou tradition where devotees are described as being \\"ridden\\" or \\"mounted\\" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 National Geographic journalist Carol Beckwith described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions: > A woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of > glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps > a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. > Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the > sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had > not even reddened. Possessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where Odin is invoked to \\"ride\\" workers of seidr (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.Robert J Wallis, Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans, p.96  Command or conjuration  Some have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities. These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked. The following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in cuneiform on a statue of the Assyrian demon Pazuzu. Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective amulet with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions. > I am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends > impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am. Another example is found in the book Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches during the Conjuration of Diana, where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish: :I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt :Nor do I cook the honey with the wine :I bake the body and the blood and soul :The soul of (great) Diana that she shall :Know neither rest nor peace and ever be :In cruel suffering till she will grant what I request :What I do most desire :I beg it of her from my very heart! :And if the grace be granted, O Diana! :In honour of thee I will hold this feast :Feast and drain the goblet deep :We will dance and wildly leap :And if thou grant'st the grace which I require :Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps :Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!  Self-identification with certain spirits  Invocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of Aphrodite or the ferocity of Kali. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an archetype) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories. See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the Songs of Bilitis, first attributed to a contemporary of Sappho (but actually written by Pierre Lou√øs in the 1890s): > Mother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, > engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and > seeking joy within thyself, Astarte! Oh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and > nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, > nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! Thou who accordest > grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with > furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes > in the wood. Oh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, > Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of > my blood!From the Songs of Bilitis References External links * Supplication from the Quran and the Sunnah * Origins of Voodoo Category:Prayer Category:Anthropology of religion Category:Ritual ","title":"Invocation"},{"id":"265638","text":"In demonology, Orias (also spelled Oriax) is a Great Marquis of Hell, and has thirty legions of demons under his command.

Variations  The Lesser Key, the Munich Burnich, Rudd, and Weyer further agree in ranking Valac as a president and attributing him with the power to locate, summon, and control serpents. The Officium Spirituum similarly attributes Doolas with the power to give the summoner command of serpents as well as \\"household spirits,\\" but it ranks Cooler and Doolas as princes instead of presidents. Valac is listed 62nd in the Lesser Key (even by Rudd) and the 49th by Weyer, with either version claiming he leads 30 legions of demons (though some manuscripts say 38). The Munich Burnich describes Volach as controlling 27 legions of spirits. The Officium Spirituum (depending on the manuscript) ranks Coolor as either 21st (with no note of how many spirits he commands) or (in the copy found in the Folger Shakespeare Library) 22nd and commanding 13 legions of spirits. All extant and complete versions of the Officium Spirituum list Doolas as 25th demon, commanding 20 legions of spirits. Rudd's version uniquely has Valac opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Iahhel.

However, the character bears no resemblance with myth besides the name. In the film's interpretation, the demon is associated with snakes, seeking human possession to escape its confinement within the Cartha monastery of Romania. The Nun would later have a cameo in the 2017 film Annabelle: Creation and receive its own spin-off films, The Nun, released on September 7, 2018, and The Crooked Man, still in development. * Valac appears as the fourth boss in the game Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon for the Nintendo Switch and PC.

It comes from the Greek word Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ (d√°ktulos) = \\"finger\\". Sometimes the ending \\"-dactylia\\" is used. The derived adjectives end with \\"-dactyl\\" or \\"-dactylous\\". As a normal feature =Pentadactyly= Pentadactyly (from Greek œÄŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒµ (p√©nte) = \\"five\\" and Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ (d√°ktulos) = \\"finger\\") is the condition of having five digits on each limb. It is traditionally believed that all living tetrapods are descended from an ancestor with a pentadactyl limb, although many species have now lost or transformed some or all of their digits by the process of evolution. However, this viewpoint was challenged by Stephen Jay Gould in his 1991 essay \\"Eight (Or Fewer) Little Piggies\\", where he pointed out polydactyly in early tetrapods and described the specializations of digit reduction. Despite the individual variations listed below, the relationship is to the original five-digit model. In reptiles, the limbs are pentadactylous. Dogs and cats have tetradactylous paws but the dewclaw makes them pentadactyls. =Tetradactyly= Tetradactyly (from Greek tetra-=\\"four\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is the condition of having four digits on a limb, as in many amphibians, birds, and theropod dinosaurs. =Tridactyly= Tridactylous Allosaurus arm Tridactyly (from Greek tri- = \\"three\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is the condition of having three digits on a limb, as in the rhinoceros and ancestors of the horse such as Protohippus and Hipparion. These all belong to the Perissodactyla. Some birds also have three toes, including emus, bustards, and quail. =Didactyly= Didactyly (from Greek di-=\\"two\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") or bidactyly is the condition of having two digits on each limb, as in the Hypertragulidae and two-toed sloth, Choloepus didactylus. In humans this name is used for an abnormality in which the middle digits are missing, leaving only the thumb and fifth finger, or big and little toes. Cloven-hoofed mammals (such as deer, sheep and cattle - Artiodactyla) have only two digits, as do ostriches. =Monodactyly= Monodactyly (from Greek monos- = \\"one\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is the condition of having a single digit on a limb, as in modern horses and other equidae. Functional monodactyly, where the weight is supported on only one of multiple toes, can also occur, as in the theropod dinosaur Vespersaurus. As a congenital defect =Syndactyly= Human foot with partial simple syndactyly. Syndactyly (from Greek œÉœÖŒΩ- = \\"together\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is a condition where two or more digits are fused together. It occurs normally in some mammals, such as the siamang and most diprotodontid marsupials such as kangaroos. It occurs as an unusual condition in humans. =Polydactyly= Polydactyly (from Greek œÄŒøŒªœÖ- = \\"many\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is when a limb has more than the usual number of digits. This can be: * As a result of congenital abnormality in a normally pentadactyl animal. Polydactyly is very common among domestic cats. For more information, see polydactyly. * Polydactyly in early tetrapod aquatic animals, such as in Acanthostega gunnari (Jarvik 1952), one of an increasing number of genera of stem-tetrapods known from the Upper Devonian, which are providing insights into the appearance of tetrapods and the origin of limbs with digits. It also occurs secondarily in some later tetrapods, such as ichthyosaurs. The use of a term normally reserved for congenital defects reflects that it was regarded as an anomaly at the time, as it was believed that all modern tetrapods have either five digits or ancestors that did. =Oligodactyly= Oligodactyly (from Greek ·ΩÄŒªŒπŒ≥Œø- = \\"few\\" plus Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ = \\"finger\\") is having too few digits when not caused by an amputation. It is sometimes incorrectly called hypodactyly or confused with aphalangia, the absence of the phalanx bone on one or (commonly) more digits. When all the digits on a hand or foot are absent, it is referred to as adactyly. Ectrodactyly Ectrodactyly, also known as split-hand malformation, is the congenital absence of one or more central digits of the hands and feet. Consequently, it is a form of oligodactyly. News anchor Bree Walker is probably the best-known person with this condition, which affects about one in 91,000 people. It is conspicuously more common in the Vadoma in Zimbabwe. =Clinodactyly= Clinodactyly, is a medical term describing the curvature of a digit (a finger or toe) in the plane of the palm, most commonly the fifth finger (the \\"little finger\\") towards the adjacent fourth finger (the \\"ring finger\\"). It is a fairly common isolated anomaly which often goes unnoticed, but also occurs in combination with other abnormalities in certain genetic syndromes, such as Down Syndrome, Turner Syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. In birds Four types of bird feet (right foot diagrams) =Anisodactyly= Anisodactyly is the most common arrangement of digits in birds, with three toes forward and one back. This is common in songbirds and other perching birds, as well as hunting birds like eagles, hawks, and falcons. These types of legs help with perching and/or climbing and clinging. This occurs in Passeriformes, Columbiformes, falconiformes, accipitriformes, Galliformes and a vast majority of birds. =Syndactyly= Syndactyly, as it occurs in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that the third and fourth toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon). This is characteristic of Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, and relatives). =Zygodactyly= A green-winged macaw has raised its right foot to its beak. Zygodactyly (from Greek Œ∂œÖŒ≥ŒøœÇ, even) is an arrangement of digits in birds and chameleons, with two toes facing forward (digits 2 and 3) and two back (digits 1 and 4). This arrangement is most common in arboreal species, particularly those that climb tree trunks or clamber through foliage. Zygodactyly occurs in the parrots, woodpeckers (including flickers), cuckoos (including roadrunners), and some owls. Zygodactyl tracks have been found dating to 120‚Äì110 Ma (early Cretaceous), 50 million years before the first identified zygodactyl fossils. All Psittaciformes, Cuculiformes, the majority of Piciformes and the osprey are zygodactyl. =Heterodactyly= Heterodactyly is like zygodactyly, except that digits 3 and 4 point forward and digits 1 and 2 point back. This is found only in trogons. =Pamprodactyly= Pamprodactyly is an arrangement in which all four toes point forward, outer toes (toe 1 and sometimes 4) often if not regularly reversible. It is a characteristic of swifts (Apodidae) and mousebirds (Coliiformes). Chameleons The feet of chameleons are organized into bundles of a group of two and a group of three digits which oppose one another to grasp branches in a pincer-like arrangement. This condition has been called zygodactyly or didactyly, however, the specific arrangement in chameleons does not fit either definition. The feet of the front limbs in chameleons, for instance, are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1, 2 and 3, and a lateral bundle of digits 4 and 5, while the feet of the hind limbs are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1 and 2, and a lateral bundle of digits 3, 4 and 5. Zygodactyly by definition, on the other hand, involves digits 1 and 4 opposing digits 2 and 3, while chameleons do not exhibit this arrangement in either front or hind limbs. Further, didactyly involves only two digits per limb, while chameleons have five digits, despite being organized into two opposing bundles.  Aquatic tetrapods  In many secondarily aquatic vertebrates, the non-bony tissues of the forelimbs and/or hindlimbs are fused into a single flipper. Some remnant of each digit generally remains under the soft tissue of the flipper, though digit reduction gradually occurs such as in baleen whales (mysticeti). Marine mammals evolving flippers represents a classic example of convergent evolution, and by some analyses, parallel evolution. Full webbing of the digits in the manus and/or pes is present in a number of aquatic tetrapods. Such animals include marine mammals (cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds), marine reptiles (modern sea turtles and extinct ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, metriorhynchids), and flightless aquatic birds such as penguins. Hyperphalangy, or an increase in the number of phalanges beyond ancestral mammal and reptile conditions, is present in modern cetaceans and extinct marine reptiles. Schizodactyly Schizodactyly is a primate term for grasping and clinging with the second and third digit, instead of the thumb and second digit.

He is also the co- founder of CodeCon and organizer of the San Francisco Bay Area P2P-hackers meeting, and was the co-author of Codeville.  Early life and career  Cohen grew up in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City as the son of a teacher and computer scientist. He claims he learned the BASIC programming language at the age of 5 on his family's Timex Sinclair computer. Cohen passed the American Invitational Mathematics Examination to qualify for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) while he attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. He is also an alumnus of the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics program. He graduated from Stuyvesant in 1993 and attended SUNY Buffalo. He later dropped out of college to work for several dot com companies throughout the mid to late 1990s, the last being MojoNation, an ambitious but ill-fated project he worked on with Jim McCoy. MojoNation allowed people to break up confidential files into encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces on computers also running the software. If someone wanted to download a copy of this encrypted file, they would have to download it simultaneously from many computers. This concept, Cohen thought, was perfect for a file sharing program, since programs like KaZaA take a long time to download a large file because the file is (usually) coming from one source (or \\"peer\\"). Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many different sources, thus speeding up the download time, especially for users with faster download than upload speeds. Thus, the more popular a file is, the faster a user will be able to download it, since many people will be downloading it at the same time, and these people will also be uploading the data to other users. Cohen claims he has Asperger syndrome based on a self diagnosis.  BitTorrent  In April 2001, Cohen quit MojoNation and began work on BitTorrent. Cohen unveiled his novel ideas at the first CodeCon conference, which he and his roommate Len Sassaman created as a showcase event for novel technology projects after becoming disillusioned with the state of technology conferences. It remains an event for those seeking information about new directions in software, though BitTorrent continues to lay claim to the title of \\"most famous presentation\\". Cohen wrote the first BitTorrent client implementation in Python, and many other programs have since implemented the protocol. In the summer of 2002, Cohen collected free pornography to lure beta testers to use the program. BitTorrent gained its fame for its ability to quickly share large music and movie files online. Cohen has claimed he has never violated copyright law using his software. Regardless, he is outspoken in his belief that the current media business was doomed to being outmoded despite the RIAA and MPAA's legal or technical tactics, such as digital rights management. In May 2005, Cohen released a trackerless beta version of BitTorrent. In late 2003, Cohen had a short career at Valve working on Steam, their digital distribution system introduced for Half-Life 2. By 2004, he had left Valve and formed BitTorrent, Inc. with his brother Ross Cohen and business partner Ashwin Navin. In 2012 he announced a beta-version of BitTorrent Live for TV broadcasting through the Internet. Cohen left BitTorrent, Inc. in a day to day capacity to co-found Chia.Network in the fall of 2017. =BitTorrent and the MPAA= By mid-2005, BitTorrent, Inc. was funded by venture capitalist David Chao from Doll Capital Management, and in late 2005 Cohen and Navin made a deal with the MPAA to remove links to illegal content on the official BitTorrent website. The deal was with the seven largest studios in America. The agreement means the site will comply with procedures outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Personal life As of 2008, Cohen lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States, with his wife Jenna and their three children. Cohen's hobbies include original origami and juggling up to five balls, but his main interest is in recreational mathematics. Cohen maintains a blog where he frequently discusses trust metrics with Raph Levien, as well as money systems, games of skill, and other math-related topics. He is also an assembly puzzle enthusiast. He has designed several puzzles including some in conjunction with Oskar van Deventer including several gear-based puzzles such as Gear Shift and a multiple Rubik's Cube variant called Bram's Fortress. Some of Bram's puzzle designs are available for 3-D printing via Shapeways. Awards Cohen has received a number of awards for his work on the BitTorrent protocol. These awards include: * 2004 Wired Rave Award * 2005 MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. * 2005 Time's 100 Most Influential People * 2006 USENIX STUG Award * 2010 Internet Evolution 100 References External links * *Interview with Cohen about BitTorrent and CodeCon *Interview with Bram Cohen about legal issues and The Pirate Bay *Interview with Bram Cohen on NPR Category:American bloggers Category:American Jews Category:American computer programmers Category:Cypherpunks Category:Living people Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:BitTorrent Category:Recreational mathematicians Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:People from San Francisco Category:People from the Upper West Side ","title":"Bram Cohen"},{"id":"265667","text":"Pattern Recognition is a novel by science fiction writer William Gibson published in 2003. Set in August and September 2002, the story follows Cayce Pollard, a 32-year-old marketing consultant who has a psychological sensitivity to corporate symbols. The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges the effectiveness of a proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet. The novel's central theme involves the examination of the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49. Pattern Recognition is Gibson's eighth novel and his first one to be set in the contemporary world. Like his previous work, it has been classified as a science fiction and postmodern novel, with the action unfolding along a thriller plot line. Critics approved of the writing but found the plot unoriginal and some of the language distracting. The book peaked at number four on the New York Times Best Seller list, was nominated for the 2003 British Science Fiction Association Award, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and Locus Awards.  Background  Before writing Pattern Recognition, the author, William Gibson, published seven novels (one co-written) and numerous short stories beginning in 1977. His previous novel, All Tomorrow's Parties, was published in October 1999 as the conclusion of the Bridge trilogy. Pattern Recognition was written between 2001 and 2002 while Gibson was living in Vancouver, British Columbia and released in February 2003. Pattern Recognition was originally intended to be a stand-alone novel, but afterwards Gibson wrote Spook Country and Zero History which take place in the same universe and use some of the same characters. Gibson traveled to Tokyo in 2001 to prepare for this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100 pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and \\"realized [the novel] had become a story that took place in an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened\\". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, \\"There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But I took that out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually happening.\\"  Plot summary  Advertising consultant Cayce Pollard, who reacts to logos and advertising as if to an allergen, arrives in London in August 2002. She is working on a contract with the marketing firm Blue Ant to judge the effectiveness of a proposed corporate logo for a shoe company. During the presentation, graphic designer Dorotea Benedetti becomes hostile towards Cayce as she rejects the first proposal. After dinner with some Blue Ant employees, the company founder Hubertus Bigend offers Cayce a new contract: to uncover who is responsible for distributing a series of anonymous, artistic film clips via the internet. Cayce had been following the film clips and participating in an online discussion forum theorizing on the clips' meaning, setting, and other aspects. Wary of corrupting the artistic process and mystery of the clips, she reluctantly accepts. Cayce is not entirely comfortable with Ivy's chat group called \\"Fetish:Footage:Forum\\" (or F:F:F), as shown by the following excerpt: A friend from the discussion group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying a friend of a friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this. Through a completely random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's word processor, for example). Another collector, and sometime 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, is a retired cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips. Cayce flies to Moscow to meet Stella in person and watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an assassination attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal that they have been spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.  Characters  * Cayce Pollard ‚Äì A 32-year-old woman who lives in New York City. She pronounces her given name \\"Case\\" although her parents named her after Edgar Cayce. She uses her interest in marketing trends and fads, and her psychological sensitivity to logos and advertising, in her work as an advertising consultant. Her sensitivity becomes a phobia towards older corporate mascots, especially the Michelin Man. She wears only black, gray or white, usually Fruit of the Loom shrunken cotton T-shirts (all tags removed) with Levis jeans (with the trademarks filed off the buttons) or skirts, tights, boots, as well as a black Buzz Rickson MA-1 bomber jacket.

The website's intention is to discuss the anonymous film postings.  Style and story elements  The novel uses a third-person narrative in the present tense with a somber tone reminiscent of a \\"low-level post- apocalypticism\\". Cayce's memories of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which briefly use the future tense, are told by Gibson as \\"a Benjaminian seed of time\\", as one reviewer calls it, because of the monistic and lyrical descriptions of Cayce's relationship to objects with the attacks in the background.. Two neologisms appear in the novel: gender-bait and mirror-world. Gibson created the term mirror-world to acknowledge a locational-specific distinction in a manufactured object that emerged from a parallel development process, for example opposite-side driving or varied electrical outlets. Gender-bait refers to a male posing as a female online to elicit positive responses. The term coolhunter, not coined by Gibson but used in the marketing industry for several years, is used to describe Cayce's profession of identifying the roots of emerging trends.. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing a break with the past with Cayce's father, who disappears during the attacks, as the personification of the 20th century. Gibson viewed the attacks as a nodal point after which \\"nothing is really the same\\". One reviewer commented that in \\"Gibson's view, 9-11 was the end of history; after it we are without a history, careening toward an unknown future without the benefit of a past‚Äîour lives before 9-11 are now irrelevant.\\" Cayce's search for her father and Damien's excavation of the German bomber symbolize the historicist search for a method to interpret people's actions in the past. Coming to terms with her father's disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to the 20th century, something that may have been influenced by Gibson coming to terms with the loss of his own father. The film clips are a motif used to enhance the theme of the desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are released over the internet and gain a cult following, in the same way that the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006.. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future.. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name- dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.  Major themes  = Pattern recognition = The central theme throughout the novel involves the natural human propensity to search for meaning with the constant risk of apophenia. Followers of the seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are revealed to be victims of apophenia as the clips are just edited surveillance camera footage. Likewise, Cayce's mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after Cayce's father disappears. Science fiction critic Thomas Wagner underscores the desire for meaning, or pattern recognition, using a comparison between the film clips and Cayce's search for her father after the attacks: > [T]he very randomness and ineffability of the clips flies in the face of our > natural human tendency towards pattern recognition ... [T]he subculture that > surrounds \\"following the footage\\" ... [is] an effective plot device for > underscoring the novel's post-9/11 themes: to wit, the uncertainty of the > fabric of day-to-day life people began to feel following that event ‚Ä¶ [We] > as people don't like uncertainty, don't like knowing that there's something > we can't comprehend. And if we can't fit something into an existing pattern, > then by golly we'll come up with one. Within the marketing world, Cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel, but rather a paragon of the system. Inescapably within the system, she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns. The review in The Village Voice calls this search \\"a survival tactic within the context of no context‚Äîdowsing for meaning, and sometimes settling for the illusion of meaning\\". = Memory of history = Using 20th-century relics, such as a Curta calculator, an excavated Stuka, Hobbs Baranov, and Voytek's planned ZX81 show, Gibson raises the question of how a contemporary society views past societies. Gibson portrays the past century as dominated by conflict, suspicion, and espionage. Following the disappearance of Cayce's father, a designer of embassy security systems, on September 11, 2001, Cayce is left feeling \\"ungrieved\\" until she reviews footage and records of that day tracking his movements until he vanishes. Following this line of thought Gibson raises the question of how the future will view today's society. The novel \\"adopts a postmodern historicism\\" perspective, through the arguments presented by Bigend, Cayce, and Parkaboy. Bigend and Cayce's view of history are compared to those of philosopher Benedetto Croce in that they believe history is open for interpretation when re-written from the frame of reference of another society. Parkaboy rejects this view, believing that history can be an exact science. = Originality and monoculture = The book explores a tension between originality and monoculture by focusing on the artist's relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's \\"loyalty and love\\" involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, \\"simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul.\\"Gibson 2003, p18. One critic points out that the marketing agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: \\"it's a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp's young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool.\\" On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson's product positioning language and Cayce's analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community. = Branding, identity, and globalization = The novel's language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it \\"a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... [where] an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... [creates] class status as a matter of knowing the score rather than of having money and power\\". He also calls it \\"postmodern nominalism\\" in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel's \\"new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity\\". One character argues that \\"there will soon be no national identity left ‚Ä¶ [as] all experience [will be] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing.\\"Gibson 2003, p341. This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets. As an example, Gibson writes how one 'yes or no' decision by Cayce on the logo will impact the lives of the people in remote places who will manufacture the logos and how it will infect their dreams.  Genre  While some reviewers regard the novel as a thriller, others see it as an example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the \\"technocultural future-present\\".. Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of illustrating society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are \\"[t]he Footage and Cayce's special talents\\" but that he \\"never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future\\". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: > [s]cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of > approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the > world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, > where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the > middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an > occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer > must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, > a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science > fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in > the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the > world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the > story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is that we live in a time > of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that > boat, like it or not. A novel set in the \\"real world\\" now has to answer the > question, \\"Which one?\\" These elements, and the use of the September 11, 2001 attacks as a breaking point from the past, led academics to label it a postmodern novel. The attacks mark the point where the 'modern', that is the 20th-century certainty in society's advancement towards a better future, changed to the 'postmodern', that is the 21st-century uncertainty in which future will develop. Fredric Jameson finds Gibson using culture as the determinant of change for the first time with this novel, rather than technology. Jameson focuses on the novel's \\"postmodern nominalism\\" that uses brand names to refresh old objects and experiences. In post-structural literary theory Cayce is compared with the main character, Oedipa Maas, of Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and, if there is one, whether it is real or conspiracy. Gibson's use of name-dropping brands to create a sense of \\"in-group style ‚Ä¶ of those in the know\\" is traced back to Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel V. . Gibson's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage, in this case) to drive the story. Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell. While markedly different from his previous writing, in that it is not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies, Pattern Recognition includes many of his previous elements, including impacts of technology shifts on society, Japanese computer experts and Russian mafia figures. In common with Gibson's previous work, Paul Di Filippo found the following in Pattern Recognition: \\"the close observation of the culture's bleeding edge; an analysis of the ways technology molds our every moment; the contrasting of boardroom with street; the impossibility and dire necessity of making art in the face of instant co-optation; the damaged loner facing the powers-that-be, for both principle and profit\\"..  Reception  Pattern Recognition was released on February 3, 2003 as Gibson launched a 15-city tour. The novel was featured on the January 19 cover of The New York Times Book Review. In the American market it peaked at number four on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction on February 23 and spent nine weeks on USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling Books peaking at number 34. Requires navigation to Pattern Recognition or William Gibson entry. In the Canadian market, the novel peaked at number three on The Globe and Mail's best seller list on February 15 in the hardcover fiction category.. The novel was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and the British Science Fiction Association Award. Gibson's writing was positively received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: \\"[w]ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics\\" and Danvers wrote that \\"no sentence has a subject if it can do without one\\". One critic found the prose to be as \\"hard and compact as glacier ice\\" and another that it \\"gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity\\". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that \\"Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war\\". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: > As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide > from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. > But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. > Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters > and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal > e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the > texture of Internet culture: how it feels to be close to someone you know > only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your > browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be \\"awkward in its effort to appear \\"cool\\" \\" while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette review commented that the \\"constant, unadulterated \\"hipster- technocrat, cyber-MTV\\" lingo [is] overdone and inappropriate\\" On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that \\"Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book\\". Some critics found the plot to be a conventional \\"unravel-the-secret\\" and \\"woman on a quest\\" thriller. Toby Litt wrote that \\"[j]udged just as a thriller, Pattern Recognition takes too long to kickstart, gives its big secrets away before it should and never puts the heroine in believable peril\\". The conclusion, called \\"unnecessarily pat\\" by one critic, was compared by Litt with the \\"ultimate fantasy ending of 1980s movies ‚Äì the heroine has lucked out without selling out, has kept her integrity but still ended up filthy rich.\\" The review in the Library Journal called the novel a \\"melodrama of beset geekdom\\" that \\"may well reveal the emptiness at the core of Gibson's other fiction\\", but recommended it for all libraries due to the author's popularity.  Publication history  Book covers for the (top left to right) North American (paperback), British (hard cover), British (paperback), Dutch, French, (bottom left to right) Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Polish releases The hardcover edition, released in February 2003, was published by the Penguin Group imprint G. P. Putnam's Sons. Berkley Books published the trade paperback one year later, on February 3, 2004, and a mass market paperback in February 2005. In the UK the paperback was published by Penguin Books a year after its Viking Press imprint published the hardcover version. In 2004 it was published in French, Danish, Japanese, German, and Spanish. In 2005 the book was published in Russia. The translation made by Nikita Krasnikov was awarded as the best translation of the year. Tantor Media published the 10.5-hour-long, unabridged audiobook on April 1, 2004 and re-released it on January 1, 2005. Voiced by Shelly Frasier, it was criticized by John Adams of Locus as being pleasant but with distracting dialects.. The audiobook is available as a digital download from audible.com.  Adaptations  The digital radio station BBC 7 broadcast (now BBC Radio 4 Extra) an abridged version of the novel, voiced by Lorelei King, in five 30-minute episodes in February and October 2007. Post-punk band Sonic Youth included a track called \\"Pattern Recognition\\" on their 2004 album Sonic Nurse that opens with the lyric \\"I'm a cool hunter making you my way\\". A film adaptation was initiated in April 2004 with producer Steve Golin's production company Anonymous Content and the studio Warner Bros. Pictures hiring director Peter Weir. Screenwriters David Arata, D. B. Weiss, and Weir co-wrote the screenplay but in May 2007, Gibson commented on his personal blog that he believed Weir would not be proceeding with the project. In 2014 it was announced that Morten Tyldum had been attached to the project.

Named for its laugh-like call, it is an opportunistic omnivore and scavenger. It breeds in large colonies mostly along the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The two subspecies are: L. a. megalopterus ‚Äì which can be seen from southeast Canada down to Central America, and L. a. atricilla which appears from the West Indies to the Venezuelan islands. The laughing gull was long placed in the genus Larus until its present placement in Leucophaeus, which follows the American Ornithologists' Union. Name The genus name Leucophaeus is from Ancient Greek leukos, \\"white\\", and phaios, \\"dusky\\". The specific atricilla is from Latin ater, \\"black\\", and cilla, \\"tail\\". Linnaeus appears to have misread his note atricapilla (black-haired), which would have been much more appropriate for this black-headed, but white-tailed, bird. Range It breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Northernmost populations migrate farther south in winter, and this species occurs as a rare vagrant to western Europe. The laughing gull's English name is derived from its raucous kee-agh call, which sounds like a high-pitched laugh \\"ha... ha... ha...\\". Laughing gulls breed in coastal marshes and ponds in large colonies. The large nest, made largely from grasses, is constructed on the ground. The three or four greenish eggs are incubated for about three weeks. Description This species is easy to identify. It is long with a wingspan and a weight range of 203‚Äì371g (7.2-13.1 oz). The summer adult's body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. Its wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the smaller Franklin's gull, and they have black tips without the white crescent shown by Franklin's. The beak is long and red. The black hood is mostly lost in winter. Laughing gulls take three years to reach adult plumage. Immature birds are always darker than most similar-sized gulls other than Franklin's. First-year birds are greyer below and have paler heads than first-year Franklin's, and second-years can be distinguished by the wing pattern and structure. Subspecies The two subspecies are: *L. a. megalopterus ‚Äì (Bruch, 1855): coastal southeast Canada, eastern & southern United States, Mexico & Central America *L. a. atricilla ‚Äì (Linnaeus, 1758): West Indies to Venezuelan islands Like most other members of the genus Leucophaeus, the laughing gull was long placed in the genus Larus. The present placement in Leucophaeus follows the American Ornithologists' Union.

Beehive in Wellington New Zealand's first flag, the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, was adopted in 1834, six years before New Zealand's separation from New South Wales and creation as a separate colony following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Chosen by an assembly of MƒÅori chiefs at Waitangi in 1834, the flag was of a St George's Cross with another cross in the canton containing four stars on a blue field. After the formation of the colony in 1840, British ensigns began to be used. The current flag was designed and adopted for use on the colony's ships in 1869, was quickly adopted as New Zealand's national flag, and given statutory recognition in 1902. For several decades there has been debate about changing the flag. In 2016, a two-stage binding referendum on a flag change took place with voting on the second final stage closing on 24 March. In this referendum, the country voted to keep the existing flag by 57% to 43%. Design = Devices = Flags of the Union Jack.svg Southern Cross (New Zealand).svg The flag of New Zealand uses two prominent symbols: * The Union Jack (or Union Flag) * The Southern Cross (or Crux) In its original usage as the flag of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union Jack combined three heraldic crosses which represent the countries of the United Kingdom (as constituted in 1801): * The red St George's Cross of England * The white diagonal St Andrew's Cross of Scotland * The red diagonal St Patrick's Cross of Ireland The Union Jack reflects New Zealand's origins as a British colony. The Southern Cross constellation is one of the striking features of the Southern Hemisphere sky, and has been used to represent New Zealand, among other Southern Hemisphere colonies, since the early days of European settlement. Additionally, in MƒÅori mythology the Southern Cross is identified as MƒÅhutonga, an aperture in Te Ikaroa (the Milky Way) through which storm winds escaped. =Specifications= The flag should be rectangular in shape and its length should be two times its width, translating into an aspect ratio of 1:2. It has a royal blue background with a Union Jack in the canton, and four five-pointed red stars centred within four five-pointed white stars on the fly (outer or right-hand side). The exact colours are specified as Pantone 186 C (red), Pantone 280 C (blue), and white. According to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the government department responsible for the flag, the royal blue background is \\"reminiscent of the blue sea and sky surrounding us\\", and the stars \\"signify [New Zealand's] place in the South Pacific Ocean\\". The notice that appeared in the New Zealand Gazette on 27 June 1902 gave a technical description of the stars and their positions on the New Zealand Ensign: Flag law and protocol The flag flying at half-mast from the Matariki Building at University of Canterbury on the day of the death of Sir Edmund Hillary The Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 governs the usage of the national flag and all other official flags. This Act, like most other laws, can be amended or repealed by a simple majority in Parliament. Section 5(2) of the Act declares the flag to be \\"the symbol of the Realm, Government, and people of New Zealand\\". Section 11(1) outlines two offences: altering the flag without lawful authority, and using, displaying, damaging or destroying the flag in or within view of a public place with the intention of dishonouring it. The Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage has authority to prescribe when and how the flag should be flown and what the standard sizes, dimensions, proportions and colours should be. In its advisory role, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage has issued guidelines to assist persons in their use of the flag. No permission is needed to fly the flag, and it may be flown on every day of the year‚Äîgovernment and public buildings with flagpoles are especially encouraged to fly the flag during working hours. However, it should never be flown in a dilapidated condition. Unlike some other countries there is no single official \\"Flag Day\\" in New Zealand, and no pledge of allegiance to the flag. Flag flying may be encouraged on certain commemorative days, at the discretion of the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. The flag can only be used as a vehicle flag by certain high-ranking officeholders, including: the Prime Minister and other ministers; ambassadors and high commissioners (when overseas); and the Chief of Defence Force. In such cases, no distinguishing defacement or fringing of the flag is used. The flag is flown at half-mast in New Zealand‚Äîalways at the discretion of the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage‚Äîto indicate a period of mourning. Notable occasions on which the flag was half-masted include: the death of former prime minister David Lange, and the death and state funeral of mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary. When the flag is flown at half-mast, it should be lowered to a position recognisably at half-mast to avoid the appearance of a flag which has accidentally fallen away from the top of the flagpole; the flag should be at least its own height from the top of the flagpole. History = Flag of the United Tribes = The need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear in 1830 when the trading ship Sir George Murray, built in the Hokianga, was seized by Customs officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had been sailing without a flag, a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. Among the passengers on the ship were two high-ranking MƒÅori chiefs, believed to be Patuone and Taonui. The ship's detention was reported as arousing indignation among the MƒÅori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships could continue to be seized. Waitangi, flying (left ‚Äì right) the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, the Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Union Jack, 5 February 2006 The first flag of New Zealand was adopted 9 (or 20) March 1834 by a vote made by the United Tribes of New Zealand, a meeting of MƒÅori chiefs convened at Waitangi by British resident James Busby. The United Tribes later made the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand at Waitangi in 1835. Three flags were proposed, all designed by the missionary Henry Williams, who was to play a major role in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The chiefs rejected two other proposals which included the Union Jack, in favour of a modified St George's Cross or the White Ensign, which was the flag used by Henry Williams on the Church Missionary Society ships. This flag became known as the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand and was officially gazetted in New South Wales in August 1835, with a general description not mentioning fimbriation or the number of points on the stars. The United Tribes' flag is still flown on the flag pole at Waitangi, and can be seen on Waitangi Day. =Union Jack= After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Union Jack was used, although the former United Tribes flag was still used by a number of ships from New Zealand and in many cases on land. The New Zealand Company settlement at Wellington, for example, continued to use the United Tribes flag until Governor William Hobson sent a small armed force to Wellington in May 1840 (following his declaration of British sovereignty). The Union Jack was described as the \\"superior flag\\", to be flown above the New Zealand flag prior to 1965. =Flags based on defaced Blue Ensign= During the Invasion of the Waikato (July 1863 ‚Äì April 1864) period of the New Zealand Wars the Imperial British forces realised they needed access to colonial ships to fight MƒÅori. The Colonial government acquired vessels which were staffed by Royal Navy officers but owned by the colonial government. The vessels were under local and not Admiralty control. An armed ship, Victoria, owned by the Colony of Victoria transported reinforcements to New Zealand for the campaign and took part in bombardments of MƒÅori. The British government was concerned about its colonies developing their own navies, not under the control of the Royal Navy's Admiralty. This led to the British parliament passing the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, which allowed the colonial governments to own ships, including for military purposes, but they would have to be under the Royal Navy's command. In 1866 the British Admiralty advised colonies that if they possessed vessels governed by the Act, they must fly the Royal Navy Blue Ensign but that they must also include on the flag the seal or badge of the colony. New Zealand did not have a colonial badge, or indeed a coat of arms of its own at this stage, and so in 1867 the letters \\"NZ\\" were simply added to the blue ensign, following a decree by Governor George Grey on 15 January 1867. Admiral Albert Hastings Markham, designer of the flag of New Zealand In 1869 the then First Lieutenant of the Royal Navy vessel Blanche, Albert Hastings Markham, submitted a design to Sir George Bowen, the Governor of New Zealand, for a national ensign for New Zealand. This followed a request by Bowen to Markham to come up with a new flag design, following a request to Bowen from the Colonial Office. His proposal, incorporating the Southern Cross, was approved on 23 October 1869. It was initially to be used only on government ships. To end confusion between various designs of the flag, New Zealand's Liberal Government passed the New Zealand Ensign Act 1901, which was approved by King Edward VII on 24 March 1902. = Flown in battle = One of the first recorded accounts of the New Zealand Blue Ensign flag being flown in battle was at Quinn's Post, Gallipoli, in 1915. It was not, however, flown officially. The flag was brought back to New Zealand by Private John Taylor, Canterbury Battalion. The first time the flag of New Zealand was flown in a naval battle and the first time officially in any battle, was from HMS Achilles during the Battle of the River Plate in 1939. Debate The New Zealand flag is often mistaken for the flag of Australia (pictured), since they are similar in design. With the Union Jack in its upper left-hand quarter, the flag still proclaims New Zealand's origins as a British colony. Some New Zealanders believe there should be a new flag which better reflects the country's independence, while others argue that the design represents New Zealand's strong past and present ties to the United Kingdom and its history as a part of the British Empire. Debate about changing the flag has often arisen in connection with the issue of republicanism in New Zealand. The Southern Cross constellation is depicted on the flags of other former British colonies, such as the flag of Australia‚Äîalthough in Australia's case there are six all-white stars, while New Zealand's four stars have red centres. The Australian and New Zealand flags are often mistaken for each other, and this confusion has been cited as a reason for adopting a different design. Debate on keeping or changing the New Zealand flag started before May 1973, when a remit to change the flag was voted down by the Labour Party at their national conference. In November 1979 Minister of Internal Affairs Allan Highet suggested that the design of the flag should be changed, and sought an artist to design a new flag with a silver fern on the fly, but the proposal attracted little support. In March 1994 Prime Minister Jim Bolger made statements supporting a move towards a republic. Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill. If passed, the Bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag and added New Zealand's anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The Bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37. In 1998 Prime Minister Jenny Shipley backed Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler's call for the flag to be changed. Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, backed the quasi-national silver fern flag‚Äîusing a silver fern on a black background, along the lines of the Canadian Maple Leaf flag‚Äîas a possible alternative flag. On 5 August 2010 Labour list MP Charles Chauvel introduced a member's bill for a consultative commission followed by a referendum on the New Zealand flag. = 2015‚Äì16 referendums = silver fern flag of the 2015 referendum designed by Kyle Lockwood On 11 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced in a speech his intention to hold a referendum, during the next parliamentary term, on adopting a new flag. Following National's re-election the details of the two referendums were announced. The first referendum was set for November 2015 allowing voters to decide on a preferred design from five choices. The second referendum would see the preferred design voted on against the current flag in March 2016. Had the flag changed, the current flag (described as the \\"1902 flag\\") of New Zealand would have been \\"recognised as a flag of historical significance\\", and its continued use would have been permitted Official documents depicting the current flag would have been replaced only through ordinary means, e.g. an existing driving licence would have remained valid until its renewal date. On 11 December 2015, preliminary results were announced for the first referendum. The blue and black design, with a silver fern and red stars, was the winning flag. This flag design did not win the second referendum; according to preliminary results announced on 24 March 2016, the existing 1902 flag was chosen to remain the New Zealand flag. 56.7% were in favour of retaining the flag, with a voter turnout of 67.3%. 43.3% were in favour of changing the flag to the Lockwood design. New Zealand Red Ensign The Red Ensign is mainly used as a civil ensign. A red version of the flag, officially called the Red Ensign and nicknamed the \\"red duster\\", was adopted in 1903 to be flown on non- government ships. It was flown on New Zealand merchant ships during both world wars. The Red Ensign has sometimes been flown incorrectly on land in the belief that it is the national flag. The Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 does allow for the Red Ensign to be used on land on occasions of MƒÅori significance, continuing the long preference of MƒÅori for the use of red in flags. Other New Zealand flags National flag alongside the tino rangatiratanga flag on Auckland Harbour Bridge on Waitangi Day, 2012 The flag commonly known as the tino rangatiratanga (MƒÅori sovereignty) flag was designed in 1989. It has been acknowledged as a national flag for the MƒÅori. There are two official flags which, when flown in the appropriate circumstance, take precedence over the national flag of New Zealand: *The Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand, adopted in 1962, depicts the New Zealand coat of arms in banner form defaced with a roundel containing the letter 'E' and a crown. The personal flag is flown continuously on any building in which the Queen is in residence and by a ship transporting the Queen in New Zealand waters. *The Flag of the Governor-General of New Zealand is flown continuously in the presence of the governor-general. The flag in its present form was adopted in 2008, and is a blue banner with a shield of the New Zealand coat of arms surmounted by a crown. In addition, the New Zealand Police, New Zealand Fire Service, New Zealand Customs Service, and the services of the New Zealand Defence Force have their own flags. A few local authorities have commissioned their own flags, such as Otago.

Van and Schenck horsing around in 1918 Van and Schenck were popular United States entertainers in the 1910s and 1920s: Gus Van (born August Von Glahn, August 12, 1886 ‚Äì March 12, 1968), baritone, and Joe Schenck (pronounced \\"skenk\\"; born Joseph Thuma Schenck, (June 2, 1891‚Äì June 28, 1930), tenor. They were vaudeville stars and made appearances in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921. They made numerous phonograph records for the Emerson, Victor, and Columbia record companies. History With Schenck on piano, the duo sang and performed comedy routines. Van was especially adept at dialect humor, and could imitate any number of regional and continental accents. One of the team's typical novelty hits was Pastafazoola, in praise of Italian food and sung in the appropriate style. Van's hearty baritone and Schenck's high tenor harmonized well, and the team became known as \\"the pennant-winning battery of songland.\\" They performed on radio shows and appeared in early talking motion pictures, including several musical shorts‚Äîin both Vitaphone and MGM Movietone‚Äîand one feature, the MGM film They Learned About Women (1930). During the first world war, they recorded humorous songs such as \\"I Don't Want to Get Well\\" which told the tale of a wounded soldier who did not want to recover, as he was comfortable in hospital and in love with a nurse. After Schenck's death in 1930 of heart disease, Van continued to perform as a solo artist on stage, screen, and radio. He appeared in many New York-produced Soundies in 1941. Schenck was buried in The Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn.

Early life Gillies was born in Dunedin, New Zealand. He attended Wanganui Collegiate School and studied medicine at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where despite a stiff elbow sustained sliding down the banisters at home as a child, he was an excellent sportsman. He was a golf blue in 1903, 1904 and 1905 and also a rowing blue, competing in the 1904 Boat Race. Career =World War I= Walter Yeo, a sailor injured at the Battle of Jutland, is assumed to be the first person to receive plastic surgery in 1917. The photograph shows him before (left) and after (right) receiving a flap surgery performed by Gillies. Following the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Initially posted to Wimereux, near Boulogne, he acted as medical minder to a French-American dentist, Valadier, who was not allowed to operate unsupervised but was attempting to develop jaw repair work. Gillies, eager after seeing Valadier experimenting with nascent skin graft techniques, then decided to leave for Paris, to meet the renowned oral surgeon Hippolyte Morestin. He saw him remove a tumour on a patient's face, and cover it with jaw skin taken from the patient. Gillies became enthusiastic about the work and on his return to England persuaded the army's chief surgeon, William Arbuthnot-Lane, that a facial injury ward should be established at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot. This rapidly proved inadequate and a new hospital devoted to facial repairs was developed at Sidcup. The Queen's Hospital opened in June 1917 and with its convalescent units provided over 1,000 beds. There Gillies and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery; more than 11,000 operations were performed on over 5,000 men (mostly soldiers with facial injuries, usually from gunshot wounds).The hospital, later to become Queen Mary's Hospital, was at Frognal House (the birthplace and property of Thomas Townshend, Lord Sydney after whom Sydney, Australia was named). For his war services Gillies was knighted in the Birthday Honours list of June 1930. Arbuthnot-Lane commented, \\"Better late than never\\". =Private practice= Frognal House, formerly Queen Mary's Hospital, in 2002 Between the wars Gillies developed a substantial private practice with Rainsford Mowlem, including many famous patients, and travelled extensively, lecturing, teaching and promoting the most advanced techniques worldwide. In 1930 Gillies invited his cousin, Archibald McIndoe to join the practice, and also suggested he apply for a post at St Bartholomew's Hospital. This was the point at which McIndoe became committed to plastic surgery, in which he too became pre-eminent. =World War II= During World War II Gillies acted as a consultant to the Ministry of Health, the RAF and the Admiralty. He organised plastic surgery units in various parts of Britain and inspired colleagues to do the same, including pioneering plastic surgeon Stewart Harrison who founded the plastic surgery unit at Wexham Park Hospital, Berkshire. His own work continued at Rooksdown House, part of the Park Prewett Hospital, Basingstoke. During this period, and after the war, he trained many doctors from Commonwealth nations in plastic surgery. =Pioneering sex reassignment surgery= Instead of retiring at the end of the Second World War Gillies had to keep working as he had insufficient savings. In 1946, he and a colleague carried out one of the first sex reassignment surgeries from female to male on Michael Dillon. In 1951 he and colleagues carried out one of the first modern sex reassignment surgery from male to female using a flap technique on Roberta Cowell, which became the standard for 40 years. Gillies made a visit to New Zealand in 1956 after an absence of 51 years. Death Gillies suffered a slight cerebral thrombosis at the age of 78 while undertaking a major operation on the damaged leg of an 18-year-old girl on 3 August 1960.Meikle. Page 196. Gillies died on 10 September 1960 at The London Clinic, at 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone. Despite earning an estimated ‚Ç§30,000 per year between the First and Second World Wars he left an estate of only ‚Ç§21,161. Personal life Gillies married Kathleen Margaret Jackson on 9 November 1911, in London. They had four children. His eldest son, John Gillies, flew Spitfires with No. 92 Squadron RAF in World War II. John was shot down over France on 23 May 1940, and became a POW for the duration of the war. Harold's youngest son Michael Thomas Gillies followed his father into medicine. Actor Daniel Gillies is his descendant. Gillies was a well-known amateur golfer. He played in the Amateur Championship every year from 1906 to 1931 and represented England in their annual match against Scotland in 1908, 1925, 1926 and 1927. He won the 1913 St. George's Grand Challenge Cup and was runner-up in the 1914 Golf Illustrated Gold Vase, behind Harold Hilton. He won the President's Putter in 1925. His older brother Charles won the 1899 Australian Amateur. For many years his home was at 71 Frognal, in the heart of London's Hampstead village. A blue plaque on the front of that house now commemorates his life and work. In 2015, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge built 12 houses and named their road Harold Gillies Close (CB5 8ZD) in his honour. Selected publications * Gillies HD. Plastic Surgery of the Face.

It bears the unofficial nicknames \\"Methuselah\\" and \\"the Genesis planet\\" due to its extreme age and a few popular sources refer to this object as \\"PSR B1620-26 c\\" (see below for discussion). The planet is in a circumbinary orbit around the two stars of PSR B1620-26 (which are a pulsar (PSR B1620-26 A) and a white dwarf (WD B1620-26)) and is the first circumbinary planet ever confirmed. It is also the first planet found in a globular cluster. The planet is one of the oldest known extrasolar planets, believed to be about 12.7 billion years old. Characteristics =Mass, orbit, and age= PSR B1620-26 b has a mass of 2.627 times that of Jupiter, and orbits at a distance of 23 AU (3.4 billion km), a little larger than the distance between Uranus and the Sun. Each orbit of the planet takes about 100 years. The triple system is just outside the core of the globular cluster Messier 4. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time, and planets form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 billion years old. This is much older than any other known planet, and nearly three times as old as Earth. It has been undergoing many stages through its lifetime. =Host stars= PSR B1620-26 b orbits a pair of stars. The primary star, PSR B1620-26, is a pulsar, a neutron star spinning at 100 revolutions per second, with a mass of 1.34 , a likely radius of around 20 kilometers (0.00003 ) and a likely temperature less than or equal to 300,000 K. The second is a white dwarf with a mass of 0.34 , a likely radius of around 0.01 , and a likely temperature less than or equal to 25,200 K. These stars orbit each other at a distance of 1 AU about once every six months. The age of the system is 12.7 to 13 billion years old, making this one of the oldest binary stars known. In comparison, the Sun has an age of 4.6 billion years. The binary system's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 24. It is far too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Evolutionary history= The evolution of the PSR B1620-26 system. The origin of this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it probably did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, it is unlikely that a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star. Stellar encounters are not very common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently. At some point during the 10 billion years, the neutron star is thought to have encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit, probably losing a previous companion star in the process. About half a billion years ago, the newly captured star began to expand into a red giant (see stellar evolution). Typical pulsar periods for young pulsars are of the order of one second, and they increase with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed that as the pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star. The infalling matter produced complex and spectacular effects. The infalling matter 'spun up' the neutron star, due to the transfer of angular momentum, and for a few hundred million years, the stars formed a low-mass X-ray binary, as the infalling matter was heated to temperatures high enough to glow in X-rays. Mass transfer came to an end when the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet. Detection and discovery The location of the system (circled in green). The system is located in the Messier 4 (M4) globular cluster. Like nearly all extrasolar planets discovered prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on radiation from the star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying what they thought was a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993. The study of the planetary orbit allowed the mass of the white dwarf star to be estimated as well, and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should be young and hot. On July 10, 2003, the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by a team led by Steinn Sigurdsson, using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced, capturing press attention around the world. Name While the designation PSR B1620-26 b is not used in any scientific papers, the planet is listed in the SIMBAD database as PSR B1620-26 b. Some popular sources use the designation PSR B1620-26 c to refer to the planet, as it was described as the third member of a triple system (composed of the planet and two stars). This designation doesn't appear in the SIMBAD database, and more modern naming conventions use a separated lettering system where lower-case letters to refer to planets and upper-case letters to designate stars (e.g. Gliese 667C c is the 'd' planet orbiting Gliese 667C, which is the 'D' star of a triple system), making PSR B1620-26 b the designation for a planet orbiting both stars of the PSR B1620-26 system. Neither usage is employed in the scientific literature with respect to the PSR B1620-26 planet. Though not officially recognized, the name \\"Methuselah\\" is commonly used for the planet in popular articles. The name comes from the biblical person Methuselah (who in Christian tradition was the oldest person who ever lived). This name is usually used as the informal name to show the similarities to the planets of the solar system, while the \\"latter name\\" is used astronomically. Methuselah is the only planet to have received a biblical name or nickname, although three other extrasolar planets have been unofficial mythological nicknames (just like in the Solar System), those planets being Dimidium, originally dubbed \\"Bellerophon\\"; Gliese 581 g, sometimes called \\"Zarmina,\\" or even more rarely \\"Zarmina's World\\" or \\"Zarmina's Planet\\"; and HD 209458 b, occasionally referred to as \\"Osiris.\\" See also * 51 Pegasi b * Pulsar planet * PSR 1257+12 References  External links  * * Category:Circumbinary planets Category:Exoplanets detected by timing Category:Exoplanets discovered in 1993 Category:Exoplanets with proper names Category:Exoplanets Category:Giant planets Category:Pulsar planets Category:Scorpius (constellation) ","title":"PSR B1620‚àí26 b"},{"id":"265732","text":"John Strype, engraving by William Richardson. John Strype (1 November 1643 ‚Äì 11 December 1737) was an English clergyman, historian and biographer. Life He was a cousin of sailor and writer Robert Knox. Born in Houndsditch, London, he was the son of John Strype, or van Stryp, a member of a Huguenot family who, in order to escape religious persecution within Brabant, had settled in East London. Located in what has now become known as Strype Street in Petticoat Lane, he was a merchant and silk throwster. The younger John was educated at St Paul's School, and on 5 July 1662 entered Jesus College, Cambridge; he went on from there to Catharine Hall, where he graduated B.A. in 1665 and M.A. in 1669. St Mary's Church, Leyton, where Strype was the curate and parish priest for 68 years and is buried. On 14 July 1669 Strype became perpetual curate of Theydon Bois, and a few months afterwards curate and lecturer of Leyton in the same county. He was never instituted or inducted to the living of St Mary's Church, Leyton, but in 1674 he was licensed by the Bishop of London to preach and expound the word of God, and to perform the office of priest and curate while it was vacant, and until his death he received the profits of it. In 1711 he obtained from Archbishop Thomas Tenison the sinecure of West Tarring, Sussex, and he discharged the duties of lecturer at Hackney from 1689 till 1724. At the latter place he spent his last years with a married granddaughter, the wife of a surgeon, Thomas Harris, dying there at the age of 94. He was buried in the church at Leyton. Works Through his friendship with Sir William Hicks, Strype obtained access to the papers of Sir Michael Hicks, secretary to Lord Burghley, from which he made extensive transcripts; he also carried on an extensive correspondence with Archbishop William Wake and Bishops Gilbert Burnet, Francis Atterbury and Nicholson. The materials he obtained were used in his historical and biographical works, which relate chiefly to the period of the Protestant Reformation. Most of his original materials have been preserved, and are included among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Museum. His works are not really original in nature, his work having mainly been to arrange his materials, but as a result they were of considerable value as convenient books of reference. Strype's major works are: *the Memorials of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1694 (ed. for the EccI. Hist.

His Historical and Biographical Works were reprinted in 59 vols. at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, between 1812 (Cranmer) and 1824 (Annals). A general index by Robert French Laurence in 2 vols. was added in 1828.

He wrote a series of chronicles of English history, published from 1565 onwards under such titles as The Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles, The Chronicles of England, and The Annales of England; and also A Survey of London (1598; second edition 1603). A. L. Rowse has described him as \\"one of the best historians of that age; indefatigable in the trouble he took, thorough and conscientious, accurate ‚Äì above all things devoted to truth\\".Rowse 1971, p. 15. Life John Stow was born in about 1525 in the City of London parish of St Michael, Cornhill, then at the heart of London's metropolis. His father, Thomas Stow, was a tallow chandler. Thomas Stow is recorded as paying rent of 6s 8d per year for the family dwelling, and as a youth Stow would fetch milk every morning from a farm on the land nearby to the east owned by the Minoresses of the Convent of St. Clare.Stow 1927, vol. 1, p. 126.Aldgate, the Minories and Crutched Friars at www.british-history.ac.uk There is no evidence that he ever attended a grammar school: his learning appears to have been largely self- acquired. Stow did not take up his father's trade of tallow chandlery, instead becoming an apprentice, and in 1547 a freeman, of the Merchant Taylors' Company, by which stage he had set up business in premises close to the Aldgate Pump in Aldgate, near to Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street. In about 1560 he started upon his major work, the Survey of London. His antiquarian interests attracted suspicion from the ecclesiastical authorities as a person \\"with many dangerous and superstitious books in his possession\\", and in February 1569 his house was searched. An inventory was made of all the books at his home, especially those \\"in defence of papistry\\", but he was able to satisfy his interrogators as to the soundness of his Protestantism.Wilson 1991. A second attempt to incriminate him was made in 1570 also without success. In about 1570 he moved to the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the Ward of Lime Street, where he lived in comfortable surroundings until his death in 1605. Antiquarian network Stow was in close contact with many of the leading antiquarians of his day, including Archbishop Matthew Parker, John Joscelyn, John Dee, William Fleetwood, William Lambarde, Robert Glover, Henry Savile, William Camden, Henry Ferrers and Thomas Hatcher. He was active in the first Society of Antiquaries, established in about 1586. He built up an extensive library of manuscript and printed historical sources, which became known to contemporaries as his \\"storehouse\\", and which he was generous in making available to others.Beer 1998, pp. 9‚Äì13Oliver Harris, \\"Stow and the contemporary antiquarian network\\", in Gadd and Gillespie 2004, pp. 27‚Äì35. Personality Stow was highly esteemed by his antiquarian contemporaries, probably in no small part because of his willingness to share his material. Sir George Buck wrote of \\"honest John Stow, who could not flatter and speak dishonestly, and who was a man very diligent and much inquisitive to uncover all things concerning the affairs or words or persons of princes\\", and characterised him as a \\"good antiquary and diligent searcher of knowledge\\". Edmund Howes described him in later life as being \\"of a pleasant and cheerful countenance; his sight and memory very good; very sober, mild, and courteous to any that required his instructions; and retained the true use of all his senses unto the day of his death, being of an excellent memory\\".Stow 1927, vol. 1, p. xxvi. Nevertheless, he was drawn into several bitter quarrels and harboured longstanding grudges. One protracted feud was with his younger brother, Thomas, over their respective shares in their mother's estate before and after her death in 1568 (John believed he was entitled to a greater share as the eldest son; Thomas claimed a greater share because he had cared for their mother during her final years).Stow 1927, vol. 1, pp. xiii‚Äìxv.Beer 1998, pp. 2‚Äì4.Trevor-Roper 1975, pp. 340‚Äì41. He had further arguments with neighbours, including William Ditcher and a Mister Crowche.Stow 1927, vol. 1, pp. xv‚Äìxvi.Beer 1998, pp. 4‚Äì6. His quarrel with his rival chronicler Richard Grafton is noted below.Stow 1927, vol. 1, pp. xi‚Äìxiii.Devereux 1990. Works Stow published his first work, The woorkes of Geffrey Chaucer, newly printed with divers additions whiche were never in printe before, in 1561. This was followed in 1565 by his Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles (in small octavo format), and in 1566 by the related but distinct Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles ... Abridged (in sextodecimo format). Both works ran through multiple editions during Stow's lifetime: editions of the Summarie appeared in 1566, 1570, 1574, 1575 and 1590 (with additional posthumous editions, by Edmund Howes, in 1607, 1611 and 1618); and of the Summarie Abridged in 1567, 1573, 1584, 1587, 1598, and 1604.Stow 1927, vol. 1, pp. lxxxii‚Äìlxxxiv. The Summarie Abridged makes disparaging allusions in its preface to the rival Abridgement of the Chronicles of England of Richard Grafton: the dispute between the two men continued to fester until Grafton's death in 1573. In 1580, Stow published the more expansive The Chronicles of England, from Brute unto this present yeare of Christ, 1580. He later developed this into the still more substantial The Annales of England, of which editions appeared in 1592, 1601 and 1605 ‚Äì the last being continued to 26 March 1605, or within ten days of Stow's own death.Stow 1927, vol. 1, p. lxxxiv.Stow, John. The Annales of England, \\"The race of the Kings of Brytaine after the received opinion since Brute, &c;\\" G. Bishop and T. Adams (London), 1605. Further posthumous editions by Edmund Howes were published in 1615 and 1631. Under Archbishop Matthew Parker's patronage, Stow was persuaded to produce a version of Flores historiarum by \\"Matthew of Westminster\\", published in 1567; and then the Chronicle of Matthew Paris in 1571, and the Historia brevis of Thomas Walsingham in 1574. In the Chronicle of England 1590 Stow writes: \\"To The Honorable Sir John Hart, Lord Maior. The Chronicle written before that nothing is perfect the first time, and that it is incident to mankinde to erre and slip sometimes, but the point of fanta[s]tical fooles to preserve and continue in their errors.\\" At the urging of Archbishop Parker, Stow also compiled a \\"farre larger volume\\", a history of Britain entitled \\"A Historie of this Iland\\". He announced this as \\"ready to the presse\\" in 1592, but it proved too ambitious to be commercially viable, and he was unable to find a printer prepared to publish it.Parry 1987. The manuscript is lost. =Survey of London= The work for which Stow is best known is his Survey of London (original spelling: A Survay of London), published in 1598. This was a work of chorography: a detailed ward-by-ward topographical and historical tour of the city, providing a unique account of its buildings, social conditions and customs. A second, revised edition appeared in 1603. Following Stow's death, a third edition, with additions by Anthony Munday appeared in 1618; a fourth by Munday and Humfrey Dyson in 1633; a fifth with interpolated amendments by John Strype in 1720; and a sixth by the same editor in 1754. The edition of 1598 was reprinted, edited by William John Thoms, in 1842, in 1846, and (with illustrations) in 1876. An edition based on that of 1598, edited by Henry Morley, was published in 1889, and has been reprinted on several occasions since. A critical edition, based on that of 1603 and edited in two volumes by C. L. Kingsford, was published in 1908, and republished with additional notes in 1927. This remains the standard scholarly edition. A more popular single- volume edition was published in Everyman's Library, with an introduction by H. B. Wheatley, in 1912 (revised edition 1956), and has been frequently reprinted. The church of St Andrew Undershaft, London Later years and death Stow's literary efforts did not prove very remunerative, but he accepted his relative poverty with cheerful spirit: Ben Jonson relates once walking with him when Stow jocularly asked two mendicant cripples \\"what they would have to take him to their order\\". From 1579 he was in receipt of a pension of ¬£4 per annum from the Merchant Taylors' Company; and in 1590 he petitioned the Court of Aldermen for admission to the Freedom of the City of London, in order to reduce his expenses.Beer 2004. In about the 1590s, William Camden commissioned Stow to transcribe six autograph notebooks of John Leland in exchange for a life annuity of ¬£8: this was probably (in part) a charitable gesture towards an old but impoverished friend. In March 1604 King James I authorised Stow and his associates to collect \\"amongst our loving subjects their voluntary contributions and 'kind gratuities'\\", and himself began \\"the largesse for the example of others\\". Whilst such royal approval was welcome it reaped dividend too slowly for Stow to enjoy any substantial benefit during his lifetime. Stow died on 5 April 1605, and was buried in the church of St Andrew UndershaftChurch of St Andrew Undershaft at www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk on the corner of Leadenhall Street and St Mary Axe. Manuscripts and collections Many of Stow's own autograph manuscripts are now held in the British Library, notably in the Harley Collection; and others in the Bodleian Library. Some in Lambeth Palace Library (MS 306) were published in 1880 by the Camden Society, edited by James Gairdner, as Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles, with Historical Memoranda by John Stowe the Antiquary, and Contemporary Notes of Occurrences written by him. The manuscript and printed works that made up his library are now scattered, but can often be identified through the many annotations he made to them.Stow 1927, pp. lxxvi‚Äìxciii.Alexandra Gillespie, \\"Stow's 'owlde' manuscripts of London chronicles\\", in Gadd and Gillespie 2004, pp. 57‚Äì67. Commemoration and legacy An 18th-century engraving of Stow's monument Stow's widow commissioned a mural monument to him in St Andrew Undershaft, made of Derbyshire marble and alabaster. The work has been tentatively attributed to Nicholas Johnson.Taylor 1974.Katherine Duncan-Jones, \\"Afterword: Stow's remains\\", in Gadd and Gillespie 2004, pp. 157‚Äì63. It includes an effigy of Stow, which was originally coloured: he is represented seated at a desk, writing in a book (probably the revision of his Annales, which he continued to 26 March, ten days before his death), and flanked by other books. Above him is the motto, based on an epigram of Pliny the Younger, Aut scribenda agere, aut legenda scribere (\\"[Blessed is he to whom it is given] either to do things that are worth writing about, or to write things that are worth reading about\\"). The figure holds a real quill pen, in a manner similar to the effigy of William Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon: the latter monument has been attributed, on equally tentative grounds, to Nicholas Johnson's brother, Gerard.The two monuments are compared in Duncan-Jones 2004. In acknowledgement of Stow's continuing reputation as the founding father of London history, the quill held by his effigy has been periodically renewed. The renewal is mentioned as taking place \\"annually\\" in 1828;Taylor 1974, p. 321. and, although the custom may later have fallen into abeyance, it was revived following the monument's restoration by the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1905. In 1924, the ceremony was incorporated into a special church service, with an address by a London historian; and this service continued to be held annually every April until 1991, including the years of the Second World War.Esdaile 1946, p. 115.Many of the addresses delivered at the services are published in the annual Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society. No services could be held in 1992 or 1993 because of damage to the church caused by the Baltic Exchange bomb of 1992. The service was revived in 1994, but from 1996 to 2017 was held only once every three years.Clark 2015. The service due to take place in 2020 was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The services are jointly sponsored by the Merchant Taylors' Company and the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, with the quill supplied by the society. The exchange of the quill is undertaken by the Lord Mayor of London or the Master Merchant Taylor alternately. Stow's Survey of London lends its title to the Survey of London, a comprehensive multi-volume architectural survey of the former County of London, founded in 1894 and still in progress.

This modification is called URL rewriting. It is a way of implementing URL mapping or routing within a web application. The engine is typically a component of a web server or web application framework. Rewritten URLs (sometimes known as short, pretty or fancy URLs, search engine friendly - SEF URLs, or slugs) are used to provide shorter and more relevant-looking links to web pages. The technique adds a layer of abstraction between the files used to generate a web page and the URL that is presented to the outside world. Usage Web sites with dynamic content can use URLs that generate pages from the server using query string parameters. These are often rewritten to resemble URLs for static pages on a site with a subdirectory hierarchy. For example, the URL to a wiki page might be: http://example.com/w/index.php?title=Page_title but can be rewritten as: http://example.com/wiki/Page_title A blog might have a URL that encodes the dates of each entry: http://www.example.com/Blog/Posts.php?Year=2006&Month;=12&Day;=19 It can be altered like this: http://www.example.com/Blog/2006/12/19/ which also allows the user to change the URL to see all postings available in December, simply by removing the text encoding the day '19', as though navigating \\"up\\" a directory: http://www.example.com/Blog/2006/12/ A site can pass specialized terms from the URL to its search engine as a search term. This would allow users to search directly from their browser. For example, the URL as entered into the browser's location bar: http://example.com/search term Will be urlencoded by the browser before it makes the HTTP request. The server could rewrite this to: http://example.com/search.php?q=search%20term Benefits and drawbacks There are several benefits to using URL rewriting:Many of these only apply to HTTP servers whose default behavior is to map URLs to filesystem entities (i.e. files and directories); certain environments, such as many HTTP application server platforms, make this irrelevant. * The links are \\"cleaner\\" and more descriptive, improving their \\"friendliness\\" to both users and search engines. * They prevent undesired \\"inline linking\\", which can waste bandwidth. * The site can continue to use the same URLs even if the underlying technology used to serve them is changed (for example, switching to a new blogging engine). There can, however be drawbacks as well; if a user wants to modify a URL to retrieve new data, URL rewriting may hinder the construction of custom queries due to the lack of named variables. For example, it may be difficult to determine the date from the following format: http://www.example.com/Blog/06/04/02/ In this case, the original query string was more useful, since the query variables indicated month and day: http://www.example.com/Blog/Posts.php?Year=06&Month;=04&Day;=02 Web frameworks Many web frameworks include URL rewriting, either directly or through extension modules. * Apache HTTP Server has URL rewriting provided by the mod_rewrite module.mod_rewrite documentation * URL Rewrite is available as an extension to Microsoft IIS.URL Rewrite extension for Microsoft IIS * Ruby on Rails has built-in URL rewriting via Routes. * Jakarta Servlet has extendable URL rewriting via the OCPsoft URLRewriteFilter and Tuckey UrlRewriteFilter. * Jakarta Server Faces has simplified URL rewriting via the PrettyFaces: URLRewriteFilter. * Django uses a regular-expressions-based system.

J. (1984) Elm, Cambridge University Press.) is a freshwater Scottish loch which crosses the Highland Boundary Fault, often considered the boundary between the lowlands of Central Scotland and the Highlands.Tom Weir. The Scottish Lochs. pp. 33-43. Published by Constable and Company, 1980. Traditionally forming part of the boundary between the counties of Stirlingshire and Dunbartonshire, Loch Lomond is split between the council areas of Stirling, Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire. Its southern shores are about northwest of the centre of Glasgow, Scotland's largest city. The Loch forms part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park which was established in 2002. Loch Lomond is long and between wide, with a surface area of . It is the largest lake in Great Britain by surface area; in the United Kingdom, it is surpassed only by Lough Neagh and Lough Erne in Northern Ireland.Whitaker's Almanack (1991) London. J. Whitaker and Sons. p. 127. In the British Isles as a whole there are several larger loughs in the Republic of Ireland. The loch has a maximum depth of about in the deeper northern portion, although the southern part of the loch rarely exceeds in depth. The total volume of Loch Lomond is , making it the second largest lake in Great Britain, after Loch Ness, by water volume.\\"Scotland‚Äôs Water Environment Review 2000‚Äì2006\\" SEPA. Retrieved 11 October 2008. The loch contains many islands, including Inchmurrin, the largest fresh-water island in the British Isles. Loch Lomond is a popular leisure destination and is featured in the song \\"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\\". The loch is surrounded by hills, including Ben Lomond on the eastern shore, which is in height and the most southerly of the Scottish Munro peaks. A 2005 poll of Radio Times readers voted Loch Lomond as the sixth greatest natural wonder in Britain.\\"Caves win 'natural wonder' vote\\" BBC.co.uk Retrieved 10 December 2006. Formation The depression in which Loch Lomond lies was carved out by glaciers during the final stages of the last ice age, during a return to glacial conditions known as the Loch Lomond Readvance between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. The loch lies on the Highland Boundary Fault, and the difference between the Highland and Lowland geology is reflected in the shape and character of the loch: in the north the glaciers dug a deep channel in the Highland schist, removing up to 600 m of bedrock to create a narrow, fjord- like finger lake. Further south the glaciers were able to spread across the softer Lowland sandstone, leading to a wider body of water that is rarely more than 30 m deep. In the period following the Loch Lomond Readvance the sea level rose, and for several periods Loch Lomond was connected to the sea, with shorelines identified at 13, 12 and 9 metres above sea level (the current loch lies at 8 m above sea level). The change in rock type can be clearly seen at several points around the loch, as it runs across the islands of Inchmurrin, Creinch, Torrinch and Inchcailloch and over the ridge of Conic Hill. To the south lie green fields and cultivated land; to the north, mountains. Islands From the summit of the island of Inchcailloch to Torrinch, Creinch, Inchmurrin and Ben Bowie The loch contains thirty or more other islands, depending on the water level. Several of them are large by the standards of British bodies of freshwater. Inchmurrin, for example, is the largest island in a body of freshwater in the British Isles. Many of the islands are the remains of harder rocks that withstood the passing of the glaciers; however, as in Loch Tay, several of the islands appear to be crannogs, artificial islands built in prehistoric periods. English travel writer, H.V. Morton wrote: Writing some 150 years earlier than Morton, Samuel Johnson had however been less impressed by Loch Lomond's islands, writing: Flora and fauna Powan are one of the commonest fish species in the loch, which has more species of fish than any other loch in Scotland, including lamprey, lampern, brook trout, perch, loach, common roach and flounder. The river lamprey of Loch Lomond display an unusual behavioural trait not seen elsewhere in Britain: unlike other populations, in which young hatch in rivers before migrating to the sea, the river lamprey here remain in freshwater all their lives, hatching in the Endrick Water and migrating into the loch as adults. The surrounding hills are home to species such as black grouse, ptarmigan, golden eagles, pine martens, red deer and mountain hares. Many species of wading birds and water vole inhabit the loch shore. During the winter months large numbers of geese migrate to Loch Lomond, including over 1% of the entire global population of Greenland white-fronted geese (around 200 individuals), and up to 3,000 greylag geese. The Scottish dock (Rumex aquaticus), sometimes called the Loch Lomond dock, is in Britain unique to the shores of Loch Lomond, being found mostly on around Balmaha on the western shore of the loch. It was first discovered growing there in 1936 (else it grows eastwards through Europe and Asia all the way to Japan). One of the loch's islands, Inchconnachan, is home to a colony of wallabies. Conservation designations As well as forming part of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, Loch Lomond holds multiple other conservation designations. 428 ha of land in the southeast, including five of the islands, is designated as national nature reserve: the Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. Seven islands and much of the shoreline form a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the Loch Lomond Woods. This designation overlaps partially with the national nature reserve, and is protected due to the presence of Atlantic oak woodlands and a population of otters. Four islands and a section of the shoreline are designated as a Special Protection Area due to their importance for breeding capercaillie and visiting Greenland white-fronted geese: this designation overlaps partially with both the national nature reserve and the SAC. Loch Lomond is also a designated Ramsar site, again for the presence of Greenland white-fronted geese. The loch and its surrounding are designated as a national scenic area, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. History People first arrived in the Loch Lomond area around 5000 years ago, during the neolithic era. They left traces of their presence at several places around the loch, including Balmaha, Luss, and Inchlonaig. A number of crannogs, artificial islands used as dwellings for over five millennia, were built at points in the loch. The Romans had a fort within sight of the loch at Drumquhassle. The crannog known as \\"The Kitchen\\", located off the island of Clairinsh, may have later been used a place for important meetings by Clan Buchanan whose clan seat had been on Clairinsh since 1225: this usage would be in line with other crannogs such as that at Finlaggan on Islay, used by Clan Donald. During the Early Medieval period viking raiders sailed up Loch Long, hauled their longboats over at the narrow neck of land at Tarbet, and sacked several islands in the loch. The area surrounding the loch later become part of the province of Lennox, which covered much of the area of the later county of Dunbartonshire. Loch Lomond became a popular destination for travellers, such that when James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited the islands of Loch Lomond on the return from their tour of the Western Isles in 1773, the area was already firmly enough established as a destination for Boswell to note that it would be unnecessary to attempt any description.S. Johnson & J. Boswell (ed. R. Black). To the Hebrides: \\"Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland\\" and \\"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\\", p. 423. Published by Birlinn, 2007. Leisure activities =Boating and watersports= Maid of the Loch at Balloch pier Loch Lomond is one of Scotland's premier boating and watersports venues, with visitors enjoying activities including kayaking, Canadian canoeing, paddle boarding, wake boarding, water skiing and wake surfing. The national park authority has tried to achieve a balance between land-based tourists and loch users, with environmentally sensitive areas subject to a strictly enforced speed limit, but the rest of the loch open to speeds of up to . The Maid of the Loch was the last paddle steamer built in Britain. Built on the Clyde in 1953, she operated on Loch Lomond for 29 years. She is now being restored at Balloch pier by the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, a charitable organisation, supported by West Dunbartonshire Council. Cruises also operate from Balloch, Tarbet, Inversnaid, Luss and Rowardennan. Loch Lomond Rescue Boat provides 24-hour safety cover on the loch. The rescue boat is a volunteer organisation and a registered charity. The national park authority also have other boats on the loch such as The Brigadier. Police Scotland also operates on the loch using RIBs and jet skis and work in conjunction with the national park authority. The loch has served as the venue for the Great Scottish Swim, which is held each year in August. =Angling= Fly and coarse fishing on Loch Lomond is regulated by the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement Association (LLAIA), who issue permits to members and visiting anglers. The association employ water bailiffs to monitor the actions of anglers on the loch and ensure angling is carried out in accordance with permit conditions. =Land-based activities= Loch Lomond Golf Club is situated on the south-western shore. It has hosted many international events including the Scottish Open. Another golf club, \\"The Carrick\\" has opened on the banks of the Loch adjacent to the Loch Lomond Club.\\"The Carrick Visit Scotland. Retrieved 10 October 2008. The West Highland Way runs along the eastern bank of the loch, and Inveruglas on the western bank is the terminus of the Cowal Way. The West Loch Lomond Cycle Path runs from Arrochar and Tarbet railway station, at the upper end of the loch, to Balloch railway station, at the south end. The long cycle path runs along the west bank. At the southern end of the loch near Balloch is a large visitor and shopping complex named Loch Lomond Shores. =Access and camping= As with all land and inland water in Scotland there is a right of responsible access to the loch and its shoreline for those wishing to participate in recreational pursuits such as walking, camping, swimming and canoeing. In 2017 the national park authority introduced byelaws restricting the right to camp along much of the shoreline of Loch Lomond, due to issues such as litter and anti-social behaviour that were blamed on some irresponsible campers. Camping is now restricted to designated areas, and campers are required to purchase a permit to camp within these areas between March and October. The byelaws were opposed by groups such as Mountaineering Scotland and Ramblers Scotland, who argued that they would criminalise camping even where it was carried out responsibly, and that the national park authority already had sufficient powers to address irresponsible behaviour using existing laws.  Transport  Map of the loch c. 1800 The main arterial route along the loch is the A82 road which runs the length of its western shore, following the general route of the Old Military Road. The road runs along the shoreline in several places, but generally keeps some distance to the west of the loch in the \\"lowland\\" section to the south. Much of the southern section of the road was widened to a high quality single carriageway standard over the 1980s, at an estimated cost of ¬£24 million (¬£ million as of ), while Luss itself is now bypassed to the west of the village along a single carriageway bypass constructed between 1990 and 1992. At Tarbet, the A83 branches west to Campbeltown while the A82 continues to the north end of the loch. This part of the road is currently of a lower standard than the sections further south. It is sandwiched between the shoreline of the loch and the mountains to the west, and it runs generally alongside the West Highland Line. The road narrows to less than in places and causes significant problems for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), which have to negotiate tight bends and the narrow carriageway width. At Pulpit rock, the road was single-track, with traffic flow controlled by traffic lights for over 30 years. The road was widened in 2015 as part of a ¬£9 million improvement programme, including a new viaduct bringing the carriageway width to modern standards. The A811 runs to the south of Loch Lomond between Balloch and Drymen, following the route of another military road at a distance of between 2 and 3 kilometres from the loch. From Drymen the B837 extends north, meeting the eastern shore of the loch at Balmaha where the road terminates. A minor road extends north as far as Rowardennan, a further 11 km away, however beyond this point no road continues along the eastern shore, although there is road access to Inversnaid via another minor road that comes in from Loch Katrine to the east via the northern shore of Loch Arklet. As Loch Arklet is over 100 m above Loch Lomond and less than 2 km to the east this road must descend steeply to reach Inversnaid. The West Highland railway line joins the western shore of the loch just north of Arrochar and Tarbet railway station. There is a further station alongside the loch at Ardlui.Ordnance Survey 1:50000 Landranger Map. Sheet 56. Loch Lomond and Inverary. This line was voted the top rail journey in the world by readers of independent travel magazine Wanderlust in 2009, ahead of the iconic Trans-Siberian line in Russia and the Cuzco to Machu Picchu line in Peru. The railway system also reaches the loch at Balloch railway station, which is the terminus of the North Clyde Line. Several different operators offer ferry services on the loch. Since 2004 Loch Lomond Seaplanes operates an aerial tour service from its seaplane base near Cameron. On 22 April 1940, a BOAC Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra (Loch Invar, registration G-AFKD) aircraft flying from Perth Airport to Heston Aerodrome in London crashed at Loch Lomond, killing all five passengers and crew. Hydroelectricity The power station at Inveruglas on the west bank of Loch Lomond. The Loch Sloy Hydro-Electric Scheme is situated on the west bank of Loch Lomond. The facility is operated by Scottish and Southern Energy, and is normally in standby mode, ready to generate electricity to meet sudden peaks in demand. It is the largest conventional hydro electric power station in the UK, with an installed capacity of 152.5 MW, and can reach full-capacity within 5 minutes from a standing start. The hydraulic head between Loch Sloy and the outflow into Loch Lomond at Inveruglas is 277 m. In popular culture Loch Lomond from just below Beinn Dubh and Creag an t-Seilich =The song= The loch is featured in a well-known song which was first published around 1841.James J. Fuld, The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular and Folk, p. 336. The chorus is: > :Oh, ye'll tak the high road, and I'll tak the low road, :And I'll be in > Scotland afore ye; :But me and my true love will never meet again :On the > bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond. The song has been recorded by many performers over the years, including Scottish Celtic rock band Runrig. The original author is unknown. One story is that the song was written by a Scottish soldier who awaited death in enemy captivity; in his final letter home, he wrote this song, portraying his home and how much he would miss it. Another tale is that during the Jacobite rising of 1745 a soldier on his way back to Scotland during the 1745‚Äì46 retreat from England wrote this song. The \\"low road\\" may be a reference to the Celtic belief that if someone died away from his homeland, then the fairies would provide a route of this name for his soul to return home. Within this theory, it is possible that the soldier awaiting death may have been writing either to a friend who was allowed to live and return home, or to a lover back in Scotland. =Other= Loch Lomond, looking west from Ben Lomond *Loch Lomond (like Loch Ness) is often used as a shorthand for all things Scottish, an image partly reinforced by the self-titled song. An archetype is the Lerner and Loewe musical Brigadoon. The opening lyrics of the song \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\" are: \\"Maybe the sun gave me the power/For I could swim Loch Lomond and be home in half an hour/Maybe the air gave me the drive/For I'm all aglow and alive!\\" *It is mentioned in the song \\"You're All the World to Me\\" from the musical film Royal Wedding in the line: \\"You're Loch Lomond when autumn is the painter!\\" *The village of Luss (\\"Glendarroch\\") on the shores of the loch was the location for the TV soap Take the High Road, and the loch itself was given the fictional name Loch Darroch for the purpose of the series. *Luss (\\"Lios\\") and the islands nearby were used as the setting for E.

In psychology, decision-making (also spelled decision making and decisionmaking) is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several possible alternative options. Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values, preferences and beliefs of the decision- maker. Every decision-making process produces a final choice, which may or may not prompt action. Research about decision-making is also published under the label problem solving, particularly in European psychological research. Overview Decision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less rational or irrational and can be based on explicit or tacit knowledge and beliefs. Tacit knowledge is often used to fill the gaps in complex decision making processes. Usually both of these types of knowledge, tacit and explicit, are used together in the decision-making process. Human performance has been the subject of active research from several perspectives: * Psychological: examining individual decisions in the context of a set of needs, preferences and values the individual has or seeks. * Cognitive: the decision-making process regarded as a continuous process integrated in the interaction with the environment. * Normative: the analysis of individual decisions concerned with the logic of decision-making, or communicative rationality, and the invariant choice it leads to. A major part of decision-making involves the analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of evaluative criteria. Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Solving such problems is the focus of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This area of decision-making, although very old, has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners and is still highly debated as there are many MCDA methods which may yield very different results when they are applied on exactly the same data. This leads to the formulation of a decision-making paradox. Logical decision-making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their knowledge in a given area to make informed decisions. For example, medical decision-making often involves a diagnosis and the selection of appropriate treatment. But naturalistic decision-making research shows that in situations with higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may use intuitive decision-making rather than structured approaches. They may follow a recognition primed decision that fits their experience and arrive at a course of action without weighing alternatives. The decision-maker's environment can play a part in the decision-making process. For example, environmental complexity is a factor that influences cognitive function. A complex environment is an environment with a large number of different possible states which come and go over time. Studies done at the University of Colorado have shown that more complex environments correlate with higher cognitive function, which means that a decision can be influenced by the location. One experiment measured complexity in a room by the number of small objects and appliances present; a simple room had less of those things. Cognitive function was greatly affected by the higher measure of environmental complexity making it easier to think about the situation and make a better decision.  Problem solving vs. decision making  It is important to differentiate between problem solving, or problem analysis, and decision-making. Problem solving is the process of investigating the given information and finding all possible solutions through invention or discovery. Traditionally, it is argued that problem solving is a step towards decision making, so that the information gathered in that process may be used towards decision-making. ; Characteristics of problem solving: * Problems are merely deviations from performance standards * Problems must be precisely identified and described * Problems are caused by a change from a distinctive feature * Something can always be used to distinguish between what has and hasn't been affected by a cause * Causes of problems can be deduced from relevant changes found in analyzing the problem * Most likely cause of a problem is the one that exactly explains all the facts, while having the fewest (or weakest) assumptions (Occam's razor). ; Characteristics of decision-making: * Objectives must first be established * Objectives must be classified and placed in order of importance * Alternative actions must be developed * The alternatives must be evaluated against all the objectives * The alternative that is able to achieve all the objectives is the tentative decision * The tentative decision is evaluated for more possible consequences * The decisive actions are taken, and additional actions are taken to prevent any adverse consequences from becoming problems and starting both systems (problem analysis and decision-making) all over again * There are steps that are generally followed that result in a decision model that can be used to determine an optimal production plan * In a situation featuring conflict, role-playing may be helpful for predicting decisions to be made by involved parties =Analysis paralysis= When a group or individual is unable to make it through the problem-solving step on the way to making a decision, they could be experiencing analysis paralysis. Analysis paralysis is the state that a person enters where they are unable to make a decision, in effect paralyzing the outcome. Some of the main causes for analysis paralysis is the overwhelming flood of incoming data or the tendency to overanalyze the situation at hand. According to Lon Roberts, there are three different types of analysis paralysis. * The first is analysis process paralysis. This type of paralysis is often spoken of as a cyclical process. One is unable to make a decision because they get stuck go over the information again and again for fear of making the wrong decision. * The second is decision precision paralysis. This paralysis is cyclical, just like the first one, but instead of going over the same information, the decision- maker will find new questions and information from their analysis and that will lead them to explore into further possibilities rather than making a decision. * The third is risk uncertainty paralysis. This paralysis occurs when the decision-maker wants to eliminate any uncertainty but the examination of provided information is unable to get rid of all uncertainty. = Extinction by instinct = On the opposite side of analysis paralysis is the phenomenon called extinction by instinct. Extinction by instinct is the state that a person is in when they make careless decisions without detailed planning or thorough systematic processes. Extinction by instinct can possibly be fixed by implementing a structural system, like checks and balances. into a group or one‚Äôs life. Analysis paralysis is the exact opposite where a group‚Äôs schedule could be saturated by too much of a structural checks and balance system. Extinction by instinct in a group setting Groupthink is another occurrence that falls under the idea of extinction by instinct. According to Irving L. Janis, groupthink is when members in a group become more involved in the ‚Äúvalue of the group (and their being part of it) higher than anything else‚Äù; thus, creating a habit of making decisions quickly and unanimously. In other words, a group stuck in groupthink are participating in the phenomenon of extinction by instinct. =Information overload= Information overload is \\"a gap between the volume of information and the tools we have to assimilate\\" it.Paul Saffo quoted in: Information used in decision making is to reduce or eliminate uncertainty. Excessive information affects problem processing and tasking, which affects decision-making. Psychologist George Armitage Miller suggests that humans‚Äô decision making becomes inhibited because human brains can only hold a limited amount of information. Crystal C. Hall and colleagues described an \\"illusion of knowledge\\", which means that as individuals encounter too much knowledge it can interfere with their ability to make rational decisions. Other names for information overload are information anxiety, information explosion, infobesity, and infoxication. = Decision fatigue = Decision fatigue is when a sizable amount of decision-making leads to a decline in decision-making skills. People who make decisions in an extended period of time begin to lose mental energy needed to analyze all possible solutions. It is speculated that decision fatigue only happens to those who believe willpower has a limited capacity. Impulsive decision-making or decision avoidance are two possible paths that extend from decision fatigue. Impulse decisions are made more often when a person is tired of analysis situations or solutions; the solution they make is to act and not think. Decision avoidance is when a person evades the situation entirely by not ever making a decision. Decision avoidance is different from analysis paralysis because this sensation is about avoiding the situation entirely, while analysis paralysis is continually looking at the decisions to be made but still unable to make a choice. =Post-decision analysis= Evaluation and analysis of past decisions is complementary to decision-making. See also Mental accounting and Postmortem documentation.  Neuroscience  Decision- making is a region of intense study in the fields of systems neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience. Several brain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex and the overlapping ventromedial prefrontal cortex are believed to be involved in decision-making processes. A neuroimaging study found distinctive patterns of neural activation in these regions depending on whether decisions were made on the basis of perceived personal volition or following directions from someone else. Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have difficulty making advantageous decisions. A common laboratory paradigm for studying neural decision-making is the two-alternative forced choice task (2AFC), in which a subject has to choose between two alternatives within a certain time. A study of a two-alternative forced choice task involving rhesus monkeys found that neurons in the parietal cortex not only represent the formation of a decision but also signal the degree of certainty (or \\"confidence\\") associated with the decision. Another recent study found that lesions to the ACC in the macaque resulted in impaired decision-making in the long run of reinforcement guided tasks suggesting that the ACC may be involved in evaluating past reinforcement information and guiding future action. A 2012 study found that rats and humans can optimally accumulate incoming sensory evidence, to make statistically optimal decisions. = Emotions = Emotion appears able to aid the decision- making process. Decision-making often occurs in the face of uncertainty about whether one's choices will lead to benefit or harm (see also Risk). The somatic marker hypothesis is a neurobiological theory of how decisions are made in the face of uncertain outcome. This theory holds that such decisions are aided by emotions, in the form of bodily states, that are elicited during the deliberation of future consequences and that mark different options for behavior as being advantageous or disadvantageous. This process involves an interplay between neural systems that elicit emotional/bodily states and neural systems that map these emotional/bodily states. A recent lesion mapping study of 152 patients with focal brain lesions conducted by Aron K. Barbey and colleagues provided evidence to help discover the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.  Decision-making techniques  Decision-making techniques can be separated into two broad categories: group decision-making techniques and individual decision-making techniques. Individual decision- making techniques can also often be applied by a group. =Group= * Consensus decision-making tries to avoid \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\". Consensus requires that a majority approve a given course of action, but that the minority agree to go along with the course of action. In other words, if the minority opposes the course of action, consensus requires that the course of action be modified to remove objectionable features. * Voting-based methods: **Majority requires support from more than 50% of the members of the group. Thus, the bar for action is lower than with consensus. ** Plurality, where the largest block in a group decides, even if it falls short of a majority. ** Quadratic voting allows participants to cast their preference and intensity of preference for each decision (as opposed to a simple for or against decision). It addresses issues of voting paradox and majority-rule. ** Range voting lets each member score one or more of the available options. The option with the highest average is chosen. This method has experimentally been shown to produce the lowest Bayesian regret among common voting methods, even when voters are strategic. * Delphi method is a structured communication technique for groups, originally developed for collaborative forecasting but has also been used for policy making. * Dotmocracy is a facilitation method that relies on the use of special forms called Dotmocracy. They are sheets that allows large groups to collectively brainstorm and recognize agreements on an unlimited number of ideas they have each wrote. * Participative decision- making occurs when an authority opens up the decision-making process to a group of people for a collaborative effort. * Decision engineering uses a visual map of the decision-making process based on system dynamics and can be automated through a decision modeling tool, integrating big data, machine learning, and expert knowledge as appropriate. =Individual= * Decisional balance sheet: listing the advantages and disadvantages (benefits and costs, pros and cons) of each option, as suggested by Plato's Protagoras and by Benjamin Franklin. * Expected-value optimization: choosing the alternative with the highest probability-weighted utility, possibly with some consideration for risk aversion. This may involve considering the opportunity cost of different alternatives. See also Decision analysis and Decision theory. * Satisficing: examining alternatives only until the first acceptable one is found. The opposite is maximizing or optimizing, in which many or all alternatives are examined in order to find the best option. * Acquiesce to a person in authority or an \\"expert\\"; \\"just following orders\\". * Anti- authoritarianism: taking the most opposite action compared to the advice of mistrusted authorities. * Flipism e.g. flipping a coin, cutting a deck of playing cards, and other random or coincidence methodsor prayer, tarot cards, astrology, augurs, revelation, or other forms of divination, superstition or pseudoscience. * Automated decision support: setting up criteria for automated decisions. * Decision support systems: using decision-making software when faced with highly complex decisions or when considering many stakeholders, categories, or other factors that affect decisions.  Steps  A variety of researchers have formulated similar prescriptive steps aimed at improving decision-making. =GOFER= In the 1980s, psychologist Leon Mann and colleagues developed a decision-making process called GOFER, which they taught to adolescents, as summarized in the book Teaching Decision Making To Adolescents. See also: The process was based on extensive earlier research conducted with psychologist Irving Janis. GOFER is an acronym for five decision-making steps: # Goals clarification: Survey values and objectives. # Options generation: Consider a wide range of alternative actions. # Facts- finding: Search for information. # Consideration of Effects: Weigh the positive and negative consequences of the options. # Review and implementation: Plan how to review the options and implement them. =DECIDE= In 2008, Kristina Guo published the DECIDE model of decision- making, which has six parts: # Define the problem # Establish or Enumerate all the criteria (constraints) # Consider or Collect all the alternatives # Identify the best alternative # Develop and implement a plan of action # Evaluate and monitor the solution and examine feedback when necessary =Other= In 2007, Pam Brown of Singleton Hospital in Swansea, Wales, divided the decision-making process into seven steps: # Outline the goal and outcome. # Gather data. # Develop alternatives (i.e., brainstorming). # List pros and cons of each alternative. # Make the decision. # Immediately take action to implement it. # Learn from and reflect on the decision. In 2009, professor John Pijanowski described how the Arkansas Program, an ethics curriculum at the University of Arkansas, used eight stages of moral decision- making based on the work of James Rest: # Establishing community: Create and nurture the relationships, norms, and procedures that will influence how problems are understood and communicated. This stage takes place prior to and during a moral dilemma. # Perception: Recognize that a problem exists. # Interpretation: Identify competing explanations for the problem, and evaluate the drivers behind those interpretations. # Judgment: Sift through various possible actions or responses and determine which is more justifiable. # Motivation: Examine the competing commitments which may distract from a more moral course of action and then prioritize and commit to moral values over other personal, institutional or social values. # Action: Follow through with action that supports the more justified decision. # Reflection in action. # Reflection on action. =Group stages= According to B. Aubrey Fisher, there are four stages or phases that should be involved in all group decision- making: * Orientation. Members meet for the first time and start to get to know each other. * Conflict. Once group members become familiar with each other, disputes, little fights and arguments occur. Group members eventually work it out. * Emergence. The group begins to clear up vague opinions by talking about them. * Reinforcement. Members finally make a decision and provide justification for it. It is said that establishing critical norms in a group improves the quality of decisions, while the majority of opinions (called consensus norms) do not. Conflicts in socialization are divided in to functional and dysfunctional types. Functional conflicts are mostly the questioning the managers assumptions in their decision making and dysfunctional conflicts are like personal attacks and every action which decrease team effectiveness. Functional conflicts are the better ones to gain higher quality decision making caused by the increased team knowledge and shared understanding.  Rational and irrational  In economics, it is thought that if humans are rational and free to make their own decisions, then they would behave according to rational choice theory. Rational choice theory says that a person consistently makes choices that lead to the best situation for himself or herself, taking into account all available considerations including costs and benefits; the rationality of these considerations is from the point of view of the person himself, so a decision is not irrational just because someone else finds it questionable. In reality, however, there are some factors that affect decision-making abilities and cause people to make irrational decisionsfor example, to make contradictory choices when faced with the same problem framed in two different ways (see also Allais paradox). One of the most prominent theories of decision making is subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, which describes the rational behavior of the decision maker. The decision maker assesses different alternatives by their utilities and the subjective probability of occurrence. Rational decision-making is often grounded on experience and theories that are able to put this approach on solid mathematical grounds so that subjectivity is reduced to a minimum, see e.g. scenario optimization.  Children, adolescents, and adults  =Children= It has been found that, unlike adults, children are less likely to have research strategy behaviors. One such behavior is adaptive decision- making, which is described as funneling and then analyzing the more promising information provided if the number of options to choose from increases. Adaptive decision-making behavior is somewhat present for children, ages 11‚Äì12 and older, but decreases in presence the younger they are. The reason children aren‚Äôt as fluid in their decision making is because they lack the ability to weigh the cost and effort needed to gather information in the decision-making process. Some possibilities that explain this inability are knowledge deficits and lack of utilization skills. Children lack the metacognitive knowledge necessary to know when to use any strategies they do possess to change their approach to decision-making. When it comes to the idea of fairness in decision making, children and adults differ much less. Children are able to understand the concept of fairness in decision making from an early age. Toddlers and infants, ranging from 9‚Äì21 months, understand basic principles of equality. The main difference found is that more complex principles of fairness in decision making such as contextual and intentional information don‚Äôt come until children get older. =Adolescents= During their adolescent years, teens are known for their high-risk behaviors and rash decisions. Research has shown that there are differences in cognitive processes between adolescents and adults during decision-making. Researchers have concluded that differences in decision-making are not due to a lack of logic or reasoning, but more due to the immaturity of psychosocial capacities that influence decision-making. Examples of their undeveloped capacities which influence decision-making would be impulse control, emotion regulation, delayed gratification and resistance to peer pressure. In the past, researchers have thought that adolescent behavior was simply due to incompetency regarding decision-making. Currently, researchers have concluded that adults and adolescents are both competent decision-makers, not just adults. However, adolescents' competent decision- making skills decrease when psychosocial capacities become present. Research has shown that risk-taking behaviors in adolescents may be the product of interactions between the socioemotional brain network and its cognitive- control network. The socioemotional part of the brain processes social and emotional stimuli and has been shown to be important in reward processing. The cognitive-control network assists in planning and self-regulation. Both of these sections of the brain change over the course of puberty. However, the socioemotional network changes quickly and abruptly, while the cognitive- control network changes more gradually. Because of this difference in change, the cognitive-control network, which usually regulates the socioemotional network, struggles to control the socioemotional network when psychosocial capacities are present. When adolescents are exposed to social and emotional stimuli, their socioemotional network is activated as well as areas of the brain involved in reward processing. Because teens often gain a sense of reward from risk-taking behaviors, their repetition becomes ever more probable due to the reward experienced. In this, the process mirrors addiction. Teens can become addicted to risky behavior because they are in a high state of arousal and are rewarded for it not only by their own internal functions but also by their peers around them. A recent study suggests that adolescents have difficulties adequately adjusting beliefs in response to bad news (such as reading that smoking poses a greater risk to health than they thought), but do not differ from adults in their ability to alter beliefs in response to good news. This creates biased beliefs, which may lead to greater risk taking. =Adults= Adults are generally better able to control their risk-taking because their cognitive-control system has matured enough to the point where it can control the socioemotional network, even in the context of high arousal or when psychosocial capacities are present. Also, adults are less likely to find themselves in situations that push them to do risky things. For example, teens are more likely to be around peers who peer pressure them into doing things, while adults are not as exposed to this sort of social setting.  Cognitive and personal biases  Biases usually affect decision-making processes. They appear more when decision task has time pressure, is done under high stress and/or task is highly complex. Here is a list of commonly debated biases in judgment and decision-making: * Selective search for evidence (also known as confirmation bias): People tend to be willing to gather facts that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions. Individuals who are highly defensive in this manner show significantly greater left prefrontal cortex activity as measured by EEG than do less defensive individuals. * Premature termination of search for evidence: People tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work. * Cognitive inertia is the unwillingness to change existing thought patterns in the face of new circumstances. * Selective perception: People actively screen out information that they do not think is important (see also Prejudice). In one demonstration of this effect, discounting of arguments with which one disagrees (by judging them as untrue or irrelevant) was decreased by selective activation of right prefrontal cortex. * Wishful thinking is a tendency to want to see things in a certainusually positivelight, which can distort perception and thinking. * Choice-supportive bias occurs when people distort their memories of chosen and rejected options to make the chosen options seem more attractive. * Recency: People tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information (see Semantic priming). The opposite effect in the first set of data or other information is termed primacy effect. * Repetition bias is a willingness to believe what one has been told most often and by the greatest number of different sources. * Anchoring and adjustment: Decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information. * Groupthink is peer pressure to conform to the opinions held by the group. * Source credibility bias is a tendency to reject a person's statement on the basis of a bias against the person, organization, or group to which the person belongs. People preferentially accept statements by others that they like (see also Prejudice). * Incremental decision-making and escalating commitment: People look at a decision as a small step in a process, and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with zero-based decision-making (see Slippery slope). * Attribution asymmetry: People tend to attribute their own success to internal factors, including abilities and talents, but explain their failures in terms of external factors such as bad luck. The reverse bias is shown when people explain others' success or failure. * Role fulfillment is a tendency to conform to others' decision-making expectations. * Underestimating uncertainty and the illusion of control: People tend to underestimate future uncertainty because of a tendency to believe they have more control over events than they really do. * Framing bias: This is best avoided by increasing numeracy and presenting data in several formats (for example, using both absolute and relative scales). ** Sunk-cost fallacy is a specific type of framing effect that affects decision-making. It involves an individual making a decision about a current situation based on what they have previously invested in the situation. An example of this would be an individual that is refraining from dropping a class that they are most likely to fail, due to the fact that they feel as though they have done so much work in the course thus far. * Prospect theory involves the idea that when faced with a decision-making event, an individual is more likely to take on a risk when evaluating potential losses, and are more likely to avoid risks when evaluating potential gains. This can influence one's decision-making depending if the situation entails a threat, or opportunity. * Optimism bias is a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring in the future and underestimate the likelihood of negative life events. Such biased expectations are generated and maintained in the face of counter-evidence through a tendency to discount undesirable information. An optimism bias can alter risk perception and decision-making in many domains, ranging from finance to health. * Reference class forecasting was developed to eliminate or reduce cognitive biases in decision-making.  Cognitive limitations in groups  In groups, people generate decisions through active and complex processes. One method consists of three steps: initial preferences are expressed by members; the members of the group then gather and share information concerning those preferences; finally, the members combine their views and make a single choice about how to face the problem. Although these steps are relatively ordinary, judgements are often distorted by cognitive and motivational biases, include \\"sins of commission\\", \\"sins of omission\\", and \\"sins of imprecision\\".  Cognitive styles  =Optimizing vs. satisficing= Herbert A. Simon coined the phrase \\"bounded rationality\\" to express the idea that human decision-making is limited by available information, available time and the mind's information-processing ability. Further psychological research has identified individual differences between two cognitive styles: maximizers try to make an optimal decision, whereas satisficers simply try to find a solution that is \\"good enough\\". Maximizers tend to take longer making decisions due to the need to maximize performance across all variables and make tradeoffs carefully; they also tend to more often regret their decisions (perhaps because they are more able than satisficers to recognize that a decision turned out to be sub-optimal). =Intuitive vs. rational= The psychologist Daniel Kahneman, adopting terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, has theorized that a person's decision-making is the result of an interplay between two kinds of cognitive processes: an automatic intuitive system (called \\"System 1\\") and an effortful rational system (called \\"System 2\\"). System 1 is a bottom-up, fast, and implicit system of decision-making, while system 2 is a top-down, slow, and explicit system of decision-making. System 1 includes simple heuristics in judgment and decision-making such as the affect heuristic, the availability heuristic, the familiarity heuristic, and the representativeness heuristic. =Combinatorial vs. positional= Styles and methods of decision-making were elaborated by Aron Katsenelinboigen, the founder of predispositioning theory. In his analysis on styles and methods, Katsenelinboigen referred to the game of chess, saying that \\"chess does disclose various methods of operation, notably the creation of predisposition- methods which may be applicable to other, more complex systems.\\" Katsenelinboigen states that apart from the methods (reactive and selective) and sub-methods (randomization, predispositioning, programming), there are two major styles: positional and combinational. Both styles are utilized in the game of chess. According to Katsenelinboigen, the two styles reflect two basic approaches to uncertainty: deterministic (combinational style) and indeterministic (positional style). Katsenelinboigen's definition of the two styles are the following. The combinational style is characterized by: * a very narrow, clearly defined, primarily material goal; and * a program that links the initial position with the final outcome. In defining the combinational style in chess, Katsenelinboigen wrote: \\"The combinational style features a clearly formulated limited objective, namely the capture of material (the main constituent element of a chess position). The objective is implemented via a well-defined, and in some cases, unique sequence of moves aimed at reaching the set goal. As a rule, this sequence leaves no options for the opponent. Finding a combinational objective allows the player to focus all his energies on efficient execution, that is, the player's analysis may be limited to the pieces directly partaking in the combination. This approach is the crux of the combination and the combinational style of play. The positional style is distinguished by: * a positional goal; and * a formation of semi-complete linkages between the initial step and final outcome. \\"Unlike the combinational player, the positional player is occupied, first and foremost, with the elaboration of the position that will allow him to develop in the unknown future. In playing the positional style, the player must evaluate relational and material parameters as independent variables. ... The positional style gives the player the opportunity to develop a position until it becomes pregnant with a combination. However, the combination is not the final goal of the positional playerit helps him to achieve the desirable, keeping in mind a predisposition for the future development. The pyrrhic victory is the best example of one's inability to think positionally.\\" The positional style serves to: * create a predisposition to the future development of the position; * induce the environment in a certain way; * absorb an unexpected outcome in one's favor; and * avoid the negative aspects of unexpected outcomes. =Influence of Myers-Briggs type= According to Isabel Briggs Myers, a person's decision-making process depends to a significant degree on their cognitive style. Myers developed a set of four bi- polar dimensions, called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The terminal points on these dimensions are: thinking and feeling; extroversion and introversion; judgment and perception; and sensing and intuition. She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style. However, some psychologists say that the MBTI lacks reliability and validity and is poorly constructed. Other studies suggest that these national or cross-cultural differences in decision-making exist across entire societies. For example, Maris Martinsons has found that American, Japanese and Chinese business leaders each exhibit a distinctive national style of decision-making. The Myers-Briggs typology has been the subject of criticism regarding its poor psychometric properties. = General decision-making style (GDMS) = In the general decision-making style (GDMS) test developed by Suzanne Scott and Reginald Bruce, there are five decision-making styles: rational, intuitive, dependent, avoidant, and spontaneous. These five different decision-making styles change depending on the context and situation, and one style is not necessarily better than any other. In the examples below, the individual is working for a company and is offered a job from a different company. * The rational style is an in-depth search for, and a strong consideration of, other options and/or information prior to making a decision. In this style, the individual would research the new job being offered, review their current job, and look at the pros and cons of taking the new job versus staying with their current company. * The intuitive style is confidence in one's initial feelings and gut reactions. In this style, if the individual initially prefers the new job because they have a feeling that the work environment is better suited for them, then they would decide to take the new job. The individual might not make this decision as soon as the job is offered. * The dependent style is asking for other people's input and instructions on what decision should be made. In this style, the individual could ask friends, family, coworkers, etc., but the individual might not ask all of these people. * The avoidant style is averting the responsibility of making a decision. In this style, the individual would not make a decision. Therefore, the individual would stick with their current job. * The spontaneous style is a need to make a decision as soon as possible rather than waiting to make a decision. In this style, the individual would either reject or accept the job as soon as it is offered.  Organizational vs. individual level  There are a few characteristics that differentiate organizational decision-making from individual decision-making as studied in lab experiments:Shapira, Z. (2002). \\"Organizational Decision Making. Cambridge Series on Judgment and Decision Making\\", Cambridge University Press: pp.4-6. , 9780521890502 1\\\\. Unlike most lab studies of individual decision-making, ambiguity is pervasive in organizations. There is often only ambiguous information, and there is ambiguity about preferences as well as about interpreting the history of decisions. 2\\\\. Decision-making in and by organizations is embedded in a longitudinal context, meaning that participants in organizational decision-making are a part of ongoing processes. Even if they don't take on active roles in all phases of decision-making, they are part of the Decision Process and its consequences. Decisions in organizations are made in a sequential manner, and commitment may be more important in such processes than judgmental accuracy. In contrast, most lab studies of individual decision-making are conducted in artificial settings (lab) that are not connected to the subjects‚Äô ongoing activities. 3\\\\. Incentives play an important role in organizational decision-making. Incentives, penalties, and their ramifications are real and may have long-lasting effects. These effects are intensified due to the longitudinal nature of decision-making in organizational settings. Incentives and penalties are very salient in organizations, and often they command managerial attention. 4\\\\. Many executives, especially in middle management, may make repeated decisions on similar issues. Managers may develop a sense of using his/her skills (which may be faulty) and a sense of having control and using one's skills are pervasive in managerial thinking about risk taking. Several repeated decisions are made by following rules rather than by using pure information processing modes. 5\\\\. Conflict is pervasive in organizational decision-making. Many times power considerations and agenda setting determine decisions rather than calculations based on the decision's parameters. The nature of authority relations may have a large impact on the way decisions are made in organizations, which are basically political systems.

The Earls, Marquesses, and Dukes of Argyll were for several centuries among the most powerful noble families in Scotland. As such, they played a major role in Scottish history throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The Duke of Argyll also holds the hereditary titles of chief of Clan Campbell and Master of the Household of Scotland. Since 2001, Torquhil Campbell has been Duke of Argyll and is the thirteenth man to hold the title. History Sir Colin Campbell of Lochow was knighted in 1280. In 1445 James II of Scotland raised Sir Colin's descendant Sir Duncan Campbell to the peerage to become Duncan Campbell of Lochow, Lord of Argyll, Knight, 1st Lord Campbell. Colin Campbell (c. 1433‚Äì1493) succeeded his grandfather as the 2nd Lord Campbell in 1453 and was created Earl of Argyll in 1457. Inveraray Castle, the principal family seat of the Dukes of Argyll The 8th Earl of Argyll was created a marquess in 1641, when Charles I visited Scotland and attempted to quell the rising political crisis (and the fall-out from the event known as The Incident). With Oliver Cromwell's victory in England, the marquess became the effective ruler of Scotland. Upon the restoration, the marquess offered his services to King Charles II but was charged with treason and executed in 1661. His lands and titles were forfeited but in 1663, they were restored to his son, Archibald, who became the 9th Earl of Argyll. In 1685 the 9th Earl was executed for his part in the Monmouth rebellion. On 21 June 1701 the 9th Earl's son was created Duke of Argyll, Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne, Earl of Campbell and Cowal, Viscount of Lochow and Glenyla, Lord Inveraray, Mull, Morvern, and Tiree for his services to William of Orange. His son, the 2nd Duke, was created Baron Chatham and Earl of Greenwich in 1705 as a reward for his support for the Act of Union and further elevated to the title Duke of Greenwich in 1719. Upon his death his Scottish titles passed to his brother and the English titles became extinct. The 5th Duke sat as a member of parliament for Glasgow until his father's accession to the Dukedom in 1761 disqualified him from representing a Scottish seat. He then became the member for Dover until 1766, when he was created Baron Sundridge and obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords. On 17 April 1892, the 8th Duke was created Duke of Argyll in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Thus, the Duke is one of only five people to hold two different dukedoms, the others being the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, and the Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon. Argyll's Lodging served as the family townhouse in Stirling During the 19th century, a distant Prussian descendant of the family, Jenny von Westphalen, became the wife of the philosopher Karl Marx. In a famous story, when exiled to Paris and reduced to poverty, Marx was nearly arrested for attempting to pawn a part of Jenny's dowry: a silver dinner service bearing the crest of the House of Argyll. Of the incident Marx wrote to Engels, possibly in an attempt to solicit another loan from his wealthy friend: \\"My wife cried all night\\". However, the silver was eventually sold to pay off long-standing debts incurred by the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.Ghosts on the roof: selected essays , Transaction Publishers, 1996 By Whittaker Chambers, page 180 In the late 19th century the then current Duke of Argyll visited America. While there, he stayed at the American Hotel situated in the main square of the village of Babylon, New York. The townspeople took a liking to the duke, and festivals and parades took place while he visited there. Just before the turn of the century (1900) the township of Babylon renamed the Bythbourne Lake/Park to Argyle Lake/Park (Argyll evolved to the currently accepted Argyle) in memory of the duke's visit. Family seats and abodes The family seat is Inveraray Castle beside Loch Fyne, Inveraray, Argyll. The estate, 75,000 acres, mixes of commercial forestry, residential property, sources of renewable energy, and a caravan park. The principal burial place of the Dukes and Duchesses is St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun. The 11th and the 12th Dukes chose to be buried on the island of Inishail in Loch Awe. In 1706 John Campbell, second Duke of Argyll, became the inhabitant of a house on the east side of King Street, St James (Soho end), Westminster, London which stood on a site occupied by the western end of Little Argyll Street which in 1735 or 1736 he vacated for redevelopment.'Argyll Street Area', in Survey of London: Volumes 31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2, ed.

A succession of Argyll Houses followed in the same block of streets In 1808 the 6th Duke sold the latter-day House to the 4th Earl of Aberdeen. In and before 1764 the family had a house near to London at Ham which was then in the county of Surrey, a parish historically associated with Richmond, and a nearby second holding, see map to left. Subsidiary titles The Duke holds several subsidiary titles, including: Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne (created 1701), Earl of Argyll (created 1457), Earl Campbell and Cowall and Viscount Lochow and Glenyla (created 1701), Lord Campbell (created 1445), Lord Lorne (created 1470), Lord Kintyre (created 1626), Lord Inveraray, Mull, Mover and Tiry' (created 1701), Baron Hamilton of Hameldon (created 1776) and Baron Sundridge (created 1766). They are in the Peerage of Scotland, except the last two, which are in the Peerage of Great Britain. The Duke is also a Baronet of Lundie (created 1627) in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The courtesy title for the Duke's eldest son and heir is Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne. Hereditary offices *Hereditary Master of the Royal Household in Scotland * Hereditary High Justiciar of Argyll *Admiral of the Western Coasts and Isles *Hereditary Keeper of the Royal Castles of: Carrick, Dunoon, Dunstaffnage, Tarbert *Hereditary High Sheriff of Argyllshire *Member Queen's Body Guard for Scotland The Duke of Argyll is also the chief of the Scottish clan of Campbell and in this capacity is known as \\"MacCailein M√≤r\\", which is Gaelic, for \\"The Great MacColin\\" referring to Cailean M√≥r (Colin the Great) of Lochawe (Colin of Lochow) who was killed in fighting with Alexander, Lord of Lorne in 1296. Since James IV's reign, the Duke has also held the position of Master of the Household of Scotland. Coat of arms The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the dukedom is: Quarterly: 1st and 4th gyronny of eight or and sable (for Campbell); 2nd and 3rd argent, a lymphad, sails furled and oars in action sable, flags and pennants flying gules (for Lorne).

The techniques for gathering and analyzing epidemiological data vary depending on the type of disease being monitored but each study will have overarching similarities.Miquel Porta (2014) A dictionary of epidemiology, 6th edn, New York: Oxford University Press. . Outline of the process of an epidemiological study #Establish that a problem exists #*Full epidemiological studies are expensive and laborious undertakings. Before any study is started, a case must be made for the importance of the research. #Confirm the homogeneity of the events #*Any conclusions drawn from inhomogeneous cases will be suspicious. All events or occurrences of the disease must be true cases of the disease. #Collect all the events #*It is important to collect as much information as possible about each event in order to inspect a large number of possible risk factors. The events may be collected from varied methods of epidemiological study or from censuses or hospital records. #*The events can be characterized by Incidence rates and prevalence rates. #*Often, occurrence of a single disease entity is set as an event. #*Given inherent heterogeneous nature of any given disease (i.e., the unique disease principle), a single disease entity may be treated as disease subtypes. This framework is well conceptualized in the interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE). #Characterize the events as to epidemiological factors ##Predisposing factors ##*Non-environmental factors that increase the likelihood of getting a disease. Genetic history, age, and gender are examples. ##Enabling/disabling factors ##*Factors relating to the environment that either increase or decrease the likelihood of disease. Exercise and good diet are examples of disabling factors. A weakened immune system and poor nutrition are examples of enabling factors. ##Precipitation factors ##*This factor is the most important in that it identifies the source of exposure. It may be a germ, toxin or gene. ##Reinforcing factors ##*These are factors that compound the likelihood of getting a disease. They may include repeated exposure or excessive environmental stresses. #Look for patterns and trends #*Here one looks for similarities in the cases which may identify major risk factors for contracting the disease. Epidemic curves may be used to identify such risk factors. #Formulate a hypothesis #*If a trend has been observed in the cases, the researcher may postulate as to the nature of the relationship between the potential disease-causing agent and the disease. #Test the hypothesis #*Because epidemiological studies can rarely be conducted in a laboratory the results are often polluted by uncontrollable variations in the cases. This often makes the results difficult to interpret. Two methods have evolved to assess the strength of the relationship between the disease causing agent and the disease. #*Koch's postulates were the first criteria developed for epidemiological relationships. Because they only work well for highly contagious bacteria and toxins, this method is largely out of favor. #*Bradford-Hill Criteria are the current standards for epidemiological relationships. A relationship may fill all, some, or none of the criteria and still be true. #Publish the results.  Measures  Epidemiologists are famous for their use of rates. Each measure serves to characterize the disease giving valuable information about contagiousness, incubation period, duration, and mortality of the disease. = Measures of occurrence = # Incidence measures ## Incidence rate, where cases included are defined using a case definition ## Hazard rate ## Cumulative incidence # Prevalence measures ## Point prevalence ## Period prevalence = Measures of association = # Relative measures ## Risk ratio ## Rate ratio ## Odds ratio ## Hazard ratio # Absolute measures ## Absolute risk reduction ## Attributable risk ### Attributable risk in exposed ### Percent attributable risk ### Levin's attributable risk = Other measures = # Virulence and Infectivity # Mortality rate and Morbidity rate # Case fatality # Sensitivity (tests) and Specificity (tests) Limitations Epidemiological (and other observational) studies typically highlight associations between exposures and outcomes, rather than causation. While some consider this a limitation of observational research, epidemiological models of causation (e.g. Bradford Hill criteria) contend that an entire body of evidence is needed before determining if an association is truly causal. Moreover, many research questions are impossible to study in experimental settings, due to concerns around ethics and study validity. For example, the link between cigarette smoke and lung cancer was uncovered largely through observational research; however research ethics would certainly prohibit conducting a randomized trial of cigarette smoking once it had already been identified as a potential health threat.

Written in the last decade of his life, The Art of Fugue is the culmination of Bach's experimentation with monothematic instrumental works. This work consists of 14 fugues and four canons in D minor, each using some variation of a single principal subject, and generally ordered to increase in complexity. \\"The governing idea of the work\\", as put by Bach specialist Christoph Wolff, \\"was an exploration in depth of the contrapuntal possibilities inherent in a single musical subject.\\"Johann Sebastian Bach, the Learned Musician by Christoph Wolff, p. 433, . The word \\"contrapunctus\\" is often used for each fugue. Sources The earliest extant source of the work is an autograph manuscriptThe autograph manuscript bears the title ', written in the hand of Bach's son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol. This implies that the title was conceived at some point before the printed edition, which is titled ', but after the completion of the autograph. of the early 1740s, containing 12 fugues and 2 canons. This autograph is typically referred to by its call number of P200 in the Berlin State Library. Three manuscripts for pieces that would appear in the revised edition were bundled with P200 at some point before its acquisition by the library. The revised version was published in May 1751, slightly less than a year after Bach's death. In addition to changes in the order, notation, and material of pieces which appeared in the autograph, it contained 2 new fugues, 2 new canons, and 3 pieces of ostensibly spurious inclusion. A second edition was published in 1752, but differed only in its addition of a preface by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg. In spite of its revisions, the printed edition of 1751 contained a number of glaring editorial errors. The majority of these may be attributed to Bach's relatively sudden death in the midst of publication. Three pieces were included that do not appear to have been part of Bach's intended order: an unrevised (and thus redundant) version of the second double fugue, Contrapunctus X; a two-keyboard arrangementThe printed indication of \\"a 2 Clav.\\" and the counterpoint of the added voices do not appear to follow Bach's practice, evidencing that the parts were likely included by the editors of the printed edition to bolster the work. of the first mirror fugue, Contrapunctus XIII; and an organ chorale prelude \\"\\" (\\"Herewith I come before Thy Throne\\"), derived from BWV 668a, and noted in the introduction to the edition as a recompense for the work's incompleteness, having purportedly been dictated by Bach on his deathbed. The anomalous character of the published order and the Unfinished Fugue have engendered a wide variety of theories which attempt to restore the work to the state originally intended by Bach. Structure The Art of Fugue is based on a single subject: \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"church organ\\" \\\\clef treble \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 d,2 a'  f d  cis d4 e  f2~ f8 g f e  d4 } which each canon and fugue employs in some variation. The work divides into seven groups, according to each piece's prevailing contrapuntal device; in both editions, these groups and their respective components are generally ordered to increase in complexity. In the order in which they occur in the printed edition of 1751 (without the aforementioned works of spurious inclusion), the groups, and their components are as follows. Simple fugues: * Contrapunctus I: 4-voice fugue on principal subject * Contrapunctus II: 4-voice fugue on principal subject, accompanied by a 'French' style dotted rhythm * Contrapunctus III: 4-voice fugue on principal subject in inversion, employing intense chromaticism * Contrapunctus IV: 4-voice fugue on principal subject in inversion, employing counter-subjects Stretto Fugues (Counter- fugues), in which the subject is used simultaneously in regular, inverted, augmented, and diminished forms: * Contrapunctus V: Has many stretto entries, as do Contrapuncti VI and VII * Contrapunctus VI, a 4 in Stylo Francese: This adds both forms of the theme in diminution,Helmut Walcha, \\"Zu meiner Wiedergabe\\", in Die Kunst Der Fuge BWV 1080, St Laurenskerk Alkmaar 1956 (Archiv Production, Polydor International 1957), Insert pp. 5‚Äì11, at p. 7. (halving note lengths), with little rising and descending clusters of semiquavers in one voice answered or punctuated by similar groups in demisemiquavers in another, against sustained notes in the accompanying voices. The dotted rhythm, enhanced by these little rising and descending groups, suggests what is called \\"French style\\" in Bach's day, hence the name Stylo Francese. * Contrapunctus VII, a 4 per Augmentationem et Diminutionem: Uses augmented (doubling all note lengths) and diminished versions of the main subject and its inversion. Double and triple fugues, employing two and three subjects respectively: * Contrapunctus VIII, a 3: Triple fugue, with three subjects, having independent expositions * Contrapunctus IX, a 4 alla Duodecima: Double fugue, with two subjects occurring dependently, and in invertible counterpoint at the 12th * Contrapunctus X, a 4 alla Decima: Double fugue, with two subjects occurring dependently, and in invertible counterpoint at the 10th * Contrapunctus XI, a 4: Triple fugue, employing the three subjects of Contrapunctus VIII in inversion Mirror fugues, in which a piece is notated once and then with voices and counterpoint completely inverted, without violating contrapuntal rules or musicality: * Contrapunctus XII, a 4 * Contrapunctus XIII, a 3 Canons, labeled by interval and technique: * Canon per Augmentationem in Contrario Motu: Canon in which the following voice is both inverted and augmented. * Canon alla Ottava: Canon in imitation at the octave * Canon alla Decima in Contrapunto alla Terza: Canon in imitation at the tenth * Canon alla Duodecima in Contrapunto alla Quinta: Canon in imitation at the twelfth The Unfinished Fugue: * Fuga a 3 Soggetti (\\"Contrapunctus XIV\\"): 4-voice triple fugue (not completed by Bach, but likely to have become a quadruple fugue: see below), the third subject of which begins with the BACH motif, B‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìB ('H' in German letter notation). Instrumentation Both editions of the Art of Fugue are written in open score, where each voice is written on its own staff. This has led some to conclude that the Art of Fugue was intended as an intellectual exercise, meant to be studied more than heard. The renowned keyboardist and musicologist Gustav Leonhardt, argued that the Art of Fugue was probably intended to be played on a keyboard instrument (and specifically the harpsichord).David Schulenberg. \\"Expression and Authenticity in the Harpsichord Music of J.S. Bach\\". The Journal of Musicology, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Autumn, 1990), pp. 449‚Äì476 Leonhardt's arguments included the following: # It was common practice in the 17th and early 18th centuries to publish keyboard pieces in open score, especially those that are contrapuntally complex. Examples include Frescobaldi's Fiori musicali (1635), Samuel Scheidt's Tabulatura Nova (1624), works by Johann Jakob Froberger (1616‚Äì1667), Franz Anton Maichelbeck (1702‚Äì1750), and others. #The range of none of the ensemble or orchestral instruments of the period corresponds to any of the ranges of the voices in The Art of Fugue. Furthermore, none of the melodic shapes that characterize Bach's ensemble writing are found in the work, and there is no basso continuo. #The fugue types used are reminiscent of the types in The Well-Tempered Clavier, rather than Bach's ensemble fugues; Leonhardt also shows an \\"optical\\" resemblance between the fugues of the two collections, and points out other stylistic similarities between them. #Finally, since the bass voice in The Art of Fugue occasionally rises above the tenor, and the tenor becomes the \\"real\\" bass, Leonhardt deduces that the bass part was not meant to be doubled at 16-foot pitch, thus eliminating the pipe organ as the intended instrument, leaving the harpsichord as the most logical choice. Despite this controversy as to whether The Art of Fugue should be performed at all and, if so, on what instrument, the work has been performed and recorded by many different solo instruments and ensembles. The Unfinished Fugue The final page of Contrapunctus XIV A handwritten manuscript of the piece known as the Unfinished Fugue is among the three bundled with the autograph manuscript P200. It breaks off abruptly in the middle of its third section, with an only partially written measure 239. This autograph carries a note in the handwriting of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, stating \\"√úber dieser Fuge, wo der Name B A C H im Contrasubject angebracht worden, ist der Verfasser gestorben.\\" (\\"At the point where the composer introduces the name BACH [for which the English notation would be B‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìB] in the countersubject to this fugue, the composer died.\\") This account is disputed by modern scholars, as the manuscript is clearly written in Bach's own hand, and thus dates to a time before his deteriorating health and vision would have prevented his ability to write, probably 1748‚Äì1749.See e.g. the discussion in Johann Sebastian Bach, the Learned Musician by Christoph Wolff, . =Attempts at completion= A number of musicians and musicologists have composed conjectural completions of Contrapunctus XIV which include the fourth subject, including musicologists Donald Tovey (1931), Zolt√°n G√∂ncz (1992), Yngve Jan Trede (1995), and Thomas Daniel (2010), organists Helmut Walcha, David Goode, Lionel Rogg, and Davitt Moroney (1989). Ferruccio Busoni's Fantasia contrappuntistica is based on Contrapunctus XIV, but it develops Bach's ideas to Busoni's own purposes in Busoni's musical style, rather than working out Bach's thoughts as Bach himself might have done.See Donald Tovey's comments in A Companion to the Art of Fugue (2013 Dover reprint, , page 177 footnote). Other completions that do not incorporate the fourth subject including those by the French classical organist Alexandre Pierre Fran√ßois Bo√´ly and pianist Kimiko Douglass-Ishizaka. =Significance= In 2007, New Zealand organist and conductor Indra Hughes completed a doctoral thesis about the unfinished ending of Contrapunctus XIV, proposing that the work was left unfinished not because Bach died, but as a deliberate choice by Bach to encourage independent efforts at a completion.University of Auckland News, Volume 37, Issue 9 (May 25, 2007) The thesis is available online: http://hdl.handle.net/2292/392 Douglas Hofstadter's book G√∂del, Escher, Bach discusses the unfinished fugue and Bach's supposed death during composition as a tongue-in-cheek illustration of Austrian logician Kurt G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem. According to G√∂del, the very power of a \\"sufficiently powerful\\" formal mathematical system can be exploited to \\"undermine\\" the system, by leading to statements that assert such things as \\"I cannot be proven in this system\\". In Hofstadter's discussion, Bach's great compositional talent is used as a metaphor for a \\"sufficiently powerful\\" formal system; however, Bach's insertion of his own name \\"in code\\" into the fugue is not, even metaphorically, a case of G√∂delian self-reference; and Bach's failure to finish his self-referential fugue serves as a metaphor for the unprovability of the G√∂delian assertion, and thus for the incompleteness of the formal system. Sylvestre and Costa reported a mathematical architecture of The Art of Fugue, based on bar counts, which shows that the whole work was conceived on the basis of the Fibonacci series and the golden ratio. The significance of the mathematical architecture can probably be explained by considering the role of the work as a membership contribution to the , and to the \\"scientific\\" meaning that Bach attributed to counterpoint.

For example, in a drug study, the treated population may die at twice the rate per unit time as the control population. The hazard ratio would be 2, indicating higher hazard of death from the treatment. Hazard ratios differ from relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) in that RRs and ORs are cumulative over an entire study, using a defined endpoint, while HRs represent instantaneous risk over the study time period, or some subset thereof. Hazard ratios suffer somewhat less from selection bias with respect to the endpoints chosen and can indicate risks that happen before the endpoint. Definition and derivation Regression models are used to obtain hazard ratios and their confidence intervals. The instantaneous hazard rate is the limit of the number of events per unit time divided by the number at risk, as the time interval approaches 0. :: h(t) = \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{observed \\\\;events \\\\;in \\\\; interval} [t, t+\\\\Delta t]/N(t)}{\\\\Delta t} where N(t) is the number at risk at the beginning of an interval. A hazard is the probability that a patient fails between t and t+\\\\Delta t, given that he has survived up to time t, divided by \\\\Delta t, as \\\\Delta t approaches zero. The hazard ratio is the effect on this hazard rate of a difference, such as group membership (for example, treatment or control, male or female), as estimated by regression models that treat the log of the HR as a function of a baseline hazard h_0(t) and a linear combination of explanatory variables: ::\\\\log h(t) = f(h_0(t),\\\\alpha + \\\\beta_1 X_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_k X_k).\\\\, Such models are generally classed proportional hazards regression models; the best known being the Cox semiparametric proportional hazards model, and the exponential, Gompertz and Weibull parametric models. For two groups that differ only in treatment condition, the ratio of the hazard functions is given by e^\\\\beta, where \\\\beta is the estimate of treatment effect derived from the regression model. This hazard ratio, that is, the ratio between the predicted hazard for a member of one group and that for a member of the other group, is given by holding everything else constant, i.e. assuming proportionality of the hazard functions. For a continuous explanatory variable, the same interpretation applies to a unit difference. Other HR models have different formulations and the interpretation of the parameter estimates differs accordingly. Interpretation Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating overall survival based on volume of brain metastases. Elaimy et al. (2011) In its simplest form, the hazard ratio can be interpreted as the chance of an event occurring in the treatment arm divided by the chance of the event occurring in the control arm, or vice versa, of a study. The resolution of these endpoints are usually depicted using Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves. These curves relate the proportion of each group where the endpoint has not been reached. The endpoint could be any dependent variable associated with the covariate (independent variable), e.g. death, remission of disease or contraction of disease. The curve represents the odds of an endpoint having occurred at each point in time (the hazard). The hazard ratio is simply the relationship between the instantaneous hazards in the two groups and represents, in a single number, the magnitude of distance between the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier plots. Hazard ratios do not reflect a time unit of the study. The difference between hazard-based and time-based measures is akin to the difference between the odds of winning a race and the margin of victory. When a study reports one hazard ratio per time period, it is assumed that difference between groups was proportional. Hazard ratios become meaningless when this assumption of proportionality is not met. If the proportional hazard assumption holds, a hazard ratio of one means equivalence in the hazard rate of the two groups, whereas a hazard ratio other than one indicates difference in hazard rates between groups. The researcher indicates the probability of this sample difference being due to chance by reporting the probability associated with some test statistic. For instance, the \\\\beta from the Cox-model or the log-rank test might then be used to assess the significance of any differences observed in these survival curves. Conventionally, probabilities lower than 0.05 are considered significant and researchers provide a 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio, e.g. derived from the standard deviation of the Cox-model regression coefficient, i.e. \\\\beta. Statistically significant hazard ratios cannot include unity (one) in their confidence intervals. =The proportional hazards assumption= The proportional hazards assumption for hazard ratio estimation is strong and often unreasonable. Complications, adverse effects and late effects are all possible causes of change in the hazard rate over time. For instance, a surgical procedure may have high early risk, but excellent long term outcomes. If the hazard ratio between groups remain constant, this is not a problem for interpretation. However, interpretation of hazard ratios become impossible when selection bias exists between groups. For instance, a particularly risky surgery might result in the survival of a systematically more robust group who would have fared better under any of the competing treatment conditions, making it look as if the risky procedure was better. Follow-up time is also important. A cancer treatment associated with better remission rates might on follow-up be associated with higher relapse rates. The researchers' decision about when to follow up is arbitrary and may lead to very different reported hazard ratios. =The hazard ratio and survival= Hazard ratios are often treated as a ratio of death probabilities. For example, a hazard ratio of 2 is thought to mean that a group has twice the chance of dying than a comparison group. In the Cox-model, this can be shown to translate to the following relationship between group survival functions: S_1(t) = S_0(t)^r (where r is the hazard ratio). Therefore, with a hazard ratio of 2, if S_0(t) = 0.2 (20% survived at time t), S_1(t) = 0.2^2 = 0.04 (4% survived at t). The corresponding death probabilities are 0.8 and 0.96. It should be clear that the hazard ratio is a relative measure of effect and tells us nothing about absolute risk. While hazard ratios allow for hypothesis testing, they should be considered alongside other measures for interpretation of the treatment effect, e.g. the ratio of median times (median ratio) at which treatment and control group participants are at some endpoint. If the analogy of a race is applied, the hazard ratio is equivalent to the odds that an individual in the group with the higher hazard reaches the end of the race first. The probability of being first can be derived from the odds, which is the probability of being first divided by the probability of not being first: * HR = P/(1 ‚àí P); P = HR/(1 + HR). In the previous example, a hazard ratio of 2 corresponds to a 67% chance of an early death. The hazard ratio does not convey information about how soon the death will occur. =The hazard ratio, treatment effect and time-based endpoints= Treatment effect depends on the underlying disease related to survival function, not just the hazard ratio. Since the hazard ratio does not give us direct time-to-event information, researchers have to report median endpoint times and calculate the median endpoint time ratio by dividing the control group median value by the treatment group median value. While the median endpoint ratio is a relative speed measure, the hazard ratio is not. The relationship between treatment effect and the hazard ratio is given as e^\\\\beta. A statistically important, but practically insignificant effect can produce a large hazard ratio, e.g. a treatment increasing the number of one-year survivors in a population from one in 10,000 to one in 1,000 has a hazard ratio of 10. It is unlikely that such a treatment would have had much impact on the median endpoint time ratio, which likely would have been close to unity, i.e. mortality was largely the same regardless of group membership and clinically insignificant. By contrast, a treatment group in which 50% of infections are resolved after one week (versus 25% in the control) yields a hazard ratio of two. If it takes ten weeks for all cases in the treatment group and half of cases in the control group to resolve, the ten-week hazard ratio remains at two, but the median endpoint time ratio is ten, a clinically significant difference.

The distance between the town of Rotorua and the town of Taupo is 80 km. (White Island is not shown.) Whakaari/White Island The Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) is a volcanic area in the North Island of New Zealand that has been active for the past two million years and is still highly active. Mount Ruapehu marks its south-western end and the zone runs north-eastward through the Taupo and Rotorua areas and offshore into the Bay of Plenty. It is part of the larger Central Volcanic Region that extends further westward through the western Bay of Plenty to the eastern side of the Coromandel Peninsula and has been active for four million years. The Taupo Volcanic Zone is widening east‚Äìwest at the rate of about 8 mm per year. It is named after Lake Taupo, the flooded caldera of the largest volcano in the zone, the Taupo Volcano. Activity There are numerous volcanic vents and geothermal fields in the zone, with Mount Ruapehu, Mount Ngauruhoe and White Island erupting most frequently. The zone's largest eruption since the arrival of Europeans was that of Mount Tarawera in 1886, which killed over 100 people. Early Maori would also have been affected by the much larger Kaharoa eruption from Tarawera around 1300 AD. The last major eruption from Lake Taupo, the Hatepe eruption, occurred in 232 AD. It is believed to have first emptied the lake then followed that feat with a pyroclastic flow that covered about of land with volcanic ash. A total of of material is believed to have been ejected, and over of material is estimated to have been ejected in just a few minutes. The date of this activity was previously thought to be 186AD as the ash expulsion was thought to be sufficiently large to turn the sky red over Rome and China (as documented in Hou Han Shu), but this has since been disproven. Taupo erupted an estimated of material in its Oruanui eruption 26,500 years ago. This was Earth's most recent eruption reaching VEI-8, the highest level on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The Rotorua caldera has been dormant longer, with its main eruption occurring about 240,000 years ago, although lava dome extrusion has occurred within the last 25,000 years. Extent and geological context The Taupo Volcanic Zone is approximately long by wide. Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end, while White Island is considered its northeastern limit. It forms a southern portion of the active Lau-Havre-Taupo back-arc basin, which lies behind the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone.Volcanic activity continues to the north-northeast, along the line of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, through several undersea volcanoes (known as Clark, Tangaroa, the Silents and the Rumbles), then shifts eastward to the parallel volcanic arc of the Kermadec Islands and Tonga. Although the back-arc basin continues to propagate to the southwest, with the South Wanganui Basin forming an initial back-arc basin, volcanic activity has not yet begun in this region. South of Kaikoura the plate boundary changes to a transform boundary with oblique continental collision uplifting the Southern Alps in the South Island. A subduction zone reappears southwest of Fiordland, at the southwestern corner of the South Island, although here the subduction is in the opposite direction. Solander Island is an extinct volcano associated with this subduction zone, and the only one that protrudes above the sea. Scientific study Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth's crust below the Taupo Volcanic Zone may be as little as 16 kilometres thick. A film of magma 50 kilometres (30 mi) wide and 160 kilometres (100 mi) long lies 10 kilometres under the surface. 01311. The geological record indicates that some of the volcanoes in the area erupt infrequently but have large, violent and destructive eruptions when they do. There is also some possible rifting in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.

Tatchell was selected as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey in 1981. He was then denounced by party leader Michael Foot for ostensibly supporting extra-parliamentary action against the Thatcher government. Labour subsequently allowed him to stand in the Bermondsey by-election in February 1983, in which the party lost the seat to the Liberals. In the 1990s he campaigned for LGBT rights through the direct action group OutRage!, which he co-founded. He has worked on various campaigns, such as Stop Murder Music against music lyrics allegedly inciting violence against LGBT people and writes and broadcasts on various human rights and social justice issues. He attempted a citizen's arrest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in 1999 and again in 2001. In April 2004, he joined the Green Party of England and Wales and in 2007 was selected as prospective parliamentary candidate in the constituency of Oxford East, but in December 2009 announced he was standing down due to brain damage he says was caused by a bus accident as well as damage inflicted by Mugabe's bodyguards when Tatchell tried to arrest him in 2001, and by neo-Nazis in Moscow while campaigning for gay rights. Since 2011 he has been the Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation. Early life Peter Tatchell at his home in 2007 Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. He started work as a sign-writer and window-dresser in department stores. Tatchell claims to have incorporated the theatricality of these displays into his activism.\\"Is This Your Life?\\" television programme, Channel 4, 5 August 1995. Raised as a Christian, Tatchell says that he \\"ditched [his] faith a long time ago\\" and is an atheist. It is widely reported that Tatchell is a vegan; however, Tatchell himself only states that he eats no meat, but does eat eggs, cheese, and, according to Richard Fairbrass, wild salmon, meaning Tatchell is a pescatarian. He became interested in outdoor adventurous activities such as surfing and mountain climbing. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions about how insurance and legal risks were making British teachers reluctant to take pupils on outdoor adventures, he said outdoor activities helped him develop the courage to take political risks in adult life. =Campaigns in Australia= Tatchell's political activity began at Mount Waverley Secondary College, where in 1967 he launched campaigns in support of Australia's Aboriginal people. Tatchell was elected secretary of the school's Student Representative Council. In his final year in 1968, as school captain, he took the lead in setting up a scholarship scheme for Aborigines and led a campaign for Aboriginal land rights. These activities led the headmaster to claim he had been manipulated by communists. He joined the Australian campaign against the death penalty. Prompted by the impending hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967, Tatchell went round his local area painting slogans against the hanging, a fact he did not reveal until nearly 30 years later.\\"Bermondsey ten years on\\", Gay Times, February 1993. Ryan was accused of killing a prison warder while escaping from Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria. Tatchell claimed, unsuccessfully, that the trajectory of the bullet through the warder's body probably made it impossible that Ryan could have fired the fatal shot. In 1968, Tatchell began campaigning against the American and Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, in his view a war of aggression in support of a \\"brutal and corrupt dictatorship\\" responsible for torture and executions. The Victoria state government and Melbourne city council attempted to suppress the anti-Vietnam War campaign by banning street leafleting and taking police action against anti-war demonstrations.New Statesman: Volume 137, Issues 4891‚Äì4903, 2008. In 2004, he proposed the renaming of Australian capital cities with their Aborigine place names. = Gay Liberation Front = Original UK Gay Liberation Front activists, including Bette Bourne (on the left), at an LSE 40th anniversary celebration. Tatchell is fourth from the left. To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971.Jorge Morales, \\"Tatchell's Long Crusade\\", The Advocate, 2 May 1995; page 23. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972. In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists. Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.Peter Tatchell, \\"GLF at the World Youth Festival, GDR 1973\\", in Gay Marxist No 3 (October 1973). Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that: = Graduation = After taking A levels at evening classes, he attended the Polytechnic of North London (PNL), now part of London Metropolitan University, where he obtained a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in sociology. At PNL he was a member of the National Union of Students Gay Rights Campaign. On graduating he became a freelance journalist specialising in foreign stories, during which he publicised the Indonesian annexation of West Papua and child labour on British-owned tea farms in Malawi.\\"Britain's profitable brew\\", New Statesman, 20 July 1979, p. 88‚Äì89  Political activity  rainbow flag, the international LGBT symbol Tatchell popularised the phrase \\"sexual apartheid\\" to describe the separate laws that long existed for gays and heterosexuals.Tim Ross (19 March 2011). \\"Peter Tatchell bids to overturn gay marriage ban at European Court of Human Rights\\". The Daily Telegraph (London).Megan Murphy (31 July 2006). \\"British Lesbians Lose Bid to Validate Their Marriage\\" , Bloomberg News (New York). =Labour candidate for Bermondsey= In 1978, Tatchell joined the Labour Party and moved to a council flat in Bermondsey, south-east London. At the Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party's (CLP) AGM in February 1980, the left group won control and Tatchell was elected Secretary. When the sitting Labour MP, Bob Mellish, announced his retirement in 1981, Tatchell was selected as his successor, despite Arthur Latham, a former MP and former Chairman of the Tribune Group, being considered the favourite. While Militant was cited as the reason for Tatchell's selection, Tatchell disagrees and ascribes his selection to the support of the \\"older, 'born and bred' working class; the younger professional and intellectual members swung behind Latham\\".Peter Tatchell (1983). The Battle for Bermondsey. Heretic Books. p. 50. In an article for a left-wing magazine, Tatchell urged the Labour Party to support direct action campaigning to challenge the Margaret Thatcher-led Tory government, stating \\"we must look to new more militant forms of extra-parliamentary opposition which involve mass popular participation and challenge the government's right to rule\\".London Labour Briefing, November 1981. Social Democratic Party MP James Wellbeloved, arguing the article was anti-Parliamentary, quoted it at Prime Minister's Questions in November 1981. Foot denounced Tatchell, stating that he would not be endorsed as a candidate and a vote at the Labour Party National Executive Committee denied Tatchell's endorsement. However, the Bermondsey Labour Party continued to support him and it was eventually agreed that when the selection was rerun, Tatchell would be eligible, and he duly won. When Mellish resigned from Parliament and triggered a by-election, Tatchell's candidacy was endorsed, and the ensuing campaign was regarded as one of the dirtiest and most violent in modern British history. Tatchell was assaulted in the street, had his flat attacked, and had a death threat and a live bullet put through his letterbox in the night. Although the Bermondsey seat had long been a Labour stronghold, the Liberal candidate, Simon Hughes, won the election. During the campaign, allegations were made that some Liberal canvassers stirred up xenophobia and homophobia on the doorsteps, playing up the fact that Tatchell was born in Australia and making an issue of his homosexuality. Members of the Liberal Gay Action Group campaigned wearing lapel badges with the words, \\"I've been kissed by Peter Tatchell\\" following the suggestion that he was attempting to hide his sexuality. One of Hughes' campaign leaflets claimed the election was \\"a straight choice\\" between Liberal and Labour,. Hughes has since apologised for what may have been seen as an inadvertent slur and later came out as bisexual in 2006. = Democratic Defence = Tatchell's book Democratic Defence was published in 1985. This outlined how defence of the United Kingdom might be assured after the nuclear disarmament that he and the Labour Party were then committed to. (Labour has since abandoned this policy.)History of the Labour Party , Labour Party website, accessed 21 March 2014. It argued that the British military was still organised on an imperialist strategy of basing troops abroad rather than on a strategy of defending the UK itself against foreign attacks. Citing the problems that the British army was facing in Northern Ireland, he argued that their long-established methods were ineffective against guerilla warfare., for troops to be allowed to join trade unions and political parties, and to end strict adherence to \\"petty regulations\\". He favorably noted the World War 2 era British Home Guard as an example of a citizens' army, as well as the armed forces of Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia as positive examples. The book also argues for withdrawal from NATO and for the establishment of a European Self-Defence Organisation, independent of both the United States, whom he felt that Europe had become too dependent on their military protection, and the Soviet Union, which he condemned for their invasions of Czechoslovakia and of Afghanistan, as well its internal repression. He quoted with approval Enoch Powell's argument that the threat from the Soviet Union to the UK was exaggerated. =Green issues= Peter Tatchell at the Cowley Road Carnival in Oxford in July 2007 In February 2000 Tatchell resigned from Labour, citing the treatment of Ken Livingstone during the nomination of a candidate for Mayor of London, and of similar cases in the Scottish and Welsh elections, as evidence that the party \\"no longer has any mechanism for democratic involvement and transformation\\".Peter Tatchell: Why I Resigned from Labour , petertatchell.net, 23 February 2000. He fought unsuccessfully for a seat on the London Assembly as an Independent candidate within the Green Left grouping, in support of Livingstone. On 7 April 2004 he announced that he had joined the Green Party of England and Wales but did not envisage standing for election. However, in 2007, he became the party's parliamentary candidate for Oxford East. On 16 December 2009, he withdrew as a candidate claiming brain damage from an assault while protesting in Brussels in 2001, while protesting in Moscow in 2007 and in a bus accident in July 2009. Tatchell opposes nuclear power; instead he advocates concentrated solar power.Peter Tatchell, \\"Economic Democracy\\" ‚Äì How The Light Gets In, 5 June 2012 In Tribune, he pointed out the adverse effects of climate change: \\"By 2050, if climate change proceeds unchecked, England will no longer be a green and pleasant land. In between periods of prolonged scorching drought, we are likely to suffer widespread flooding.\\" For many years, he supported a green‚Äìred alliance. More recently, he helped launch the Green Left grouping within the Green Party. He urged links between trade unions and the Greens. On 27 April 2010, he urged Green Party supporters to vote for Liberal Democrats in constituencies where they had an incumbent MP or a strong chance of winning.BBC News: Live coverage ‚Äì General Election 2010, 27 April 2010, 16:03 = Iraq War = Tatchell opposed the war in Iraq, and its subsequent occupation. For nearly three decades he had previously supported the Iraqi Left Opposition, helping them remove the government of Saddam Hussein because of the gross violations of human rights that Hussein had committed against democrats, left-wingers, trade unionists, Shia Muslims and the Kurdish people, and because under Saddam's dictatorship there were no opportunities for peaceful, democratic change. He advocated military and financial aid to opponents of the Saddam government, suggesting that anti-Saddam organisations be given \\"tanks, helicopter gun-ships, fighter planes, heavy artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles\\".Peter Tatchell (19 March 2003). \\"Iraq: the third way\\". The Guardian (London). While opposing western intervention, he advocated regime change from within in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria.\\"ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT IGNORES SADDAM'S CRIMES Tatchell has written that on 12 March 2003 he ambushed Tony Blair's motorcade in an anti-Iraq war protest. He forced Blair's limousine to stop, and then unfolded a banner that read \\"Arm the Kurds! Topple Saddam\\". He added that in terms of the political struggle within Britain (as opposed to struggles against absolute tyrants like Hitler and Saddam, where violent resistance can be the lesser of two evils): \\"I remain committed to the Gandhian principle of non-violence\\".\\"Diary\\" ‚Äì Peter Tatchell. New Statesman (London), 24 March 2003. After the war he signed the 'Unite Against Terror' declaration, arguing that \\"the pseudo-left reveals its shameless hypocrisy and its wholesale abandonment of humanitarian values\\" by supporting resistance and insurgent groups in Iraq that resort to indiscriminate terrorism, killing innocent civilians. In 2003, Tatchell said he supported giving \\"massive material aid\\" to Iraqi opposition groups, including the \\"Shi'ite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq\\" (SCIRI), to bring down Saddam. But in 2006 Tatchell noted that SCIRI had become markedly more fundamentalist and was endorsing violent attacks on anyone who did not conform to its increasingly harsh interpretation of Islam. He claimed that SCIRI, the leading force in Baghdad's ruling coalition, wanted to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship, with a goal of clerical fascism, and had engaged in \\"terrorisation of gay Iraqis\\", as well as terrorising Sunni Muslims, left- wingers, unveiled women and people who listen to western pop music or wear jeans or shorts.Peter Tatchell, \\"Iraq ‚Äì Ayatollah Sistani Says Death to Gays; Sistani fatwa encourages terror against queers. Shia Badr Corps execute sodomites, Sunnis and others. UK fetes Sistani and hosts Badr's political wing, despite anti-gay murders.\\" , 15 March 2006.; News story about protest- Marc Shoffman, \\"Iraqi Ayatollah sparks outrage after decreeing death to gays\\", Pink News, 17 March 2006. In September 2014, Tatchell advocated arming the Kurdistan Workers Party to fight against ISIS, and argued that the US and EU had been wrong to designate it as a terrorist organisation. In November 2015, Tatchell condemned the conviction of British teenager Silhan √ñz√ßelik for trying to join the Kurdistan Workers Party. =Syrian civil war= A previous supporter of the Stop the War Coalition, Tatchell and many other public personalities expressed concern with the coalition's allegedly unduly favourable view of Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and has called for the Labour leader and former Stop the War Chair Jeremy Corbyn not to attend the Coalition's Christmas fundraiser 2015. In December 2016, Tatchell and others disrupted Corbyn's speech on human rights on the basis that the Labour leader had responded insufficiently to the bombing of Aleppo and urged him to condemn Russian military intervention in Syria. = Balochistan = Since 2006, he expressed concern for the Baloch people facing military operations in their homeland, Balochistan in Pakistan. From 2007 to 2009, he campaigned in defence of two UK-based Baloch Muslim human rights activists, Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch, accused of terrorism charges and tried in London. Both men were acquitted in 2009. He alleged British and U.S. collusion with the suppression of the Balochs, including arms sales to Pakistan, which he says were used to bomb and attack Baloch towns and villages.Peter Tatchell, \\"Balochistan: UN Speech\\", delivered to Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization; Human Rights in Pakistan conference held at the United Nations in Geneva on 11 March 2010 parallel to the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council. The conference was co-hosted by UNPO and Interfaith International. () = Activities in Moscow = In May 2006 Tatchell attended the first Moscow Pride Festival. He appears in the documentary Moscow Pride '06 featuring this event. In May 2007 Tatchell returned to Moscow to support Moscow Pride and to voice his opposition to a ban on the march, staying at the flat of an American diplomat. On 27 May 2007, Tatchell and other gay rights activists were attacked. He was punched in the face and nearly knocked unconscious, while other demonstrators were beaten, kicked and assaulted. A German MP, Volker Beck, and a European Parliament deputy from Italy, Marco Cappato, were also punched before being arrested and questioned by police. Tatchell later said \\"I'm not deterred one iota from coming back to protest in Moscow.\\"http://pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4499.html On his release, Tatchell made a report on the incident to the American Embassy. On 16 May 2009, the day of the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow, Russian gay rights activists staged a protest in Moscow in defiance of the city's mayor, Yuri Luzkhov, who had long banned gay demonstrations and denounced them as \\"satanic\\". Tatchell was among 32 campaigners arrested when they shouted slogans and unfurled banners. = NUS politics = On 14 February 2015, Tatchell was one of a number of signatories to a letter criticising the trend in the British National Union of Students to apply a No Platform policy to feminists who criticised the sex industry or challenged demands made by certain groups of trans people. In particular, the letter cited the denial of a platform to Kate Smurthwaite at Goldsmith's College and to Germaine Greer at the University of Cambridge. Tatchell received death threats after signing the letter. He later stated that he would have worded the letter differently to clarify that he supported the human rights of trans people and sex workers, but that he had signed the letter nonetheless because he believed in the message of free speech on campuses. He said that the initial draft that he signed contained the sentence \\"Some of us have disagreements with the views expressed [by feminist critics of trans people]\\", and that he was \\"not happy\\" that this was cut out of the final letter. On 13 February 2016, Fran Cowling, the national LGBT representative for the NUS, refused to share a platform with Tatchell at Canterbury Christ Church University to discuss the topic of \\"re- radicalising queers\\". Cowling said that Tatchell supported speakers who are \\"openly transphobic and incite violence\\" against transgender people, and also that Tatchell had used \\"racist language\\". Tatchell responded that no evidence could be produced to support either claim, and that Cowling had never consulted the NUS membership before deciding to make pronouncements on their behalf, and said \\"This sorry, sad saga is symptomatic of the decline of free and open debate on some university campuses. There is a witch-hunting, accusatory atmosphere. Allegations are made without evidence to back them ‚Äì or worse, they are made citing false, trumped-up evidence.\\" =2015 Labour Party leadership election= In August 2015, Tatchell endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He tweeted: \\"Jeremy Corbyn is the best hope for a progressive shake up of UK politics @jeremycorbyn @Corbyn4Leader #SignUp4Corbyn\\". Since then he has criticised Corbyn, tweeting in August 2018: \\"For all of us who support Jeremy Corbyn's UK social justice policies, his repeated praise for, & collusion with, anti-semites & Islamist fascists is very disturbing. He has NEVER recanted or apologised.\\" Tatchell urged his followers to read a piece on Corbyn's links to Raed Salah.  Campaigns  Peter Tatchell being interviewed by Natalie Thorne, deputy editor of Fyne Times, at a 'First Sunday' event, November 2007 = OutRage! = Tatchell took part in many gay rights campaigns over issues such as Section 28. Following the murder of actor Michael Boothe on 10 May 1990, Tatchell was one of thirty people to attend the inaugural meeting of the radical gay rights non-violent direct action group OutRage! ‚Äì although he was not a co-founder ‚Äì and has remained a leading member. The group fuses theatrical performance styles with queer protest. As the most prominent OutRage! member, Tatchell is sometimes assumed to be the leader of the group, though he has never claimed this, saying he is one among equals.See, e.g., Ian Lucas, \\"OutRage! ‚Äì an oral history\\", Cassell 1998. In 1991, a small group of OutRage! members covertly formed a separate group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group's go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS's threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell's assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate the hypocrisy of those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.Ian Lucas, \\"OutRage! ‚Äì an oral history\\", Cassell 1998, pp. 63‚Äì71 Some OutRage! activities were highly controversial. In 1994, it unveiled placards inviting ten Church of England bishops to \\"tell the truth\\" about what Outrage! alleged was their homosexuality and accusing them of condemning homosexuality in public while leading secret gay lives. Shortly afterwards the group wrote to twenty UK MPs, condemning their alleged support for anti-gay laws and claiming they would out them if the MPs did not stop what they described as attacks on the gay community. The MP Sir James Kilfedder, one such opponent of gay equality,http://www.scotsgay.co.uk/text/sg3.txt who had received one of the letters, died two months later of a sudden heart attack on the day one of the Belfast newspapers planned to out him. In a comment in The Independent in October 2003, Tatchell claimed the OutRage! action against the bishops was his greatest mistake because he failed to anticipate that the media and the church would treat it as an invasion of privacy. On 12 April 1998, Tatchell led an OutRage! protest, which disrupted the Easter sermon by George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with Tatchell mounting the pulpit to denounce what he claimed was Carey's opposition to legal equality for lesbian and gay people. The protest garnered media coverage and led to Tatchell's prosecution under the little-used Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 (formerly part of the Brawling Act 1551), which prohibits any form of disruption or protest in a church.Garner, Clare (30 November 1998). \\"Stars of stage and pulpit will support 'indecent' Tatchell\\". The Independent (London).Garner, Clare (1 December 1998). \\"Protest in the cathedral 'political', says Tatchell\\". The Independent (London). Tatchell failed in his attempt to summon Carey as a witness and was convicted. The judge fined him the trivial sum of ¬£18.60, which commentators theorised was a wry allusion to the year of the statute used to convict him.\\"Tatchell defends Mugabe 'arrest'\\". BBC News. 6 March 2001.Summerskill, Ben (23 February 2003).\\"The Observer Profile: Peter Tatchell: Just a zealous guy\\". The Observer (London). The LGBT press dubbed him \\"Saint Peter Tatchell\\" following further OutRage! campaigns involving religion. A number of African LGBTI leaders signed a statement condemning the involvement of Tatchell and OutRage! in African issues, which led Tatchell to respond that he favoured working with the radical LGBTI groups in Africa rather than the more conservative (according to him) leaders who had signed the statement. Tatchell and OutRage! published a refutation of the allegations. OutRage!'s protest against Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, who supported the idea of genetic engineering to eliminate homosexuality,\\"If we could by some form of genetic engineering eliminate these trends, we should‚Äîso long as it is done for a therapeutic purpose\\" ‚Äî letter to the Jewish Chronicle, 16 July 1993 led to accusations that Tatchell was antisemitic, following OutRage!'s leaflets citing the similarity of Jakobovits ideas for the eradication of homosexuality to those of Heinrich Himmler were distributed outside the Western and Marble Arch Synagogue on the Rosh Hashanah in September 1993. Rabbi Dame Julia Neuberger, who had campaigned for gay rights, said \\"Drawing a comparison between Lord Jakobovits and Himmler is offensive, racist and [...] makes OutRage appear antisemitic\\". She stated that the action and leaflet would \\"alienate Jews who are sympathetic to gay rights\\".Jason Bennetto, \\"Is this comparison odious?\\", The Independent, 31 October 1993.  Stop Murder Music campaign  Tatchell argues that a number of Afro- Caribbean artists produce music that glorifies murder of homosexual men, and incites violence against homosexuals. He argued that British laws against incitement to violence were not being enforced on foreign artists traveling to the UK. He also organised protests outside the concerts of singers whose lyrics he says incite violence, mainly Jamaican dancehall and ragga artists who he says glorify violence toward lesbians and gay men, including murder. Tatchell's campaign began in 1992 when Buju Banton's song \\"Boom bye-bye\\" was released. He has picketed the MOBO Awards ceremony to protest at their inviting performers of what he terms \\"murder music\\". Tatchell argues that murder is not legal in Jamaica, and glorification of murder is not a legitimate form of Afro-Caribbean culture. In response Tatchell received death threats and was labelled racist. He defended himself by noting that the campaign was at the behest of the Jamaican gay rights group J-Flag, and the UK-based Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, with which he works closely. He pointed to what he described as his life's work campaigning against racism and apartheid and stated that his campaigns against \\"murder music\\" and state- sanctioned homophobic violence in Jamaica were endorsed by black Jamaican gay rights activists such as Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG), and by many straight human rights activists in Jamaica (male homosexuality remains illegal in Jamaica). The campaign has had positive effects with seven of eight original murder music singers signing the Reggae Compassion Act, which says that signatories will not \\"make statements or perform songs\\" that incite hatred or violence.Leah Nelson, \\"Jamaica's Anti-Gay 'Murder Music' Carries Violent Message\\" Intelligence Report, Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140. Members of the Rastafari movement accused Tatchell of racism and extremism, saying, \\"He has gone over way over the top. It's simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla in the same bracket and just shows how far he is prepared to go.\\"Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter. \\"Black Music Council Defends DJ's\\" , The Sunday Gleaner (sosjamaica.org). 13 December 2004. Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler. =Age of consent laws and Pedophile Information Exchange= In 1996, Tatchell led an OutRage! campaign to reduce the age of consent in the UK to 14 years, to adjust for studies that showed nearly half of all young people had their first sexual experiences prior to 16 years old, regardless of sexuality. He stated that he wished to exempt these people from being \\"treated as criminals by the law,\\" and that the campaign claimed there should be no prosecution if the difference in ages of the sexual partners was no more than three years, provided that these youths are given a more comprehensive sex education at a younger date. He was quoted in the OutRage!'s press release as saying \\"Young people have a right to accept or reject sex, according to what they feel is appropriate for them\\".OutRage! press release, 21 February 1996 Leo McKinstry, in The Sun, called the release \\"a perverts' charter\\".McKinstry, Leo (24 February 1996). \\"Gays Homing in on Kids\\". The Sun (London). Tatchell has since reiterated that he does not condone adults having sex with children. On his personal website, under the subsection Age of Consent, he writes: On 10 March 2008, in the Irish Independent, he repeated his call for a lower age of consent to end the criminalisation of young people engaged in consenting sex and to remove the legal obstacles to upfront sex education, condom provision and safer sex advice. Alt URL In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised what he calls the body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society. In 2006, he opposed the appointment of Ruth Kelly as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as Kelly had not supported equal treatment of lesbians and gay men in any parliamentary votes. Tatchell said \\"her appointment suggests the government does not take lesbian and gay rights seriously\\", adding \\"Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race-equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism\\". Paedophile Information Exchange Tatchell has written an obituary in The Independent for Paedophile Information Exchange founder Ian Dunn, as well as an essay for a pro-paedophile activist and Paedophile Information Exchange member Warren Middleton in the book \\"Betrayal of Youth (BOY)\\". The actor and activist, John Connors described Tatchell as a \\"paedophile apologist\\" and other critics (such as the British National Party) have suggested that he is personally pro-paedophile, which he strongly denies - stating that: He also comments on an interview he conducted in the late 1990s on the subject of paedophilia and child prostitution, in which he interviewed a 14-year-old boy (under the pseudonym \\"Lee\\") who had had sex with older men, in some cases for money. In this interview, Tatchell makes various counterarguments against Lee's point of view, such as: \\"How can a young child understand sex and give meaningful consent?\\", \\"Perhaps your friends were particularly mature for their age. Most young people are not so sophisticated about sex\\", \\"Many people worry that the power imbalance in a relationship between a youth and an adult means the younger person can be easily manipulated and exploited\\", \\"Many people fear that making sex easier for under-age teenagers will expose them to dangers like HIV. Isn't that a legitimate worry?\\". In 1997 Tatchell wrote a letter to The Guardian, defending an academic book about \\"boy-love\\", calling the work \\"courageous\\", before writing: On Tatchell's personal website he clarifies, > My Guardian letter cited examples of youths in Papuan tribes and some of my > friends who, when they were under 16, had sex with adults (over 18s), but > who do not feel they were harmed. I was not endorsing their viewpoint but > merely stating that they had a different perspective from the mainstream > opinion about inter-generational sex. They have every right for their > perspective to be heard.\\" Following the publication of a photo of Tatchell alongside the Irish Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O'Gorman, on Twitter, at a Pride event and subsequent moral panic, O'Gorman issued a statement outlining that the apparent views in Tatchell's letter were \\"abhorrant\\" to him, and his appreciation that Tatchell clarified his own position. =Civil partnerships= Tatchell has pledged his support for opposite-sex couples to be allowed to have civil partnerships, stating that some opposite-sex couples dislike the \\"sexist, homophobic history of [the institution of] marriage\\", and allowing them into civil partnerships \\"is simply a matter of equality\\". Writing for his organisation the Peter Tatchell Foundation, he wrote: Writing for Pink News, he continues: = Foreign politics =  Imperialism  While still at school, Tatchell campaigned in favour of better treatment of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia.(Tatchell, 1983) p.13 He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing that this would be a fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he says has been discarded and disrespected for too long. His anti-imperialist activism began in 1968 and involved campaigns against the war in Vietnam. He participated in the mass Vietnam Moratorium protests in his Melbourne in 1970. The same year he founded and was elected secretary of the inter-denominational anti-war movement, Christians for Peace. Later, on moving to London in 1971, he was active in solidarity work with the independence movements in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea Bissau, Namibia, Eritrea, Oman, New Hebrides, Western Sahara, Palestine, East Timor and West Papua. In 2002, he brought an unsuccessful legal action in Bow Street Magistrate's Court for the arrest of the former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on charges of war crimes in Vietnam and Cambodia. Zimbabwe Part of Tatchell's political activism and journalism in the 1970s involved the Bush War (or Second Chimurenga) in Rhodesia, in which he supported the black nationalist movement, including the Zimbabwe African National Union and its military wing. Mugabe's denunciation of male homosexuality in 1995 led Tatchell to help organise a protest for LGBT rights in Zimbabwe outside the Zimbabwe High Commission in London. Two years later, he passed through police security disguised as a TV cameraman to quiz Mugabe during the \\"Africa at 40\\" conference at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. Mugabe told him that allegations of human rights abuses were grossly exaggerated; he became agitated when Tatchell told him that he was gay. Mugabe's minders summoned Special Branch guards, who ejected Tatchell. On 26 October 1997 a letter from Tatchell to The Observer argued that the United Kingdom should suspend aid to Zimbabwe because of its violence against LGBT people. Tatchell researched the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked supporters of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks to the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened the car door and grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as \\"gay gangsters\\", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government. On 5 March 2001, Tatchell believed Mugabe was about to visit Brussels. He went there and attempted a second citizen's arrest. Mugabe's bodyguards were seen knocking him to the floor. Later that day, Tatchell was briefly knocked unconscious by Mugabe's bodyguards and was left with permanent damage to his right eye. The protest drew worldwide headlines, as Mugabe was highly unpopular in the Western world for his land redistribution policy. Tatchell's actions were praised by Zimbabwean activists and many of the newspapers that had previously denounced him. Tatchell ultimately failed in his attempt to secure an international arrest warrant against Mugabe on torture charges. The magistrate argued that Mugabe had immunity from prosecution as a serving head of state. In late 2003, Tatchell acted as a press spokesman for the launch of the Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a \\"hoax.\\" However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film \\"Peter Tatchell: Just who does he think he is?\\" by Max Barber. South Africa Following a protest against the ANC, Tatchell described himself as a long-time anti-apartheid activist, in an essay for the book 'sex and politics in South Africa', he claimed that his lobbying of the ANC in 1987 contributed to it renouncing homophobia and making its first public commitment to lesbian and gay human rights and that in 1989 and 1990, he helped persuade the ANC to include a ban on anti-gay discrimination in the post-apartheid constitution (claiming he assisted in drafting model clauses for the ANC)Sex and Politics in South Africa (Double Storey Books, Cape Town, 2005), pp. 140‚Äì49. After Tachell was named as one of the UKs most \\"hate filled bigots\\" in the 'Desi Express' newspaper, Aaron Saeed, Muslim Affairs spokesperson for the gay human rights group OutRage!, claimed that Tatchell was involved in the anti-apartheid movement for over 20 years.Galloway Activist Urges: Assault Tatchell: Respect Member Stirs Homophobia, Violence and Xenophobia Against Gay Activist , UK Gay News, 16 January 2006.  Gaza and the West Bank  In a tweet condemning the Palestinian Authority, Tatchell describes himself as a long-term supporter of Palestine. In May 2004, he and a dozen other lesbians and gay men from OutRage! and the Queer Youth Alliance joined a London demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Their placards read \\"Israel: stop persecuting Palestine! Palestine: stop persecuting queers!\\". Tatchell claims that others present accused him of being a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, a supporter of Ariel Sharon or an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency or MI5. Tatchell has written a number of articles in The Guardian on the issue. 2008 Olympics In April 2008, Tatchell attempted to disrupt the procession of the Olympic torch though London. As a protest against China's human rights record he stood in front of the bus carrying the torch along Oxford Street while carrying a placard calling on Beijing to \\"Free Tibet, Free Hu Jia\\" (the name of a recently jailed human rights activist). Tatchell was taken away by police but was not charged.Scott Anthony \\"Police forced to call in reinforcements as protesters disrupt Olympic torch relay\\", The Guardian, 6 April 2008. Retrieved on 4 September 2008. In an interview Tatchell called on the world to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics, or to take other visible action. Iran Tatchell is a critic of capital punishment in Iran. Within Iran, the criminal code has parts based on sharia, and punishments are prescribed for zina offenses, including consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners. Iranian members of parliament publicly support the death penalty for homosexuality.Gays should be hanged, says Iranian minister; The Times, 13 November 2007; Retrieved on 1 April 2008 Iran is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child which forbids the execution of juveniles, however, Iran kills juvenile offenders. In 2005, Iran executed two teenage boys, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, aged 16 and 18. The Iranian government, and Iranian state media, reported that the pair were executed for raping a 13-year-old boy at knifepoint. Tatchell argued that Iran has a history of arresting political activists on false charges and extracting false confessions from death penalty convicts, and declared that he believed the original crime was consensual sex between the two, which is illegal in Iran. Tatchell reiterated his long-standing view that Iran is an \\"Islamo-fascist state\\". He argued that information from Iranian exile groups with contacts inside Iran was that the teenagers were a secret gay party before they were arrested. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch preferred campaigners to focus on the Convention on the Rights of the Child violations rather than the weak allegation of a connection to gay sex. Faisal Alam, founder of American Gay Muslim group Al-Fatiha, argued in the magazine Queer that Iran was condemned before the facts were certain, and in 2003 the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that \\"from different and reliable sources that there currently is no active policy of prosecution of charges of homosexuality in Iran\\". Russia Tatchell has written articles condemning the Russian LGBT propaganda law. In 2014 Tatchell protested Valery Gergiev's support for Vladimir Putin. Tatchell protested the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi over the gay rights stance of Russia, comparing the event to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Tatchell was arrested at the Moscow Pride parade in 2011 amid a spate of anti-gay violence by Neo-Nazis. Tatchell argues that the Russian police collude with Neo-Nazi elements, and that some in the Neo-Nazi group were undercover police officers. In February 2007, the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, visited London mayor Ken Livingstone for an annual meeting that also involved the Mayors of Berlin and Paris, with the mayor of Beijing present as well. Nikolay Alexeyev, one of the organizers of the Moscow gay pride parade, joined Tatchell in protesting the visit. A notice of the protest quoted Talgat Tadzhuddin saying that the Moscow pride marchers should be flogged. Livingstone asserted that he supports gay rights, and said \\"In Moscow the Russian Orthodox church, the chief rabbi and the grand Mufti all supported the ban on the Gay Pride march with the main role, due to its great weight in society, being played by the Orthodox church. The attempt of Mr Tatchell to focus attention on the role of the grand Mufti in Moscow, in the face of numerous attacks on gay rights in Eastern Europe, which overwhelmingly come from right-wing Christian and secular currents, is a clear example of an Islamophobic campaign.\\" Tatchell retorted that Livingstone's remarks were \\"dishonest, despicable nonsense\\", adding \\"The Grand Mufti was not singled out\\". He further said the Mayor had brought his \\"office into disrepute\\" and \\"has revealed himself to be a person without principles, honesty or integrity.\\"Gay Pride Parade Wars: Livingstone Attacks Tatchell and Alexeyev Attacks Livingstone ‚Äì UK Gay News, 1 March 2007. Israel Following the vote by the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, in 2007 in favour of bills to ban lesbian and gay pride parades in Jerusalem, the Lesbian and Gay Coalition Against Racism criticised Tatchell, saying: Tatchell issued a statement opposing any boycott of Israel as a result of this.Peter Tatchell, \\"Don't Boycott World Pride in Jerusalem ‚Äì Tatchell\\" , UK Gay News, 19 June 2006. =Anglican and Catholic churches= Peter Tachell behind Richard Dawkins, protesting Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom Tatchell criticised the Catholic Church and Pope Benedict XVI, whom he described as \\"the ideological inheritor of Nazi homophobia\\".\\"Interview: Peter Tatchell's 40 years of campaigning\\", Pink News, 15 December 2007, Antonio Fabrizio \\"He'd like to eradicate homosexuality, but since he can't put LGBT people in physical concentration camps, is doing his best to put them in psychological concentration camps.\\" Channel 4 indicated in June 2010 that Tatchell would be the presenter of a documentary film examining \\"the current Pope's teachings throughout the world\\". The announcement sparked criticism from some prominent British Catholics including Conservative politician Ann Widdecombe, who accused Channel 4 of trying to \\"stir up controversy\\". Tatchell stated as part of the announcement that the documentary \\"will not be an anti-Catholic programme\\". With respect to Anglicanism, he stated that \\"it's very sad to see a good man like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, going to such extraordinary lengths to appease homophobes within the Anglican Communion\\".Irish Times, 25 July 2008, pg. 17 On 15 September 2010, Tatchell, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter, published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. In 2017 Tatchell praised the Church of England's new 'Valuing all God's Children' scheme for schools, which seeks to stop homophobic and transphobic bullying. =Multiculturalism= Tatchell has occasionally been moderately critical of multiculturalism. In 2010 he gave a speech to the Libertarian Alliance at the National Liberal Club arguing that British people are increasingly \\"fragmented according to their different and sometimes competing identities, values, and traditions. These differences are prioritised over shared experiences and interests. Our common needs and the universalities of human rights are downplayed in favour of religious and racial particularities.\\" Free speech In 2006, during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Tatchell spoke at a 25 March 2006 rally called the Freedom of Expression Rally. At the rally, Tatchell argued for the \\"disestablishment of the Church of England and the freedom to insult the Queen, Prime Minister and Archbishop of Canterbury.\\" Tatchell said that the far-left is \\"Mired in the immoral morass of cultural relativism, they no longer endorse Enlightenment values and universal human rights. Their support for free speech is now qualified by so many ifs and buts. When push comes to shove, it is more or less worthless.\\"Gays in Eurabia ‚Äì Muslim immigrants to Europe are threatening the rights of gays, women and free speech, metroweekly.com, 20 April 2006. In 2007, he wrote a Guardian opinion piece, arguing that \\"The best way to tackle prejudice is by presenting facts and using reasoned arguments, to break down ignorance and ill-will.\\" In 2016, Tatchell made threats to free speech in Britain the topic of his British Humanist Association annual conference lecture. Speaking with reference to a number of censorship controversies in the 2010s, he said that \\"the recent trend against freedom of speech means that we must fight the battles of the Enlightenment all over again.\\" Tatchell himself was accused of censorship when he threatened to sue an independent feminist book publisher for publishing a book that suggested that he was Islamophobic. The book publisher yielded, published a lengthy apology, and stopped publishing the book, but was eventually forced to shut down. In 2018 Tatchell voiced his support for Mark Meechan's conviction under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 for posting a \\"grossly offensive\\" video on YouTube. =Islam= Tatchell is critical of Islam, and first wrote about its rise in Britain in 1995. In 1995, he wrote that \\"although not all Muslims are anti-gay, significant numbers are violently homophobic [...] homophobic Muslim voters may be able to influence the outcome of elections in 20 or more marginal constituencies.\\" At the 2019 Conservative Party Conference he said he was \\"jealous\\" of Trevor Phillips when Mr. Phillips was nominated to be Islamophobe of the year - though he later suggested this was an ironic joke. He is critical of the UK government's All- Party Parliamentary Group definition of Islamophobia, suggesting that he tries \\"to avoid the term\\", that Muslimness is a vague and subjective term, and that the Islamophobia term is a \\"a de facto threat to free speech and liberal values\\" and \\"virtue-signalling\\". Tatchell has described the entire Sharia, which is the moral code that Muslims try to live by, as \\"a clerical form of fascism\\" and was the keynote speaker at a 2005 protest at the Canadian High Commission, demanding that Ontario's arbitration law, which permitted religious arbitration in civil cases for Jews and Christians, not be extended to Muslims. In 2017, Tatchell wrote to the organisers of Pride in London to defend the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. The organisation, set up by Maryam Namazie, had previously held placards stating \\"Allah is Gay\\", \\"Fuck Islam\\", \\"Islamophobia is an Oxymoron\\" and \\"East London Mosque incites murder of LGBT\\". The East London Mosque, who had previously condemned homophobia and worked with Tatchell himself on seeking ways to combat it, disliked the placards but understood that they fell under the banner of free speech. However, he strenuously objected the suggestion that they incited murder as defamatory and brazenly incorrect. Tatchell stated \\"East London Mosque has refused all dialogue with LGBT community. It refuses to meet LGBT Muslims. I have asked them 11 times since 2015\\". Tatchell has previously condemned Islamophobia, saying \\"any form of prejudice, hatred, discrimination or violence against Muslims is wrong. Full stop\\". He described the Qur'an as \\"rather mild in its condemnation of homosexuality\\". He points out that much of his prison and asylum casework involves supporting Muslim prisoners and asylum seekers‚Äîheterosexual, as well as LGBT. In 2006, he helped stop the abuse of Muslim prisoners at a Norwich jail and helped secure parole for other Muslim detainees.Sue Simkim, Anna Thomas-Betts, \\"Prisoners or Detainees?\\" Independent Monitor, The Association of Members of Independent Monitoring Boards, March 2008, Issue 93, pp. 12‚Äì15. Half his asylum cases are, he reports, male and female Muslim refugees. Two of his highest-profile campaigns involved Muslim victims‚ÄîMohamed S, who was framed by men who first tried to kill him and then jailed him for eight years, and Sid Saeed, who brought a racism and homophobic harassment case against Deutsche Bank.Jamie Doward, \\"Fallen City star claims gay bigotry: Deutsche Bank faces allegations of sexual discrimination against vice-president\\", The Observer, 20 February 2005. Tatchell chose Malcolm X as his specialist subject when appearing on Celebrity Mastermind, explaining that he considered him an inspiration and hero (his other inspirations are Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst and Martin Luther King Jr.). However, his endorsement of Bruce Perry's biography, in an article calling for black gay role models, led to criticism.Peter Akinti, the editor of Black in Britain, described the claim of homosexuality as \\"shocking\\" and \\"inappropriate\\", due to Perry's claim that Malcolm X had male lovers in his youth.According to Perry's book, Little (Malcolm X) occasionally engaged in sex with other men, usually, though not always, for money. In a Michigan boarding house, he raised rent money by sleeping with a gay transvestite ... Later, in New York, Little and some friends raised funds by being fellated by men at the YMCA where he lived (pg. 77) In Boston a man paid Little to undress him, sprinkle him with talcum powder, and bring him to orgasm.(Perry, pp. 82‚Äì83). In February 2010, Women Against Fundamentalism defended Tatchell against allegations of Islamophobia and endorsed his right to challenge all religious fundamentalism: \\"WAF supports the right of Peter Tatchell and numerous other gay activists to oppose the legitimisation of fundamentalists and other right wing forces on university campuses, by the Left and by the government in its Preventing Violent Extremism strategy and numerous other programmes and platforms\\". Muslim Council of Britain Tatchell describes the Muslim Council of Britain as \\"anti-gay\\", asking how can \\"they expect to win respect for their community, if at the same time as demanding action against Islamophobia, they themselves demand the legal enforcement of homophobia?\\". He noted that the MCB had joined forces with the \\"rightwing Christian Institute\\" to oppose every gay law reform from 1997 to 2006. In January 2006, the MCB Chairman Iqbal Sacranie said that homosexuals are immoral, harmful and diseased on BBC Radio 4. Tatchell argued that \\"Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia\\". Tatchell subsequently criticised Unite Against Fascism for inviting Sacranie to share its platforms, describing him as a \\"homophobic hate-mongerer.\\" When the MCB boycotted Holocaust Memorial Day, partly because it was \\"not sufficiently inclusive\\", Tatchell wrote that \\"the only thing that is consistent about the MCB is its opposition to the human rights of lesbians and gay men\\". Muslims and gay rights In 2006, Tatchell wrote an opinion column in The Guardian arguing that Muslims deliberately conflate offence with violence, in an effort to suppress Muslim reformers in Britain. He argued that Islamist groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir in Britain see \\"any criticism of Islam is an insult and that all such insults are unacceptable\\" in order to suppress the \\"free exchange of ideas\\". The Muslim gay rights organisation IMAAN criticised Tatchell, saying, \\"OutRage! doesn't understand our cultural and religious sensitivities. Often, the way they word and phrase their press releases can and does antagonise Muslims. Much as we‚Äôve invited them to meetings so we can talk about the best way to tackle Muslim LGBT issues, they insist on doing things their way.\\" In the book \\"Out of Place: Interrogating Silences in Queerness/Raciality\\", in a chapter called \\"Gay Imperialism: Gender and Sexuality Discourse in the 'War on Terror'\\", Jin Haritaworn, Tamsila Tauqir and Esra Erdem wrote, \\"rather than help, politics such as Tatchell's have worsened the situation for the majority of queer Muslims. It has become increasingly difficult for groups such as the Safra Project, who are forced into the frontline of the artificially constructed gay v. Muslim divide, to contest sexual oppression in Muslim communities. The more homophobia is constructed as belonging to Islam, the more anti-homophobic talk will be viewed as a white, even racist, phenomenon, and the harder it will be to increase tolerance and understanding among straight Muslims [...] The dialogue which Safra and other queer Muslim groups have long sought over this is more often than not ignored or disregarded, and white gay activists such as Tatchell have proved indifferent to the fact that the mud which they sling onto Muslim communities lands on queer Muslims themselves.\\" Despite previously attending a \\"rally for free expression\\", where the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons were celebrated, Tatchell sued the small publisher Raw Nerve Books, who issued an apology, and replaced links to the book on their site with that apology, but were later forced to shut down. The Monthly Review described this as censorship, adding, \\"the violent suppression of \\"Gay Imperialism\\" and the book in which it appeared also works as a warning to the authors, editors, and other critics and potential critics of Tatchell to better keep their mouths shut.\\" Yusuf al-Qaradawi In July 2004, then- Mayor of London Ken Livingstone invited Yusuf al-Qaradawi to attend a talk called \\"A woman's right to choose\\" about the wearing of the hijab. Livingstone had read positive coverage of Qaradawi in The Guardian and The Sun. In October 2004, 2,500 Muslim academics from 23 countries condemned Qaradawi, and accused him of giving \\"Islam a bad name and foster[ing] hatred among civilizations\\" and \\"providing a religious cover for terrorism\\". Tatchell argued that Qaradawi expresses liberal positions to deceive the Western press and politicians, while being \\"rightwing, misogynist, anti-semitic and homophobic\\", using his books and fatwas to advocate female genital mutilation, blame for rape victims who dress immodestly, and the execution of apostates, homosexuals, and women who have sex outside marriage. Livingstone issued a 2005 dossier praising Qaradawi as a moderate, based on positive press coverage he had received previously. Livingstone pronounced that Tatchell has \\"a long history of Islamophobia\\", and asserted that he is in a \\"de facto alliance with the American neo-cons and Israeli intelligence services.\\" Tatchell strenuously denied the accusations, pointing out that he has never said any of the things that Livingstone accused him of saying. Livingstone continued to describe Qaradawi as \\"one of the leading progressive voices in the Muslim world\\" in 2010, after having been denied entry to the UK for his extremist views. Two years after condemning Tatchell, Livingstone stated he \\"probably shouldn't\\" have called Tatchell an \\"Islamophobe\\". Adam Yosef In December 2005, Respect Party activist Adam Yosef came under criticism for an article in Desi Xpress opposing registered civil partnerships. He asserted that Tatchell needed \\"a good slap in the face\\" and his \\"queer campaign army\\" should \\"pack their bent bags and head back to Australia\\". Desi Xpress staff expressed regret to Tatchell and gave him a right of reply, while Yosef apologised and retracted his article, claiming the \\"slap in the face\\" remark was a \\"figure of speech\\" and the remark about Australia was not racist. Yosef later backed Tatchell's 2009 election campaign. =Secondary issues= Environmental issues For over 20 years, Tatchell has written and campaigned about environmental problems including global warming and resource depletion, pointing out that they often have a disproportionately negative impact on developing countries. In the late 1980s, he was co-organiser of the Green and Socialist Conferences, which sought to ally reds and greens. He championed energy conservation and renewable energy; in particular tidal, wave and concentrated solar power. On 24 May 2009, he appeared on the BBC Daily Politics programme to oppose the Elephant and Castle regeneration scheme, which he said would bring few benefits to local working-class people. However, most of his campaigning continues to be in the areas of human rights and \\"queer emancipation\\". In August 2008 Tatchell wrote about speculative theories concerning possible atmospheric oxygen depletion compared to prehistoric levels, and called for further investigation to test such claims and, if proven, their long-term consequences.Peter Tatchell The Oxygen Crisis, The Guardian, Comment Is Free 13 August 2008.  Animal rights  Tatchell is an active supporter of animal rights, saying \\"human rights and animal rights are two aspects of the same struggle against injustice\\", and that he advocates for a \\"claim to be spared suffering and offered inalienable rights\\" for both humans and animals. Cornwall Tatchell campaigned on the issue of the constitutional status of Cornwall. In November 2008, The Guardian carried an article by him entitled Self-rule for Cornwall, in which he said: This article received the largest number of comments to any Guardian article, according to This is Cornwall. Over 1,500 comments were made, and while some comments were supportive, Tatchell found himself \\"shocked and disgusted\\" by the anti-Cornish sentiment shown by many commenters. Columnist and other pursuits Tatchell has written numerous articles in newspapers and magazines related to his various campaigns. He was highly critical of the media coverage of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing, claiming than the homophobic attitudes of news outlets had helped fuel the attack, and that the press concerned themselves almost exclusively with the one heterosexual victim, rather than the two other deaths and the dozens of maimed patrons, saying that: On 5 August 1995 Tatchell was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil on his one-on-one interview show Is This Your Life?, made by Open Media for Channel 4.Listing on IMDb , he has been an Ambassador for the penal reform group, Make Justice Work. In 2011, he became the Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation, a human rights organisation that seeks to promote and protect the human rights of individuals, communities and nations, in the UK and internationally, in accordance with established national and international human rights law. Tatchell is a patron of Humanists UK, an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society National Secular Society. Retrieved 27 July 2019 and a committed secularist, saying, \\"As an atheist, secularist and humanist I believe that reason, science and ethics ‚Äì not religious superstition ‚Äì are the best way to understand the world and promote human rights and welfare.\\" He contributes to The Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2.  Awards  In 2006, New Statesman readers voted him sixth on their list of \\"Heroes of our time\\".New Statesman Library ‚Äì Articles by Peter Tatchell In 2009, he racked up multiple awards. He was named Campaigner of the Year in The Observer Ethical Awards, London Citizen of Sanctuary Award, Shaheed Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti Award (for reporting the Balochistan national liberation struggle), Evening Standard 1000 Most Influential Londoners (winning again in 2011), Liberal Voice of the Year and a Blue Plaque in recognition of his more than 40 years of human rights campaigning. In 2010 he won Total Politics Top 50 Political Influencers. A diary journalist reported rumours that he had been recommended for the award of a life peerage in the British New Year Honours. He was said to have turned it down. In 2012, the National Secular Society awarded Tatchell Secularist of the Year, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the defence of human rights against religious fundamentalism. On 21 September 2012, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award at the UK's first National Diversity Awards. Alongside Misha B, Jody Cundy, Peter Norfolk and others he was a patron for 2013 National Diversity Awards. In January 2014, Tatchell was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by De Montfort University.

They are considered the largest family of birds, with more than 400 species. They are the most diverse avian family in every country in the Americas, except for the United States and Canada. As could be expected from a family this large, the members vary greatly in shape, patterns, size and colors. Some tyrant flycatchers superficially resemble the Old World flycatchers, which they are named after but are not closely related to. They are members of suborder Tyranni (suboscines), which do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of most other songbirds.del Hoyo, J. Elliott, A. & Christie, D. (editors). (2004) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 9: Cotingas to Pipits and Wagtails. Lynx Edicions. Most, but not all, species are rather plain, with various hues of brown, gray and white commonplace. Obvious exceptions include the bright red vermilion flycatcher, blue, black, white and yellow many-colored rush- tyrant and some species of tody-flycatchers or tyrants, which are often yellow, black, white and/or rufous, from the Todirostrum, Hemitriccus and Poecilotriccus genera. Several species have bright yellow underparts, from the ornate flycatcher to the great kiskadee. Some species have erectile crests. Several of the large genera (i.e. Elaenia, Myiarchus or Empidonax) are quite difficult to tell apart in the field due to similar plumage and some are best distinguished by their voices. Behaviorally they can vary from species such as spadebills which are tiny, shy and live in dense forest interiors to kingbirds, which are relatively large, bold, inquisitive and often inhabit open areas near human habitations. As the name implies, a great majority of tyrant flycatchers are entirely insectivorous (though not necessarily specialized in flies). Tyrant flycatchers are largely opportunistic feeders and often catch any flying or arboreal insect they encounter. However, food can vary greatly and some (like the large great kiskadee) will eat fruit or small vertebrates (e.g. small frogs). In North America, most species are associated with a \\"sallying\\" feeding style, where they fly up to catch an insect directly from their perch and then immediately return to the same perch. Most tropical species however do not feed in this fashion and several types prefer to glean insects from leaves and bark. Tropical species are sometimes found in mixed-species foraging flocks, where various types of passerines and other smallish birds are found feeding in proximity. The smallest family members are the closely related short-tailed pygmy tyrant and black-capped pygmy tyrant from the genus Myiornis (the first species usually being considered marginally smaller on average). These species reach a total length of and a weight of 4‚Äì5 grams. By length, they are the smallest passerines on earth, although some species of Old World warblers apparently rival them in their minuscule mean body masses if not in total length.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . The minuscule size and very short tail of the Myiornis pygmy tyrants often lend them a resemblance to a tiny ball or insect. The largest tyrant flycatcher is the great shrike-tyrant at and . A few species such as the streamer-tailed tyrant, scissor-tailed flycatcher and fork-tailed flycatcher have a larger total length (up to ), but this is mainly due to their extremely long tails; the fork-tailed flycatcher has relatively the longest tail feathers of any known bird. A number of species previously included in this family are now placed in the family Tityridae (see Systematics). Sibley and Alquist in their 1990 bird taxonomy had the genera Mionectes, Leptopogon, Pseudotriccus, Poecilotriccus, Taenotriccus, Hemitriccus, Todirostrum and Corythopis as a separate family Pipromorphidae, but although it is still thought that these genera are basal to most of the family, they are not each other's closest relatives. Habitat and distribution Species richness of Tyrannidae, when compared to habitat, is highly variable, although most every land habitat in the Americas has at least some of these birds. The habitats of tropical lowland evergreen forest and montane evergreen forest have the highest single site species diversity while many habitats including rivers, palm forest, white sand forest, tropical deciduous forest edge, southern temperate forest, southern temperate forest edge, semi-humid/humid montane scrub, and northern temperate grassland have the lowest single species diversity. The variation between the highest and the lowest is extreme; ninety species can be found in the tropical lowland evergreen forests while the number of species that can be found in the habitats listed above typically are in the single digits. This may be due in part to the fewer niches found in certain areas and therefore fewer places for the species to occupy. Tyrannidae specialization among habitat is very strong in tropical lowland evergreen forests and montane evergreen forests. These habitat types, therefore, display the greatest specialization. The counts differ by three species (tropical lowland evergreen forests have 49 endemic species and montane evergreen forests have 46 endemic species). It can be assumed that they both have similar levels of specialization. Regionally, the Atlantic Forest has the highest species richness with the Choc√≥ following closely behind. Status and conservation The northern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma imberbe) is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.\\"List of Migratory Bird Species Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act as of December 2, 2013\\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service This species is common south of the US border. The situation for a number of other species from South and Central America is far more problematic. In 2007, BirdLife International (and consequently IUCN) considered two species, the Minas Gerais tyrannulet and Kaempfer's tody-tyrant critically endangered. Both are endemic to Brazil. Additionally, seven species were considered endangered and eighteen species vulnerable.BirdLife International (2007). Species factsheets. Accessed 12 December 2007 available online Systematics The family comprises 437 species divided into 104 genera. A full list, sortable by common and binomial names, is at list of tyrant flycatcher species. Species in the genera Tityra, Pachyramphus, Laniocera and Xenopsaris were formerly placed in this family, but evidence suggested they belong in their own family, the Tityridae,Adopt the Family Tityridae ‚Äì South American Classification Committee (2007) where they are now placed by SACC.

Mainly used to correct typewriting in the past, correction products now mostly cover handwriting mistakes. Product history Liquid Paper In 1956, Bette Nesmith Graham invented the first correction fluid in her kitchen. Working as a typist, she used to make many mistakes and always strove for a way to correct them. Starting on a basis of tempera paint she mixed with a common kitchen blender, she called the fluid \\"Mistake Out\\" and started to provide her co-workers with small bottles on which the brand's name was displayed. By 1958, Graham founded the Mistake Out Company and continued working from her kitchen (and eventually garage) nights and weekends to produce small batches of correction bottles. She was fired from her typist job as executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust after she accidentally put her own company‚Äôs name on her employer‚Äôs letter. She subsequently decided to devote all her time to Mistake Out. Graham offered her correction fluid to IBM, which declined the offer (the company announced its own Correcting Selectric with an integrated lift-off tape in 1973). By 1968, the product ‚Äì now renamed Liquid Paper ‚Äì was profitable, and in 1979 the company was sold to the Gillette Corporation for $47.5 million with royalties. Acquisition In 2000, the Liquid Paper product and brand name was acquired by Newell Rubbermaid (now Newell Brands). In some regions of the world, Liquid Paper is now endorsed by Papermate, a widely known writing instruments brand (also owned by Newell). Ingredients A traditionally shaped bottle of Liquid Paper Current MSDSs list Liquid Paper as containing titanium dioxide, solvent naphtha, mineral spirits, resins, dispersant, and fragrances. Liquid Paper came under scrutiny in the 1980s, due to concerns over recreational sniffing of the product. The organic solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as a thinner in the product. Liquid Paper containing this thinner was thought to be toxic and a carcinogen, but later studies have shown that although the thinner used was toxic there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. There were a number of studies linking fatalities to the trichloroethane contained in correction fluids, including Liquid Paper. In 1989, Gillette reformulated Liquid Paper such that it did not use trichloroethane. This was done in response to a complaint under California Proposition 65.

The core belief holds that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (thetan) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable past lives, some of which, preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth, were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events. Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if cleared of unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts. Scientology is described as \\"a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential.\\" Believers reach their full potential \\"when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. \\" There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries. The Church of Scientology believes that \\"Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe,\\" as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology. Roy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as \\"a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training\\" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential. Scientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions. Scientologists may profess belief in other religions, such as Protestantism and Catholicism, and may participate in their activities and sacred rites. Jacob Neusner emphasizes this in the section on Scientology in his book World Religions in America. According to J. Gordon Melton, \\"Scientologists aim to utterly make the world instead of taking refuge from it,\\" as they participate in culture instead of being isolated. Scientology is inherently nondenominational and open to individuals, regardless of religious background; according to Mary A. Mann, it contains the elements necessary for a global religion and caters to people of all different ethnicities and educational upbringing. Core beliefs and practices =\\"Reactive mind\\" and traumatic memories= A Scientologist introduces the E-meter to a potential student Among the basic tenets of Scientology are the beliefs that human beings are immortal, that a person's life experience transcends a single lifetime, and that human beings possess infinite capabilities. Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind. The reactive mind is thought to absorb all pain and emotional trauma, while the analytical mind is a rational mechanism which is responsible for consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as engrams. Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. Avoiding this fate is Scientology's basic goal. Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the Clear state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams, and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan. Hubbard's differentiation of the reactive mind and the analytical mind forms one of the basic tenets of Dianetics. The analytical mind is similar to the conscious mind, which processes daily information and events. The reactive mind produces the mind's \\"aberrations\\" such as \\"fear, inhibition, intense love and hate and various psychosomatic ills\\" which are recorded as \\"engrams.\\"Oppenheimer, Mark. \\"In The Clear.\\" Nation 293.19 (2011): 31-35. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Nov. 2015. Scientology believes that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.J. Gordon Melton The Encyclopedia of American Religion, p. 224, McGrath Publishing Co., 1978 It is believed that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as auditing.Paul Finkelman Religion and American Law, p. 509, Taylor & Francis, 2000 Through auditing, it is said that people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams. This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be at cause in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams. Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of Preclear to Clear and Operating Thetan. Scientology's utopian aim is to \\"clear the planet\\", a world in which everyone has cleared themselves of their engrams. Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or auditor. It bears a superficial similarity to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do. Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand engrams, and their limiting effects, for him- or herself. Most auditing requires an E-meter, a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal \\"cans\\"), and a small current is passed through them. Scientology believes that watching for changes in the E-meter's display helps locate engrams. Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it, in order to help him or her eliminate the engram, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram's \\"charge\\" has been dissipated and the engram has in fact been cleared. As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity. At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors. =Auditing= One central practice of Scientology is an activity known as \\"auditing\\" (listening) which seeks to elevate an adherent to a state of \\"clear\\", one of freedom from the influences of the reactive mind. The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \\"auditor\\" addresses a series of questions to a preclear, observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session. The term \\"Clear\\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \\"optimal individuals\\" and \\"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \\"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\\" \\"Auditing\\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \\"preclear folders\\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes. The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress. Auditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's galvanic skin response in a manner similar to a polygraph (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors. The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \\"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\\" Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in. Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family. Church members pair up often to get their training, doing the same course at the same time, so that they can audit each other up through the various Scientology levels. According to scholar Harriet Whitehead, the Church of Scientology \\"has developed a fine-tooled hierarchically organized system of audit (training) sessions where the technology of these sessions, in fact, is the treatment leading to processes of renunciation and eventually reformulation in the individual,\\" which is similar to psychoanalysis. =Emotional tone scale and survival= Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the tone scale. The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition. Scientology emphasizes the importance of survival, which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as \\"dynamics\\". An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family. The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and the Infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being. The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics. =ARC and KRC triangles= The ARC and KRC triangles are concept maps which show a relationship among three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology logo. The KRC triangle is the uppermost triangle. It combines the components of \\"Knowledge\\" \\"Responsibility\\" and \\"Control\\". A Scientologist must gain Knowledge of, take Responsibility for, and effectively exert Control over elements of his or her environment. The ARC triangle is the lower triangle. It is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for. It combines three components: \\"Affinity\\" is the degree of affection, love or liking, i.e. an emotional state. \\"Reality\\" reflects consensual reality, that is agreements on what is real. \\"Communication\\", believed to be the most important element of the triangle, is the exchange of ideas. Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the ARC triangle \\"increases the level\\" of the other two but the most important aspect of this triangle is \\"communication\\" mainly because communication drives the other two aspects: \\"affinity\\" and \\"reality\\". Scientologists believe that ineffective communication is a chief cause of human survival problems, and this is reflected by efforts at all levels within the movement to ensure clear communication, the presence of unabridged standard dictionaries for example being an established feature of Scientology centers. Scientologists believe that the three elements are fundamental between individuals ‚Äúin that to communicate with a person one must have some affinity for him or her,‚Äù as Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes it. According to Scientology doctrine, the break in the flow of ARC that hinders survival must be handled in auditing. The two triangles are connected by a letter \\"S\\", standing for SCIO (Latin > \\"I Know\\"). Church of Scientology doctrine defines scio as 'knowing in the fullest sense of the word'. It links the two triangles together. =The Dynamics= Hubbard introduced the Scientology cross in the 1950s as the central symbol for the church. He described the eight points of the cross as symbolizing the \\"eight dynamics\\" or eight measures for survival that all human beings have, which includes the urge to service as a spiritual being and the urge to survive as a godlike entity. Hubbard writes that survival is moving away from death and towards immortality, and that human beings are constantly on the search for feelings of pleasure and motivated by the avoidance of pain. # The first dynamic is the urge toward survival of self. # The second dynamic is the urge toward survival through sex, or children. This dynamic actually has two divisions. The second dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself and second dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children. # The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through a group of individuals or as a group. Any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the third dynamic. The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups. # The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind. # The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these. # The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components Matter, Energy, Space and Time, from which we derive the word MEST. # The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the seventh dynamic. A sub-heading of this dynamic is ideas and concepts such as beauty and the desire to survive through these. # The eighth dynamic is the urge toward survival through the Supreme Being, or more exactly, infinity. =Thetans= According to L. Ron Hubbard's book The History of Man, published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a \\"Thetan\\" or consciousness \\"that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.\\" According to Hubbard, \\"In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.\\" Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an \\"Operating Thetan.\\" \\"Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.\\" People are viewed as spiritual beings that have minds and bodies and a person's \\"spiritual essence\\" is called the Thetan.Pretorius, SP 2006. 'The concept \\"salvation\\" in the Church of Scientology', HTS Teologiese Studies/ Theological Studies, vol. 62, no. 1, pp. 313‚Äì327 Scientology teaches that \\"a thetan is the person himself, not his body or his name or the physical universe, his mind or anything else.\\" According to the doctrine, \\"one does not have a thetan, he is a thetan.\\" Exteriorization Exteriorization is a practice in which a thetan functions independently of the physical body, sometimes as a result of auditing process R2-45. According to Lawrence Wright, author of ‚ÄúGoing Clear,‚Äù exteriorization ‚Äúis the sense that one has actually left his physical being behind,‚Äù and a commonly reported occurrence among Scientologists. =Afterlife= In Scientology, the human body is regarded as similar to that of other religions in that, at death, the spirit will leave the body. \\"Life and personality go on. The physical part of the organism ceases to function.\\" Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary Scientology believes in the \\"immortality of each individual's spirit,\\" therefore making death not a significant worry. The spirit acquires another body necessary for growth and survival. To achieve an individual's true identity is the primary goal. According to Scientology doctrine, salvation is achieved through ‚Äúclearing‚Äù engrams and implant, the source of human misery, through the auditing process. Salvation is limited to the current life and there is no ‚Äúfinal salvation or damnation,‚Äù author Richard Holloway writes. ‚ÄúLife is a not a one-shot deal. There is only the eternal return of life after life.‚Äù According to Scientology beliefs, \\"the individual comes back. He has a responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow.\\" According to Scientology beliefs, Scientology itself is a blend of science and spirituality, with belief in an immortal spirit and in improving that spirit here on Earth using Scientology's methods. Scientologists do not typically dwell on Heaven or Hell or the afterlife, instead focusing on the spirit. Many Scientologists also belong to other churches. In the Scientology book, A History of Man, Hubbard discusses that a human's past experiences make up that person's present identity. These include experiences as atoms, seaweed, plankton and clams, pointing to the belief in recurring lives. =God= The Church of Scientology states that it has no set dogma on God and allows individuals to come to their own understanding of God. In Scientology, \\"vastly more emphasis is given to the godlike nature of the person and to the workings of the human mind than to the nature of God.\\" Hubbard did not clearly define God in Scientology. When pressed about their belief, Scientologists mention the \\"eight dynamic\\" which they say is the \\"God dynamic\\". Scientologists believe in an \\"Infinity\\" (\\"the All-ness of All\\"). They recite a formal prayer for total freedom at meetings, which include the verses \\"May the author of the universe enable all men to reach an understanding of their spiritual nature. May awareness and understanding of life expand, so that all may come to know the author of the universe. And may others also reach this understanding which brings Total Freedom ... Freedom from war, and poverty, and want; freedom to be; freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom to use and understand Man's potential ‚Äì a potential that is God-given and Godlike.\\" The prayer commences with \\"May God let it be so.\\"http://www.faithology.com/practices/weekly- worship-in-scientology Veenker, Jody, and Steve Rabey. \\"Building Scientopolis : How Scientology Remade Clearwater, Florida‚ÄîAnd What Local Christians Learned In The Process.\\" Christianity Today 44.10 (2000): 90‚Äì99. ATLASerials, Religion Collection. Web. November 15, 2013. Scientologists affirm the existence of a deity without defining or describing its nature. L. Ron Hubbard explains in his book Science of Survival, \\"No culture in the history of the world, save the thoroughly depraved and expiring ones, has failed to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an empirical observation that men without a strong and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less capable, less ethical and less valuable.\\" Instead of defining God, members assert that reaching higher states of enlightenment will enable individuals to make their own conclusions about the Supreme Being. =Science= The church considers itself scientific, although this belief has no basis in institutional science.Rothstein, Mikael. \\"Science and Religion in the New Religions.\\" Oxford Handbooks Online. 2009-09-02. Oxford University Press. Date of access .Jan 29, 2014, http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195369649.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195369649-e-5 According to religious scholar Mikael Rothstein Scientologists believe that \\"all religious claims can be verified through experimentation\\". Scientologists believe that their religion was derived through scientific methods, that Hubbard found knowledge through studying and thinking, not through revelation. The \\"science\\" of Dianetics, however, was never accepted by the scientific community. Rothstein also writes that there is a possibility that Scientology partly owes its existence to the conflict with the conventional scientific community, which hindered Hubbard's original intention. Religious scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that Scientology differs from the scientific method in that Scientology has become increasingly self-referential, while true science normally compares competing theories and observed facts. Hubbard originally claimed and insisted that Dianetics was based on the scientific method. He taught that \\"the scientific sensibilities [carry] over into the spiritual realities one encounters via auditing on the e-meter.\\" Scientologists commonly prefer to describe Hubbard's teachings with words such as knowledge, technology and workability rather than belief or faith. Hubbard described Dianetics and Scientology as \\"technologies\\" based on his claim of their \\"scientific precision and workability.\\" Hubbard attempted to \\"break down the barrier between scientific (objective, external) and religious (subjective, internal) forms of knowledge.\\" Hubbard describes Scientology's epistemology as \\"radically subjective: Nothing in Scientology is true for you unless you have observed it and it is true according to your observation.\\" This is a type of self-legitimation through science which is also found in other religions such as Christian Science, Religious Science, and Moorish Science Temple of America. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge cites Scientology's origins in the subcultures of science fiction and \\"harmony\\" with scientific cosmology. Science fiction, viewed to work for and against the purposes of science, has contributed to the birth of new religions, including Scientology. While it promotes science, it distorts it as well. Science fiction writer A.E. van Vogt based the early development of Dianetics and Scientology on a novel based on General Semantics, a self-improvement and therapy program created by Alfred Korzybski for the purpose of curing personal and social issues.Bainbridge, William Sims. \\"Science and Religion: The Case of Scientology.\\" In David G. Bromley and Phillip E. Hammond, eds. The Future of New Religious Movements. Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 1987, 59-79. Members of the Church believe that Hubbard \\"discovered the existential truths that form their doctrine through research,\\" thus leading to the idea that Scientology is science. Hubbard created what the church would call a \\"spiritual technology\\" to advance the goals of Scientology. According to the church, \\"Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life.\\" The underlying claims are that Scientology is \\"exact\\" and \\"certain.\\" Michael Shermer, writing for Scientific American in 2011, said that Scientology's methods lacked enough study to qualify as a science, but that the story of Xenu and Scientology's other creation myths were no less tenable than other religions. B. Hubbard, J. Hatfield and J. Santucci compare Scientology's view of humanity to the Yogachara school of Buddhism, saying that both have been described as \\"the most scientific\\" among new and traditional religions respectively. B. Hubbard et al. cite the use of technical language and the claim that teachings were developed through observation and experimentation. They also emphasize that many investigators and researchers consider Scientology to be a pseudoscience because of its absolute and meta-empirical goals. Scholar Kocku von Stuckrad stated that Scientology is an example of the phenomenon of both the ‚Äúscientification of religion‚Äù and the ‚Äúsacralization‚Äù of science. Donald A. Westbrook elaborates that there is apparently an ‚Äúongoing and dialectical relationship‚Äù between religion and science in Hubbard's teachings. =The Bridge to Total Freedom= The Bridge to Total Freedom is the means by which Scientologists undertake personal development. Processing is the actual practice of auditing which directs questions towards areas of travail in a person's life to get rid of barriers that inhibit his or her natural abilities. This process is supposed to bring greater happiness, intelligence and success.Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary. Training is also given in the process of auditing others. The Bridge to Total Freedom is considered a metaphor for the spiritual life of the believer, and is also a detailed outline of the process a Scientologist undergoes in order to develop spirituality. It follows a strict hierarchy with ascending levels. The main goal of the first stage is to be freed from limitations of the MEST universe (MEST standing for matter, energy, space and time), while the second stage is about regaining creative powers as a spiritual being which have been lost according to the teachings of Scientology. =Rejection of psychology and psychiatry= Scientologists on an anti-psychiatry demonstration Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both psychiatry and psychology. Scientology's views on the evils of materialism. Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on spiritual healing. The psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s. Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity's spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard's insights about the nature of the mind. Scientology holds psychiatry responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying it has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and \\"that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust.\\" The anti-psychiatry organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) was founded by Hubbard in 1969. It operates Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, an anti-psychiatry museum. Through CCHR, Scientology has made claims of psychiatric abuse. The anti-psychiatry organization has had political accomplishments: In 1986, it published a manifesto against psychiatry and psychotropic medication, which was included in a document by the United Nations which saw wide circulation; In 2006, a bill drafted by the group was passed by the Arizona senate \\"mandating an additional consent form be presented to subjects considering participation in psychiatric research.\\" The form in question \\"differentiates real disease from mental illness.\\" A similar CCHR bill was rejected by the Florida house, \\"mandating that a long, ominous-sounding statement about the dangers of psychoactive drugs be presented to parents prior to school referral for mental health evaluation.\\" The movement has gained momentum across the US. = How Scientology defines ethics = Scientology teaches that progress on The Bridge to Total Freedom requires and enables the attainment of high moral and ethical standards. According to Hubbard, the goal of ethics is to remove impediments to survival, and ethics is essentially a tool to \\"get technology in\\", meaning Scientology's use of the term technology. Stephen A. Kent describes Scientology ethics as \\"a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefitted [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology. In this 'ethical' environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and 'justice system' ‚Äî its so-called technology ‚Äî onto society.\\" Scientology's system of ethics is designed to motivate members to expand church membership, as members' ethical level is tied to their performance in recruiting new members. Applied teachings The church makes it clear that Hubbard is considered the sole source of Dianetics and Scientology: \\"The Scientology religion is based exclusively upon L. Ron Hubbard's research, writings and recorded lectures ‚Äì all of which constitute the Scriptures of the religion.\\" His work, recorded in 500,000 pages of writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films, is archived for posterity. The Religious Technology Center holds \\"the ultimate ecclesiastical authority and the pure application of L. Ron Hubbard's religious technologies.\\" Individuals applying Hubbard's techniques who are not officially connected to the Church of Scientology are considered part of the \\"Free Zone\\". Some of these individuals were litigated against for using and modifying the practices for their own use and that of others, thereby infringing the law on patent, trademarks, or trade secrets. =Toxins and \\"Purification\\"= The Purification Rundown is a controversial detoxification program developed by Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard and used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. Scientologists consider it the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure. The program combines exercise, dietary supplements and long stays in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). It is promoted variously as religious or secular, medical or purely spiritual, depending on context. Narconon is a drug education and rehabilitation program founded on Hubbard's beliefs about toxins and purification. Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its Purification Program uses a regimen composed of sauna, physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study. =\\"Handling\\" of psychosis= The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is \\"looking into one's own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.\\"Technical Bulletins X Bridge Publications, Inc. (1991) The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995. =\\"Word Clearing\\" and \\"Learning on a Gradient\\"= On November 12, 1952, Hubbard delivered a lecture entitled \\"Precision Knowledge: Necessity to know terminology and law\\" emphasizing the importance to precise terminology. Scientology defined methods of correcting \\"misunderstoods\\" (\\"misunderstood word or symbol\\"). Scientologists have their own Technical Dictionary(, ) featuring modified definitions of existing English words. Scientology dictionaries also include specialized terminology such as \\"enturbulate\\" and \\"havingness.\\" Critics of Scientology have accused Hubbard of \\"loading the language\\" and using Scientology jargon to keep Scientologists from interacting with information sources outside of Scientology. Scientology teaches that that material must be learned \\"on a gradient\\", that is, in order without skipping or skimming material. In Scientology doctrine, the idea of communication has a high status. In the book Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities, Petrowsky and Zellner state that in the Scientology belief system, ‚Äúmisinformation or miscommunication is analogous to original sin, inhibiting individual growth and relationships with others.‚Äù The ‚Äúmisunderstood word‚Äù is a central teaching in Scientology. Failure in reading comprehension is attributed to it. =Interpretation and context= Scientology discourages secondary interpretation of its writings. Students of Scientology are taught to direct others to those original sources, rather than to convey any interpretation of the concepts in their own words. Emphasis is placed on keeping the writings in context. =Silent birth= Advocated by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, silent birth describes \\"the process of childbirth where labor and delivery is done in a calm and loving environment.\\" To provide quiet surroundings for the delivery of the baby, individuals in his/her immediate vicinity are prompted not to speak. According to Scientology practices, silent birth is \\"mandatory to provide the best possible environment for the pregnant mother and her new baby.\\" Shouting, laughing or making loud remarks must be avoided while the baby is being pushed out. According to The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, \\"its origins are fundamentally rooted in the principle that women, particularly expectant mothers, be given the utmost care and respect.\\" =Holidays= There are several holidays celebrated by Scientologists, notably L. Ron Hubbard's birthday in March, the Anniversary of the first publication of Dianetics in May, Sea Org Day in August, Auditor's Day in September and the International Association of Scientologists (IAS) Anniversary in October.Melton, J. Gordon. \\"Scientology, Holidays of the Church of.\\" Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations. Ed. J. Gordon Melton. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. 789‚Äì791. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. January 8, 2014. Most official celebrations are scheduled on weekends. Scientologists also celebrate holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year's Eve, as well as other local celebrations. Scientologists also celebrate religious holidays depending on other religious beliefs, as Scientologists very often retain their original affiliations with religions in which they were raised. =Sunday services= A Scientology Sunday service has a sermon, similar to other religions in the United States. It typically begins at 11am and Hubbard's writings are read aloud during the service. Much like other religions‚Äô services, music is played or sometimes musical performances are enjoyed. The minister speaks on Scientology doctrine, announces that weekly activities of the community and recent updates from churches around the world. Scientologists also say ‚ÄúA Prayer for Total Freedom,‚Äù asking the ‚Äúauthor of the universe‚Äù to help them as they seek enlightenment. The way Scientology's service has been executed has not changed. The minister chooses from a limited selection of possible sermons and group processing exercises. He creates the sermon within the parameters of a literal interpretation of Hubbard's canonical teachings, functioning similar to other indigenous theologians who work with canonical texts. According to religion scholar James R. Lewis, Sunday services are more for interested non-members and the holidays and events are more for existing members of the church. =Rituals= The church's rituals can be categorized four ways: first, rituals performed for spiritual transformation; second, collective ceremonies usually called events, including Hubbard's birthday; third, rites of passage including weddings and funerals; and fourth, those that mimic Christian rituals, such as Sunday services. Events include the anniversary of Dianetics, the anniversary of Freewinds and Auditor's Day. =Training= Scientologists also undergo training aside from auditing, which consists of several levels of courses about daily life improvement using various tools, and auditing techniques, so that members are able to perform the same procedure to other Scientologists. =Applications of \\"Ethics\\" and \\"Disconnection\\"= Scientology has an internal justice system (the Ethics system) designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior. Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org's performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents. Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high \\"ethical\\" standards. In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality. Actions are considered ethical if they promote survival across all eight dynamics, thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest. While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people's imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals. Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called social personalitiespeople who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others. The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were Suppressive Persons. According to Hubbard, only about 2.5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity: \\"the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.\\" Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals has an adverse effect on one's spiritual condition, necessitating disconnection. In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons, and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors. A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and as a result shows signs of antisocial behaviour is referred to as a Potential Trouble Source. =\\"Fair Game\\"= The term Fair Game is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the Church against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are \\"Fair Game\\" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible. Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of covert and illegal infiltration of the IRS and other U.S. government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church's critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology, 212 Cal. App. 3d 872 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1989)Frank K. Flinn testimony in Church of Scientology of California, 1984, vol.23, pp.4032‚Äì4160Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, July 18, 1989 =Splinter groups: Independents, Miscavige's RTC, and \\"Squirreling\\"= Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. While Scientology generally refers to Miscavige-led Church of Scientology, many other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members. In 1965, a longtime Church member and \\"Doctor of Scientology\\" Jack Horner (b. 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's \\"ethics\\" program, developed Dianology. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s. The church labels these groups as \\"squirrels\\" in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure. On January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the Religious Technology Center (RTC). On November 11, 1982, the Free Zone was established by former top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC.William W. Zellner Extraordinary Groups, p. 295, Macmillan, 2007 The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy. The Advanced Ability Center was a breakaway organization from the Church of Scientology established by former Scientologist David Mayo after he left the Church in February 1983 ‚Äì a time when most of Scientology's upper and middle management split with David Miscavige's organization.Nordhausen & Billerbeck (2008), pp. 469‚Äì470 David Mayo had been Hubbard's own auditor. More recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have represented and stood for the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church. =Use of contracts= The Church of Scientology requires that all members sign a legal waiver which covers their relationship with the Church of Scientology before engaging in Scientology services.

When mainstream media outlets have reported alleged abuses, representatives of the church have tended to deny such allegations. Secrecy The church maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, names and religious texts. Although U.S. intellectual property law allows for \\"fair use\\" of material for commentary, parody, educational purposes, etc., critics of the church such as Gerry Armstrong have argued the church unfairly and illegally uses the legal system to suppress \\"fair\\" uses, including suppressing any mention of the space opera aspects of the religion, including the story of Xenu.:371-383 One example critics cited is a 1995 lawsuit against the Washington Post newspaper et al. The Religious Technology Center (RTC), the corporation controlling L. Ron Hubbard's copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a Post reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and the circulation of their \\"advanced technology\\" teachings would cause \\"devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm\\" to those not prepared. In her judgment in favor of the Post, Judge Leonie Brinkema noted: Scientology and psychiatry There have been a number of controversies between Scientology and psychiatry since the founding of the Church of Scientology in 1952. Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both psychiatry and psychology. Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on spiritual healing. According to the Church of Scientology, psychiatry has a long history of improper and abusive care. The group's views have been disputed, criticized and condemned by experts in the medical and scientific community and been a source of public controversy. The Church of Scientology's objection to secular ideas about mental health are religious in nature, based on the conviction that humans are essentially divine beings who have been marred by negative experiences acquired over several lifetimes. Scientology also purports that the secular perception of what is mentally normal are not based on science, a contradiction to the claims of psychiatry and psychology. The Church founded an anti-psychiatry organization called Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which operates a museum in Hollywood, California called Psychiatry: An Industry of Death. The museum is dedicated to criticizing what it describes as \\"an industry driven entirely by profit\\".\\"Museum Targets Psychiatry As An \\"Industry Of Death\\"\\", CCHR press release, December 21, 2005 It has a variety of displays and exhibits that highlight physical psychiatric treatments, such as restraints, psychoactive drugs, electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery (including lobotomy, a procedure abandoned in the 1960s). \\"Attack the Attacker\\" policy Scientology has a reputation for hostile action toward anyone who criticizes it in a public forum; executives within the organization have proclaimed Scientology is \\"not a turn-the-other-cheek religion\\". Journalists, politicians, former Scientologists and various anti-cult groups have made accusations of wrongdoing against Scientology since the 1960s, and Scientology has targeted these critics - almost without exception - for retaliation, in the form of lawsuits and public counter-accusations of personal wrongdoing. Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives. The organization's actions reflect a formal policy for dealing with criticism instituted by L. Ron Hubbard, called \\"attack the attacker\\". Hubbard codified this policy in the latter half of the 1960s in response to government investigations into the organization. In 1966, Hubbard wrote a criticism of the organization's behavior and noted the \\"correct procedure\\" for attacking enemies of Scientology: =Scientology and Me= In 2007 a BBC documentary on Scientology by reporter John Sweeney came under scrutiny by Scientologists. Sweeney alleged \\"While making our BBC Panorama film Scientology and Me I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed‚Äîthat is how it felt to me‚Äîin a mock up of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers\\". This resulted in a video being distributed by Scientologists of a shouting match between Sweeney and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis. The church has reportedly released a DVD accusing the BBC of organising a demonstration outside a Scientology office in London, during which \\"terrorist death threats\\" were made against Scientologists. The BBC described the allegations as \\"clearly laughable and utter nonsense\\". Sandy Smith, the BBC programme's producer, commented the church of Scientology has \\"no way of dealing with any kind of criticism at all\\". =Fair Game= Hubbard detailed his rules for attacking critics in a number of policy letters, including one often quoted by critics as \\"the Fair Game policy\\". This allowed those who had been declared enemies of the Church, called \\"suppressive persons\\" (SPs), \\"May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed\\". (taken from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV, Penalties for Lower Conditions ) The aforementioned policy was canceled and replaced by HCOPL July 21, 1968, Penalties for Lower Conditions. The wordings \\"May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed\\", are not found in this reference.Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology: Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P. ‚Äì Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, December 1971, Chapter 7 (also referred to as the Foster Report) Scientology critics argue only the term but not the practice was removed. To support this contention, they refer to \\"HCO Policy Letter of October 21, 1968\\" which says, \\"The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of a SP.\\" According to a book by Omar Garrison, HCOPL March 7, 1969, was created under pressure by the government of New Zealand. Garrison quotes from the HCOPL, \\"We are going in the direction of mild ethics and involvement with the Society\\". Garrison then states, \\"It was partly on the basis of these policy reforms that the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry recommended that no legislative action be taken against Scientology\\".Garrison, Omar PLAYING DIRTY The Secret War Against Beliefs Ralton-Pilot, Los Angeles, 1980 pg 172-173 The source of Omar Garrison for this is most likely the Dumbleton-Powles Report, additional data and quotations are found in this report.The Commission of Inquiry Into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand; Chairman: Sir Guy Richardson Powles, K.B.E., C.M.G.; Member: E. V. Dumbleton, Esquire, June 1969, page 26 In 1977, top officials of Scientology's \\"Guardian's Office\\", an internal security force run by Hubbard's wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, admitted that fair game was policy in the GO. (U.S. v. Kember, Budlong Sentencing Memorandum ‚Äì Undated, 1981). In separate cases in 1979 and 1984, attorneys for Scientology argued the Fair Game policy was in fact a core belief of Scientology and as such deserved protection as religious expression.Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, 18 July 1989, (courtesy link) =\\"Dead agenting\\"= In the 1970s, Hubbard continued to codify the policy of \\"attacking the attacker\\" and assigned a term to be used frequently within Scientology: \\"dead agenting\\". Used as a verb, \\"dead agenting\\" is described by Hubbard as a technique for countering negative accusations against Scientology by diverting the critical statements and making counter-accusations against the accuser; in other words, to \\"attack the attacker\\". Hubbard defined the PR (public relations) policy on \\"dead agenting\\" in a 1974 bulletin: The phrase comes from a misunderstanding of the chapter on espionage in The Art of War. The Scientology-sponsored website, religiousfreedomwatch.org, features depictions of so-called \\"anti-religious extremists\\", most of them critics of Scientology. Featuring photos of the critics and claimed evidence of their personal wrongdoing (sometimes very vague, for example: \\"Documentation received by Religious Freedom Watch shows that [Kristi] Wachter paid an individual to carry out a specific project for her, and also instructed this individual to lie about what he was doing in case he was caught\\"). The \\"Religious Freedom Watch\\" site is often cited by alt.religion.scientology users as a contemporary example of \\"dead agenting\\". Dead agenting has also been carried out by flier campaigns against some critics‚Äîusing so-called \\"DA fliers\\". Bonnie Woods, an ex-member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a \\"hate campaigner\\" with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999, the church agreed to issue an apologyChurch of Scientology apology to Bonnie Woods from the Church of Scientology and other defendants, 8 June 1999. and to pay ¬£55,000 damages and ¬£100,000 costs to the Woods.Stars' cult pays out ¬£155,000 over hate campaign, Richard Palmer, The Express, 8 June 1999, courtesy link \\"Scientologists pay for libel\\", Clare Dyer, The Guardian, 9 June 1999. =R2-45= \\"R2-45\\" is the name given by L. Ron Hubbard to what he described as \\"an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time\\". In Scientology doctrine, exteriorization refers to the separation of the thetan (soul) from the body. According to the author Stewart Lamont, Hubbard defined R2-45 as a process by which exteriorization could be produced by shooting a person in the head with a .45 revolver. The journalist and author Tony Ortega has suggested R2-45 may have been used neither as a murder order nor as a joke, but as a means of intimidation. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carried out a lengthy investigation of Scientology in the 1960s, and as part of that interviewed two prominent ex-Scientologists who said they had been sent \\"R2-45\\" letters. According to FDA records dating from 1970 that Ortega published in 2015, one of the two said he received a letter suggesting he use \\"a 45 caliber pistol to exteriorize himself\\", while the other \\"stated he also received letters indicating he should apply technique R2-45 to himself\\". The FDA inspector noted \\"[t]his particular technique is a route whereby an individual places a 45 caliber pistol to his head and disassociates himself from his body.\\" While no \\"R2-45 letters\\" have been published, orders to use R2-45 on specific individuals were published in a prominent Scientology magazine. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled \\"Racket Exposed\\", in which he denounced twelve people as \\"Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life\\", and ordered \\"Any Sea Org member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.\\" The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology's internal journal, The Auditor.The Auditor, issue #35. (Undated but copyrighted 1968) Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in The Auditor later in 1968.The Auditor, issue #37. (Undated but copyrighted 1968) Criminal convictions of members Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology is reflected in the long list of legal incidents associated with the organization including the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization. In 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L. Ron Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States, called \\"Operation Snow White\\". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service. The judge who convicted Mary Sue Hubbard and ten accomplices described their attempt to plead freedom of religion in defense: Eleven church staff members, including Mary Sue Hubbard and other highly placed officials, pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court based on evidence seized in the raids and received sentences from two to six years (some suspended). Other noteworthy incidents involving criminal accusations and prosecutions against the Church of Scientology include: * On January 4, 1963, more than one hundred E-meters were seized by U.S. marshals at the \\"Founding Church of Scientology\\" building, now known as the L. Ron Hubbard House, located in Washington, D.C. The church was accused of making false claims that the devices effectively treated some 70 percent of all physical and mental illness. The FDA also charged that the devices did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended. Chapter 6. Upon appeal, the E-meters were returned, with the direction that they should be used only in \\"bona fide religious counseling\\", and that all meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits. In the decision, the court gave recognition to Scientology's \\"constitutional right to protection from the government's excessive entanglement with religion\\" as written by James R. Lewis, in Scientology. * In 1978, L. Ron Hubbard was convicted in absentia by French authorities of engaging in fraud, fined 35,000 francs, and sentenced to four years in prison. The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.Catholic Sentinel, March 17, 1978 * The FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology actions against various critics of the organization. Among these documents was a plan to frame Gabe Cazares, the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, with a staged hit- and-run accident. Also, plans were made to discredit the skeptical organization CSICOP by spreading rumors that it was a front for the CIA, and a project called \\"Operation Freakout\\" which aimed at ruining the life of Paulette Cooper, author of The Scandal of Scientology, an early book that had been critical of the movement. Original (18M) * In 1988, the government of Spain arrested Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and ten other members of the organization on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations. Jentzsch jumped bail, leaving Spain and returning to the United States after Scientology paid a bail bond of approximately $1 million, and he has not returned to the country since. Scientology fought the charges in court for fourteen years, until the case was finally dismissed in 2002. * The Church of Scientology is the only religious organization in Canada to be convicted on the charge of breaching the public trust: The Queen v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, et al. (1992) * In France, several officials of the Church of Scientology were convicted of embezzlement in 2001. The Church was listed as a \\"dangerous cult\\" in a parliamentary report. In May 2009 a trial commenced in France against Scientology, accusing it of organised fraud. The case focused on a complaint by a woman who says that after being offered a free personality test, she was pressured into paying large sums of money. The church is regarded as a sect in France.Scientology trial due in France BBC News 25 May 2009. The result of the trial was that two branches of the organization and several of its leaders have been found guilty of fraud and fined. Alain Rosenberg, the group's head in France, received a two-year suspended jail sentence. * The Church of Scientology long considered the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) as one of its most important enemies, and many Scientology publications during the 1980s and 1990s cast CAN (and its spokesperson at the time, Cynthia Kisser) in an unfriendly light, accusing the cult-watchdog organization of various criminal activities. After CAN was forced into bankruptcy and taken over by Scientologists in the late 1990s, Scientology proudly proclaimed this as one of its greatest victories. *In Belgium, after a judicial investigation since 1997, a trial against the organization is due to begin in 2008. Charges include formation of a criminal organization, the unlawful exercise of medicine, and fraud. Belgium charges Scientologists with extortion. Sydney Morning Herald. Accessed 05 September 2007. *In the United Kingdom the church has been accused of \\"grooming\\" City of London Police officers with gifts worth thousands of pounds. *In Australia, Scientology has been temporarily banned in the 1960s in three out of six states; the use of the E-meter was similarly banned in Victoria. In Victoria, Scientology was investigated by the state government. In the conclusion to his report written as part of this investigation, Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C. stated \\"Scientology is a delusional belief system, based on fiction and fallacies and propagated by falsehood and deception\\".The Anderson Report ‚Äì Contents courtesy link The report was later overturned by the High Court of Australia, which compelled the states to recognize Scientology as a religion for purposes of payroll taxes, stating \\"Regardless of whether the members of are gullible or misled or whether the practices of Scientology are harmful or objectionable, the evidence, in our view, establishes that Scientology must, for relevant purposes, be accepted as \\"a religion\\" in Victoria.\\" *In 2009, a Paris court found the French Church of Scientology guilty of organized fraud and imposed a fine of nearly . The prosecution had asked for the Church to be banned, but a recent change in legislation made this impossible. The case had been brought by two ex-members who said they had been pressured into spending large amounts of money on Scientology courses and other services. Commenting on the verdict, the plaintiffs' attorney said, \\"It's the first time in France that the entity of the Church of Scientology is condemned for fraud as an organized gang\\". A Scientology spokesperson likened the judgment to \\"an Inquisition for modern times\\" and said the Church would appeal. Treatment of members In 2007, a 25-year-old woman from Sydney was charged with murdering her father and sister and seriously injuring her mother. Her parents had prevented her from seeking the psychiatric treatment she needed because of their Scientology beliefs. In 2012, Debbie Cook, who ran the \\"spiritual Mecca\\" for seventeen years, came forward and accused the church of repeated accounts of \\"screaming, slapping\\" and being \\"made to stand in a trash and water's poured over you\\" in efforts to confess her sins. This was all done in \\"The Hole\\", located at Scientology's International base in Hemet, California. She claims that she was taken there against her will and forced to stay for seven weeks. The church states that she \\"voluntarily\\" participated in their program of \\"religious discipline\\". Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath is a 2016‚Äì2017 A&E; documentary series that investigates abuses of the Church of Scientology by interviewing of former members. =Death of Lisa McPherson= Lisa McPherson The most widely publicized death of one of the organization's members was that of 36-year-old Lisa McPherson while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in Clearwater, Florida, in 1995. McPherson, at the time, was displaying symptoms suggesting she was struggling with mental illness; in one case, she removed all of her clothes after being involved in a minor traffic accident, later remarking she had done so in hopes of obtaining counseling. The Church, however, intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment and to keep her in Church custody. Records show that she was then placed in a Scientology program, the Introspection Rundown, which was forced isolation used to handle a psychotic episode. Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. The autopsy identified multiple hematomas (bruises), an abrasion on the nose, and lesions that were consistent with \\"insect/animal bites\\". An autopsy showed that she had died of a pulmonary embolism. Florida authorities filed criminal charges against the Church of Scientology, who denied any responsibility for McPherson's death and vigorously contested the charges. The prosecuting attorneys ultimately dropped the criminal case. After four years, a $100 million civil lawsuit filed by Lisa McPherson's family was settled in 2004. The suit resulted in an injunction against the distribution of a film critical of Scientology, The Profit, which the Church claimed was meant to influence the jury. The terms of the settlement were sealed by the court. =Death of Elli Perkins= Another crime that received substantial news coverage involved the death of Elli Perkins. This included an installment on the CBS investigative news program 48 Hours. Perkins was a mother of two, a professional glass artist, and a Scientologist who lived in Western New York. She was a senior auditor at the Church of Scientology in Buffalo, New York. When her then 24-year-old son Jeremy began to show strange and disturbing behavior, Elli did not seek out psychiatric care but used treatment in accordance with Scientology. Scientologists believe that psychiatry \\"doesn't work.\\" First, the family sent Jeremy to Scientology's Sea Org in California. He returned home some months later because Sea Org hadn't helped. Found trespassing outside the University at Buffalo on August 14, 2001, Jeremy was arrested and remanded to a local hospital after a court-ordered psychiatric exam confirmed that he had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Elli Perkins later convinced the court to release her son into her custody so she could seek alternatives to psychiatry. She also refused any treatment with anti-psychotic medications. Defense attorney John Nuchereno said that Jeremy's condition declined over the summer of 2002. He was no longer able to work in the family business. The Church of Scientology ceased efforts to cure Jeremy and classified him as a level III \\"Potential Trouble Source.\\" In the fall of 2002, the family consulted Dr. Conrad Maulfair, an osteopathic physician and Scientologist. Dr. Maulfair concluded that Jeremy needed to be purged of certain chemical toxins in his body. Maulfair said he needed to be \\"energized\\" through vitamin therapy. Jeremy became suspicious of his mother; he thought the vitamins were poisoning him. In February 2003, Elli took Jeremy to see Albert Brown, a self-taught \\"natural healer.\\" Elli planned to send Jeremy to live with Brown for treatment. He was to leave for Brown's on March 13, 2003, but days beforehand began to act more aggressively. On the 13th, after a shower he retrieved a steak knife and tried to slit his wrists. Unsuccessful, Jeremy found his mother in the kitchen and attacked her as she spoke to a friend on the phone. Autopsy reports showed that Elli Perkins was stabbed 77 times. Jeremy was charged with second degree murder but found not responsible by reason of mental disease. On January 29, 2004, after NY State Office of Mental Health exams, he was assessed \\"Dangerously Mentally Ill\\" and committed to a secure facility. Jeremy is on psychotropic medications, which court psychiatrists state have not cured him, but have stabilized his condition. In March 2006, an advertisement in LA Weekly blamed the Church of Scientology for Perkins' violent death. The 48 Hours segment on Perkins' death aired on October 28, 2006. Afterward, CBS reported they had received complaints from Scientologists. =Death of Noah Lottick= Noah Lottick was an American student of Russian studies who committed suicide on May 11, 1990, by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands. After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents' concern over his membership in the Church of Scientology. Noah Lottick had taken Scientology courses, for which he paid .Richard Behar, \\"Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\", Time, May 6, 1991, see article: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power Lottick's friends and family remarked that after taking these courses he began to act strangely. They stated to Time magazine that he told them that his Scientologist teachers were telepathic, and that his father's heart attack was purely psychosomatic. His parents said that he visited their home five days before his death, claiming they were spreading \\"false rumors\\" about him. Lottick's suicide was profiled in a Time cover story that was highly critical of Scientology, \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\", which received the Gerald Loeb Award, and later appeared in Reader's Digest.October 1991, Reader's Digest, \\"A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream\\" Lottick's father, Dr. Edward Lottick, stated that his initial impression of Scientology was that it was similar to Dale Carnegie's techniques. However, after his son's death, his opinion was that the organization is a \\"school for psychopaths\\". He blamed Scientology for his son's death, although no direct connection was determined. After Dr. Lottick's remarks were published in the media, the Church of Scientology haggled with him over that Noah had allegedly paid to the Church and not utilized for services. The Church claimed Lottick had intended this to be a donation. The Church of Scientology sued Richard Behar and Time magazine for $416 million. Dr. and Mrs. Lottick submitted affidavits affirming \\"the accuracy of each statement in the article\\", and stating that Dr. Lottick had \\"concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations\\". They said that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral of their son.Church of Scientology v. Time and Richard Behar, 92 Civ. 3024 (PKL), Opinion and Order, Court TV library Web site., retrieved 1 October 2006. All counts against Behar and Time were later dismissed.\\"Judge Dismisses Church of Scientology's $416 Million Lawsuit Against Time Magazine\\" , Business Wire, July 16, 1996. Lottick's father cited his son's suicide as his motivation for researching cults, in his article describing a survey of physicians that he presented to the Pennsylvania State Medical Society.Survey Reveals Physicians' Experience with Cults, Dr. Edward Lottick, Cult Observer, Volume 10, Number 3, 1993. The Church of Scientology issued a press release denying any responsibility for Lottick's suicide. Spokesperson Mike Rinder was quoted in the St. Petersburg Times as saying that Lottick had an argument with his parents four days before his death. Rinder stated, \\"I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable.\\" =Brainwashing= The Church of Scientology is frequently accused by critics of employing brainwashing. The controversy about the existence of cultic brainwashing has become one of the most polarizing issues among cult followers, academic researchers of cults, and cult critics. Parties disagree about the existence of a social process attempting coercive influence, and also disagree about the existence of the social outcome‚Äîthat people become influenced against their will. One alleged example of the Church's possible brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned to work off alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent's Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF). Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentik√§inen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force. L. Ron Hubbard is believed to have authored The Brainwashing Manual. The Anderson Report The final results of the Anderson Report in 1965 declared: > \\"The Board is not concerned to find that the scientology techniques are > brainwashing techniques as practiced, so it is understood, in some > communist-controlled countries. Scientology techniques are, nevertheless, a > kind of brainwashing...The astonishing feature of Scientology is that its > techniques and propagation resemble very closely those set out in a book > entitled Brain-washing, advertised and sold by the HASI\\".Report of the Board > of Enquiry into Scientology, by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C., Published 1965 > by the State of Victoria, Australia. =Disconnection= The Church of Scientology has been criticized for their practice of \\"disconnection\\" in which Scientologists are directed to sever all contact with family members or friends who criticize the faith. Critics including ex-members and relatives of existing members say that this practice has divided many families. The disconnection policy is considered by critics to be further evidence that the Church is a cult. By making its members entirely dependent upon a social network entirely within the organization, critics assert that Scientologists are kept from exposure to critical perspectives on the church and are put in a situation that makes it extremely difficult for members to leave the church, since apostates will be shunned by the Church and have already been cut off from family and friends. The Church of Scientology acknowledges that its members are strongly discouraged from associating with \\"enemies of Scientology\\", and likens the disconnection policy to the practice of shunning in religions such as the Amish. However, there is a consensus of religious scholars who oppose Scientology's practice: \\"I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it, the policy hurts everybody.\\" J. Gordon Melton, Institute for the Study of American Religion, Santa Barbara, California. \\"It has to do with feeling threatened because you're not that big. You do everything you can to keep unity in the group.\\" Frank K. Flinn, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri. \\"Some people I've talked to, they just wanted to go on with their lives and they wanted to be in touch with their daughter or son or parent. The shunning was just painful. And I don't know what it was accomplishing. And the very terms they use are scary, aren't they?\\" Newton Maloney, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California. =Use of donations and preferential treatment of Scientologist celebrities= Andre Tabayoyon, a former Scientologist and Sea Org staffer, testified in a 1994 affidavit that money from not-for-profit Scientology organizations and labor from those organizations (including the Rehabilitation Project Force) had gone to provide special facilities for Scientology celebrities, which were not available to other Scientologists: \\"A Sea Org staffer...was taken along to do personal cooking for Tom Cruise and Miscavige at the expense of Scientology not for profit religious organizations. This left only 3 cooks at Gold to cook for 800 people three times a day...apartment cottages were built for the use of John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, Edgar Winter, Priscilla Presley, and other Scientology celebrities who are carefully prevented from finding out the real truth about the Scientology organization ... Miscavige decided to redo the meadow in beautiful flowers; Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the project so that Cruise and Kidman could romp there. However, Miscavige inspected the project and didn't like it. So the whole meadow was plowed up, destroyed, replowed and sown with plain grass.\\"Tabayoyon, Andre. 1994. 'Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon.' In Church of Scientology International v. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz. United States District Court, Central District of California. Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), (4 April): 64 pp Tabayoyon's account of the planting of the meadow was supported by another former Scientologist, Maureen Bolstad, who said that a couple of dozen Scientologists including herself were put to work on a rainy night through dawn on the project. \\"We were told that we needed to plant a field and that it was to help Tom impress Nicole...but for some mysterious reason it wasn't considered acceptable by Mr. Miscavige. So the project was rejected and they redid it\\". Legitimacy of Scientology as a religion Islamic extremism, Scientology and organized crime. The nature of Scientology is hotly debated in many countries. The Church of Scientology pursues an extensive public relations campaign arguing Scientology is a bona fide religion. The organization cites a number of studies and experts who support their position. Critics point out most cited studies were commissioned by Scientology to produce the desired results. Many countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom), while not prohibiting or limiting the activities of the Church of Scientology, have rejected its applications for tax-exempt, charitable status or recognition as a religious organization; it has been variously judged to be a commercial enterprise or a dangerous cult. Scientology is legally accepted as a religion in the United States and Australia, and enjoys the constitutional protections afforded to religious practice in each country. In October 1993, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service recognized the Church as an \\"organization operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes\\".https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-97-50.txt The Church offers the tax exemption as proof that it is a religion. (This subject is examined in the article on the Church of Scientology). In 1982, the High Court of Australia ruled the State Government of Victoria lacked the right to declare the Church of Scientology was not a religion.. The Court found the issue of belief to be the central feature of religion, regardless of the presence of charlatanism: Charlatanism is a necessary price of religious freedom, and if a self- proclaimed teacher persuades others to believe in a religion which he propounds, lack of sincerity or integrity on his part is not incompatible with the religious character of the beliefs, practices and observances accepted by his followers.\\" Other countries to have recognized Scientology as a religion include Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden,, and New Zealand. The debate continues until today, with a new generation of critics continuing to question Scientology's legitimacy as a religion. =L. Ron Hubbard and starting a religion for money= While the oft-cited rumor Hubbard made a bar bet with Robert A. Heinlein he could start a cult is unproven, many witnesses have reported Hubbard making statements in their presence starting a religion would be a good way to make money. These statements have led many to believe Hubbard hid his true intentions and was motivated solely by potential financial rewards. Editor Sam Merwin, for example, recalled a meeting: \\"I always knew he was exceedingly anxious to hit big money‚Äîhe used to say he thought the best way to do it would be to start a cult.\\" (December 1946) Writer and publisher Lloyd Arthur Eshbach reported Hubbard saying \\"I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is.\\" Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said \\"You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.\\"Sam Moskowitz affidavit, 14 April 1993 Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an A&E; documentary titled Inside Scientology shows Lyle Stuart reporting Hubbard stated repeatedly to make money, \\"you start a religion.\\" According to The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977: :\\" . . .[Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. Harlan Ellison's version (Time Out, UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [John W.] Campbell, \\"I'm going to invent a religion that's going to make me a fortune. I'm tired of writing for a penny a word\\". Sam Moskowitz, a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence\\". The following letter, written by L. Ron Hubbard, was discovered by the FBI during its raid on Scientology headquarters. The letter shows Hubbard turned Scientology into a \\"religion\\" for financial reasons: > (1953) DEAR HELEN RE CLINIC, HAS The arrangements that have been made seem a > good temporary measure. On a longer look, however, something more equitable > will have to be organized.

An article by Professor Benjamin Beith-Hallahmi documents the secular aspects of Scientology from Scientology's own writings. Free Zone suppression The Church has taken steps to suppress the Free Zone, the term for a variety of groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside the strictures of the Church of Scientology proper, and shut down dissenters when possible. The CoS has used copyright and trademark laws to attack various Free Zone groups. Accordingly, the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including 'Scientology' itself. In 2000, the Religious Technology Center unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Web domain www.scientologie.org from the World Intellectual Property Organization, in a legal action against the Free Zone. Skeptic Magazine described the Free Zone as: \\"..a group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard's ideas independent of the COS [Church of Scientology].\\" A Miami Herald article wrote that ex-Scientologists joined the Free Zone because they felt that Church of Scientology leadership had: \\"..strayed from Hubbard's original teachings.\\" One Free Zone Scientologist identified as \\"Safe\\" was quoted in Salon as saying: \\"The Church of Scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it doesn't want its members to know that they can get scientology outside of the Church of Scientology.\\" Litigation as harassment of critics In the past many critics of Scientology have claimed they were harassed by frivolous and vexatious lawsuits. Paulette Cooper was falsely accused of felony charges as she had been framed by the Church of Scientology's Guardian's Office. Furthermore, her personal life had been intruded upon by Scientologists who had attempted to kill her and/or draw her to suicide in a covert plan known as Operation Freakout brought to light after FBI investigations into other matters (See Operation Snow White). Original (PDF), 18M A prominent example of litigation of its critics is the Church of Scientology's $416 million libel lawsuit s:Church of Scientology v. Behar against Time Warner as a result of their publication of a highly critical magazine article \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" by Richard Behar. A public campaign by the Church of Scientology accordingly ensued in an attempt to defame this Time Magazine publication. (See Church of Scientology's response) Gareth Alan Cales is being harassed by the Church of Scientology, including false charges against him and his friends. Similarly, the Church of Scientology's legal battle with Gerry Armstrong in Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong spanned two decades and involved a $10 million claim against Armstrong.WikiSource ‚Äì Church of Scientology v. Armstrong WikiSource ‚Äì Church of Scientology v. Superior Court Personality tests In 2008 the 20-year-old daughter of Olav Gunnar Ballo, a Norwegian member of parliament, had taken a personality test organized by Scientologists in Nice, and received very negative feedback from it. A few hours later she committed suicide. French police started an investigation of the Scientology church. In the wake of the Ballo suicide linked to the personality test, the spokesman for the church in Norway called the link at accusation deeply unfair, and pointing out that the daughter had previously suffered eating disorders and psychiatric troubles. The personality test has been condemned by the psychologist Rudy Myrvang. He called the test a recruitment tool, aimed at breaking down a person so that the Scientologists can build the test-taker back up.Police probe suicide linked to Scientologists Aftenposten, April 16, 2008 Treatment of Scientologists in Germany Tom Cruise is one of several Scientologist artists who have been subject to boycott calls in Germany.Staff (2007-07-09). \\"Stauffenberg-Film: R√ºckendeckung aus Hollywood\\", Die Zeit Pastor Thomas Gandow, a prominent spokesperson for the German Lutheran Church, has described Cruise as the \\"Goebbels of Scientology\\".Moore, Tristana (2008-01-13). \\"Scientologists in German push\\", BBCPaterson, Tony (2007-07-23). \\"Cruise is 'Goebbels of Scientology', says German church\\", The Independent Based on the 1993 IRS decision granting Scientology tax-exempt status, the U.S. Department of State formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists' complaints of harassment and discrimination in its annual Human Rights Reports, starting from the 1993 report. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has repeatedly expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists' individual rights posed by \\"sect filters\\", whereby potential employees are required to divulge any association with Scientology before they are considered for a job.Lehmann, Hartmut (2004). Koexistenz und Konflikt von Religionen im Vereinten Europa, Wallstein Verlag, , pp. 68‚Äì71 Germany, America and Scientology, Washington Post, February 1, 1997Frantz, Douglas (1997-11-08). \\"U.S. Immigration Court Grants Asylum to German Scientologist\\", New York Times It has also warned that companies and artists associated with Scientology may be subject to \\"government-approved discrimination and boycotts\\" in Germany. Past targets of such boycotts have included Tom Cruise and jazz pianist Chick Corea. In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drew parallels between the \\"organized oppression\\" of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. Schmid, John (1997-01-15). German Party Replies To Scientology Backers, International Herald Tribune The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives.Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (1997-02-10). \\"Does Germany Have Something Against These Guys?\\", Time Commenting on the matter, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State criticized Germany's treatment of Scientologists and said that Scientologists were indeed discriminated against in Germany, but condemned any comparisons of this treatment to the Nazis' treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, an opinion echoed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights.Staff (1998-04-02). \\"U.N. Derides Scientologists' Charges About German 'Persecution'\\", New York Times German officials sharply rejected the accusations. They said that Germany guarantees the freedom of religion, but characterized Scientology as a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion, and emphasized that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all \\"radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups\\", and not just against Scientology. According to a 1997 Time magazine article, most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization, with pollsters reporting 70% popular support for banning Scientology in Germany. In late 1997, the United States granted asylum to a German Scientologist, Antje Victore, who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In 2000, the German Stern magazine published a report asserting that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application‚Äîostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist‚Äîhad in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of the Office of Special Affairs and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum. On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an \\"orchestrated effort\\" by Scientology undertaken \\"for political gain\\", and \\"a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system\\".Tobin, Thomas C. (2000-07-26). \\"German visitor takes on Scientology\\", St. Petersburg Times German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a \\"hate campaign\\" in Germany that had \\"ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists\\" and maintained that Scientologists had not \\"exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States\\". Mark Rathbun, a top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, \\"there would have been nothing improper if it had\\". Scientology and Wikipedia In an effort to adhere to Wikipedia policy, the Arbitration Committee of the English Wikipedia decided in late-May 2009 to restrict editing from Church of Scientology Internet Protocol addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by editors within CoS-administered networks.WP:ARBSCI A \\"host of anti-Scientologist editors\\" were topic-banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had \\"gamed policy\\" and resorted to \\"battlefield tactics\\", with articles on living persons being the \\"worst casualties\\". Church of Scientology's response to criticism Scientology's response to accusations of criminal behavior has been twofold; the church is under attack by an organized conspiracy, and each of the church's critics is hiding a private criminal past. In the first instance, the Church of Scientology has repeatedly stated that it is engaged in an ongoing battle against a massive, worldwide conspiracy whose sole purpose is to \\"destroy the Scientology religion.\\" Thus, aggressive measures and legal actions are the only way the church has been able to survive in a hostile environment; they sometimes liken themselves to the early Mormons who took up arms and organized militia to defend themselves from persecution. The church asserts that the core of the organized anti-Scientology movement is the psychiatric profession, in league with deprogrammers and certain government bodies (including elements within the FBI and the government of Germany.) These conspirators have allegedly attacked Scientology since the earliest days of the church, with the shared goal of creating a docile, mind-controlled population. As an official Scientology website explains: :To understand the forces ranged against L. Ron Hubbard, in this war he never started, it is necessary to gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly before the turn of the century; it is certainly not worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control. On the other hand, L. Ron Hubbard has proclaimed that all critics of Scientology are criminals. Hubbard wrote on numerous occasions that all of Scientology's opponents are seeking to hide their own criminal histories, and the proper course of action to stop these attacks is to \\"expose\\" the hidden crimes of the attackers. The Church of Scientology does not deny that it vigorously seeks to \\"expose\\" its critics and enemies; it maintains that all of its critics have criminal histories, and they encourage hatred and \\"bigotry\\" against Scientology. Hubbard's belief that all critics of Scientology are criminals was summarized in a policy letter written in 1967: :Now get this as a technical fact, not a hopeful idea. Every time we have investigated the background of a critic of Scientology we have found crimes for which that person or group could be imprisoned under existing law. We do not find critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts. Over and over we prove this. -- Critics of Scientology, \\"Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter\\", 5 November 1967. Scientology claims that it continues to expand and prosper despite all efforts to prevent it from growing; critics claim that the Church's own statistics contradict its story of continuing growth.Scientology#Membership statistics The Church of Scientology has published a number of responses to criticism available online. Analyses of Scientology's counter-accusations and actions against its critics are available on a number of websites, including the critical archive Operation Clambake. On January 22, 2013, attorneys for the organization, as well as some of its members, reacted toward the CNN News Group, threatening legal action for its airing of a story covering the release of a book published by Lawrence Wright, entitled 'Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief', published earlier the same year. CNN News Group then chose to publish the correspondence, with confidential information redacted, on its web site. The threats were not followed up by lawsuits.

The L-2000 lost the contract to the Boeing 2707, but that competing design was ultimately canceled for political, environmental and economic reasons. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy committed the government to subsidizing 75% of the development of a commercial airliner to compete with the Anglo-French Concorde then under development. The director of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Najeeb Halaby, elected to improve upon the Concorde's design rather than compete head-to-head with it. The SST, which might have represented a significant advance over the Concorde, was intended to carry 250 passengers (a large number at the time, more than twice as many as Concorde), fly at Mach 2.7-3.0, and have a range of 4,000 mi (7,400 km). The program was launched on June 5, 1963, and the FAA estimated that by 1990 there would be a market for 500 SSTs. Boeing, Lockheed, and North American officially responded. North American's design was soon rejected, but the Boeing and Lockheed designs were selected for further study. Design and development =Early design studies= The CL-823 used a cranked-arrow wing and buried engines, the L-2000 had a compound delta and podded engines, and was larger overall. Most of the major US aviation firms spent at least some time in the 1950s considering SST designs. Lockheed's first attempts date to 1958. Lockheed sought an airplane with cruise speeds of around with takeoff and landing speeds that compared to large subsonic jets of the same era. Early designs followed Lockheed's tapered straight wing, similar to the one used on the F-104 Starfighter, with a delta-shaped canard for aerodynamic trim. During wind-tunnel tests, this design demonstrated substantial shifts in the airplane's center of pressure (C/L). These would require large trim changes as the aircraft changed speed, causing trim drag. A delta wing was substituted which alleviated a portion of the movement, but it was not deemed sufficient. Lockheed knew a variable geometry, swing-wing design could accomplish this goal, but felt it was too heavy: they preferred a fixed-wing solution. In a worst-case scenario, they were willing to design a fixed-wing aircraft using fuel for ballast. By 1962, Lockheed arrived at a highly swept, cranked-arrow design featuring four engine pods buried in the wings and a canard. The improvement was closer to their goal, but still not optimal. By 1963, they extended the leading edge of the wing forward to eliminate the need for the canard, and re-shaped the wing into a double-delta shape with a mild twist and camber. This, along with careful shaping of the fuselage, was able to control the shift in the center of pressure caused by the highly swept forward part of the wing developing lift supersonically. The engines were shifted from being buried in the wings to individual pods slung below the wings. =Later design studies= Artist's concept of an L-2000 in Pan Am livery at altitude in full afterburner (top), and with landing gear extended The new design was designated L-2000-1 and was 223 ft (70 m) long with a narrow-body 132 in (335.2 cm) wide fuselage to meet aerodynamic requirements, allowing for passenger seating of five abreast seating in coach and a four-abreast arrangement in first-class seating. A typical mixed-class seating layout would equal around 170 passengers, with high-density layouts exceeding 200 passengers. The L-2000-1 featured a long, pointed nose that was almost flat on top and curved on the bottom, which allowed for improved supersonic performance, and could be drooped for takeoff and landing to provide adequate visibility. The wing design featured a sharp forward inboard sweep of 80¬∞, with the remaining part of the wing's leading edge swept back 60¬∞, with an overall area of 8,370 ft¬≤ (778 m¬≤). The high sweep angles produced powerful vortices on the leading edge which increased lift at moderate to high angles of attack, yet still retained stable airflow over the control surfaces during a stall. These vortices also provided good directional control as well, which was somewhat deficient with the nose drooped at low speeds. The wing, while only 3% thick, provided substantial lift due to its large area, which, aided by vortex lift, allowed takeoff and landing speeds comparable to a Boeing 707. Additionally, a delta wing is a naturally rigid structure which requires little stiffening. The plane's undercarriage was a traditional tricycle type with a twin-wheeled nose gear. Each of the two six-wheeled main gear utilized the same tires used on the Douglas DC-8, but which were filled with nitrogen and to lower pressures. To provide an optimum entry date into service, Lockheed decided to use a beefed-up turbofan derivative of the Pratt & Whitney J58. The J58 had already successfully proven itself as a high-thrust, high- performance jet engine on the top-secret Lockheed A-12 (and subsequently on the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.) Since it was a turbofan, it was deemed to be quieter than a typical turbojet at low altitude and low speed, required no afterburner for takeoff, and allowed reduced power settings. The engines were placed in cylindrical pods with a wedge-shaped splitter, and a squarish intake providing the inlet system for the aircraft. The inlet was designed with the goal of requiring no moving parts, and was naturally stable. To reduce the noise from sonic booms, rather than penetrate the sound barrier at a more ideal 30,000 ft (9,144 m), they intended to penetrate it at 42,000 ft (12,802 m) instead. It would not be possible on hot days, but on normal days this would be achievable. Acceleration would continue through the sound barrier to Mach 1.15, at which point sonic booms would be audible on the ground. The plane would climb precisely to minimize sonic boom levels. After an initial level-off at around 71,500 ft (21,793 m), the plane would cruise climb upwards, ultimately reaching 76,500 ft (23,317 m). Descents would also be performed in a precise way to reduce sonic boom levels until subsonic speeds were reached. By 1964, the US Government issued new requirements regarding the SST Program which required Lockheed to modify their design, by now called the L-2000-2. The new design had numerous modifications to the wing; one change was rounding the front of the forward delta in order to eliminate the pitch-up tendency. To increase high-speed aerodynamic efficiency, the wing's thickness was reduced to 2.3%, the leading edges were made sharper, the sweep angles were changed from 80/60¬∞ to 85/62¬∞, and substantial twist and camber were added to the forward delta; much of the rear delta was twisted upwards to allow the elevons to remain flush at Mach 3.0. In addition, wing/body fairings were added on the underside of the fuselage where the wings are located, allowing a more normally shaped nose to be used. To retain low-speed performance, the rear delta was enlarged considerably; to increase the payload, the trailing edge featured a forward sweep of 10¬∞, extending the inner part of the wing rearward. The new nose reduced the overall length to 214 ft (65.2 m) while retaining virtually the same internal dimensions. Wingspan was identical as before, and despite the thinner wing, the increased wing area of 9,026 ft¬≤ (838.5 m¬≤) allowed the same takeoff performance. The airplane's overall lift-to-drag ratio increased from 7.25 to 7.94. During the course of the L-2000-2's development, the engine previously selected by Lockheed was no longer deemed acceptable. During the time frame between the L-2000-1 and L-2000-2, Pratt and Whitney designed a new afterburning turbofan called the JTF-17A, which produced greater amounts of thrust. General Electric developed the GE4 which was an afterburning turbojet with variable guide- vanes, which was actually the less powerful of the two at sea level, but produced more power at high altitudes. Both engines required some degree of afterburner during cruise. Lockheed's design favored the JTF-17A over the GE-4, but there was the risk that GE would win the engine competition and Lockheed would win the SST contract, so they developed new engine pods that could accommodate either engine. Aerodynamic modifications allowed a shorter engine pod to be used and which utilized a new inlet design. This inlet featured minimal external cowl angles and was precisely contoured to allow a high-pressure recovery using no moving parts, and allowed maximum performance with either engine option. To allow additional airflow for noise-reduction, or to aid afterburner performance, a set of suck-in doors was added to the rear portion of the pod. To provide mid-air braking capability for rapid deceleration and rapid descents, and to assist ground braking, part of the nozzle could be employed as a thrust reverser at speeds below Mach 1.2. The pods were also repositioned on the new wing to better shield them from abrupt changes in airflow. The additional thrust from the new engines allowed supersonic penetration to be delayed until up to 45,000 ft (13,716 m) under virtually all conditions. Since at this point the possibility of supersonic overland flight was still considered to be an option, Lockheed also considered larger, shorter-ranged versions of the L-2000-2B. All designs weighed exactly the same, with a new tail design, changes to the fuselage length, extensions to the forward delta, increased capacity, and variations in fuel capacity. The largest version featured capacity for 250 domestic passengers, while the medium version featured transatlantic capability with 220 passengers. Despite the fuselage length changes, there was no appreciable increase in the risk of the aircraft pitching upwards too far (over-rotation) on takeoff. =Design competition= By 1966, the design took on its final form as the L-2000-7A and L-2000-7B. The L-2000-7A featured a re-designed wing and fuselage lengthened to 273 ft (83 m). The longer fuselage allows for a mixed-class seating of 230 passengers. The new wing featured a proportionately larger forward delta, with greater refinement to the wing's twist and curvature. Despite having the same wingspan, the wing-area was increased to 9,424 ft¬≤ (875 m¬≤), with a slightly reduced 84¬∞ sweepback, and an increased 65¬∞ main delta wing, with reduced forward sweep along the trailing edge. Unlike previous versions, this aircraft featured a leading-edge flap to increase lift at low speeds, and to allow a slight down-elevon deflection. The fuselage, as a result of greater length, changes to the wing design, and attempts to further reduce drag, featured a slight vertical thinning in the fuselage where the wings were, a more prominent wing/body \\"belly\\" to carry fuel and cargo, a longer nose, and a refined tail. Since the airplane was not as directionally stable as before, the plane featured a ventral fin, located on the underside of the trailing fuselage. The L-2000-7B was extended to 293 ft (89 m), utilizing a lengthened cabin and a more pronounced upward-curving tail to reduce the chance of the tail striking the runway during over-rotation. Both designs had the same maximum weight of 590,000 lb (267,600 kg), and the aerodynamic lift-to-drag ratio was increased to 8:1. Full-scale mock-ups of the Boeing 2707-200 and L-2000-7 designs were presented to the FAA, and on December 31, 1966 the Boeing design was selected. The Lockheed design was judged simpler to produce and less risky, but its performance during takeoff and at high speed was slightly lower. Because of the JTF-17A, the L-2000-7 was also predicted to be louder as well. The Boeing design was considered more advanced, representing a greater lead over the Concorde and thus more fitting to the original design mandate. Boeing eventually changed its advanced variable-geometry wing design to a simpler delta-wing similar to Lockheed's design, but with a tail. The Boeing SST was ultimately cancelled on May 20, 1971 after the US Congress stopped federal funding for the SST program on March 24, 1971.

An open system is a system that has external interactions. Such interactions can take the form of information, energy, or material transfers into or out of the system boundary, depending on the discipline which defines the concept. An open system is contrasted with the concept of an isolated system which exchanges neither energy, matter, nor information with its environment. An open system is also known as a flow system. The concept of an open system was formalized within a framework that enabled one to interrelate the theory of the organism, thermodynamics, and evolutionary theory.Luhmann, Niklas. Social Systems. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995; pp. 6-7 This concept was expanded upon with the advent of information theory and subsequently systems theory. Today the concept has its applications in the natural and social sciences. Properties of isolated, closed, and open systems in exchanging energy and matter. In the natural sciences an open system is one whose border is permeable to both energy and mass.Glossary Maxwell Demon, 1998. By contrast, a closed system is permeable to energy but not to matter. The definition of an open system assumes that there are supplies of energy that cannot be depleted; in practice, this energy is supplied from some source in the surrounding environment, which can be treated as infinite for the purposes of study. One type of open system is the radiant energy system, which receives its energy from solar radiation - an energy source that can be regarded as inexhaustible for all practical purposes. Social sciences In the social sciences an open system is a process that exchanges material, energy, people, capital and information with its environment. French/Greek philosopher Kostas Axelos argued that seeing the \\"world system\\" as inherently open (though unified) would solve many of the problems in the social sciences, including that of praxis (the relation of knowledge to practice), so that various social scientific disciplines would work together rather than create a monopoly whereby the world appears only sociological, political, historical, or psychological. Axelos argues that theorizing a closed system contributes to making it closed, and is thus a conservative approach.Axelos, K.

Looking at the crisis in accumulation, Harvey argues that phenomena such as foreign direct investment, privatization of state-owned resources, and accumulation by dispossession act as necessary outlets when capital has overaccumulated too much in private hands and cannot circulate effectively in the marketplace.

It is an internal state of a single thermodynamic system, or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable walls. In thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy, either within a system or between systems. In a system that is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, no macroscopic change occurs. Systems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual thermal, mechanical, chemical, and radiative equilibria. Systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium, though not in others. In thermodynamic equilibrium, all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely, until disturbed by a thermodynamic operation. In a macroscopic equilibrium, perfectly or almost perfectly balanced microscopic exchanges occur; this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium. A thermodynamic system in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform temperature. Its intensive properties, other than temperature, may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long- range force field imposed on it by its surroundings. In systems that are at a state of non-equilibrium there are, by contrast, net flows of matter or energy. If such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring, the system is said to be in a meta-stable equilibrium. Though not a widely named a \\"law,\\" it is an axiom of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The second law of thermodynamics states that when a body of material starts from an equilibrium state, in which, portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions, and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable and it is isolated, then it spontaneously reaches its own, new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the entropies of the portions.  Overview  Classical thermodynamics deals with states of dynamic equilibrium. The state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the one for which some thermodynamic potential is minimized, or for which the entropy (S) is maximized, for specified conditions. One such potential is the Helmholtz free energy (A), for a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and volume: :A = U - TS Another potential, the Gibbs free energy (G), is minimized at thermodynamic equilibrium in a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and pressure: :G = U - TS + PV where T denotes the absolute thermodynamic temperature, P the pressure, S the entropy, V the volume, and U the internal energy of the system. Thermodynamic equilibrium is the unique stable stationary state that is approached or eventually reached as the system interacts with its surroundings over a long time. The above-mentioned potentials are mathematically constructed to be the thermodynamic quantities that are minimized under the particular conditions in the specified surroundings.  Conditions  * For a completely isolated system, S is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium. * For a system with controlled constant temperature and volume, A is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium. * For a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure, G is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium. The various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows: *Two systems are in thermal equilibrium when their temperatures are the same. *Two systems are in mechanical equilibrium when their pressures are the same. *Two systems are in diffusive equilibrium when their chemical potentials are the same. *All forces are balanced and there is no significant external driving force. Relation of exchange equilibrium between systems Often the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regarded as another thermodynamic system. In this view, one may consider the system and its surroundings as two systems in mutual contact, with long-range forces also linking them. The enclosure of the system is the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two systems. In the thermodynamic formalism, that surface is regarded as having specific properties of permeability. For example, the surface of contiguity may be supposed to be permeable only to heat, allowing energy to transfer only as heat. Then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium when the long-range forces are unchanging in time and the transfer of energy as heat between them has slowed and eventually stopped permanently; this is an example of a contact equilibrium. Other kinds of contact equilibrium are defined by other kinds of specific permeability.M√ºnster, A. (1970), p. 49. When two systems are in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability, they have common values of the intensive variable that belongs to that particular kind of permeability. Examples of such intensive variables are temperature, pressure, chemical potential. A contact equilibrium may be regarded also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is 'permeable' only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates of transfer of energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates of transfer of volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures on either side of it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero balance of rates of transfer as work. A radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate systems. Radiative exchange equilibrium prevails when the two systems have the same temperature.Planck. M. (1914), p. 40. Thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium of a system A collection of matter may be entirely isolated from its surroundings. If it has been left undisturbed for an indefinitely long time, classical thermodynamics postulates that it is in a state in which no changes occur within it, and there are no flows within it. This is a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium.Haase, R. (1971), p. 4.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 26. (This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the \\"minus first\\" law of thermodynamics. One textbookUhlenbeck, G.E., Ford, G.W. (1963), p. 5. calls it the \\"zeroth law\\", remarking that the authors think this more befitting that title than its more customary definition, which apparently was suggested by Fowler.) Such states are a principal concern in what is known as classical or equilibrium thermodynamics, for they are the only states of the system that are regarded as well defined in that subject. A system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a thermodynamic operation be isolated, and upon the event of isolation, no change occurs in it. A system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regarded as being in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Multiple contact equilibrium The thermodynamic formalism allows that a system may have contact with several other systems at once, which may or may not also have mutual contact, the contacts having respectively different permeabilities. If these systems are all jointly isolated from the rest of the world those of them that are in contact then reach respective contact equilibria with one another. If several systems are free of adiabatic walls between each other, but are jointly isolated from the rest of the world, then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium, and they have a common temperature, a total internal energy, and a total entropy.Carath√©odory, C. (1909).Prigogine, I. (1947), p. 48.Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 128‚Äì142.Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108. Amongst intensive variables, this is a unique property of temperature. It holds even in the presence of long-range forces. (That is, there is no \\"force\\" that can maintain temperature discrepancies.) For example, in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field, the pressure on the top wall is less than that on the bottom wall, but the temperature is the same everywhere. A thermodynamic operation may occur as an event restricted to the walls that are within the surroundings, directly affecting neither the walls of contact of the system of interest with its surroundings, nor its interior, and occurring within a definitely limited time. For example, an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings. Consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings, the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, according to the second law of thermodynamics, the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings. Following Planck, this consequent train of events is called a natural thermodynamic process.Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967), ¬ß 1.12. It is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium, even though during the process there is transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium. A natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course. It is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static 'process' that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course, and is fictively 'reversible'. Classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium, if the main part of its course is at a finite rate, then it is considered to be natural, and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and thereby irreversible. Engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings.Levine, I.N. (1983), p. 40.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), pp. 17‚Äì18. The allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of \\"inanimate\\" agency; a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate.Thomson, W. (1851). Otherwise, a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system. It is often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystems are so much larger than the system that the process can affect the intensive variables only of the surrounding subsystems, and they are then called reservoirs for relevant intensive variables.  Local and global equilibrium  It is useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. In thermodynamics, exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by intensive parameters. As an example, temperature controls heat exchanges. Global thermodynamic equilibrium (GTE) means that those intensive parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system, while local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any point, one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point. If the description of the system requires variations in the intensive parameters that are too large, the very assumptions upon which the definitions of these intensive parameters are based will break down, and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium. For example, it takes a certain number of collisions for a particle to equilibrate to its surroundings. If the average distance it has moved during these collisions removes it from the neighborhood it is equilibrating to, it will never equilibrate, and there will be no LTE. Temperature is, by definition, proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrated neighborhood. Since there is no equilibrated neighborhood, the concept of temperature doesn't hold, and the temperature becomes undefined. It is important to note that this local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particles in the system. For example, LTE is usually applied only to massive particles. In a radiating gas, the photons being emitted and absorbed by the gas doesn't need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particles of the gas in order for LTE to exist. In some cases, it is not considered necessary for free electrons to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atoms or molecules for LTE to exist. As an example, LTE will exist in a glass of water that contains a melting ice cube. The temperature inside the glass can be defined at any point, but it is colder near the ice cube than far away from it. If energies of the molecules located near a given point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution for a certain temperature. If the energies of the molecules located near another point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution for another temperature. Local thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity. In other words, each small locality need not have a constant temperature. However, it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. A global non-equilibrium state can be stably stationary only if it is maintained by exchanges between the system and the outside. For example, a globally-stable stationary state could be maintained inside the glass of water by continuously adding finely powdered ice into it in order to compensate for the melting, and continuously draining off the meltwater. Natural transport phenomena may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium. Going back to our example, the diffusion of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium, a state in which the temperature of the glass is completely homogeneous.H.R. Griem, 2005 Reservations Careful and well informed writers about thermodynamics, in their accounts of thermodynamic equilibrium, often enough make provisos or reservations to their statements. Some writers leave such reservations merely implied or more or less unstated. For example, one widely cited writer, H. B. Callen writes in this context: \\"In actuality, few systems are in absolute and true equilibrium.\\" He refers to radioactive processes and remarks that they may take \\"cosmic times to complete, [and] generally can be ignored\\". He adds \\"In practice, the criterion for equilibrium is circular. Operationally, a system is in an equilibrium state if its properties are consistently described by thermodynamic theory!\\"Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 15. J.A. Beattie and I. Oppenheim write: \\"Insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all states of real systems.\\"Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979), p. 3. Another author, cited by Callen as giving a \\"scholarly and rigorous treatment\\",Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 485. and cited by Adkins as having written a \\"classic text\\",Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. xiii. A.B. Pippard writes in that text: \\"Given long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense, ... . The time involved may be so enormous, however, perhaps 10100 years or more, ... . For most purposes, provided the rapid change is not artificially stimulated, the systems may be regarded as being in equilibrium.\\"Pippard, A.B. (1957/1966), p. 6. Another author, A. M√ºnster, writes in this context. He observes that thermonuclear processes often occur so slowly that they can be ignored in thermodynamics. He comments: \\"The concept 'absolute equilibrium' or 'equilibrium with respect to all imaginable processes', has therefore, no physical significance.\\" He therefore states that: \\"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\\" M√ºnster, A. (1970), p. 53. According to L. Tisza: \\"... in the discussion of phenomena near absolute zero. The absolute predictions of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of frozen-in nonequilibrium states is very common.\\"Tisza, L. (1966), p. 119. Definitions The most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system is through contact with the surroundings that allows simultaneous passages of all chemical substances and all kinds of energy. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change its shape or size while doing so; thus it is defined by a rigid volume in space. It may lie within external fields of force, determined by external factors of far greater extent than the system itself, so that events within the system cannot in an appreciable amount affect the external fields of force. The system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force fields are uniform, and are determining its uniform acceleration, or if it lies in a non-uniform force field but is held stationary there by local forces, such as mechanical pressures, on its surface. Thermodynamic equilibrium is a primitive notion of the theory of thermodynamics. According to P.M. Morse: \\"It should be emphasized that the fact that there are thermodynamic states, ..., and the fact that there are thermodynamic variables which are uniquely specified by the equilibrium state ... are not conclusions deduced logically from some philosophical first principles. They are conclusions ineluctably drawn from more than two centuries of experiments.\\"Morse, P.M. (1969), p. 7. This means that thermodynamic equilibrium is not to be defined solely in terms of other theoretical concepts of thermodynamics. M. Bailyn proposes a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulates the existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 20. Textbook definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium are often stated carefully, with some reservation or other. For example, A. M√ºnster writes: \\"An isolated system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when, in the system, no changes of state are occurring at a measurable rate.\\" There are two reservations stated here; the system is isolated; any changes of state are immeasurably slow. He discusses the second proviso by giving an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst. M√ºnster points out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state is described by fewer macroscopic variables than is any other state of a given system. This is partly, but not entirely, because all flows within and through the system are zero.M√ºnster, A. (1970), p. 52. R. Haase's presentation of thermodynamics does not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intends to allow for non- equilibrium thermodynamics. He considers an arbitrary system with time invariant properties. He tests it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cutting it off from all external influences, except external force fields. If after insulation, nothing changes, he says that the system was in equilibrium.Haase, R. (1971), pp. 3‚Äì4. In a section headed \\"Thermodynamic equilibrium\\", H.B. Callen defines equilibrium states in a paragraph. He points out that they \\"are determined by intrinsic factors\\" within the system. They are \\"terminal states\\", towards which the systems evolve, over time, which may occur with \\"glacial slowness\\".Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 13. This statement does not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium, the system must be isolated; Callen does not spell out what he means by the words \\"intrinsic factors\\". Another textbook writer, C.J. Adkins, explicitly allows thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which is not isolated. His system is, however, closed with respect to transfer of matter. He writes: \\"In general, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and work-like interactions with the surroundings.\\" He distinguishes such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium, in which only thermal contact is mediating transfer of energy.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 7. Another textbook author, J.R. Partington, writes: \\"(i) An equilibrium state is one which is independent of time.\\" But, referring to systems \\"which are only apparently in equilibrium\\", he adds : \\"Such systems are in states of ‚Ä≥false equilibrium.‚Ä≥\\" Partington's statement does not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system. Like M√ºnster, Partington also refers to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. He adds a proviso that \\"In a true equilibrium state, the smallest change of any external condition which influences the state will produce a small change of state ...\\"Partington, J.R. (1949), p. 161. This proviso means that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbations; this requirement is essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium. A student textbook by F.H. Crawford has a section headed \\"Thermodynamic Equilibrium\\". It distinguishes several drivers of flows, and then says: \\"These are examples of the apparently universal tendency of isolated systems toward a state of complete mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical‚Äîor, in a single word, thermodynamic‚Äîequilibrium.\\"Crawford, F.H. (1963), p. 5. A monograph on classical thermodynamics by H.A. Buchdahl considers the \\"equilibrium of a thermodynamic system\\", without actually writing the phrase \\"thermodynamic equilibrium\\". Referring to systems closed to exchange of matter, Buchdahl writes: \\"If a system is in a terminal condition which is properly static, it will be said to be in equilibrium.\\"Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 8. Buchdahl's monograph also discusses amorphous glass, for the purposes of thermodynamic description. It states: \\"More precisely, the glass may be regarded as being in equilibrium so long as experimental tests show that 'slow' transitions are in effect reversible.\\"Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 111. It is not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium, but the converse is usually assumed: that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is subject to a sufficiently slow process, that process may be considered to be sufficiently nearly reversible, and the body remains sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 8. A. M√ºnster carefully extends his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated systems by introducing a concept of contact equilibrium. This specifies particular processes that are allowed when considering thermodynamic equilibrium for non-isolated systems, with special concern for open systems, which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings. A contact equilibrium is between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings, brought into contact with the system of interest, the contact being through a special kind of wall; for the rest, the whole joint system is isolated. Walls of this special kind were also considered by C. Carath√©odory, and are mentioned by other writers also. They are selectively permeable. They may be permeable only to mechanical work, or only to heat, or only to some particular chemical substance. Each contact equilibrium defines an intensive parameter; for example, a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature. A contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest. In a contact equilibrium, despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall, the system of interest is changeless, as if it were in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium. This scheme follows the general rule that \\"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\\" Thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system means that, with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall, contact equilibrium exists when the respective intensive parameters of the system and surroundings are equal. This definition does not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is through unselective contacts. This definition does not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundaries; but it is compatible with the following definition, which does so state. M. Zemansky also distinguishes mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium. He then writes: \\"When the conditions for all three types of equilibrium are satisfied, the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium\\".Zemansky, M. (1937/1968), p. 27. P.M. Morse writes that thermodynamics is concerned with \\"states of thermodynamic equilibrium\\". He also uses the phrase \\"thermal equilibrium\\" while discussing transfer of energy as heat between a body and a heat reservoir in its surroundings, though not explicitly defining a special term 'thermal equilibrium'.Morse, P.M. (1969), pp. 6, 37. J.R. Waldram writes of \\"a definite thermodynamic state\\". He defines the term \\"thermal equilibrium\\" for a system \\"when its observables have ceased to change over time\\". But shortly below that definition he writes of a piece of glass that has not yet reached its \\"full thermodynamic equilibrium state\\".Waldram, J.R. (1985), p. 5. Considering equilibrium states, M. Bailyn writes: \\"Each intensive variable has its own type of equilibrium.\\" He then defines thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, and material equilibrium. Accordingly, he writes: \\"If all the intensive variables become uniform, thermodynamic equilibrium is said to exist.\\" He is not here considering the presence of an external force field.Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 21. J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium as follows: \\"A system is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium if, during the time period allotted for experimentation, (a) its intensive properties are independent of time and (b) no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings.\\" It is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems. They do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with \\"glacial slowness\\", and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation. They note that for two systems in contact, there exists a small subclass of intensive properties such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal, then all respective intensive properties are equal. States of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass, provided some other conditions are satisfied.Kirkwood, J.G., Oppenheim, I. (1961), p. 2 Characteristics of a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium =Homogeneity in the absence of external forces= A thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase in the absence of external forces, in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous. This means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. In general, a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some intensive variables. For example, a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation. =Uniform temperature= Such equilibrium inhomogeneity, induced by external forces, does not occur for the intensive variable temperature. According to E.A. Guggenheim, \\"The most important conception of thermodynamics is temperature.\\"Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967), p.5. Planck introduces his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium, and then announces: \\"In the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous, isotropic bodies of any form, possessing throughout their substance the same temperature and density, and subject to a uniform pressure acting everywhere perpendicular to the surface.\\"Planck, M. (1897/1927), p.3. As did Carath√©odory, Planck was setting aside surface effects and external fields and anisotropic crystals. Though referring to temperature, Planck did not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, Carath√©odory's scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed systems postulates the concept of an \\"equilibrium state\\" following Gibbs (Gibbs speaks routinely of a \\"thermodynamic state\\"), though not explicitly using the phrase 'thermodynamic equilibrium', nor explicitly postulating the existence of a temperature to define it. The temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is uniform in space as well as in time. In a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, there are no net internal macroscopic flows. In particular, this means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform. This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers.Gibbs, J.W. (1876/1878), pp. 144-150.ter Haar, D., Wergeland, H. (1966), pp. 127‚Äì130.M√ºnster, A. (1970), pp. 309‚Äì310.Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 254-256. Considerations of kinetic theory or statistical mechanics also support this statement.Maxwell, J.C. (1867).Boltzmann, L. (1896/1964), p. 143.Chapman, S., Cowling, T.G. (1939/1970), Section 4.14, pp. 75‚Äì78.Partington, J.R. (1949), pp. 275‚Äì278. In order that a system may be in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium, it is of course necessary, but not sufficient, that it be in its own internal state of thermal equilibrium; it is possible for a system to reach internal mechanical equilibrium before it reaches internal thermal equilibrium. =Number of real variables needed for specification= In his exposition of his scheme of closed system equilibrium thermodynamics, C. Carath√©odory initially postulates that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variables define the states that are the points of the manifold of equilibria. In the words of Prigogine and Defay (1945): \\"It is a matter of experience that when we have specified a certain number of macroscopic properties of a system, then all the other properties are fixed.\\"Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954), p. 1.Silbey, R.J., Alberty, R.A., Bawendi, M.G. (1955/2005), p. 4. As noted above, according to A. M√ºnster, the number of variables needed to define a thermodynamic equilibrium is the least for any state of a given isolated system. As noted above, J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by a special subclass of intensive variables, with a definite number of members in that subclass. If the thermodynamic equilibrium lies in an external force field, it is only the temperature that can in general be expected to be spatially uniform. Intensive variables other than temperature will in general be non-uniform if the external force field is non-zero. In such a case, in general, additional variables are needed to describe the spatial non- uniformity. =Stability against small perturbations= As noted above, J.R. Partington points out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is stable against small transient perturbations. Without this condition, in general, experiments intended to study systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are in severe difficulties. =Approach to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated system= When a body of material starts from a non-equilibrium state of inhomogeneity or chemical non-equilibrium, and is then isolated, it spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. It is not necessary that all aspects of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reached simultaneously; some can be established before others. For example, in many cases of such evolution, internal mechanical equilibrium is established much more rapidly than the other aspects of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium.Fitts, D.D. (1962), p. 43. Another example is that, in many cases of such evolution, thermal equilibrium is reached much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium.Denbigh, K.G. (1951), p. 42. =Fluctuations within an isolated system in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium= In an isolated system, thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time. In classical physics it is often convenient to ignore the effects of measurement and this is assumed in the present account. To consider the notion of fluctuations in an isolated thermodynamic system, a convenient example is a system specified by its extensive state variables, internal energy, volume, and mass composition. By definition they are time- invariant. By definition, they combine with time-invariant nominal values of their conjugate intensive functions of state, inverse temperature, pressure divided by temperature, and the chemical potentials divided by temperature, so as to exactly obey the laws of thermodynamics.Tschoegl, N.W. (2000). Fundamentals of Equilibrium and Steady-State Thermodynamics, Elsevier, Amsterdam, , p. 21. But the laws of thermodynamics, combined with the values of the specifying extensive variables of state, are not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal values. Further information is needed, namely, of the constitutive properties of the system. It may be admitted that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive functions of state, they are found to have slightly different values from time to time. Such variability is regarded as due to internal fluctuations. The different measured values average to their nominal values. If the system is truly macroscopic as postulated by classical thermodynamics, then the fluctuations are too small to detect macroscopically. This is called the thermodynamic limit. In effect, the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanished from sight, too small to see. According to Buchdahl: \\"... there is no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuations about equilibrium (see, however, Section 76).\\"Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 16. If the system is repeatedly subdivided, eventually a system is produced that is small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuations. This is a mesoscopic level of investigation. The fluctuations are then directly dependent on the natures of the various walls of the system. The precise choice of independent state variables is then important. At this stage, statistical features of the laws of thermodynamics become apparent. If the mesoscopic system is further repeatedly divided, eventually a microscopic system is produced. Then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the processes of fluctuation. One has left the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics, and one needs quantum statistical mechanics. The fluctuations can become relatively dominant, and questions of measurement become important. The statement that 'the system is its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium' may be taken to mean that 'indefinitely many such measurements have been taken from time to time, with no trend in time in the various measured values'. Thus the statement, that 'a system is in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with stated nominal values of its functions of state conjugate to its specifying state variables', is far far more informative than a statement that 'a set of single simultaneous measurements of those functions of state have those same values'. This is because the single measurements might have been made during a slight fluctuation, away from another set of nominal values of those conjugate intensive functions of state, that is due to unknown and different constitutive properties. A single measurement cannot tell whether that might be so, unless there is also knowledge of the nominal values that belong to the equilibrium state. = Thermal equilibrium = An explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which there are occurring several irreversible processes, entailing non-zero fluxes; the two systems are separated by a wall permeable only to heat. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then \\"it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.\\"Eu, B.C. (2002), page 13. This illustrates the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature. Thermal equilibrium is achieved when two systems in thermal contact with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy. It follows that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium, then their temperatures are the same.R. K. Pathria, 1996 Thermal equilibrium occurs when a system's macroscopic thermal observables have ceased to change with time. For example, an ideal gas whose distribution function has stabilised to a specific Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution would be in thermal equilibrium. This outcome allows a single temperature and pressure to be attributed to the whole system. For an isolated body, it is quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reached before thermal equilibrium is reached, but eventually, all aspects of equilibrium, including thermal equilibrium, are necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium.de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 44. Non-equilibrium A system's internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguished from a \\"stationary state\\" in which thermodynamic parameters are unchanging in time but the system is not isolated, so that there are, into and out of the system, non-zero macroscopic fluxes which are constant in time.de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 43. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods. Laws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are also debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the maximum entropy production principle. It states that a non-equilibrium system evolves such as to maximize its entropy production.

He belonged to an ancient Wallachian family, one of whose members had been banished in the 17th century by Prince Matei Basarab, and had settled in Moldavia. Biography Born in Ia»ôi, Catargiu rose to the office of prefect of police in the city under the rule of the Moldavian Prince Grigore Ghica (1849-1856). In 1857 he became a member of the ad hoc Divan of Moldavia, a commission elected in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1856) to vote on the proposed union of Moldavia and Wallachia (the Danubian Principalities). His strongly conservative views, especially on land reform, induced the Conservatives to support him as a candidate for the Romanian throne in 1859. LascƒÉr Catargiu - caricature by Nicolae Petrescu- GƒÉinƒÉ During the reign of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza (1859-1866), Catargiu was one of the Opposition leaders, and received much assistance from his kinsman, Barbu Catargiu (b. 1807), a noted journalist and politician, who was assassinated in Bucharest on the June 20, 1862. LascƒÉr Catargiu consequently took part in the so-called monstrous coalition that toppled Cuza, and, on the accession of Domnitor Carol I in May 1866, became President of the Council of Ministers but, finding himself unable to cooperate with his Liberal colleagues, Ion BrƒÉtianu and C. A. Rosetti, he resigned in July. After eight more ministerial changes, culminating in the anti-dynastic agitation of 1870-1871 (provoked by the Liberals in the context of the Franco-Prussian War; see also Republic of Ploie»ôti), Catargiu formed, for the first time in Romanian history, a stable Conservative cabinet, which lasted until 1876. His policy, which averted political violence and revived the popularity of the crown, was regarded as unpatriotic and reactionary by the Liberals, who resumed office in 1876; and a proposal to impeach the whole Catargiu cabinet was only withdrawn in 1878. Catargiu remained in opposition until 1889, when he formed another cabinet, taking the portfolio of the Interior; but this administration fell after seven months. In the Ion Emanuel Florescu cabinet of March 1891 he occupied the same position, and in December he again became president of the Council, retaining office until 1895. During this period he was responsible for several important reforms, chiefly financial and commercial. He died in Bucharest.

Twelve of the species which occur in Africa are found in the subcontinental region of southern Africa; of these, seven occur in varying proportions within the political boundaries of Namibia. Six southern African francolins are considered endemic to the subcontinent, of which three are found in Namibia (the Hartlaub's, red-billed and Orange River francolins. The Cape spurfowl, endemic to the Cape Province of South Africa, occurs marginally in southern Namibia. A fossil francolin, Francolinus capeki, has been described from Late Pliocene deposits of Hungary; the contemporary fossil galliforms \\"Francolinus\\" minor and \\"F.\\" subfrancolinus are now placed in Palaeocryptonyx. Taxonomy Until the early 1990s, major authorities placed all francolins in the genus Francolinus. In 1992 it was suggested that this treatment was problematic, and the francolins should be split into four genera: Francolinus for the Asian species, and the African species divided into Peliperdix, Scleroptila and Pternistis.Crowe, T.

The crested francolin and Nahan's francolin were considered possibly quite distinct, but still maintained in Peliperdix and Pternistis respectively. Based on further evidence, the crested francolin was moved to the monotypic genus Dendroperdix in 1998,Bloomer, P, & Crowe, T. M. (1998).

When split, the English name \\"francolin\\" is generally restricted to the members of the genera Francolinus, Peliperdix, Dendroperdix and Scleroptila, while the name \\"spurfowl\\" is used for Pternistis (\\"spurfowl\\" is also used for Galloperdix of the Indian subcontinent). As the Nahan's \\"francolin\\" is related to the stone partridge rather than the true francolins and spurfowl,Crowe, T. (2010).

(Abstract). its name is sometimes modified to Nahan's partridge. In addition to the major changes proposed at genus level, the species level taxonomy among several francolins/spurfowl is disputed. For example, the distribution of the Orange River francolin (F. (S.) levaillantoides) is highly disjunct, leading some authorities to split the northern taxa (from Kenya and northwards) into a separate species, the acacia/Archer's francolin (F. (S.) gutturalis, with subspecies lorti), while maintaining the southern taxa (from Angola and southwards) in the Orange River francolin. Most authorities treat the Elgon francolin (F. (S.) psilolaema elgonensis) as a subspecies of the moorland francolin, but others have suggested it is a species (F. (S.) elgonensis), a subspecies of the Shelley's francolin, or even a hybrid between the moorland and red-winged francolins. =Species= * Francolinus: ** Black francolin, Francolinus francolinus ** Painted francolin, Francolinus pictus ** Chinese francolin, Francolinus pintadeanus ** Grey francolin, Francolinus pondicerianus ** Swamp francolin, Francolinus gularis * Peliperdix: ** Coqui francolin, Peliperdix coqui ** White-throated francolin, Peliperdix albogularis ** Schlegel's francolin, Peliperdix schlegelii ** Latham's francolin, Peliperdix lathami * Dendroperdix: ** Crested francolin, Dendroperdix sephaena * Scleroptila: ** Ring-necked francolin, Scleroptila streptophorus ** Finsch's francolin, Scleroptila finschi ** Red-winged francolin, Scleroptila levaillantii ** Grey-winged francolin, Scleroptila africanus ** Moorland francolin, Scleroptila psilolaemus ** Shelley's francolin, Scleroptila shelleyi ** Orange River francolin, Scleroptila gutturalis * Pternistis (\\"Spurfowl\\"): ** Scaly spurfowl, Pternistis squamatus ** Ahanta spurfowl, Pternistis ahantensis ** Grey-striped spurfowl, Pternistis griseostriatus ** Hartlaub's spurfowl, Pternistis hartlaubi ** Double-spurred spurfowl, Pternistis bicalcaratus ** Heuglin's spurfowl, Pternistis icterorhynchus ** Clapperton's spurfowl, Pternistis clappertoni ** Harwood's spurfowl, Pternistis harwoodi ** Hildebrandt's spurfowl, Pternistis hildebrandti ** Jackson's spurfowl, Pternistis jacksoni ** Handsome spurfowl, Pternistis nobilis ** Mount Cameroon spurfowl, Pternistis camerunensis ** Swierstra's spurfowl, Pternistis swierstrai ** Chestnut-naped spurfowl, Pternistis castaneicollis ** Erckel's spurfowl, Pternistis erckelii ** Djibouti spurfowl, Pternistis ochropectus ** Red-billed spurfowl, Pternistis adspersus ** Cape spurfowl, Pternistis capensis ** Natal spurfowl, Pternistis natalensis ** Yellow-necked spurfowl, Pternistis leucoscepus ** Grey-breasted spurfowl, Pternistis rufopictus ** Red-necked spurfowl, Pternistis afer ** Swainson's spurfowl, Pternistis swainsonii  References  A Molecular Phylogeny of the Pheasants and Partridges Suggests That These Lineages Are Not Monophyletic R.

It is sometimes considered a lake rather than a bay or lagoon.DEME: Lake Maracaibo The Compass of Sigma Gamma Epsilon (1939:184)Ralph Alexander Liddle (1946:24) The Geology of Venezuela and TrinidadKenneth Knight Landes (1951:535) Petroleum Geology It is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela by Tablazo Strait, which is wide at the northern end. It is fed by numerous rivers, the largest being the Catatumbo. At it was once the largest lake in South America; the geological record shows that it was a true lake in the past, and as such is one of the oldest lakes on Earth at 20‚Äì36 million years old.Lake Profile: Maracaibo. LakeNet. Maracaibo, Lake . The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Lake Maracaibo acts as a major shipping route to the ports of Maracaibo and Cabimas. The surrounding Maracaibo Basin contains large reserves of crude oil, making the lake a major profit center for Venezuela. The basin also holds almost a quarter of Venezuela's population. A dredged channel gives oceangoing vessels access to the bay. The long General En Jefe Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, which was completed in 1962 and spans the bay's outlet, is one of the longest bridges in the world. The weather phenomenon known as the Catatumbo lightning at Lake Maracaibo regularly produces more lightning than any other place on the planet. The villages of Barranquitas and San Luis, on the lake's western shore, have the highest concentration of Huntington's disease sufferers in the world.  History  The first known settlements on the bay were those of the Guajiros, who still are present in large numbers, but were re-settled in the western boundary area with Colombia. The first European to 'discover' the bay was Alonso de Ojeda on August 24, 1499, on a voyage with Amerigo Vespucci (the same explorer for whom the American continents were named). Legend has it that upon entering the lake, Ojeda's expedition found groups of indigenous huts, built over stilts on water (Spanish: palafitos), and interconnected by boardwalks on stilts, with each other and with the lake shore. The stilt houses reminded Vespucci of the city of Venice, (, ), so he named the region \\"Venezuela,\\" meaning \\"little Venice\\" in Spanish. The suffix -uela is used as a diminutive term (e.g., plaza / plazuela, cazo / cazuela); some have argued that the suffix was also intended to be pejorative. (Examples of palafitos can still be found in \\"Santa Rosa\\", an area in the city of Maracaibo.) Battle of Lake Maracaibo in 1823 View of General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge Although the Vespucci story remains the most popular and accepted version of the origin of the country's name, a different reason for the name comes up in the account of Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew. In his work Summa de Geograf√≠a, he states that they found an indigenous population who called themselves the \\"Veneciuela,\\" which suggests that the name \\"Venezuela\\" may have evolved from the native word. The port town of Maracaibo was founded in 1529 on the western side. In July 1823, the bay was the site of the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, an important battle in the Venezuelan War of Independence. Oil production began in the surrounding basin in 1914, with wells drilled by Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, a predecessor of Royal Dutch Shell. On April 6, 1964, at 11:45 pm, the tanker Esso Maracaibo, loaded with of crude oil, suffered a major electrical failure, so that control of steering was lost. Thus it collided with pier #31 of the two-year-old General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge across the mouth of the lake. A section of the bridge roadway fell into the water with a portion coming to rest across the tanker just a few feet from the ship's superstructure. No oil spill occurred, and there were no deaths or serious injuries on the tanker. However, seven motorists and passengers in vehicles crossing the bridge were killed.  Islands  Some islands are of considerable size. They are populated with fishermen and are used for commercial and recreational purposes. The majority of the islands are located in the Almirante Padilla municipality, including: * Zapara Island * Toas Island * San Carlos Island * Isla de Providencia * Isla de Pescadores * Los P√°jaros Island * Maraca Island * San Bernardo Island * Sabaneta de Montiel Island Fishing Fisherman taking a bath in the Maracaibo lake As recently as 2000, Lake Maracaibo supported 20,000 fishermen.  Settlements  Several settlements built out on stilts over the lake ‚Äì palafitos ‚Äì still exist in the south and south-west, notably at Lagunetas.  Subsiding ground  Due to the massive volume of oil removed in the Maracaibo Basin, some oil-producing areas adjacent to Lake Maracaibo have sunk, changing the geography of the region. The original concessions to oil companies purposefully assigned swamps and wetlands along the east border of the lakes for facilities. This required the oil companies to build dikes and drain the land in order to build their facilities; Dutch Shell takes credit for some of the most enduring dike systems. Since the nationalization of the oil industry in 1976, maintenance of the dike systems has fallen upon the Venezuelan government to protect sub-sea-level areas like T√≠a Juana, Lagunillas, and Bachaquero from encroachment by the waters. Cumulative subsidence is as much as , and it continues at a rate of up to at some locations inland and typically along the coast. Due to the negligence of maintenance to the dike, many consider it to be a disaster in waiting, with the potential of an earthquake causing soil liquefaction and submerging a large population. A program of mitigative measures to address the seismic risk was begun in 1988. Ongoing maintenance and improvements to the dike will be needed, as it continues to subside by as much as .Juan Murria, \\"Subsidence Due to Oil Production in Western Venezuela: Engineering Problems and Solutions,\\" Land Subsidence (Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Land Subsidence, May 1991). IAHS Publ. no. 200, 1991.  Duckweed infestation  Green swirls on the lake are duckweed. Solid waste in the lake's coast As of June 18, 2004, a large portion (18%) of the surface of Lake Maracaibo is covered by duckweed, specifically Lemna. Although efforts to remove the plant have been underway, the plant ‚Äì which can double its size every 48 hours ‚Äì occupies over 130 million cubic meters of the lake. The only way to remove the weed is to pull it out of the lake physically ‚Äì no chemical or biological method has been found to treat the weed. The government has been spending $2 million monthly to clean the lake, and the state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. has created a $750 million cleanup fund. Current efforts are barely keeping up with the growth of the plant. The removal process has proven to be particularly difficult in the center of the lake, where a specially equipped ship may be needed to pull the weed off the lake. There is some mystery as to how the plant came to reside in the waters of Lake Maracaibo. According to scientists from the Institute for the Conservation of Lake Maracaibo (ICLAM), one of the government organizations charged with the care of Lake Maracaibo, the weed is probably native to the lake, but few studies have been conducted to confirm that suspicion. The prodigious growth of the freshwater-marine plant is likely a self-purification mechanism. Others disagree, believing the type of duckweed to be native to Florida and Texas and thus the infestation is a result of its having been transported by ship. Another point of uncertainty is why the scale of the outbreak is so great. Maracaibo is fed by both salt water from the Caribbean and fresh water from numerous rivers. The lighter fresh water floats on top of the heavier salt water, which forms a dense layer on the bottom. This set-up traps nutrients that have settled on the floor of the lake. In the spring of 2004, heavy rains disrupted the usual pattern. The sudden influx of fresh water stirred the layers, allowing nutrients to float to the top, where duckweed and other plants reside. These nutrients may have triggered the duckweed's rapid expansion. Additional sources of nutrients include untreated sewage discharge and fertilizers and other industrial waste flowing into the lake through rivers (97 percent of the country's raw sewage is discharged without treatment into the environment). Furthermore, chemicals used to clean up oil spills may have contributed to the duckweed problem. The lake basin hosts Venezuela's largest oil fields, and high concentrations of biodegradable dispersants that contain phosphates and polyaspartic acid ‚Äì a chemical used to increase nutrient uptake in crops ‚Äì have been found, a veritable feast for the plants. Scientists at ICLAM disagree, saying that dispersants have been banned from the lake for years and, even if they were present, could not contain enough nutrients to support the current duckweed population. Duckweed is not toxic to fish, but some scientists are concerned that it could suck oxygen out of the lake as it decays, asphyxiating large numbers of fish. Though officials say the weed hasn't harmed fish yet, it is putting a dent in the local fishing industry. The plant clogs the motors of small boats, making it impossible for fishers to launch their vessels. Duckweed further threatens the local ecosystem by choking out other plants as it shades large portions of the lake. In certain conditions, the weed may concentrate heavy metals and bacteria such as Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. Despite these problems, the weed may yet have some positive use; duckweed can be treated to be fed to poultry or to make paper. As of 2007, the duckweed problem continues.

During the centuries following the Roman withdrawal in 271, the population of the region was influenced by contact with the Byzantine Empire, Slavic peoples, Hungarian people, and later by the Ottoman Turks. Slavic migration into the region began in the 6th century and continued gradually through the early 19th century. A heavy Polish influence occurred during the 14‚Äì16th centuries, when the Principality of Moldova was connected to Poland by a trade route and was briefly a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland.Marcin Kosienkowski, \\"Polska a Mo≈Çdawia i Naddniestrze\\" Since the 18th century, several waves of emigration of Poles came to the land which constitutes the majority of modern Moldova. Beginning in the 19th century, a strong Western European (particularly French) influence came to be evident in literature and the arts. The resulting melting pot has produced a rich cultural tradition. Although foreign contact was an inevitable consequence of the region's geographical location, their influence only served to enhance a vital and resilient popular culture. The population of what once was the Principality of Moldavia (1359‚Äì1859) had come to identify itself widely as \\"Moldovan\\" by the 14th century, but continued to maintain close cultural links with other Romanian groups. After 1812, the eastern Moldovans, those inhabiting Bessarabia and Transnistria, were also influenced by Slavic culture during the periods of 1812‚Äì1917, and during 1940‚Äì1989 they were influenced by Russia. The geographical area that is now modern Moldova was formed under the conditions of contacts with the East Slavic population, and later under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1812, the territory of modern Moldova was liberated from Ottoman rule and incorporated into the Bessarabian province of the Russian Empire, which had a great influence on the development of the culture of the region. After the October Revolution in 1918, Romania annexed the nation for 22 years, and the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed on the left bank of the Dniester, as a result of which culture developed under a stronger Russian influence under Soviet administrative control, as well as by ethnic Russian or Russian-speaking immigration. By 1918, Bessarabia was one of the least developed, and least educated European regions of the Russian Empire. In 1930, Moldova's literacy rate was 40%, while Romania itself had a 38% literacy rate according to the 1930 Romanian census. Especially low was the literacy rate for women, less than 10% in 1918, to just under 50% in 1940. Although Soviet authorities promoted education, the region's cultural ties with Romania were slowly eroded due to administrative policies. With many ethnic Romanian intellectuals, either fleeing, being killed after 1940, or being deported both during and after World War II, Bessarabia's cultural and educational situation changed drastically and became more Russified. After the 1960s, Soviet authorities developed urban cultural and scientific institutions that were subsequently filled with Russians, and diverse ethnic groups from across the Soviet Union. Much of the urban culture came from Moscow, while the primarily rural ethnic Romanian population was allowed to express itself in folklore and folk art. Folk culture Although the folk arts flourished, similarities with Romanian culture were hidden. Music and dance, particularly encouraged by Soviet authorities, were made into a showcase, but were subtly changed to hide their Romanian origins. For example, the national folk costume, in which the traditional Romanian moccasin (opinca) was replaced by the Russian boot. Moldova's traditional folk culture is very rich. The ancient folk ballads, such as \\"Miori≈£a\\" and \\"Me≈üterul Manole\\", play a central role in this traditional culture. Folk traditions, including ceramics and weaving, continue to be practiced in rural areas. The folk culture tradition is promoted at the national level and is represented by, among other groups, the folk choir, Doina. Literary culture The first Moldovan books, religious texts, appeared in the mid-17th century. Prominent figures in Moldova's cultural development include Dosoftei, Grigore Ureche, Miron Costin, metropolitan of Kiev Petru MovilƒÉ, scholars Nicolae Milescu-Sp√£taru, Dimitrie Cantemir (1673‚Äì1723), and Ion Neculce, Gavriil BƒÉnulescu-Bodoni, Alexandru Donici, Constantin Stamati, Costache Negruzzi, historian and philologist Bogdan P. Hasdeu (1836‚Äì1907), author Ion CreangƒÉ (1837‚Äì1889), and poet Mihai Eminescu (1850‚Äì1889). Varlaam published the first books. Dosoftei founded numerous schools and published a lot. Cantemir wrote the first thorough geographical, ethnographical, and economic description of the country in Descriptio Moldaviae (Berlin, c. 1714). Modern writers include Vladimir Be≈üleagƒÉ, Nicolae Dabija, Ion Dru≈£ƒÉ, Victor TeleucƒÉ, and Grigore Vieru. In 1991, a total of 520 books were published in Moldova, of which 402 were in Romanian, 108 in Russian, eight in Gagauz, and two in Bulgarian. In the early 1990s, Moldova had twelve professional theaters. All performed in Romanian, except the A.P. Chekhov Russian Drama Theater in Chi≈üinƒÉu, and the Russian Drama and Comedy Theater in Tiraspol, both of which performed solely in Russian, and the Licurici Republic Puppet Theater, in Chi≈üinƒÉu, which performed in both Romanian and Russian.

Development Monino Museum (1998) In the late 1940s, the Soviet Union was strongly committed to matching the United States in strategic bombing capability. The Soviets' only long-range bomber at the time was Tupolev's Tu-4 'Bull', a reverse-engineered copy of the American B-29 Superfortress. The development of the notably powerful Mikulin AM-3 turbojet led to the possibility of a large, jet-powered bomber. The Tupolev design bureau began work on the Tu-88 (\\"Aircraft N\\") prototypes in 1950. The Tu-88 first flew on 27 April 1952. After winning a competition against the Ilyushin Il-46, it was approved for production in December 1952. The first production bombers entered service with Frontal Aviation in 1954, receiving the service designation Tu-16. It received the NATO reporting name Badger-A.

These very large weapons were aerodynamically similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter, fitted with either a nuclear or conventional warhead, having a range of about .

A total of 1,507 aircraft were constructed in three plants in the Soviet Union, in 1954‚Äì1962. A civilian adaptation, the Tupolev Tu-104, saw passenger service with Aeroflot. The Tu-16 was also exported to Indonesia, Egypt, and Iraq. It continued to be used by the Air Forces and naval aviation of the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia, until 1993. Delivery of the Tu-16 to China began in 1958, and the Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC) license-produced the aircraft under the Chinese designation Xian H-6. At least 120 of these aircraft remain in service. On 14 May 1965, one of the PLAAF Tu-16 bombers carried out the first airborne nuclear weapon test inside China. Variants Among the main production variants of the Badger were the Tu-16 and Tu-16A bombers and Tu-16KS and Tu-16K-10 missile carriers, Tu-16SPS, \\"Elka\\", and Tu-16Ye ECM aircraft, Tu-16R reconnaissance aircraft, and Tu-16T torpedo bombers; others were produced from conversions. Individual aircraft could be modified several times, with designations changed, especially concerning missile-carrying aircraft. * \\"Aircraft 88\\" - Initial prototype. * \\"Aircraft 97\\" - Twin-engined long-range bomber development project of Tu-16 with two RD-5 engines. * \\"Aircraft 103\\" - Supersonic bomber development project of Tu-16 with four VD-7 AM-13 engines. * Badger A (Tu-16) ‚Äì This is the basic configuration of the Tu-16 bomber deployed in 1954 to replace the Tu-4. Several modified models of this variant existed, all of which were known as Badger A in the West. ** Tu-16A ‚Äì Modified Tu-16s designed to carry nuclear bombs, one of main versions, with 453 built. Many of these were subsequently converted into other variants. ** Tu-16Z ‚Äì An early specialized version of the Tu-16 that served as airborne tankers (a refuelling method: wing-to-wing), though retaining their medium bomber role. ** Tu-16G (Tu-104G) ‚Äì Fast air mail model, Aeroflot aircrew training version. ** Tu-16N ‚Äì A dedicated tanker version for Tu-22/Tu-22M bombers, with probe and drogue system. Entered service in 1963. Similar aircraft Tu-16NN converted from Tu-16Z. ** Tu-16T ‚Äì Limited production maritime strike version (torpedo bomber), that served in the Soviet Naval Aviation, and carried torpedoes, mines and depth charges. 76 built and some more converted. All units subsequently converted into Tu-16S configuration. ** Tu-16S ‚Äì A lifeboat carrier version used for search and rescue operations. ** Tu-16Ye ‚Äì These were equipped with heavy electronic warfare and electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment. * Badger B (Tu-16KS) ‚Äì Variant designed as a launch platform for two AS-1 Kennel/KS-1 Komet missiles. 107 built in 1954‚Äì1958, served with the Soviet Naval Aviation, Egypt and Indonesia. Soviet ones later converted with newer missiles. Tu-16K-10-26 Badger C * Badger C (Tu-16K-10) ‚Äì Another Naval Aviation variant, units of this version carried a single AS-2 Kipper/K-10S anti-ship missile. 216 built in 1958‚Äì1963. It differed from other variants in having a radar in a nose. A further development, the Tu-16K-10-26, carried a single K-10S and two KSR-2 or KSR-5 AS-6 Kingfish missiles (K-26 missile complex). Some were later converted into ELINT platforms. * Badger D (Tu-16RM-1) ‚Äì Maritime reconnaissance model with ELINT equipment; 23 converted from Tu-16K-10. It retained its radar in a nose and could guide K-10S missiles, fired from other planes, at targets. * Badger E (Tu-16R) ‚Äì Reconnaissance version of the airframe, with ELINT equipment, first of all meant for maritime reconnaissance. It could guide KS missiles. ** Tu-16RM-2 ‚Äì modified Tu-16R, serving in the Naval Aviation. It could guide KSR-2 missiles. ** Tu-16KRM ‚Äì Launch platforms for target drones (a variant of Tu-16K-26). * Badger F (Tu-16RM-2) ‚Äì Another reconnaissance version based on the ‚àí16R/RM but with the addition of external ELINT equipment. Tu-16 Badger G with KSR-5 missile * Badger G (Tu-16K/Tu-16KSR) ‚Äì Serving in the Naval Aviation, these were conversions from earlier models. These were designed to carry bombs in internal bays in addition to carrying air-to-surface missiles externally, such as the AS-5 Kelt and AS-6 Kingfish. There existed numerous variants, designated either from carried missile complex (K-11, K-16 and K-26) or from missiles of these complexes (KSR-11, KSR-2 and KSR-5). Following further modifications, they were also given suffixes. Main variants: **Tu-16KSR-2 ‚Äì carrying the K-16 complex (two KSR-2 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft, converted from other variants, were designated Tu-16K-16. **Tu-16K-11-16 ‚Äì carrying the K-16 complex (KSR-2 missiles) or the K-11 complex (two anti-radar KSR-11 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-11. Over 440 Tu-16 could carry the K-16 or K-11 complex. Tu-16K-26 or Tu-16KSR-2-11-16, with KSR-5 missiles under wings (1998) **Tu-16K-26 ‚Äì carrying the K-26 complex (two KSR-5 missiles), retaining a capability of KSR-2 and 11 missiles. Used from 1969. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-5-11 or Tu-16KSR-2-5 (no KSR-11 capability). Over 240 Tu-16 could carry the K-26 complex. **Tu-16K-26P ‚Äì carrying the K-26P missiles (two anti-radar KSR-5P missiles, as well as KSR-5, 2 or 11). * Badger H (Tu-16 Elka) ‚Äì Designed for stand-off electronic warfare and electronic counter- measures support. * Badger J (Tu-16P Buket) ‚Äì Another electronic warfare variant configured as an ECM strike escort. * Badger K (Tu-16Ye) ‚Äì Believed to be a version of the Badger F configuration possessing enhanced ELINT capability. * Badger L (Tu-16P) ‚Äì Another version of the Badger J with more modern systems and used in ELINT role. * \\"Aircraft 90\\" - Turboprop-powered project. * Tu-104 - Civilian airliner version.

The General Police Inspectorate () is a state institution subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, that regulates law enforcement in Moldova. The current Chief of the General Police Inspectorate is currently Vadim Cojocaru.http://politia.md/ro/content/cojocaru-vadim  History  The IGP was established as the Police of the Republic of Moldova on 13 September 1990, after the Government of Moldova adopted resolution no. 321 \\"On the reform of the bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moldovan SSR\\", which provided for the creation of the police and district police stations. Thus, the place of the Soviet-era militia was occupied by the new police. On 18 December 1990, the Parliament of Moldova adopted the Law on police. In 1995 the national police of Moldova were under the direction of the Ministry of Interior. Internal troops were reported to have 2,500 men, and the numbers of riot police were put at 900. The scope and quality of Moldova's state security apparatus were difficult to determine. Like the armed forces, local assets of the former Moldavian KGB were transferred to the new government along with those personnel who wished to enter the service of the new government. These elements functioned at the time under the republic's Ministry of National Security before being transferred to the MAI. On 27 December 2012, a law which entered into force on 5 March 2013 established the General Police Inspectorate under the MAI.Buletin informativ IGP ‚Äì edi»õie specialƒÉ On 24 April 2013, the new police uniform was approved.

Organization  A Moldovan policeman. As a law enforcement body of state power, the police of the Republic of Moldova are divided into state and municipal. State police perform their duties throughout the republic, municipal - in the territory of the corresponding administrative unit. State and municipal police carry out their tasks in close cooperation. The State Police provides the municipal police with methodological and advisory assistance, as well as assists in the implementation of the duties assigned to it by their own forces and means. The municipal police assist the state police in carrying out operational investigative measures, timely inform them of the persons and facts of interest to them. –£—á–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–ª—è –¥–æ—É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä—É –ë–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞–∫ –û–°–ù–û–í–´ –ì–û–°–£–î–ê–†–°–¢–í–ê –ò –ü–†–ê–í–ê –†–ï–°–ü–£–ë–õ–ò–ö–ò –ú–û–õ–î–û–í–ê –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω—ç—É ¬´≈ûtiin≈£a¬ª 1998 Institutions under the PGI are:http://politia.md/ro/content/inspectoratul- general-al-politieihttp://politia.md/sites/default/files/organigrama_igp_0.pdf *National Inspectorate of Investigations *National Patrol Inspectorate *Police Department of Chisinau Municipality *General Directorate of Criminal Investigation *Special Target Brigade \\"Fulger\\" *Chinologic Center *Technical- forensic center and judicial expertise *Center for International Police Cooperation (Interpol) *Judicial Police *Procurement and Logistics Service *Directorate of Inspection *General Directorate for Public Security *42 police inspectorates at district level  Uniform  The IGP has a summer outfit, a spring-autumn outfit and a winter outfit.

Crime in Moldova, as everywhere in former Soviet republics, has risen in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, although in recent years there has been an improvement. Corruption in Moldova, economic and drug-related crimes are the most visible and predictable results of the deteriorating economic situation. Racketeering and mafia has also risen up during the 90s and 2000s. Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and street thefts, are also common.  Crime by type  = Corruption = Corruption in Moldova is one of the country's most serious problems. In 2014, $1bn has vanished from three of Moldova's leading banks. = Murder = In 2014, Moldova had a murder rate of 3.19 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 130 murders in Moldova in 2014. = Drug trade = Illicit cultivation of opium poppies and cannabis is carried out in Moldova, mainly for consumption in CIS countries. According to NATO, drug trafficking in Moldova is valued between $200 million to $250 million per year. Moldova is a transshipment point for illegal drugs to Western Europe. =Human trafficking= The CIA names human trafficking, widespread crime and underground economic activity among major crime issues of Moldova. Moldova is a source and transit nation in the trafficking in human beings, in particular women and girls into forced prostitution. The annual country human rights report from the United States Department of State pinpoints some involvement by government officials and Moldovan law enforcement in human trafficking. According to the United States Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report of 2018:United States Department of State > \\"The Government of Moldova does not fully meet the minimum standards for the > elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do > so.

Along with the courts and procuratorates, the country's judicial and public security agencies include the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security, with their descending hierarchy of departments, bureaus, subbureaus, and stations Hong Kong and Macau have separate law enforcement agencies and work together with mainland agencies to deal with crime between them.  Overview  The national security system is made up of the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security, the People's Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and the state judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems. The Ministry of Public Security oversees all domestic police activity in China. The ministry is responsible for police operations and detention centers and has dedicated departments for internal political, economic, and communications security. Its lowest organizational units are public security stations, which maintain close day- to-day contact with the public. The People's Armed Police Force, with its 1.5 million personnel, is organized into 45 divisions. These include security police, border defense personnel, guards for government buildings and embassies, and police communications specialists. The Ministry of State Security was established in 1983 to ensure \\"the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China's socialist system.\\" The ministry is guided by a series of laws enacted in 1993, 1994, and 1997 that replaced the \\"counterrevolutionary\\" crime statutes. The ministry's operations include intelligence collection, both domestic and foreign. Authorities have used arrests on charges of revealing state secrets, subversion, and common crimes to suppress political dissent and social advocacy. The Ministry of Justice oversee the operation of prisons. The Security Bureau is the local security department for Hong Kong. The paramilitary Hong Kong Police Force was established in 1844 and has 27,375 uniformed personnel and 4,885 civilian staff. Hong Kong Correctional Service was established in 1879 and has 6,659 uniformed personnel and civilian staff. Both services report to the Security Bureau. Secretariat for Security (Macau) is the local security department in Macau. Macau Security Force (established in 1999 by the merger of the Judiciary Police Unitary Police Service, Macau Prisons) is a force of 3,700 personnel and reports to the local Security department. = Judicial and legal system = In 2004 the National People's Congress (NPC) amended the constitution so that for the first time the protection of the individual was incorporated as a constitutional requirement. Specifically, Articles 37 and 38 recognize the \\"freedom of the person\\" and the \\"personal dignity of citizens\\" as \\"inviolable.\\"Constitution of China In practice, however, those amendments have been widely ignored. Although the 1997 Criminal Procedure Law allows the police to detain a person for up to 37 days before release or formal arrest, more vigorous court reviews have led to the release of thousands of unlawfully detained individuals. However, although the law stipulates that the authorities must notify a detainee's family or work unit of the detention within 24 hours, in practice timely notification is often disregarded, especially in sensitive political cases. Police sometimes hold individuals without granting access to family members or lawyers, and their trials are sometimes conducted in secret. Detained criminal suspects, defendants, their legal representatives, and close relatives are entitled to apply for bail, but, in practice, few suspects are released pending trial. There used to be a reeducation-through-labor system that allows nonjudicial panels of police and local civil authorities to sentence individuals to up to three years in prison-like facilities, which practice was abolished in 2013. Citizens have a constitutional guarantee of the right to use their own spoken and written language in court proceedings. Courts and procuratorates are advised by the constitution that they \\"should provide translations for any party to the court proceedings who is not familiar with the spoken or written languages in common use in the locality.\\" The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but the courts are subjected to party and government policy guidance that influences the outcome of verdicts and sentences. Conviction rates in criminal cases in the early 2000s were approximately 90 percent, and trials generally were little more than sentencing hearings. Although most suspects in criminal cases are legally guaranteed the right to counsel, they often meet their appointed attorney only once before the hearing; at best, a defense attorney can obtain a reduction of the sentence. In many politically sensitive trials, rarely lasting more than several hours, the courts hand down guilty verdicts immediately following proceedings, and death sentences are often implemented within days of the rejection of an appeal. The legal system in Hong Kong is based in English Common law and remains unchanged for at least 50 years from 1997. The legal system in Macau is based in Portuguese legal system, as well as some aspects of German law, Chinese law, Italian law, and some English common law. Like Hong Kong, the Macau's legal structure will remain as is for at least 50 years from 1999. Both SARs have separate judicial systems, but the National People's Congress (NPC) is still the highest legal organ.  Important organizations and role  = Ministry of Public Security = The Ministry of Public Security is the principal police authority. The ministry has functional departments for areas such as internal security, intelligence, counter-terrorism, police operations, prisons, and political, economic, and communications security. Subordinate to the ministry are provincial-level public security departments; public security bureaus and subbureaus at the county level (the bureaus located in the prefectures and large cities, the subbureaus in counties and municipal districts); and public security stations at the township level. While public security considerations has a strong influence at all levels of administration, the police appear to wield progressively greater influence at the lower levels of government. The organization of local public security stations can be inferred from the tasks with which the police are charged. Generally, each station has sections for population control, pre-trial investigations, welfare, traffic control, a detention center, and other activities. The public security station - the police element in closest contact with the people - is supervised by the public security subbureau as well as by local governments and procuratorates. The procuratorate assumes direct responsibility for handling any case it chooses, and it supervises investigations in those cases it allows the public security station to conduct. A great deal of coordination occurs among the public security organs, the procuratorates, and the courts, so that a trial is unlikely to produce a surprise outcome. The public security station generally has considerably broader responsibilities than a police station in the other countries, involving itself in every aspect of the district people's lives. In a rural area it has a chief, a deputy chief, a small administrative staff, and a small police force. In an urban area it has a greater number of administrative staff members and seven to eighteen patrolmen. Its criminal law activities includes investigation, apprehension, interrogation, and temporary detention. The station's household section maintains a registry of all persons living in the area. Births, deaths, marriages, and divorces are recorded and confirmed through household checks. The station regulates all hotels and requires visitors who remain beyond a certain number of days to register. It also regulates the possession, transportation, and use of all explosives, guns, ammunition, and poisons. Another important police function is controlling change of residence. Without such controls, larger numbers of rural residents undoubtedly would move to the overcrowded cities in search of better living standards, work, or education (see Urbanization in China). In April 1984 the State Council issued the \\"Tentative Regulations Governing People's Republic of China Resident Identity\\". The regulations, to be implemented over a period of years, required all residents over sixteen years of age, except active-duty members of the PLA and the People's Armed Police and inmates serving sentences, to be issued resident identity cards by the Ministry of Public Security. The picture cards indicated the name, sex, nationality, date of birth, and address of the bearer. Special police operations employed agents, informers, and spies. Informers are used in surveillance of suspected criminals. The criminal laws in force after January 1, 1980, restricted police powers regarding arrests, investigations, and searches. A public security official or a citizen could apprehend a suspect under emergency conditions, but a court or procuratorate was required to approve the arrest. The accused had to be questioned within twenty-four hours and his or her family notified of the detention \\"except in circumstances where notification would hinder the investigation or there was no way to notify them.\\" Any premeditated arrest required a court or procuratorate warrant. The time that an accused could be held pending investigation was limited to three to seven days, and incarceration without due process is illegal. Two officials were needed to conduct a criminal investigation. They were required to show identification and to inform the accused of the crime allegedly committed before he or she was questioned. The suspect could refuse to answer only those questions irrelevant to the case. The 1980 laws also provided that in conjunction with an arrest the police could conduct an emergency search; otherwise, a warrant was required. They had the right to search the person, property, and residence of an accused and the person of any injured party. They could intercept mail belonging to the accused and order an autopsy whenever cause of death was unclear. In July 1980 the government approved new regulations governing police use of weapons and force. Police personnel could use their batons only in self-defense or when necessary to subdue or prevent the escape of violent criminals or rioters. Lethal weapons, such as pistols, could be used if necessary to stop violent riots, to lessen the overall loss of life, or to subdue surrounded but still resisting criminals. The regulations also governed use of sirens, police lights, and whistles. The relationship between the police officers assigned to neighborhood patrols and the people is close. Police officers live in a neighborhood on a long-term assignment and are expected to know all the residents personally. Their task is not only to prevent and punish crime but to promote desirable behavior by counseling and acting as role models. This positive side of the police officer's duties was a constant responsibility, and the bond between the public security units and the people are strengthened annually by means of \\"cherish-the-people\\" months, during which the police officer makes a special effort to be of help, especially to the aged and the infirm. = People's Armed Police = A People's Armed Police squad in the Forbidden City, Beijing. The People's Armed Police (PAP) is a Gendarmerie paramilitary police force under the authority of the Ministry of Public Security and Central Military Commission. After a trial period in selected jurisdictions, it was officially established at the national level in 1983. In line with the general policy of reducing the size of the armed forces and transferring responsibilities to the civilian sector, the newly established force was formed from internal security units reassigned from the PLA to the Ministry of Public Security and from border defense (customs) and fire-fighting units. In 1985 the PAP consisted of approximately 600,000 volunteers and conscripts. With a headquarters at the national level and division-level provincial units, regimental-level detachments, and battalion-level brigades, it retained its military organization. Current strength of PAP is 1.5 million. PAP units are responsible for guarding party and state organizations and foreign embassies and consulates, as well as for responding to emergencies and maintaining law and order. Border defense units performed standard customs duties, such as inspecting vehicles and ships entering and leaving the country, and maintained surveillance against smugglers and drug traffickers. PAP firefighting units were responsible for fire-prevention education as well as for fighting fires. PAP units at every level worked in close cooperation with the armed forces and other public security organizations. = Inspection officers = Cities in China often have uniformed, but unarmed inspection officers under the command of each municipalities' \\"Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau\\". More commonly known as \\"Chengguan\\" (, \\"city administration\\"), the Chinese abbreviation of the term. They are usual civil servants acting as parapolice and do not enjoy Police's rights and privileges. The agency is in charge with enforcement of urban management of the city. This includes local bylaws, city appearance bylaws, environment, sanitation, work safety, pollution control, health, and can involve enforcement in planning, greening, industry and commerce, environment protection, municipal affairs and water in large cities. However, since the establishment of the Chengguan in 2001/2002, there have been numerous cases of Chengguan in cities across China using excessive violence and abuse of power. In fact, there have been several incidents involving the Chengguan seriously wounding innocents and even beating people to death in public. These tragedies have given the Chengguan a notorious reputation and the agency is generally disliked and loathed by the Chinese people. In recent years efforts have been made to ameliorate the tense relation between the Chengguan and the general public, with mixed results.  Police vehicles  Police cars in the mainland are white with a dark blue swoosh painted on the side such as BYD e6. China does not have a uniform fleet buying program so local departments typically buy from a variety of local dealerships. Volkswagen Santanas and Volkswagen Passats are the most common but other makes and models are present as well.

Historical background  However much the public security system may have been influenced by communist ideology and practice, it remained rooted directly in the traditional Chinese concept of governmental control through imposed collective responsibility. Even in the pre-imperial era, a system was proposed to organize the people into \\"groups of families which would be mutually responsible for each other's good behavior and share each other's punishments.\\" The Qin (221-207 BCE) and Han (206 BCE-CE 220) dynasties made use of the concept, and the Song dynasty (960-1279) institutionalized it on a nationwide basis in the bao jia (tithing) system. It entailed the organization of family households into groups of ten, each unit being organized successively into a larger unit up to the county level of administration. Each family sent a representative to the monthly meeting of its unit, and each unit elected a leader to represent it at the next higher level. Since the head of each unit was responsible to the next higher level for the conduct of all members of his unit, the system served as an extension of the central government. Eventually, each group of families also was required to furnish men to serve in the militia. Bao jia, which alternately flourished or languished under later rulers and usually existed more in theory than in practice, was reinstituted during the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). During the Qing period, the people's aversion to legalistic procedures and the rulers' preferences for socially and collectively imposed sanctions continued. Technically, the magistrate was to hear even minor criminal cases; but local elders and village leaders were allowed to handle most disputes, freeing the magistrate for more important work and saving the government expense. The people preferred to handle matters in this way, outside the intimidating court system. Other practices for maintaining public order in China during the imperial era included the formation of mutual aid groups of farm households, which over time came to assume police functions. In a manner similar to twentieth-century means of ideological control, the Qing bureaucracy organized mass lectures that stressed the Confucian principle of obedience. Still another traditional form of policing was the appointment of censors to investigate corruption and misconduct up to the highest levels of government. Doing that job too well cost many censors their lives. In 1932 Chiang Kai- shek's Kuomintang (KMT) government reinstituted the bao jia system. In the KMT's revised bao jia system, in addition to the chief, there were two officers of importance within each 100-family unit. The population officer maintained the records and reported all births, deaths, marriages, moves, and unlawful activities to the district office. The bao jia troop commander headed a self-defense unit and was responsible for maintaining law and order. In rural China, however, the local village was generally a self-contained world, and the peasants remained aloof from distant and higher-ranking centers of authority. The Japanese were introduced to the bao jia system on Taiwan when they assumed control of the island after the Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95), and they found the system highly suitable for administering occupied areas. They instituted modified versions of it in north China after 1937. The Japanese imposed severe restrictions on the population, and the system aided in taking the census, restricting movement, and conducting spot checks. Each household had to affix a wooden tablet on the front door with the names of all inhabitants inscribed. Anyone missing or not on the list during an inspection by Japanese troops was assumed to be an insurgent. Since there were not as many Japanese troops in south China as in the north, the local leaders assisted the Japanese in administering the areas. They also disseminated propaganda at neighborhood meetings and established self-defense and youth corps. The Communists were themselves products of Chinese society, and when they came to power in 1949 they liberally borrowed from these historical examples. They extensively organized the population and maintained the principles of mutual surveillance and mutual responsibility. They also retained the concept of self-defense forces. Communist control, however, exceeded that of bao jia or any other traditional system and extended into virtually every household. Under communist rule, the family was not considered an effective control mechanism. To achieve near-total control, a large number of administrative agencies and social organizations were established or adapted. Police forces resembling the Soviet police in organization, power, and activities were organized with the aid of Soviet advisers. From 1949 to 1953, the newly established government of the People's Republic made use of the PLA, militia units made up of demobilized soldiers and other civilians, the police, and loyal citizens to put down resistance and establish order. Remnants of the Republic of China Armed Forces remained in pockets on the mainland, and communist efforts to enforce tax laws and agricultural rules provoked disturbances and riots. Extending responsibility for public order to include the police, military, and citizenry proved to be a highly effective arrangement, and the concept was written into the Common Program that preceded the 1954 state constitution. The PLA and the militia continued to share responsibility for internal security and public order under the 1954 state constitution. The PLA's involvement in internal affairs was most extensive during the more turbulent period of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76). Mao Zedong, perceiving that the public security cadres were protecting precisely the party leaders he wished to purge, directed youthful Red Guards to crush the police, courts, and procuratorates as well. The minister of public security, Luo Ruiqing (who concurrently served as the chief of Joint staff), was purged, soon followed by heads of the courts and procuratorates. Initially, the military tried to remain uninvolved. But on Mao's orders, the PLA, which had once been told to support (actually to acquiesce to) the Red Guards, moved in to quell the chaos that Mao had inspired. The PLA gradually took over public security functions by establishing military control committees to replace the government bureaucracy. Revolutionary committees were set up as provincial-level and local administrative organs, usually with a PLA cadre in charge, and order gradually returned. By the summer of 1968 the Red Guards were being disbanded, and mass trials were used to punish and intimidate rioters. With nineteen of China's twenty-nine provincial-level people's revolutionary committees headed by PLA commanders, the military again was in charge of administration and security throughout the country, but it badly needed help from experienced police officers. A policy of leniency toward most former officials evolved, and some public security cadres returned to work. The PLA also recruited inexperienced people to form auxiliary police units. These units were mass organizations with a variety of names reflecting their factional orientation. Perhaps the best known unit was the \\"Attack with Reason, Defend with Force Corps\\" named for the militant slogan of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. Public security forces were composed largely of non-professionals and lacked the disciplined informant networks and personnel dossiers previously used to maintain order. Beginning in 1968, the authorities called upon the PLA to help remove millions of urban dwellers from the overcrowded cities and relocate them to the countryside and to transport cashiered officials to special cadre schools for indoctrination and labor. The migration to the country mostly involved students and other youths for whom there were not enough jobs or places in the school system within the cities. Yet despite the discontent these campaigns caused, reported crime declined after 1970. Increased concern over the threat from the Soviet Union in the wake of armed clashes on the Sino-Soviet border in 1969 forced the PLA gradually to return to barracks, and control of the country reverted to the civilian leadership. The Beijing-based Central Security Regiment, also known as the 8341 Unit, was an important PLA law enforcement element. It was responsible over the years for the personal security of Mao Zedong and other party and state leaders. More than a bodyguard force, it also operated a nationwide intelligence network to uncover plots against Mao or any incipient threat to the leadership. The unit reportedly was deeply involved in undercover activities, discovering electronic listening devices in Mao's office and performing surveillance of his rivals. The 8341 Unit participated in the late 1976 arrest of the Gang of Four, but it reportedly was deactivated soon after that event. The militia also participated in maintaining public order in the 1970s. Their involvement was especially evident in the 1973-76 period. In 1973 the Gang of Four, concerned over the transformation of the PLA into a more professional, less political, military force, took control of the urban militia from the PLA and placed it under local party committees loyal to them. For the next three years, the urban militia was used extensively to enforce radical political and social policies. It was the urban militia, along with the public security forces, that broke up the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square honoring the memory of Zhou Enlai in April 1976 ‚Äî the event that served as the pretext for the second purge of Deng Xiaoping. At the time, in rural areas the militia was more under the control of the PLA. Public security officials also made extensive use of the authority granted them to impose administrative sanctions by two sets of documents. These were the 1957 Regulations on Reeducation Through Labor, which were reissued in 1979 with amendments, and the 1957 Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order, which were rescinded and replaced in 1986 by regulations of the same name. Offenders under the Regulations on Reeducation Through Labor might include \\"vagabonds, people who have no proper occupation, and people who repeatedly breach public order.\\" The police could apprehend such individuals and sentence them to reeducation through labor with the approval of local labor-training administration committees. The 1957 regulations placed no limit on the length of sentences, but beginning in the early 1960s three or four years was the norm. The 1979 amended regulations, however, limited the length of reeducation through labor to three years with possible extension for extraordinary cases. The Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order empowered the police to admonish, fine, or detain people for up to fifteen days. Goods illegally in the possession of an offender were to be confiscated, and payment was imposed for damages or hospital fees in the event injury had been caused. History of grass-roots organizations Neighborhood committees in the 1980s continued to be heavily involved in law enforcement and mediation of disputes at the local level. Among the enforcement procedures these committees used to influence both thought and behavior were criticism and collective responsibility. Before the reform era, aspects of Chinese society also contributed to shaping the contemporary structure for maintaining public order. During the beginning of the 1980s economic reforms, urban and rural dwellers rarely changed their residences. Amid the sprawling cities, neighborhoods remained closeknit communities. For the 80 percent of the population that lived in the countryside, home and place of work were the same. With little physical mobility, most villagers stayed put for generations and knew each other intimately. In such close-knit environments, where everyone was likely to know everyone else and noticed most of what happened, mutual surveillance and peer pressure was extremely effective. The structure of the public security system remained extensive in the 1980s, and the authority of its forces exceeded that of most police forces in the West. Nevertheless, public security agencies required and received the assistance of a wide-ranging network of grass-roots organizations to mobilize residents' responses to the government's call for observance of laws, lead the people in maintaining social order and public security, and settle disputes among residents. In urban areas an average of 11 patrolmen were responsible for controlling an area containing 15,000 or more residents. A patrolman could not know all the people and their particular problems, and therefore needed and enlisted help. The local people's governments and congresses shared responsibility for public order but had no special personnel for the task. The armed forces were available, but they had other primary concerns and would be called out only in the most extreme circumstances. To provide security beyond what could be provided by the police and to extend government control, a system of neighborhood or street committees had been established on a nationwide basis in 1954. The committees were charged with the responsibility of assisting the government in maintaining order. They usually controlled from 10,000 to 20,000 people and consisted of 3 to 7 full-time officials. In the late 1970s, the size and functions of neighborhood committees were expanded. The neighborhood committees were specifically responsible for maintaining public order and were accountable to the local people's congress. Residents' committees and residents' \\"small groups,\\" also established in 1954, were subordinate to neighborhood committees. These were the genuine grass-roots organizations, staffed by unpaid local residents elected by their neighbors. They directly involved the people in controlling their neighborhoods, and they reduced the demands on formal state institutions by maintaining surveillance for the public security forces and mediating most civil disputes and minor criminal cases for the judiciary. A residents' committee supervised from 100 to 600 families with a staff of 7 to 17 members, one from each subordinate residents' small group. A residents' small group controlled fifteen to forty households. The public security organization in the countryside was also pervasive. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, it was structured along military lines. The people's commune was the lowest level of government organization, with its administrative committee on a legal par with the local people's government in the urban areas. People's communes were subdivided into production brigades and production teams. Each team elected a people's public security committee, which sent a representative to the committee at the brigade level. Physical control was mostly the responsibility of the militia units organized at the team, brigade, and commune levels. In the winter of 1982-83 communes were replaced by township governments, and grass-roots committees were patterned after urban committees. These rural grass-roots committees were given legal status by the Draft Organic Regulations for Villagers' Committees approved by the National People's Congress in April 1987. Residents' committees and small groups were staffed originally by housewives and retired persons but involved others as their functions expanded. Their pervasive presence made them a primary means for disseminating propaganda, and their grass-roots nature allowed for effective use of peer pressure in mediating disputes and controlling troublemakers. Perhaps 4 or 5 percent of the adult population exercised some authority in what Western experts have described as \\"participatory democracy in an extended form.\\" The functional subunits, the residents' committees and residents' small groups, were particularly important in controlling the people. People's mediation committees, guided and supervised jointly by the basic people's court and the public security station, performed an important function within the residents' committees. They settled minor disputes and disagreements using conciliation and peer pressure. Mediation committees were established originally in communist areas during the Chinese Civil War (1945‚Äì49) as a natural outgrowth of traditional preferences for local mediation of disputes. Upon taking over the major cities of China in 1949, the Communists were confronted with a tremendous backlog of judicial cases. Mediation committees provided a means of resolving disputes while actively propagandizing and involving the people in the new government. Beginning in 1954 mediation committees were set up in neighborhoods, stores, schools, enterprises, factories, and workshops in the cities and in the production brigades and teams in the countryside. In the 1980s the five- to eleven-member people's mediation committees were elected by popular vote to two-year terms with the option of being reelected. Members served without pay and could be removed at any time by the electors for dereliction of duty. They were responsible for settling disputes, strengthening popular unity, promoting production and order, and conducting propaganda activities. Parties in dispute came voluntarily to the mediation committee; people seemed to feel they should try mediation before proceeding to a lawsuit. Mediators' duties ranged from acting as go-betweens for parties who refused to talk to one another to defining issues, deciding questions of fact, and issuing tentative or advisory decisions. Mediation committees also exerted strong political, economic, social, and moral pressures upon one or both parties to gain \\"voluntary\\" compliance with the decisions. In addition to mediation committees, other officials, police officers, party members, and work supervisors were expected to serve as mediators. Members of the residents' committees and small groups who were not members of the mediation committees were also involved in the mediation process.

It was designed to take advantage of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine and the swept wing, and was the first jet-powered aircraft produced by Hawker to be procured by the RAF. On 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft, achieving a speed of . The single-seat Hunter was introduced to service in 1954 as a manoeuvrable day interceptor aircraft, quickly succeeding first-generation jet fighters in RAF service such as the Gloster Meteor and the de Havilland Venom. The all-weather/night fighter role was filled by the Gloster Javelin. Successively improved variants of the type were produced, adopting increasingly more capable engine models and expanding its fuel capacity amongst other modifications being implemented. Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams: the \\"Black Arrows\\", who on one occasion looped a record-breaking 22 Hunters in formation, and later the \\"Blue Diamonds\\", who flew 16 aircraft. The Hunter was also widely exported, serving with a total of 21 overseas air forces. During the 1960s, following the introduction of the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role, the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a fighter-bomber and for aerial reconnaissance missions, using dedicated variants for these purposes. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s. Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014. The Hunter saw combat service in a range of conflicts with several operators, including the Suez Crisis, the Aden Emergency, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Second Congo War, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were manufactured by Hawker Aircraft and its successor, Hawker Siddeley, as well as being produced under licence overseas. In British service, the Hunter was replaced in its principal roles by the Lightning, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. Development =Origins= RAF Hunters of the Black Arrows performing aerobatics at Farnborough Airshow, 1960 During 1945, the Second World War came to a close and a new postwar Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, came to power in Britain.Wood 1975, p. 40. The incoming Attlee government's initial stance on defence was that no major conflict would occur for at least a decade, and thus there would be no need to develop or to procure any new aircraft until 1957. In accordance with this policy, aside from a small number of exceptions such as what would become the Hawker Sea Hawk for the Royal Navy, the majority of Specifications issued by the Air Ministry for fighter-sized aircraft during the late 1940s were restricted to research purposes.Wood 1975, pp. 40‚Äì43. Aviation author Derek Wood refers to this policy as being: \\"a fatal error of judgement which was to cost Britain a complete generation of fighters and heavy bomber aircraft\\". As the Cold War arose in the late 1940s, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings.Wood 1975, pp. 43‚Äì45. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them.Mason 1991, pp. 355‚Äì356. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.Griffin 2006, p. 15. Seeking better performance and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which was essentially a Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft.Mason 1991, pp. 368‚Äì370. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19 June 1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.Mason 1991, p. 373. =P.1067= The prototype Hunter WB188, modified to Mark 3 standard, displayed in its world speed record colours in 1976 In 1946, the British Air Ministry issued Specification F.43/46, which sought a daytime jet- powered interceptor aircraft. Camm promptly prepared a new design for a swept- winged fighter that would be powered by the upcoming Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet. The Avon's major advantage over the earlier Nene engine, as used in the earlier Sea Hawk, was adoption of the axial compressor, which allowed for a much smaller engine diameter and provided greater thrust; this single engine gave roughly the same power as the two Rolls-Royce Derwents of the Gloster Meteors, a fighter aircraft that would be replaced by the envisioned new aircraft. In March 1948, the Air Ministry issued a revised Specification F.3/48, which demanded a speed of 629 mph (1,010 km/h) at 45,000 ft (13,700 m) and a high rate of climb,Jackson 1982, p. 8. while carrying an armament of four or two 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon (rather than the large-calibre gun demanded by earlier specifications).Mason 1992, p. 368. Initially fitted with a single air intake in the nose and a T-tail, the project rapidly evolved into the more familiar Hunter shape. The intakes were moved to the wing roots to make room for weapons and radar in the nose, and a more conventional tail arrangement was devised as a result of stability concerns.Jackson 1982, p. 10. In 1950, the outbreak of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950.Wood 1975, pp. 43‚Äì46. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.Wood 1975, pp. 45‚Äì46. \\"Miss Demeanour\\" ‚Äì a privately owned Hawker Hunter F.58A, 2007 On 20 July 1951, the P.1067 made its maiden flight, flown by Neville Duke, from RAF Boscombe Down, powered by a single 6,500 lbf (28.91 kN) Avon 103 engine.Jackson 1982, p. 11. The second prototype, which was fitted with production-standard avionics, armament and a 7,550 lbf (33.58 kN) Avon 107 turbojet, first flew on 5 May 1952\\\\. As an insurance against development problems on the part of the Avon engine, Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet, the 8,000 lbf (35.59 kN) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Fitted with a Sapphire, the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952.Griffin 2006, pp. 17‚Äì18. On 16 March 1953, the first production standard Hunter F.1, fitted with a single 7,600 lbf (33.80 kN) Avon 113 turbojet, made its first flight. The first 20 aircraft were, in effect, a pre-production series and featured a number of \\"one-off\\" modifications such as blown flaps and area ruled fuselage.Griffin 2006, pp. 18‚Äì19. On 7 September 1953, the sole Hunter Mk 3 (the modified first prototype, WB 188) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for jet-powered aircraft, attaining a speed of 727.63 mph (1,171.01 km/h) over Littlehampton, West Sussex.\\"R.Ae.C. Award Winners.\\" Flight International, 5 February 1954. Retrieved: 3 November 2009. This world record stood for less than three weeks before being broken on 25 September 1953 by the Hunter's early rival, the Supermarine Swift, being flown by Michael Lithgow.\\"Speed Record Again Broken?\\" Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 25 September 1953. Design =Overview= The cockpit of a preserved Hunter The Hunter entered service with the Royal Air Force as an interceptor aircraft. It was the first jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset it was clear that the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records.Flight 1955, p. 243. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround timeenabled by features such as its removable gun pack and pressurised fuelling systemand for its easy handling in flight. The definitive version of the Hunter was the FGA.9, on which the majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government,Geiger 2004, p. 170. the Hunter proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, in part due to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs.Laming 1996, p. 53. As the RAF received newer aircraft capable of supersonic speeds to perform the air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad. The Hunter would be procured by a considerable number of foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers.Chesneau 1985, pp. 1‚Äì3. The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.Laming 1996, p. 51. =Armament and equipment= A Hunter's removable weapons pack. In the foreground are the ADEN cannons. The single- seat fighter versions of the Hunter were armed with four ADEN cannon, with 150 rounds of ammunition per gun. The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a single pack that could be removed from the aircraft for rapid re-arming and maintenance. Unusually, the barrels of the cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed.Mason 1991, p. 375. In the two-seat version, either a single 30 mm ADEN cannon was carried or, in some export versions, two, with a removable ammunition tank. Later versions of the Hunter were fitted with SNEB Pods; these were rocket projectiles in 18-round Matra pods, providing an effective strike capability against ground targets.Griffin 2006, p. 27. The Hunter featured a nose-mounted ranging radar, providing range input to the gyro gunsight for air-to-air gunnery only. Other equipment included pylon-mounted underwing external fuel tanks, a forward-facing gun camera, and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack. These were nicknamed \\"Sabrinas\\", after the buxom actress of the time. Several variants were fitted with tail-mounted brake parachutes.Chesneau 1985, p. 3. Typically, export Hunters were equipped to be compatible with additional types of missiles, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile. =Layout and structure= The Hunter is a conventional swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots and has a single jetpipe in the rear of the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35¬∞ and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.Chesneau 1985, pp. 1‚Äì2. The airframe of the Hunter consists of six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing the cockpit and armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack.Flight 1955, p. 242. Establishing initial full- rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.Flight 1955, pp. 239‚Äì242. =Engine= The tail and rear fuselage are detachable, providing maintenance access to the aircraft's single engine The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951, powered by a 6,500 lbf (28.91 kN) Rolls-Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber. The second prototype was fitted with a 7,550 lbf (33.58 kN) Avon 107 turbojet. Hawker's third prototype was powered by an 8,000 lbf (35.59 kN) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine. Early on in the Hunter's service the Avon engines proved to have poor surge margins, and worryingly suffered compressor stalls when the cannon were fired, sometimes resulting in flameouts.Law 2002, pp. 211‚Äì212. The practise of \\"fuel dipping\\", reducing fuel flow to the engine when the cannon were fired, was a satisfactory solution. Although the Sapphire did not suffer from the flameout problems of the Avon and had better fuel economy, Sapphire-powered Hunters suffered many engine failures. The RAF elected to persevere with the Avon to simplify supply and maintenance, since the Canberra bomber used the same engine.Griffin 2006, pp. 25‚Äì26. The RAF sought more thrust than was available from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor to put an end to surge problems, an annular combustion chamber, and an improved fuel control system. The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000 lbf (44.48 kN) of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.Griffin 2006, p. 26. Operational history =Royal Air Force= Hunter T7 of the Empire Test Pilots' School, Farnborough Air Show, September 1959 The Hunter F.1 entered service with the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It was the first high-speed jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service.\\"Hawker Hunter FGA9 Aircraft History - Post-World War Two Aircraft\\". RAF Museum. Retrieved: 9 April 2011. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour.Griffin 2006, p. 19. A fatal accident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.\\"Hunter Aircraft (Report of Inquiry).\\" Hansard, 25 April 1956. Retrieved: 23 August 2009. Another difficulty encountered during the aircraft's introduction was the occurrence of surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links had a tendency to strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification.Law 2002, p. 167. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings. To address the problem of range, a production Hunter F.1 was fitted with a modified wing featuring bag- type fuel tanks in the leading edge and \\"wet\\" hardpoints. The resulting Hunter F.4 first flew on 20 October 1954, and entered service in March 1955.Griffin 2006, p. 25. A distinctive Hunter feature added on the F.4 was the pair of blisters under the cockpit, which collected spent ammunition links to prevent airframe damage. Crews dubbed them \\"Sabrinas\\" after the contemporary movie star. The Sapphire-powered version of the F.4 was designated the Hunter F.5. No. 43 Squadron in flight, c. 1956 The RAF later received Hunters equipped with an improved Avon engine. The Avon 203 produced 10,000 lbf (44.48 kN) of thrust and was fitted to XF833, which became the first Hunter F.6. Some other revisions on the F.6 included a revised fuel tank layout, the centre fuselage tanks being replaced by new ones in the rear fuselage; the \\"Mod 228\\" wing, which has a distinctive \\"dogtooth\\" leading edge notch to alleviate the pitch- up problem; and four \\"wet\\" hardpoints, finally giving the aircraft a good ferry range. The Hunter F.6 was given the company designation Hawker P.1099. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, Hunters of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on offensive missions into Egypt.Skardon 2010, p. 478. For most of the conflict the Hunters engaged in local air defence due to their lack of range.Griffin 2006, p. 93. During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the Royal Air Force deployed Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei to provide support for British ground forces;Fowler and Lyles 2006, p. 10. Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels.Fowler and Lyles 2006, p. 5. In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle. In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.Moulton, J.L. The Royal Marines. London: Leo Cooper, 1972. . The Hunter F.6 was retired from its day fighter role in the RAF by 1963, being replaced by the much faster English Electric Lightning interceptor. Many F.6s were then given a new lease of life in the close air support role, converting into the Hunter FGA.9 variant. The FGA.9 saw frontline use from 1960 to 1971, alongside the closely related Hunter FR.10 tactical reconnaissance variant. The Hunters were also used by two RAF display units; the \\"Black Arrows\\" of No. 111 Squadron who set a record by looping and barrel rolling 22 Hunters in formation, and later the \\"Blue Diamonds\\" of No. 92 Squadron who flew 16 Hunters.\\"Black Arrows History.\\" Royal Air Force, Retrieved: 9 April 2011. Hunter F6A in flight near RAF Abingdon, 1979 In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF were used extensively during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting to overthrow the Federation of South Arabia. SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch high explosive rockets and 30 mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform.Scholey and Forsyth 2008, pp. 135, 137. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.Scholey and Forsyth 2008, p. 169. Hunters were flown by No.63, No. 234 and No. 79 Squadrons acting in training roles for foreign and Commonwealth students. These remained in service until after the Hawk T.1 entered service in the mid-1970s.Griffin 2006, p. 30. Two-seat trainer versions of the Hunter, the T.7 and T.8, remained in use for training and secondary roles by the RAF and Royal Navy until the early 1990s; when the Blackburn Buccaneer retired from service. The requirement for Hunter trainers disappeared so the Buccaneer-oriented trainers were retired, leaving the RN T.8Ms to soldier on for a while longer. Hunters were also used by the Empire Test Pilots' School at MoD Boscombe Down. The Hunter is unusual among swept wing jet aircraft in being able to be safely spun inverted. This would be demonstrated to students of the school.\\"Thunder and Lightnings Hunter T.7 XL612\\" = Royal Danish Air Force = As early as 1953 the first Hunter flew over Denmark, when test pilot Neville Duke demonstrated the F.1 over Copenhagen Airport. During this demonstration, the pilot broke the sound barrier in a shallow dive. Air Force officials were very impressed with the demonstration and since the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) were looking for a replacement for the Gloster Meteors in service at the time, the Hunter was a natural choice. Consequently, a contract for delivery of 30 F. Mk. 51 was signed on 3 July 1954. RDAF took delivery of the first two of these on 31 January 1956 and nine months later, all 30 Hunters had been delivered to 724 Squadron. Since the Hunter was a significantly different aircraft to fly, compared to older types such as the Meteor, the need for a two-seat trainer soon arose, and the RDAF took delivery of two T.Mk. 53 two-seat trainers in 1958. In contrast to most other users of the Hunter, RDAF never converted the Hunter to the fighter-bomber role. Although some studies and experiments carried out in 1959, the project never materialised and the Hunter carried on as a day fighter until its retirement in 1974. The last flight of the Hunter in RDAF service was carried out on 30 April 1974. The entire fleet was initially preserved at Aalborg Air Base, in the hopes of a future sale to other users. No such sale was ever carried out, but 16 F.Mk. 51s and four T-Mk.53 (two additional T.Mk. 53 had been purchased from the Netherlands in 1967) were sent back to Hawker Siddeley in December 1975. Ultimately, most Hunters were sold either to private buyers or to military museums around the world. Only one example (47-401/E-401) was reserved for museum use in Denmark and currently resides in ‚ÄúDanmarks Flymuseum‚Äù in Stauning. =Indian Air Force= In 1954, India arranged to purchase Hunters as a part of a wider arms deal with Britain, ordering 140 Hunter single-seat fightersFricker and Green 1958, p. 160. at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters.Kavic 1967, p. 109. The Indian Air Force (IAF) was the first to operate the Hunter T.66 trainers, placing an initial order in 1957. The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment, allowing for greater takeoff weights.Griffin 2006, p. 31. During the 1960s, Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric Lightnings, but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would do to its relations with India, which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex-RAF Hunters.Pytharian 2000, p. 130. By the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and the Hunter was the nation's primary and most capable interceptor.Gupta 1997, p. 33. During the conflict, the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air.Sieff 2009, p. 83. India's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India.Sieff 2009, p. 84. In 1962, India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970.Gupta 1997, pp. 41‚Äì42. The Hunter was to play a major role during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India's primary air defence fighter, and regularly engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters.Mohan and Chopra 2005, p. 41. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month.Singh, Jasjit. \\"The 1965 India-Pakistan War: IAF‚Äôs Ground Reality\\". The Sunday Tribune, 6 May 2007. Both sides claimed victory in the air war, Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own.Van Creveld, 2012, pp. 286‚Äì287. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.Coggins 2000, pp. 163‚Äì164. IAF Hunters performed extensive operations during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; India had six combat-ready squadrons of Hunters at the start of the conflict.Coggins 2000, p. 165. Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala. Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non-stop bombing raids. The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks, armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions, which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan's ground forces.Nordeen 1985, p. 100. Hunters were also used for many ground-attack missions and raids inside Pakistan's borders, such as the high-profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies.Jackson 1990, p. 128. In the aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan claimed to have shot down a total of 32 of India's Hunters.Coggins 2000, p. 166. Due to unfavourable currency conditions and conflicting pressures on the military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers.Gupta 1997, pp. 48‚Äì49. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, a large portion of which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978.Smith 1994, pp. 99‚Äì100. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.Datta, Saikat.\\"Rest Over, Upgraded Sukhois Set to Fly Again\\". Indian Express, 27 September 2002. =Swedish Air Force= Swedish Air Force J34 Hunter, 1955 In the early 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw the need for an interceptor that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than the J 29 Tunnan that formed the backbone of the fighter force. A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954Jackson 1982, p. 70. and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955.Mason 1991, p. 600. The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm. The J 34 was armed with four 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force's aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings, F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in √Ñngelholm, during the 1960s.Griffin 2006, p. 431. A project to improve the performance of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine's thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, so the project was shelved.Mason 1991, pp. 398‚Äì399. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969. =Swiss Air Force= A pair of ex-Swiss Air Force Hunters flying in close formation behind a single Mirage III, 2011 In 1957, the Swiss Air Force performed an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre, the Folland Gnat, and the Hawker Hunter; a pair of Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing.Mason 1985, pp.126‚Äì127 In January 1958, the government of Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project, the in- development FFA P-16, instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters.Lombardi 2007, p. 50. Further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued.Condon 2007, pp. 8‚Äì9. This initial order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s, and 88 new-built F.58s.Donnet World Air Power Journal, Volume 20, Spring 1995, p. 138.Lake Wings of Fame Volume 20, p. 96.Martin 1996, p. 321. Swiss Hunters were operated as interceptors, with a secondary ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.Lombardi 2007, p. 51. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained an arsenal of conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface- to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound.Anselmino 1990, p. 21-23. In case of unserviceable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.Anselmino1990, pp. 21‚Äì23. The Patrouille Suisse flight demonstration team were prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators on the engine exhausts and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft.Patrouille Suisse. Swiss Air Force. Retrieved: 14 April 2011. Hunters of the Patrouille Suisse in formation flight, c. 1991 The Hunter fleet endured several attempts to procure successor aircraft to the type; in the case of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of the Hunter itself. A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.Donnet World Air Power Journal Volume 20 Spring 1995, p. 140. By 1975, plans were laid to replace the Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II.Martin 1996, p. 322. The Hunter remained in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80 mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles,Lake Wings of Fame Volume 20, pp. 81‚Äì82.Braybrook Air International July 1981, p. 26. the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs and the ability to carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.Donnet World Air Power Journal, Volume 20, Spring 1995, p. 141. In the 1990s, the discovery of wing cracking led to the quick retirement of all Hunter F.58As. The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994.Donnet World Air Power Journal Volume 20, Spring 1995, p. 145.Lake Wings of Fame Volume 20, pp. 82, 96.Senior 2003, pp. 33‚Äì34, 74.

The aircraft were built under licence in both Belgium and the Netherlands in a joint programme, some using US offshore funding. SABCA and Avions Fairey built 64 aircraft in Belgium and a further 48 were built in the Netherlands by Fokker. The Hunters were used by Nos. 1, 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, and most were scrapped afterwards.Jackson 1990, p. 84. The Belgian and Dutch governments subsequently ordered the improved Hunter F.6, with Nos. 1, 7 and 9 Wings of the Belgian Air Force receiving 112 Fokker- built aircraft between 1957 and 1958. Although built in the Netherlands, 29 aircraft had been assembled from kits in Belgium by SABCA and 59 by Avions Fairey, and were operated by 7 and 9 Wings. No. 9 Wing was disbanded in 1960, and by 1963 the Hunter squadrons in 7 Wing had also been disbanded. A large number of the surviving Hunters were sold to Hawker Aircraft and re-built for re-export to India and Iraq, with others to Chile, Kuwait and Lebanon. Middle East Hunter F.73 of the Royal Jordanian Air Force in 1971 Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France delivered significant quantities of arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters were far more effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq.Curtis 1986, p. 128. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, but most of the Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground on the first day of the Six-Day War.Pollack 2002, p. 295.

In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters in an effort to burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.SIGWEB Sistemas integrados de Gesti√≥n, Carlos Saldivia, Las desconocidas historias de los tres derrames de petr√≥leo en Chile , retrieved on 18 September 2013 During the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, some of the Hunters were used by military officers as part of the effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende, on 11 September 1973. On 10 September 1973, coup leaders ordered the Hunters to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation. The following morning, the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against Palacio de La Moneda, Allende's official residence in Santiago, and several radio stations loyal to the government. The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d'√©tat for delivery of a further seven Hunters, as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment. The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft, along with vessels and submarines also on order; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978. The action was led by Rolls Royce workers, Bob Fulton, Robert Sommerville and John Keenan, who hid the engines in the factory.Phythian 2000, p. 105.

Eleven people on the ground were killed and several others were injured, including the pilot of the plane. Witnesses told local TV that the jet appeared to have crashed when it failed to pull out of a loop manoeuvre. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch concluded that the crash was caused by the pilot completing the top of the loop at too low an altitude and at too low an airspeed. The AAIB concluded that the pilot may have confused the parameters for the Hunter with the Jet Provost he had recently flown, saying, \\"a possible error path was that the pilot recalled the wrong numbers, essentially mixing up the two aircraft.\\" Specifications (Hunter F.6) 300px Mounted above the Hunter's nose (ex-RAF XF458) is the G-10 gun camera port.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin West constituency from 1989 to 2002 and Member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (MP) for East Tyrone from 1964 to 1972. Currie was born in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, to a Catholic family. He was educated in Dungannon and at Queen's University Belfast. Between 1964 and 1972, he was the Nationalist Party Stormont MP for East Tyrone. On 20 June 1968, with others including mediator Father Tom Savage, he began a protest about discrimination in housing allocation by squatting (illegally occupying) in a house in a new council development in Caledon, County Tyrone. The house had been allocated by Dungannon Rural District Council to a 19-year-old unmarried Protestant woman, Emily Beattie, who was the secretary of a local Unionist politician. All 14 houses in the new council development had been allocated to Protestants. The protesters were evicted by officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), one of whom was Emily Beattie's brother. The next day the annual conference of the Nationalist Party unanimously approved of the protest action by Austin Currie in Caledon. This was one of the catalysts of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. He became an active member in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. In 1970, he was a founder of the group that established the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). From 1973 to 1974, Currie was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In 1974, he became chief whip of the SDLP. That same year he became Minister for Housing, Local Government and Planning in the Northern Ireland Executive. He contested the 1979 United Kingdom general election and 1986 by-election in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat. He also was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982 for the same seat. By 1989, Currie had decided to move south, and at the general election of that year he was elected as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la for the Dublin West constituency. In 1990, after much procrastination, Fine Gael nominated him as a candidate at the presidential election. He finished a distant third in the election after Mary Robinson and Brian Lenihan. However, his transfers flowed overwhelmingly to Robinson, helping Robinson overtake Lenihan and make her Ireland's first female President. In the Rainbow Coalition between 1994 and 1997, he became Minister of State at the Departments of Education, Justice and Health. At the 2002 general election he lost his seat in D√°il √âireann when he failed to be elected in Dublin Mid-West. He immediately announced his retirement from politics. He currently resides in County Kildare. He occasionally lectures and gives talks on issues relating to The Troubles. Following the deaths of Seamus Mallon and John Hume in January and August 2020 respectively, he became the last-surviving senior founder of the SDLP. Reading *Austin Currie (2004).

Bombay, 7 April 1939. Mahadev Desai (1 January 1892 ‚Äì 15 August 1942) was an Indian independence activist and writer best remembered as Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary. He has variously been described as \\"Gandhi's Boswell, a Plato to Gandhi's Socrates, as well as an Ananda to Gandhi's Buddha\\".  Early life  Mahadev Desai was born on 1 January 1892 in the village of Saras in Surat District of Gujarat to Haribhai Desai, a school teacher, and his wife Jamnabehn. Jamnabehn died when Desai was seven years old. In 1905, aged 13, Mahadev was married to Durgabehn. He was educated at the Surat High School and the Elphinstone College, Mumbai. Desai graduated with a BA Degree, and after earning his L.L.B in 1913 took a job as an inspector at the central co-operative bank in Bombay.  Gandhi's associate  Mahadev Desai first met Gandhi in 1915 when he went to meet him to seek his advice on how best to publish his book (a Gujrati translation of John Morley's English book On Compromise). Desai joined Gandhi's Ashram in 1917 and with Durgabehn accompanied him to Champaran that year. He maintained a diary from 13 November 1917 to 14 August 1942, the day before his death, chronicling his life with Gandhi. In 1919 when the colonial government arrested Gandhi in Punjab, he named Desai his heir. Desai was for the first time arrested and sentenced to a year in prison in 1921. He was Gandhi's personal secretary for 25 years, but as Verrier Elwin wrote of him, \\"he was much more than that. He was in fact Home and Foreign Secretary combined. He managed everything. He made all the arrangements. He was equally at home in the office, the guest- house and the kitchen. He looked after many guests and must have saved 10 years of Gandhi's life by diverting from him unwanted visitors\\". Rajmohan Gandhi writes of Mahadev Desai thus: \\"Waking up before Gandhi in pre-dawn darkness, and going to sleep long after his Master, Desai lived Gandhi's day thrice over ‚Äî first in an attempt to anticipate it, next in spending it alongside Gandhi, and finally in recording it into his diary\\".  Political activism  Yerawada Jail In 1920, Motilal Nehru requisitioned the services of Mahadev Desai from Gandhi to run his newspaper, the Independent, from Allahabad. Desai created a sensation by bringing out a hand-written cyclostyled newspaper after the Independent's printing press was confiscated by the British government. Desai was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment for his writings in 1921 ‚Äì his first stint in prison. In prison, Desai saw that the jail authorities mistreated prisoners, frequently flogging them. His report describing the life inside an Indian jail, published in Young India and Navajivan, compelled the British authorities to bring about some drastic jail reform measures. Desai took over as editor of Navajivan in 1924 and from 1925 he began the translation into English of Gandhi's autobiography and its serial publication in the Young India. The following year he became chairman of the executive committee of the Satyagraha Ashram and won a prize from the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad for his article in Navajivan. He took part in the Bardoli Satyagraha along with Sardar Patel and wrote a history of the Satyagraha in Gujarati which he translated into English as The Story of Bardoli. For his participation in the Salt Satyagraha, he was arrested and imprisoned but following the Gandhi- Irwin Pact, he was released from jail and accompanied Gandhi to the Second round Table Conference along with Mirabehn, Devdas Gandhi and Pyarelal. He was the only person to accompany Gandhi when the latter met with King George V. Following the collapse of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the deadlock at the Round Table Conference, Gandhi restarted the Civil Disobedience Movement. The colonial government, under the new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, was determined to crush the movement and ordered a clampdown on the Indian National Congress and its activists. In 1932, Desai was arrested again and sent to prison with Gandhi and Sardar Patel. Following his release in 1933, he was re-arrested and detained in the Belgaum Jail. It was during this time in prison that he wrote Gita According to Gandhi which was posthumously published in 1946. He also played a role in organising people's movements in the princely states of Rajkot and Mysore in 1939 and was put in charge of selecting satyagrahis during the Individual Satyagraha of 1940. Desai's final prison term followed the Quit India Declaration of 8 August 1942. He was arrested on the morning of 9 August 1942 and, till his death of a massive heart-attack six days later, was interred with Gandhi at the Aga Khan Palace. Desai was 51 at the time of his death.  Writings  Mahadev Desai was an outstanding writer, at ease with Gujarati, Bengali and English. He is highly regarded as a translator and writer in Gujarati. He wrote several biographies such as Antyaj Sadhu Nand (1925), Sant Francis (1936), Vir Vallabhbhai (1928) and Be Khudai Khidmatgar (1936) which was a biography of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and his brother Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. He started translating when he was studying in college. He translated John Morley's On Compromise in Gujarati and won a thousand rupees prize of the Farbas Gujarati Sabha. Later it was published as Satyagrahni Maryada. From Bengali, he translated Saratchandra Chattopadhyaya's short stories as Tran Vartao (1923) and the novella Virajvahu (1924). He also translated Tagore's works into Gujarati such as Prachin Sahitya (1922), Chitrangada and Viday Abhishap (1925). He translated Nehru's Autobiography as Mari Jeevanktha (1936) into Gujarati from English. The English translation of Gandhi's autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, from its Gujarati original was also done by Desai. Mahadevbhaini Dayari (1948-1997) is the 22 volume publication of Mahadev Desai's diaries. These, edited by Narhari Parikh (Volume I-VI) and Chandulal Bhagubhai Dalal (VII-XXII), provide a close look at Gandhi's life and are a valuable chronicle of the major events in Gandhi's life and in Indian independence movement. He was also a regular contributor to Gandhi's publications Young India, Navjivan and the Harijanbandhu. Desai was among the founding members of the All India Newspaper Editors' Conference. He also frequently contributed to various nationalist Indian newspapers such as Free Press, The Bombay Chronicle, Hindustan Times, The Hindu and Amrita Bazar Patrika. He wrote several works in English including Gandhiji in Indian Villages (1927), With Gandhiji in Ceylon (1928), The Story of Bardoli (1929), Unworthy of Vardha (1943), The Eclipse of Faith (1943), A Righteous Struggle (1951) and Gospel of Selfless Action or The Geeta According to Gandhi (1946, translation of Anasaktiyoga by Gandhi). He was posthumously awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1955 for Mahadevbhaini Dayari.  Death and legacy  Mahadev Desai's obituary in Harijan, Gandhi's newspaper Samadhis of Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai at Aga Khan Palace, Pune Aged 50, Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack on the morning of 15 August 1942 at the Aga Khan Palace where he was interned with Gandhi. When Desai stopped breathing, Gandhi called out to him in agitation: \\"Mahadev! Mahadev!\\" When he was later asked why he had done so, Gandhi answered: \\"I felt that if Mahadev opened his eyes and looked at me, I would tell him to get up. He had never disobeyed me in his life. I was confident that if had he heard those words, he would have defied even death and got up\\". Gandhi himself washed Desai's body and he was cremated on the Palace's grounds, where his samadhi lies today. The Indian Department of Posts published a commemorative stamp in his honour in 1983. His son Narayan Desai was also a noted Gandhian activist and writer who wrote Mahadev Desai's biography The Fire and the Rose. The Mahadev Desai Samajseva Mahavidyalaya, Gujarat Vidyapith's faculty of social sciences, arts and humanities was named in Mahadev Desai's honour.

Wifredo Lam and His Contemporaries 1938‚Äì1952. New York: The Studio Museum in Harlem, 1992. In Sagua La Grande, Lam was surrounded by many people of African descent; his family, like many others, practiced Catholicism alongside their African traditions. Through his godmother, Matonica Wilson, a Santer√≠a priestess locally celebrated as a healer and sorceress, he was exposed to rites of the African orishas. His contact with African celebrations and spiritual practices proved to be his largest artistic influence. In 1916, Lam moved to Havana to study law, a path that his family had thrust upon him. Simultaneously he also began studying tropical plants at the Botanical Gardens.Alley, Rin. \\"Lam, Wifredo\\". Grove Art Online. 1999-09-27. Oxford University Press. From 1918 to 1923, Lam studied painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. However, he disliked both academic teaching and painting. He left for Madrid, Spain in the autumn of 1923 to further his art studies. Career in Europe In 1923, Lam began studying in Madrid under Fernando √Ålvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, the curator of the Museo del Prado and teacher of Salvador Dal√≠. In the mornings he would attend his conservative teacher's studio, while he spent his evenings working alongside young, nonconformist painters. At the Prado, he discovered and was awed by the work of Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel I. While Lam's early paintings were in the modernist Spanish tradition, his work soon became more simplified and decorative. Though his dislike for academic conservatism persisted, his time in Spain marked his technical development, in which he began to merge a primitive aesthetic and the traditions of Western composition. In 1929, he married Eva Piriz, but both she and their young son died in 1931 of tuberculosis; it is likely that this personal tragedy contributed to the dark nature of his work.\\"Wifredo Lam.\\" Guggenheim Collection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. . During the 1930s, Lam was exposed to a variety of influences. The influence of Surrealism was discernible in his work, as well as that of Henri Matisse. Throughout Lam's travels through the Spanish countryside, he developed empathy for the Spanish peasants, whose troubles in some ways mirrored those of the former slaves he grew up around in Cuba.Richards, Paulette. \\"Wifredo Lam: a Sketch.\\" Callaloo 34 (1988): 90‚Äì92. JSTOR. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he sided with the Republicans and used his talent to fashion Republican posters and propaganda. Drafted to defend Madrid, Lam was incapacitated during the fighting in late 1937 and was sent to Barcelona. There he met Helena Holzer, a German researcher, and the Catalan artist known as Manolo Hugu√©. Manolo gave Lam the letter of introduction that sparked his friendship with Picasso, whose artwork had impressed and inspired Lam a year before when he saw an exhibition in Madrid. In 1938, Lam moved to Paris. He quickly gained the support of Picasso, who introduced him to many of the leading artists of the time, such as Fernand L√©ger, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and Joan Mir√≥. Picasso also introduced him to Pierre Loeb, a Parisian art dealer; Loeb gave Lam his first exhibition at the Galerie Pierre Loeb in 1939, which received an enthusiastic response from critics.Sims, Lowery S. Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923‚Äì1982. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2002. Picasso and Lam also exhibited their work together at the Perls Galleries in New York in the same year. Lam's work went from showing the influence of Matisse, seen in his still lifes, landscapes and simplified portraits, to being influenced by Cubism. Mainly working with gouache, Lam began producing stylized figures that appear to be influenced by Picasso. Much of his work in 1938 possessed emotional intensity; the subject matter ranged from interacting couples to women in despair and showed a considerably stronger African influence, seen in the figures‚Äô angular outlines and the synthesis of their bodies. While Lam began simplifying his forms before he came into contact with Picasso's work, it is apparent that Picasso had a significant impact on him. With regard to Picasso's exhibition, Lam said that it was \\"not only a revelation, but‚Ä¶ a shock.\\" Lam gained the approval of Picasso, whose encouragement has been said to have led Lam to search for his own interpretation of modernism. With the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of Paris by the Germans, Lam left for Marseille, France in 1940. There he rejoined many intellectuals, including the Surrealists, with whom he had been associated since he met Andr√© Breton in 1939. While in Marseille, Lam and Breton collaborated on the publication of Breton's poem Fata Morgana, which was illustrated by Lam. Though the drawings he created in Marseille between 1940 and 1941 are known as the Fata Morgana suite, only about three inspired the illustrations for the poem. In 1941, Breton, Lam and Claude L√©vi-Strauss, accompanied by many others, left for Martinique, only to be imprisoned. After forty days, Lam was released and allowed to leave for Cuba, which he reached in midsummer 1941. Havana years Upon Lam's return to Havana, he developed a new awareness of Afro- Cuban traditions. He noticed that the descendants of the slaves were still being oppressed and that the Afro-Cuban culture was degraded and made picturesque for the sake of tourism. He believed that Cuba was in danger of losing its African heritage and therefore sought to free them from cultural subjugation. In an interview with Max-Pol Fouchet, he said: > \\"I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by > thoroughly expressing the negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the > blacks. In this way I could act as a Trojan horse that would spew forth > hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of > the exploiters.\\" Additionally, his time in Cuba marked a rapid evolution of his style. Drawing from his study of tropical plants and familiarity with Afro-Cuban culture, his paintings became characterized by the presence of a hybrid figure‚Äîpart human, part animal, and part vegetal. His style was also distinctive because of its fusion of Surrealist and Cubist approaches with imagery and symbols from Santer√≠a.Nessen, Susan. \\"Review: Multiculturalism in the Americas.\\" Art Journal 52 (1993): 86‚Äì91. JSTOR. In 1943, he began his best-known work, The Jungle. It reflected his mature style, depicting four figures with mask-like heads, half-emerging from dense tropical vegetation. Later that year it was shown in an exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York, where it created controversy. The painting depicted the tension between Modernism and the vibrancy and energy of African culture. The Jungle was ultimately purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It is often compared to Picasso's Guernica, which is hung in the Museo Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid. Lam with fellow artist Manuel Carbonell (1952) Lam continued to simplify and synthesize abstraction yet continued painting figurally; he also kept on developing the mythology and totemism that defined his style. In 1944, he married Helana Holzer, whom he divorced in 1950. In 1946, he and Breton spent four months in Haiti. There Lam enriched his already extensive understanding and knowledge of African divinity and magic rituals through observing Voodoun ceremonies, although he later said that his contact with the African spirituality that he found throughout the Americas did not directly impact his formal style. African poetry, on the other hand, was said to have had a broadening effect on his paintings. In 1950, he worked with Ren√© Portocarrero and others; in the village of Santiago de Las Vegas, the group of painters worked on ceramic.Victor Moreno ‚Äì ein kubanischer Maler, Felix Busse, Vielflieger Verlag Lam settled in Paris in 1952 after having divided his time between Cuba, New York, and France. Sal√≥n de Mayo, 1967. Sidewalk insert in front of the Radiocentro CMQ Building by Wilfredo Lam. Lam, who continued to sympathize with the common man, exhibited a series of paintings at Havana University in 1955 to demonstrate his support for the students' protests against Batista's dictatorship. Similarly, in 1965, six years after the revolution, he showed his loyalty to Castro and his goals of social and economic equality by painting El Tercer Mundo (The Third World) for the presidential palace. In 1960, Lam established a studio in Albissola Marina on Italy's northwest coast and settled there with his wife Lou Laurin, a Swedish painter, and their three sons. In 1964, he was awarded the Guggenheim International Award and between 1966 and 1967 there were many retrospectives of his work throughout Europe. At the encouragement of Asger Jorn and after being intrigued by the local pottery-making, Lam began to experiment with ceramics and had his first ceramic exhibition in 1975. He progressed to model sculptures and cast in metal in his twilight years, often depicting personages similar to those he had painted. Wifredo Lam died on September 11, 1982, in Paris, aged 79. Having had more than one hundred personal exhibitions around the world, Lam had a well established reputation by the time of his death. Legacy Lam, like many of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, combined radical modern styles with the \\"primitive\\" arts of the Americas. While Diego Rivera and Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a drew inspiration from Pre-Columbian art, Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. He dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement. He held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork. He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted mask-like faces. While Cuban culture and mythology permeated his work, it dealt with the nature of man and therefore was wholly relatable to non- Cubans. Opened in 1983, the Wifredo Lam Center for Contemporary Art (in Spanish: Centro de Arte Contempor√°neo Wifredo Lam) is a state-run gallery in tribute to Lam and located in Havana, Cuba. This art gallery is responsible for the organization of the Bienal de la Habana, Cuba, a permanent art collection of approx. 1000 works, and research and study of contemporary visual arts in developing countries. In 2015 a retrospective exhibition of his works opened at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, set to travel to the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain and the Tate Museum in London afterwards. The Jungle Wifredo Lam, The Jungle, gouache on paper, 1943, Museum of Modern Art The Jungle, which is considered Lam's masterpiece, is exemplary of the artist's mature style. The polymorphism, for which Lam is well known, juxtaposes aspects of humans, animals, and plants, creating monstrous, hybrid creatures. The dense composition creates a claustrophobic feeling while the forms remain difficult to differentiate. The figures' elongated limbs lack definition, while much emphasis is placed on their large feet, round buttocks, and African-inspired masked heads. Additionally, the iridescent quality of the forms enhances the painting's tropical feeling. The Jungle was not, however, intended to describe the primitivism of Cuba. Rather, Lam's intention was to depict a spiritual state‚Äîthat which is surely inspired by Santer√≠a;Lucie- Smith, Edward. Latin American Art of the 20th Century. 2nd ed. London, England: Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2004. he sheds light on the absurdity that has become Afro-Cuban culture and more specifically on the way their traditions were cheapened for tourism. He sought to describe the reality of his people through the powerful work and gained acclaim and fame for doing so.

She spent the latter part of her childhood and youth in the United States and eventually became an American citizen, although she lived in France for many years and eventually retired to Scotland, where she died.Garden is sometimes referred to as solely 'American', as she had lived in America since the age of 6, however she did not even apply for American citizenship until 8 April 1924 (Turnbull, Michael TRB: Mary Garden, p. 159) and lived in Europe thereafter. Described as \\"the Sarah Bernhardt of opera\\", Garden was an exceptional actress as well as a talented singer. She was particularly admired for her nuanced performances which employed interesting uses of vocal color. Possessing a beautiful lyric voice that had a wide vocal range and considerable amount of flexibility, Garden first arose to success in Paris during the first decade of the 20th century. She became the leading soprano at the Op√©ra-Comique; notably portraying roles in several world premieres, including M√©lisande in Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1902). She worked closely with Jules Massenet, in whose operas she excelled. Massenet notably wrote the title role in his opera Ch√©rubin (1905) for her. In 1907, Oscar Hammerstein convinced Garden to join the Manhattan Opera House in New York where she became an immediate success. By 1910 she was a household name in America and Garden appeared in operas in several major American cities; including performing with the Boston Opera Company and the Philadelphia Opera Company. Between 1910 and 1932 Garden worked in several opera houses in Chicago. She first worked with the Chicago Grand Opera Company (1910‚Äì1913) and then joined the Chicago Opera Association in 1915, ultimately becoming the company's director in 1921. Although director for only one year, Garden was notably responsible for staging the world premiere of Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges before the company went bankrupt in 1922. Shortly thereafter she became the director of the Chicago Civic Opera where she commissioned the opera Camille by 28-year-old composer Hamilton Forrest. She sang roles at the Civic Opera until 1931, notably in several United States and world premieres. Additionally, Garden appeared in two silent films made by Samuel Goldwyn.Michael T.R.B. Turnbull: \\"Mary Garden\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 9 February 2009) (subscription access) After retiring from the opera stage in 1934, Garden worked as a talent scout for MGM. She also gave lectures and recitals, mostly on the life and works of Claude Debussy, until 1949. She retired to Scotland and in 1951 published a successful autobiography, Mary Garden's Story. Her voice is preserved on a number of recordings made for the Gramophone Company (including some with Debussy at the piano), Edison Records, Path√©, Columbia Records and the Victor Talking Machine Company between 1903 and 1929.Biography of Mary Garden, operissimo.com (in German) Biography = Early life and rise to stardom in Europe= Early years Mary Garden, 1908 Mary Garden was born on 20 February 1874 at 35 Charlotte Street, Aberdeen, Scotland, the oldest of the four daughters of Robert Davidson Garden (b. 1851), a cashier at the Blaikie ironworks, and his wife Mary (n√©e Joss) (1852‚Äì1948). Her parents married a little over a month before her birth. Two of her sisters were born in Scotland while another was born in the United States.\\"Mary Garden, 92, Opera Star, Dead\\", The New York Times, 5 January 1967 The family moved to Chicopee, Massachusetts, United States when she was nine years old. They then moved to Hartford, Connecticut a few years later, and then to Chicago in 1888 when Mary was 14.  Voice student  She showed promise as a young singer, and studied with Sarah Robinson-Duff in Chicago under the financial support of wealthy patrons David and Florence Mayer. In 1896 she pursued further studies in Paris, chiefly with Trabadelo and Lucien Fug√®re, still under the support of the Mayers. She also studied some under Jacques Bouhy, Jules Chevalier, and Mathilde Marchesi. In 1899 Garden lost the backing of her benefactors, and she began to study singing with the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson. Sanderson introduced her to Jules Massenet and Albert Carr√©, the director of the Op√©ra- Comique.  Operatic debut  Impressed with her voice, Carr√© invited her to join the roster at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1900. Garden made her professional opera debut with the company on 10 April 1900 in the title role of Gustave Charpentier's Louise, which had received its world premiere only two months before. Although Garden had been preparing the role, her debut, at the eighth performance of the work, was unscheduled as she was a last minute replacement for Marthe Rioton who had become ill. From 1901 for two years, she carried on an affair with Andr√© Messager, who conducted her in Louise. She claimed that when the Op√©ra-Comique director Albert Carr√© asked her to marry him, she replied that she had someone else in her life ‚Äì Messager. Her description is of a tempestuous relationship, but they remained friends until his death.Opstad G. Debussy's M√©lisande ‚Äì the lives of Georgette Leblanc, Mary Garden and Maggie Teyte. The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 2009. Mary Garden as M√©lisande in Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande After her debut, Garden quickly became one of the leading sopranos at the Op√©ra-Comique. In 1901 she starred in two world premieres, Marie in Lucien Lambert's La Marseillaise and Diane in Gabriel Piern√©'s La fille de Tabarin. That same year she sang the title role in Massenet's Tha√Øs at Aix-les-Bains, and sang both the title roles in Massenet's Manon and Messager's Madame Chrysanth√®me at the Op√©ra de Monte- Carlo; all under the coaching of Sanderson. In 1902, Claude Debussy selected her to play the female lead at the Op√©ra-Comique debut of his Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Garden's performances met with considerable critical acclaim. She also created a sensation as Salom√© in the French version of Richard Strauss's opera of that name. Following the success of Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Garden periodically went to London to sing at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden while still appearing in performances in Paris. At Covent Garden she sang Manon, Juliette in Charles Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette, and Marguerite in Gounod's Faust during the 1902 and 1903 seasons. Garden, however, did not care for London and decided to not take any more engagements in that city. Her performances at the Op√©ra-Comique during this time included the title role in Massenet's Gris√©lidis (1902), Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata (1903), the title role in the world premiere of Xavier Leroux's La reine Fiammette (1903), and the title role in Saint-Sa√´ns's H√©l√®ne (1905). In 1905 she sang at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo in the world premiere of Massenet's Ch√©rubin, a role which the composer wrote specifically for her. The following year she returned to the Op√©ra-Comique to sing Chrysis in the world premiere of Camille Erlanger's Aphrodite. =Departure from the Op√©ra-Comique and later career in the United States= Mary Garden in the opera Tha√Øs Persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to join his competition against the Metropolitan Opera, Garden quit her frequent Op√©ra-Comique engagements to join the Manhattan Opera House in New York City. She made her American debut in the Manhattan Opera House on 25 November 1907 in the title role in Tha√Øs, a role which fitted her personality and art like a glove. She further astounded American audiences with her uncanny portrayal of a young boy in Massenet's Le jongleur de Notre- Dame (1908) and in the United States premiere of Pell√©as et M√©lisande. In 1908 she returned to Paris to join the roster at the Op√©ra National de Paris. She sang there for one season, notably portraying Ophelia in Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet (1908) and the title part in Henry F√©vrier's Monna Vanna (1909) among other roles. She also sang the role of Marguerite in Gounod's Faust (1909) in Brussels. Afterwards, Garden returned again to New York in 1909 to perform the title role in Richard Strauss's Salome. During the performance she lasciviously kissed the severed head of John the Baptist which shocked the morals of a number of the audience members even more than her Dance of the Seven Veils (which she performed in a bodystocking). Mary Garden as Natoma By 1910, Garden had become a household name within America. She left the Manhattan Opera House to join the Chicago Grand Opera Company where she sang from 1910 to 1913 in such roles as M√©lisande, Fanny in Massenet's Sapho, Dulcin√©e in Massenet's Don Quichotte, the Prince in Massenet's Cendrillon, the title role in Georges Bizet's Carmen, and the title role in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. During this time she also sang in other American cities, notably appearing in the world premiere of Victor Herbert's Natoma in Philadelphia on 25 February 1911 and in the title role F√©vrier's Monna Vanna in its United States premiere in Boston. In late April 1912 Garden along with Caruso and the Metropolitan Opera Company gave special concerts in which they raised $12,000(over quarter of a million in 2017) dollars for aid to survivors of the Titanic tragedy. Mary Garden as Cleopatra from Massenet's Cl√©op√¢tre (1921) Garden next sang with the Chicago Opera Association from 1915 until 1921 where she sang such roles as the title part in Massenet's Cl√©op√¢tre and the title part in the world premiere of F√©vrier's Gismonda (both 1919), and the role of Fiora in Montemezzi's L'amore dei tre re (1920) among many others. She notably became the director of the Chicago Opera Association in a notorious coup for the organization's final 1921‚Äì22 season. Although serving as director for only one year, she was responsible for producing the world premi√®re of Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges. Also during this time she appeared in two silent films made by Samuel Goldwyn, the title role in a film version of Thais (1917) and the role of Dolores Fargis in The Splendid Sinner (1918). During World War I she was decorated by the French and Serbian governments and made a Chevalier (knight) of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1921. In 1922 Garden became the director of the newly formed Chicago Civic Opera where she also performed roles until 1931. Among the many roles she performed with the Chicago Civic Opera are Charlotte in Massenet's Werther (1924), Katyusha in Franco Alfano's Risurrezione (1925, in French) and the heroine of Arthur Honegger's Judith (1927), the last two both United States premi√®res. In 1930 she sang in the world premiere of Hamilton Forrest's Camille, an opera based on Dumas The Lady of the Camellias. That same year she returned to the Op√©ra-Comique to appear in several operas. In 1931 Garden sang her last role with the Chicago Civic Opera, Carmen, after which the company went bankrupt. (1887‚Äì1945) and Mary Garden in 1918 Garden retired from the opera stage in 1934, after making her last appearance as Katyusha in Franco Alfano's Risurrezione at the Op√©ra- Comique. After retiring, Garden worked as a talent scout for MGM and gave lectures and recitals, mostly on the life and works of Claude Debussy up through 1949. For much of her life she had openly encouraged young singers and even secretly paid for them to receive training. She continued to support young artists after her retirement through master classes, often allowing aspiring artists to attend for free. =Personal life= Mary Garden featured on an advertisement for the autopiano, 1910s As portrayed in both her autobiography and that of Michael Turnbull, Garden was an archetypal diva who knew exactly how to get her own way. She had a number of feuds with various colleagues from which she invariably emerged victorious, eventually ending up in control of the Chicago Opera. A relentless self-publicist, a woman however of genuine beauty, her flamboyant personal life was often the subject of more attention than her public performances, and her affairs with men, real or imagined, were liable to emerge as scandalous rumours in the newspapers. Mary Garden in 1954 Her autobiography, Mary Garden's Story (1951), is marred by inaccuracies. Always prone to embellish and exaggerate, Garden was already succumbing to dementia when the manuscript was being prepared. It was in recognition of her personal history that Scottish Opera chose to present in their inaugural 1962 season Pell√©as et M√©lisande. That year marked the centenary of Debussy's birth and the diamond jubilee of the opera. By the time of the first performance Mary Garden was unable to accept her invitation to attend, being in hospital after a fall, and with her health in decline. Mary Garden died in Inverurie, close to Aberdeen, where she spent the last 30 years of her life. An award for opera singing at the Aberdeen International Youth Festival is made in her name. There is a small memorial garden dedicated to her in the west-end of Aberdeen, with a small inscribed stone and a bench. Recordings and films Mary Garden made about 40 gramophone records between 1903 and 1929 for G & T, Columbia and Victor. They continue to be reissued and are of interest to connoisseurs of historical recordings‚Äîalthough Garden herself was said to have been generally disappointed with the results. Of special interest are the four 1904 Black G&T; recordings she made accompanied by Claude Debussy in Paris. There are also a small number of recordings made from radio broadcasts.Discography by Jim McPherson and William R Moran in Turnbull, Michael TRB: Mary Garden (Portland, Oregon, 1997), Appendix 2. She made two silent films, Thais (1917) and a World War I romance entitled The Splendid Sinner (1918). Without her singing voice, her acting was criticized and neither film was a success. In the 1930s, Garden appeared on Cecil B. DeMille's Lux Radio Theater. One such airing had Garden and Melvyn Douglas reading the play Tonight or Never which had recently been made into a motion picture.Jeanette MacDonald on the Radio , a list of Lux Radio Theater programs in the mid-1930s Literary references Garden is cited with other artistic figures of the period in Hugh MacDiarmid's poem A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle (ll.30‚Äì2): Whaur's Isadora Duncan dancin nou, Is Mary Garden in Chicago still And Duncan Grant in Paris ‚Äì and me fou?

He was of an independent mind, and did not stick regularly to the main parties. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the South Sea Bubble and his involvement with the Company led to his resignation and disgrace. Studley Royal (1880) Background and education Aislabie's family were originally Yeoman farmers who lived in Hemingbrough. His father George Aislebie married into the highly influential Mallory family through Mary Mallory, daughter of Sir John Mallory of Studley Royal. He was admitted at St. John's College, Cambridge in 1687 and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1692. He inherited the Studley estate from his mother's family in 1693, and started serious development of the garden around 1716. He was the first in England to introduce natural landscaping and created the water garden at Studley Royal. His son, William Aislabie, added the ruins of Fountains Abbey to the estate. Political career Aislabie was elected as a Member of Parliament for Ripon at the 1695 English general election, apparently on the assumption he was a Tory, though his political views were somewhat fluid. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. He was returned again for Ripon at the 1698 English general election. The loss of his wife and daughter in a house fire in January 1700 may have dampened his political activity for a while. He was returned again for Ripon at the two general elections of 1701, and he kept well enough in with Robert Harley to be classed as a Tory. He was elected Mayor of Ripon for the year 1702 to 1703, and was returned instead as MP for Northallerton at the 1702 English general election in an exchange deal with William Hustler. As mayor he was generous in paying for the reconstruction of the Market Cross, and making gifts to the Corporation. He became more active in politics from 1704, especially on the economy. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned again for Ripon and voted for the Court candidate as speaker on 25 October 1705. He eventually became associated with the Country Whigs. Under the patronage of Robert Harley he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty from 1710 in the Tory administration. This proved a precarious appointment as Aislabie's Whig sympathies manifested in votes against the government. When the Whigs returned to office in 1714, Aislabie was made Treasurer of the Navy. He became an ally of the Earl of Sunderland who became, in effect, Prime Minister in 1718. Sunderland appointed Aislabie as Chancellor of the Exchequer. When in 1719 the South Sea Company proposed a deal whereby it would take over the national debt in exchange for government bonds, Aislabie was a very strong supporter of the scheme and negotiated the contract; he piloted the Bill through the House of Commons. The South Sea Company had been built on high expectations which it could never fulfil, and it collapsed in August 1720. An investigation by Parliament found that Aislabie had been given ¬£20,000 of company stock in exchange for his promotion of the scheme. He resigned the Exchequer in January 1721, and in March was found guilty by the Commons of the \\"most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption\\". He was expelled from the House, removed from the Privy Council, and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Later life and contributions After his release from prison, he retired to his estate and continued the development of the gardens. The obelisk in the Market Square, Ripon, the first in England, was provided by John Aislabie in 1702, and is now grade I listed. In 1723 Aislabie constructed Waverley Abbey House on the site of former Cistercian Waverley Abbey in Surrey. John's son William Aislabie would also serve in Parliament for the Ripon constituency.

Ross, and with music by Henry Mancini and cinematography by Russell Harlan. The supporting cast includes Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, Arthur O'Connell and Vivian Vance. The movie cost US$12 million (equivalent to $98.36 million in 2020), making it the most expensive comedy film at the time. The story was inspired by the actual 1908 New York to Paris Race. It is noted for one scene that was promoted as \\"the greatest pie fight ever\\". It was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing. Plot The Great Leslie and Professor Fate are competing daredevils at the turn of the 20th century. Leslie is the classic hero ‚Äì always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful. Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain ‚Äì usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York City to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey. They design and build a new car named \\"The Leslie Special\\". Fate builds his own race vehicle, \\"The Hannibal Twin-8\\", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal suffragette. A seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Borracho. A local outlaw named \\"Texas Jack\\" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and \\"wanted to go back to New York\\". The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side by side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead. After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the spitting image of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe. Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster's plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake. A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich's best wishes. As the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the Eiffel Tower to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York. The return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.

On February 12, 1908, the \\"Greatest Auto Race\\" began with six entrants, starting in New York City and racing westward across three continents. The destination was Paris, making it the first around-the- world automobile race. Only the approximate race route and the general time period were borrowed by Edwards in his effort to make \\"the funniest comedy ever\\". Edwards, a studious admirer of silent film, dedicated the film to film comedians Laurel and Hardy. The Great Race incorporated a great many silent era visual gags, along with slapstick, double entendres, parodies, and absurdities. The film includes such time-worn scenes as a barroom brawl, the tent of the desert sheik, a sword fight, and the laboratory of the mad scientist. The unintended consequences of Professor Fate's order, \\"Push the button, Max!\\", is a running gag, along with the spotless invulnerability of \\"The Great Leslie\\". Edwards poked fun at later films and literature as well. The saloon brawl scene was a parody of the western film genre, and a plot detour launched during the final third of the film was a direct parody of the novel, The Prisoner of Zenda, and of the 1937 film version of the story, wherein a traveler is a lookalike for the king and stands in for him. Production Because of the success of Edwards' previous films Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark, the film's budget started at a generous $6 million. Mirisch Productions initially financed the film for United Artists. The film's escalating costs led UA to drop the film, but the project was picked up by Warners.p.239 Mirisch, Walter I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History Univ of Wisconsin Press, 27/02/2008 Edwards wanted Robert Wagner to play the leading man, but studio executive Jack L. Warner insisted on Tony Curtis, possibly because of Wood's recent divorce from Wagner. (Burt Lancaster was announced at one stage.) Working with Warner, Curtis's new agent Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar negotiated US$125,000 for Curtis, more than Edwards and Lemmon who were to receive US$100,000 each. After Warner signed the Curtis contract, Lazar reasoned that Edwards and Lemmon should also make US$125,000, and Warner upped its compensation to match Curtis. Natalie Wood did not want to make The Great Race, but Warner talked her into it. Wood was unhappy with her career and her personal life, having been divorced from Robert Wagner in April 1962. Warner asked Curtis if he would give a percentage of his film royalties to Wood as an enticement, but Curtis refused. He said \\"I couldn't give her anything to make her want to do the movie.\\" Instead of more money, Warner promised Wood that if she completed The Great Race, she could star in Gavin Lambert's drama Inside Daisy Clover, a role she greatly wished to have. Wood agreed, thinking that filming would be brief on Edwards' movie. Shooting began on June 15, 1964. Many of the sight gags for The Great Race were expensive to create, and the costs ballooned to US$12 million by the time the film was finished. Edwards, sometimes with Wood in tow, repeatedly visited Warner in his office to ask for more money. Warner approved nearly all of the requests. When it was released, it was the most expensive comedy ever filmed. Shooting ended in November 1964. During the five months of filming, Wood's unhappiness was not visible to the cast and crew, and her characterization of Maggie DuBois was playful. Her sister Lana Wood thought that Wood looked the prettiest she ever had, but Lana sensed that the film \\"was physically taxing\\" for Wood.Finstad, 2009, p. 299 On Friday, November 27, the day after Thanksgiving, Wood wrapped the last bit of dialog work, then went home and swallowed a bottle of prescription pills. Groggy from the drugs, she called her friend Mart Crowley who took her to the hospital for emergency treatment. Music for the film was by Henry Mancini, and the costumes were designed by Edith Head. Production design, setting the period and augmenting the visual humor, was by Fernando Carrere who had designed The Great Escape and The Pink Panther for Blake Edwards. Unique slideshow-style title design was by Ken Mundie. =Custom cars= The hero's white car, named the \\"Leslie Special\\" was specially built by Warner Brothers to resemble a Thomas Flyer, the car that won the 1908 New York to Paris Race. According to the Petersen Automotive Museum, four \\"Leslie Specials\\" were built. One of the four is at the Tupelo Automobile Museum in Tupelo, Mississippi, listed as a 1963 Leslie Special Convertible. Another of the four appears painted dark green in the 1970 Warner Brothers film The Ballad of Cable Hogue‚Äîthe grille can be seen bearing the words \\"Leslie Special\\", with the wheels and tires remaining their original white color. This vehicle shows up during the last 30 minutes of the movie carrying a lead character, and has a pivotal role at the end of the movie. The villain's black car was named the \\"Hannibal Twin-8\\"; five were constructed. One is on display at the Petersen Automobile Museum, powered by a Volkswagen industrial engine. Another is at the Volo Auto Museum in Volo, Illinois. This model includes a prop \\"cannon\\" and a working smoke generator. The Volo museum describes the Hannibal Twin-8 as built by Warner Brothers at a cost of US$150,000, powered by a Corvair six-cylinder engine with three-speed manual transmission and six wheels. All four rear wheels are powered by a chain drive. Both vehicles were first on display at Movie World's \\"Cars of the Stars\\" museum in Buena Park, California until the museum closed in the late 1970s. It was located adjacent to the Planes of Fame Museum. =Pie fight= The Technicolor scene for the pie fight in the royal bakery was filmed over five days. The first pastry thrown was part of a large cake decorated for the king's coronation. Following this was the throwing of 4,000 pies, the most pies ever filmed in a pie fight. The scene lasts four minutes and 20 seconds and cost US$200,000 to shoot; US$18,000 just for the pastry. Colorful cream pies with fillings such as raspberry, strawberry, blueberry and lemon were used. For continuity between days of shooting, the actors were photographed at the end of each day and then made up the following morning to have the same colorful appearance, the same smears of pie crust and filling. Edwards told the cast that a pie fight by itself is not funny, so to make it funny they would build tension by having the hero, dressed all in white, fail to get hit with any pies. He said \\"The audience will start yearning for him to get it\\". Finally, the hero was to take a pie in the face at \\"just the right moment\\". Shooting was halted while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled all over the scenery. When the actors returned Monday morning, the set stunk so badly that the building required a thorough cleaning and large fans to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was recreated carefully with more pies, and shooting resumed. At first, the actors had fun with the pie fight assignment, but eventually the process grew wearisome and dangerous. Wood choked briefly on pie filling which hit her open mouth. Lemmon reported that he got knocked out a few times; he said \\"a pie hitting you in the face feels like a ton of cement\\". At the end of shooting, when Edwards called \\"cut!\\", he was barraged with several hundred pies that members of the cast had hidden, waiting for the moment. The pie fight scene paid homage to the early Mack Sennett practice of using a single thrown pie as comedic punctuation, but to a greater degree, it was a celebration of classic movie pie fights such as Behind the Screen (1916) with Charlie Chaplin; The Battle of the Century (1927) starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy; and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (1941) with the Three Stooges. In his script for The Great Race, Edwards called for a \\"Battle of the Century-style pie fight\\". Though Edwards used 4,000 pies over five days, many of these were used as set dressing for continuity. Laurel and Hardy used 3,000 pies in only one day of shooting, so more are seen flying through the air. Leonard Maltin compared The Great Race pie fight to The Battle of the Century and determined that Laurel and Hardy's pacing was far superior, that the more modern film suffered from an \\"incomplete understanding of slapstick\\" while the 1927 pie fight remains \\"one of the great scenes in all of screen comedy.\\" Reception The Great Race was generally not well-received upon release and was considered a critical and commercial flop, making it the first notable failure for director Edwards. Most critics attacked its blatant and overdone slapstick humor and its lack of substance. It also suffered from comparisons with another race-themed \\"epic comedy\\" of 1965, Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. Film critic Richard Schickel wrote that, though the film \\"bumps along very pleasantly for the most part\\", Edwards failed at his attempt to recreate the slapstick atmosphere of a Laurel and Hardy comedy. Schickel felt that Wood was \\"hopelessly miscast\\", and that the energies of Lemmon and Curtis did not quite make the slapstick work. Maltin wrote that Wood \\"never looked better\\" and that the film's comedy sometimes worked but was otherwise forced: \\"a mixed bag\\". It currently has a 74% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite earning theatrical rentals of over $11.4 million in the United States and Canada, due to its high cost, it was loss-making. Soundtrack Before the film was released, the soundtrack was re-recorded in Hollywood by RCA Victor Records for release on vinyl LP. Henry Mancini spent six weeks composing the score, and the recording involved some 80 musicians. Mancini collaborated with lyricist Johnny Mercer on several songs including \\"The Sweetheart Tree\\", a waltz released as a single.

At the 4th Moscow International Film Festival, the film won the Silver Prize. Adaptations Slightly in advance of the film's release, as was the custom of the era, a paperback novelization of the film was published by Dell Books. The author was renowned crime and western novelist Marvin H. Albert, who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. He seems to have been the most prolific screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy. * Dell Movie Classic: The Great Race (March 1966) Legacy The film was a major influence on Wacky Races, a Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. The film's characterizations were rather cartoonish. Furthermore, film editor and sound-effects man Treg Brown, who worked on many classic Warner Brothers cartoons, worked on this film. Brown's sound design won the film an Oscar. In his Top 10 Favorite Comedies, Doug Walker cited Jack Lemmon's performance as Professor Fate as a major influence for his Nostalgia Critic persona. The villain's catchphrase, \\"Push the button, Max!\\" was also adapted by the satirical TV series, Mystery Science Theater 3000 for most of the early seasons as, \\"Push the button, Frank!\\", as an episode closing catchphrase.https://mst3k.fandom.com/wiki/%22Push_the_Button,_Frank!%22 See also * Monte Carlo or Bust!, aka Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies (1969) References External links  * Category:1965 films Category:1960s screwball comedy films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American screwball comedy films Category:American auto racing films Category:Films set in Europe Category:Films set in the 1900s Category:Films directed by Blake Edwards Category:Films with screenplays by Blake Edwards Category:American comedy road movies Category:American slapstick comedy films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films that won the Best Sound Editing Academy Award Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Films adapted into comics Category:1965 comedy films ","title":"The Great Race"},{"id":"265892","text":"Pyrethrum was a genus of several Old World plants now classified as Chrysanthemum or Tanacetum (e.g., C. coccineum) which are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flower heads. Pyrethrum continues to be used as a common name for plants formerly included in the genus Pyrethrum. Pyrethrum is also the name of a natural insecticide made from the dried flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium and Chrysanthemum coccineum. Its active ingredient are pyrethrins. Description Some members of the genus Chrysanthemum, such as the following two, are placed in the genus Tanacetum instead by some botanists. Both genera are members of the daisy (or aster) family, Asteraceae. They are all perennial plants with a daisy-like appearance and white petals. *Tanacetum cinerariifolium Tanacetum cinerariifolium is called the Dalmatian chrysanthemum, denoting its origin in that region of the Balkans (Dalmatia). It looks more like the common daisy than other pyrethrums do. Its flowers, typically white with yellow centers, grow from numerous fairly rigid stems. Plants have blue-green leaves and grow to in height. The plant is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized and the active components, called pyrethrins, contained in the seed cases, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. When present in amounts less than those fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides and are not persistent, being biodegradable and also decompose easily on exposure to light. They are considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food. Kenya produced 90% (over 6,000 tonnes) of the world's pyrethrum in 1998, called py for short. Production in Tanzania and Ecuador is also significant. Currently the world's major producer is Tasmania, Australia. *Tanacetum coccineum'C. coccineum, the Persian chrysanthemum, is a perennial plant native to Caucasus and looks somewhat like a daisy. It produces large white, pink or red flowers. The leaves resemble those of ferns, and the plant grows to between in height. The flowering period is June to July in temperate climates (Northern Hemisphere). C. coccineum also contains insecticidal pyrethrum substances, but it is a poor source compared to C. cinerariifolium. *Other species, such as C. balsamita and C. marshalli, also contain insecticidal substances, but are less effective than the two species mentioned above. Tanacetum cinerariifolium Insecticides =Sprays= Pyrethrum has been used for centuries as an insecticide,Bioaromatica The history of pyrethrum and as a lice remedy in the Middle East (Persian powder, also known as \\"Persian pellitory\\"). It was sold worldwide under the brand Zacherlin by Austrian industrialist J. Zacherl. It is one of the most commonly used non- synthetic insecticides allowed in certified organic agriculture.Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening, by Laura Pickett Pottorff, Colorado State University Cooperative Extension, January 5, 2010. The flowers should be dried and then crushed and mixed with water. *Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum (pyrethrins); one common example is permethrin. A common formulation of pyrethrin is in preparations containing the synthetic chemical piperonyl butoxide: this has the effect of enhancing the toxicity to insects and speeding the effects when compared with pyrethrins used alone. These formulations are known as synergized pyrethrins. Toxicity Rat and rabbit levels for pyrethrum are high, with doses in some cases of about 1% of the animal's body weight required to cause significant mortality. This is similar to fatal levels in synthetic pyrethroids.Pesticide Toxicity Profile: Synthetic Pyrethroid Pesticides, by Frederick M. Fisher, University of Florida IFAS Extension Service, 2013 Nevertheless, pyrethrum should be handled with the same caution as synthetic insecticides.insecticide (botanical, mineral, synthetic) toxicity to mammals Electronic Data Information Source of University of Florida People can be exposed to pyrethrum as a mixture of cinerin, jasmolin, and pyrethrin in the workplace by breathing it in, getting it in the eyes or on the skin, or swallowing it. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for pyrethrum exposure in the workplace as 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 5000 mg/m3, pyrethrum is immediately dangerous to life and health. People exposed to pyrethrum may experience symptoms including pruritus (itching), dermatitis, papules, erythema (red skin), rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, and asthma. People using pyrethrum should wear safety equipment. It is a chemical that should be kept apart from other chemicals. =Companion planting= Because pyrethrum contains pyrethrins and aphid alarm pheromone, they are used as companion plants to repel pest insects from nearby crops and ornamental plants. They are thought to repel aphids, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius), leafhoppers, spider mites, harlequin cabbage bugs, ticks, pickleworms, and imported cabbage worms, among others, in gardens and farms. For example, they are planted among broccoli plants for protection from several common insect pests.

It has been described as \\"probably the most common and influential form that English poetry has taken since the 16th century\\",Jay Parini, The Wadsworth Anthology of Poetry (Cengage Learning, 2005), page 655. and Paul Fussell has estimated that \\"about three quarters of all English poetry is in blank verse\\".Paul Fussell, Poetic Meter and Poetic Form (McGraw-Hill, 1979 revised edition), page 63. The first known use of blank verse in the English language was by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in his translation of the √Üneid (composed c. 1540; published posthumously, 1554‚Äì1557). He may have been inspired by the Latin original as classical Latin verse did not use rhyme; or possibly he was inspired by Ancient Greek verse or the Italian verse form of versi sciolti, both of which also did not use rhyme. The play Arden of Faversham (around 1590 by an unknown author) is a notable example of end- stopped blank verse. History of English blank verse The 1561 play Gorboduc by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville was the first English play to use blank verse. Christopher Marlowe was the first English author to achieve critical notoriety for his use of blank verse. The major achievements in English blank verse were made by William Shakespeare, who wrote much of the content of his plays in unrhymed iambic pentameter, and John Milton, whose Paradise Lost is written in blank verse. Miltonic blank verse was widely imitated in the 18th century by such poets as James Thomson (in The Seasons) and William Cowper (in The Task). Romantic English poets such as William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats used blank verse as a major form. Shortly afterwards, Alfred, Lord Tennyson became particularly devoted to blank verse, using it for example in his long narrative poem \\"The Princess\\", as well as for one of his most famous poems: \\"Ulysses\\". Among American poets, Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens are notable for using blank verse in extended compositions at a time when many other poets were turning to free verse. Marlowe and then Shakespeare developed its potential greatly in the late 16th century. Marlowe was the first to exploit the potential of blank verse for powerful and involved speech: Shakespeare developed this feature, and also the potential of blank verse for abrupt and irregular speech. For example, in this exchange from King John, one blank verse line is broken between two characters: Shakespeare also used enjambment increasingly often in his verse, and in his last plays was given to using feminine endings (in which the last syllable of the line is unstressed, for instance lines 3 and 6 of the following example); all of this made his later blank verse extremely rich and varied. This very free treatment of blank verse was imitated by Shakespeare's contemporaries, and led to general metrical looseness in the hands of less skilled users. However, Shakespearean blank verse was used with some success by John Webster and Thomas Middleton in their plays. Ben Jonson, meanwhile, used a tighter blank verse with less enjambment in his great comedies Volpone and The Alchemist. Blank verse was not much used in the non-dramatic poetry of the 17th century until Paradise Lost, in which Milton used it with much license and tremendous skill. Milton used the flexibility of blank verse, its capacity to support syntactic complexity, to the utmost, in passages such as these: Milton also wrote Paradise Regained and parts of Samson Agonistes in blank verse. In the century after Milton, there are few distinguished uses of either dramatic or non-dramatic blank verse; in keeping with the desire for regularity, most of the blank verse of this period is somewhat stiff. The best examples of blank verse from this time are probably John Dryden's tragedy All for Love and James Thomson's The Seasons. An example notable as much for its failure with the public as for its subsequent influence on the form is John Dyer's The Fleece. At the close of the 18th century, William Cowper ushered in a renewal of blank verse with his volume of kaleidoscopic meditations, The Task, published in 1784. After Shakespeare and Milton, Cowper was the main influence on the next major poets in blank verse, teenagers when Cowper published his masterpiece. These were the Lake Poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wordsworth used the form for many of the Lyrical Ballads (1798 and 1800), and for his longest efforts, The Prelude and The Excursion. Wordsworth's verse recovers some of the freedom of Milton's, but is generally far more regular: Coleridge's blank verse is more technical than Wordsworth's, but he wrote little of it: His so-called \\"conversation Poems\\" such as \\"The Eolian Harp\\" and \\"Frost at Midnight\\" are the best known of his blank verse works. The blank verse of Keats in Hyperion is mainly modelled on that of Milton, but takes fewer liberties with the pentameter and possesses the characteristic beauties of Keats's verse. Shelley's blank verse in The Cenci and Prometheus Unbound is closer to Elizabethan practice than to Milton's. Of the Victorian writers in blank verse, the most prominent are Tennyson and Robert Browning. Tennyson's blank verse in poems like \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"The Princess\\" is musical and regular; his lyric \\"Tears, Idle Tears\\" is probably the first important example of the blank verse stanzaic poem. Browning's blank verse, in poems like \\"Fra Lippo Lippi\\", is more abrupt and conversational. Gilbert and Sullivan's 1884 opera, Princess Ida, is based on Tennyson's \\"The Princess\\". Gilbert's dialogue is in blank verse throughout (although the other 13 Savoy operas have prose dialogue). Below is an extract spoken by Princess Ida after singing her entrance aria \\"Oh, goddess wise\\". Blank verse, of varying degrees of regularity, has been used quite frequently throughout the 20th century in original verse and in translations of narrative verse. Most of Robert Frost's narrative and conversational poems are in blank verse; so are other important poems like Wallace Stevens's \\"The Idea of Order at Key West\\" and \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\", W. B. Yeats's \\"The Second Coming\\", W. H. Auden's \\"The Watershed\\" and John Betjeman's Summoned by Bells. A complete listing is impossible, since a sort of loose blank verse has become a staple of lyric poetry, but it would be safe to say that blank verse is as prominent now as it has been any time in the past three hundred years. The largest English poems as The Fall of Nineveh by Edwin Atherstone and King Alfred by John Fitchett are written in blank verse. Blank verse is also common in German literature. It was used by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in the tragedy Nathan der Weise (Nathan the Wise):German literature. Lines are 10 syllables long or 11 syllables long.

In high school, between the ages of 14 and 16, she was a model for fashion companies and joined many sports in her school. She wanted to be popular, and being a model was not enough; so she then became a smoker. During the last months of Tarbox's life she went around Canada teaching young adults the consequences of smoking. Perhaps most memorably, she emphasized how she was unable to quit smoking even after she found out that she had cancer. Tarbox died at a hospital in Edmonton on May 18, 2003 at the age of 42 from brain cancer and lung cancer. On December 5, 2003, Barb Tarbox was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by Her Excellency, the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson, Governor General of Canada, for devotion to the anti-smoking cause.

It was published in 1996 at the same time as its \\"mirror\\" novel, The Regulators, itself published under King's Richard Bachman pseudonym. It was made into a TV film starring Ron Perlman, Tom Skerritt and Steven Weber in 2006. The two novels represent parallel universes relative to one another, and most of the characters present in one novel's world also exist in the other novel's reality, albeit in different circumstances. Desperation is a story about several people who, while traveling along the desolated Highway 50 in Nevada, get abducted by Collie Entragian, the deputy of the fictional mining town of Desperation. Entragian uses various pretexts for the abductions, from an arrest for drug possession to \\"rescuing\\" a family from a nonexistent gunman. It becomes clear to the captives that Entragian has been possessed by an evil being named Tak, who has control over the surrounding desert wildlife and must change hosts to keep itself alive. They begin to fight for their freedom, sanity and lives before realizing that if they are ever to escape Desperation, they must trap Tak in the place from which he came.  Plot  Peter and Mary Jackson are driving quietly on a desolate Nevada highway when they are pulled over and arrested by the disturbed Collie Entragian. They are taken to the police station of a deserted small mining town named Desperation, where Entragian kills Peter. Several other people are held captive here: the Carver family, whose daughter was also killed by Entragian; Johnny Marinville, a writer who was on a cross-country motorcycle trip to gather new material; and Tom Billingsley, the town veterinarian. Meanwhile, Johnny's assistant Steve, who had been trailing him at a distance, finds Johnny's bike and searches for him with Cynthia, a hitchhiker. Entragian takes Ellen Carver with him, and during his absence, the intensely devout Carver son, David, manages to free everyone, and the party takes him on as a spiritual guide. They take refuge in an abandoned theater and are joined by Steve, Cynthia and Audrey, an employee of the mine. They realize that they are the only survivors of a wave of carnage committed by an evil supernatural entity named Tak. Tak had been imprisoned in an old mine shaft and can take possession of human beings, but this state quickly deteriorates the host and requires it to change hosts. Tak can also manipulate desert wildlife such as coyotes, buzzards, spiders and scorpions. Billingsley is killed by a cougar controlled by Tak, and Audrey, also under its influence, attempts to kill David. She nearly succeeds in strangling him, but is prevented by the intervention of Steve and Johnny. Tak occupies Ellen's body and takes Mary captive. The survivors contemplate leaving the town, but David, having come out of a trance, reveals to them that God has other plans for them. Mary takes advantage of the rapid deterioration of Ellen's body to escape her, and upon Ellen's death, Tak occupies the body of a golden eagle. The group gather some ANFO to blow up the well from which Tak escaped. Tak attacks David, but kills his self-sacrificing father Ralph. Johnny prevents the now-orphaned David from giving his own life, and takes his place by blowing up the well and sealing Tak inside. David, Mary, Steve and Cynthia begin to leave the town of Desperation. While in Mary's car, David finds in his pocket the hall pass from his previous \\"deal with God\\" with a message from Johnny written on it.

Writing and release  Stephen King was inspired to write Desperation as a result of a cross-country drive in 1991, during which he visited the small desert community of Ruth, Nevada, near U.S. 50. His first thought was that the town's inhabitants were all dead. He then wondered who had killed them, and the idea occurred to him that the town's sheriff had done so.StephenKing.com: Inspiration for Desperation Desperation was released simultaneously with the novel The Regulators (published by King under the name Richard Bachman).  Connections to other King works  *The term can-toi is used in the Dark Tower series to describe the Low Men in Yellow Coats, which are strange animal-human hybrids. *In the Dark Tower short story \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\", the vampiric Sisters speak to each other in a language Roland does not recognize.

The distance between the two peninsulas is about . The body is named after Tiran Island located at its entrance from the Sinai, on which the Multinational Force and Observers has an observation post to monitor the compliance of Egypt in maintaining freedom of navigation of the straits as provided under the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty. Sanafir Island lies to the east of Tiran, southeast of the shallow strait between Tiran and Saudi Arabia.  Background  International documents inconsistently refer to both the \\"Straits of Tiran\\" and the \\"Strait of Tiran\\". There are several passages formed by the islands between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The westernmost strait, between Egypt and the island of Tiran, overlooked by the Egyptian city Sharm el-Sheikh is the \\"Strait of Tiran\\", wide. It has two passages deep enough to be navigable by large ships. The Enterprise passage, deep, is adjacent to the Egyptian side, while the deep Grafton passage, surrounded by shallows, is to the east, nearer to the island of Tiran. To the east of Tiran, between it and Saudi Arabia, the other strait has reefs and shallows with a single channel deep.  Closure in 1967  Access to Jordan's only seaport of Aqaba and to Israel's only Red Sea seaport of Eilat is through the Gulf of Aqaba, which gives the Straits of Tiran strategic importance.Robert Priewasser, Tiran Island and Straits of Tiran. Unexplained Sovereignty over an Island in the Context of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (Saarbr√ºcken: Akademikerverlag, 2013) In 1967, ninety percent of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran, making it a target of Egyptian blockade during the Arab League boycott of Israel. In May 1967, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol repeated declarations that Israel had made in 1957, saying that closure of the Straits of Tiran would be an act of war.Neff, David. Warriors for Jerusalem: The Six Days that Changed the Middle East, p. 88 (Simon & Schuster, 1984): \\"In separate messages to the leading maritime powers, Eshkol warned: 'Israel would stop short of nothing to cancel the blockade. It is essential that President Nasser should not have any illusions.'\\"\\"Statement to the General Assembly by Foreign Minister Meir, 1 March 1957\\" (Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs): \\"Interference, by armed force, with ships of Israeli flag exercising free and innocent passage in the Gulf of Aqaba and through the Straits of Tiran will be regarded by Israel as an attack entitling it to exercise its inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter and to take all such measures as are necessary to ensure the free and innocent passage of its ships in the Gulf and in the Straits.\\" Egypt then blockaded the straits on May 22, 1967, and oil tankers that were due to pass through the straits were required to submit documents ensuring their cargo was not destined for an Israeli port. At that time, Israel viewed the Straits of Tiran as a vital interest as it is where Israel received vital imports, mainly oil from Iran, and a blockade threatened Israel's ability to develop the Negev. In May 1967, Major General Indar Jit Rikhye was the commander of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai peninsula when Egypt deployed its own troops in that territory and demanded that Rikhye withdraw all of his troops. Rikhye did withdraw, including from the port at Sharm el Sheikh adjacent to the straits. The subsequent closure of the Tiran Straits by Egypt was closely linked to the preceding UNEF withdrawal, because having the peacekeepers (rather than the Egyptian military) at Sharm el Sheik was important for keeping that waterway open. Later in life, General Rikhye sought to downplay the importance that Israel attached to keeping that waterway open, saying that Israel's accusation in 1967 of a blockade was \\"questionable\\" given that an Israeli-flagged ship had not passed through the straits in two years, and that \\"The U.A.R. [Egyptian] navy had searched a couple of ships after the establishment of the blockade and thereafter relaxed its implementation\\". Egypt had initially requested UNEF withdrawal from locations other than Sharm el-Sheik,Quigley, John (December 2012). The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defense, Kindle Location 485.

His son Baron Carl Erik Mannerheim came to Finland in the latter part of 18th century and the family was immatriculated in Finland in 1818. =Comital lineage= (number 8 in the register of the Finnish House of Nobility) Baron Carl Erik Mannerheim (1759‚Äì1837) was the son of Baron Johan Augustin Mannerheim. Born in S√§ter, Carl Erik was part of the Anjala League, an opposition movement during the reign of Gustav III of Sweden. However, he received an amnesty and emigrated to Finland, where he purchased Louhisaari manor in 1795. In 1805, he was elected Chairman of the Finnish Economic Society. At the beginning of Russian rule in Finland, he was chairman of the delegation accounting for matters in Finland to Tsar Alexander I. He served as Vice-President of the Senate of Finland's Economic Department (i.e., de facto head of government), and Governor of Turku and Pori provinces. He was also first Major of the √Öbo province infantry regiment. He was given the hereditary title of Count (in Finnish Kreivi, in Swedish Greve) in 1824 and introduced in 1825. The title is inherited by the eldest son. The family was reintroduced in the Swedish nobility in 1947 and 1953. {  Mannerheim family arms  Mannerheim family arms (Swedish barons)  Mannerheim family arms (Finnish barons)  Mannerheim family arms (Finnish counts) } Members *Anna Maria Mannerheim, wife of Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld *Augustin Marhein *Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (1797‚Äì1854) - Finnish entomologist and governor *Carl Robert Mannerheim (1835‚Äì1914) - Finnish aristocrat and businessman *Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1867‚Äì1951) - soldier, statesman, and President of Finland; grandson of the entomologist *Henrik Marhein *Johan Augustin Mannerheim *Sophie Mannerheim See also *Swedish-speaking Finns References Mannerheim family ","title":"Mannerheim (family)"},{"id":"265910","text":"All Saints Day in New Orleans -- Decorating the Tombs in One of the City Cemeteries, an 1885 engraving. Saint Louis Cemetery (, ) is the name of three Roman Catholic cemeteries in New Orleans, Louisiana. Most of the graves are above-ground vaults constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Cemeteries No. 1 and No. 2 are included on the National Register of Historic Placeshttps://www.nps.gov/nr/research/ and the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.http://www.crt.louisiana.gov/tourism/pressroom/history-and- heritage/african-american-heritage-trail/index Saint Louis No. 1 Vaults in Saint Louis No. 1 St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is the oldest and most famous. It was opened in 1789, replacing the city's older St. Peter Cemetery (; no longer in existence) as the main burial ground when the city was redesigned after a fire in 1788. It is 8 blocks from the Mississippi River, on the north side of Basin Street, one block beyond the inland border of the French Quarter. It borders the Iberville housing project. It has been in continuous use since its foundation. The nonprofit group Save Our Cemeteries and commercial businesses offer tours for a fee. Famous New Orleanians buried in St. Louis No. 1 include Etienne de Bor√©, wealthy pioneer of the sugar industry and the first mayor of New Orleans; Homer Plessy, the plaintiff from the landmark 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision on civil rights. Ernest N. \\"Dutch\\" Morial, the first African-American mayor of New Orleans was interred there in 1989. Subsequently Morial's family built a new family tomb at St. Louis Cemetery No. 3, and Morial's body was reinterred there in late 2014. The renowned Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau is believed to be interred in the Glapion family crypt. Other notable New Orleanians here include Bernard de Marigny, the French- Creole aristocrat and politician who founded both the Faubourg Marigny and Mandeville, Louisiana; Barthelemy Lafon, the architect and surveyor who allegedly became one of Jean Lafitte's pirates; and Paul Morphy, one of the earliest world champions of chess. Delphine LaLaurie, the notoriously cruel slave owner, is also believed to lie in rest here. Architect and engineer Benjamin Latrobe was buried at St. Louis No. 1 after dying from yellow fever in 1820, while doing engineering for the New Orleans water works. In 2010, actor Nicolas Cage purchased a pyramid-shaped tomb to be his future final resting place. The cemetery spans just one square block but is the resting place of many thousands. A Protestant section (generally not vaulted) lies in the northwest section. Effective March 1, 2015, the Roman Catholic Diocese of New Orleans, which owns and manages this cemetery, has closed it to the general public, ostensibly because of the rise in vandalism there. However, in a controversial move, the diocese is now charging tour companies for access ($4,500 per year, or lesser amounts for short periods). Families who own tombs can apply for a pass to visit. Saint Louis No. 2 A view between the vaults at cemetery 3 St. Louis No. 2 is located some three blocks back from St. Louis No. 1, bordering Claiborne Avenue. It was consecrated in 1823. A number of notable jazz and rhythm & blues musicians are buried here, including Danny Barker and Ernie K. Doe. Also entombed here is Andre Cailloux (1825-1863), African-American Union hero and martyr of the American Civil War. The cemetery received minor flooding during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and its tombs seemed virtually untouched by the storm when the water went down, aside from the brownish waterline visible on all structures that were flooded. There are many notable citizens of 19th and 20th century New Orleans laid to rest here. These include the Venerable Mother Henriette DeLille, who is a candidate for sainthood by the Catholic Church, and Jean Baptiste Dupeire (1795‚Äì1874) prominent citizen of New Orleans, among others. It was listed in National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Other politicians and soldiers interred/entombed here: * Jacques Viller√© (1761-1830) of St. Bernard Parish, La. Second Governor of Louisiana after statehood, commander of the 1st Division, La. State Militia, at the Battle of New Orleans. * Oscar Dunn (1826-1871) Emancipated from slavery as a child, he became the first elected black lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. * Pierre Soul√© (1801‚Äì1870) of New Orleans, Orleans Parish, La. Born in France. Member of Louisiana state senate, 1845; U.S. Senator from Louisiana, 1847, 1849‚Äì53; U.S. Minister to Spain, 1853‚Äì55; officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

He seized power with the help of the United States, and declared himself \\"President for Life\\" at age 87 in January 1908, and was exiled in December of that year. Saint Louis No. 3 St. Louis No. 3 is located some back from the French Quarter, some 30 blocks from the Mississippi, fronting Esplanade Avenue near Bayou St. John. It opened in 1854. The crypts on average are more elaborate than at the other St. Louis cemeteries, including a number of fine 19th century marble tombs. Those entombed include ragtime composer Paul Sarebresole, photographer E. J. Bellocq, and painter Ralston Crawford. Also, one of the most famous to be entombed here, is Sweet Emma Barrett [1897-1983], a very gifted self-taught piano player and singer, who helped make New Orleans Jazz the treasure as we know it to be. New Orleans mayor Ernest N. \\"Dutch\\" Morial was reinterred at St. Louis Cemetery No. 3 in a new tomb for the Morial family. St. Louis No. 3 also includes a Greek Orthodox section. The cemetery was heavily flooded during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but its tombs escaped relatively unscathed. There was some plaster damage from debris.

Other members throughout the band's existence were former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch (bass), Dave Stead (drums) and Dave Rotheray (guitar). The band's original material was written by the team of Heaton and Rotheray. After the band's first album (recorded as a quintet), they were joined by a succession of female vocalists. All of the following artists performed lead and backing vocals alongside Heaton and Hemingway ‚Äì Briana Corrigan for albums two and three after appearing as a guest vocalist on one, followed by Jacqui Abbott for the fourth to seventh albums, and finally Alison Wheeler for the final three Beautiful South albums. The group broke up in January 2007, claiming the split was due to \\"musical similarities\\", having sold around 15 million records worldwide. History =Formation= Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway had initially come to attention as (respectively) the lead singer and \\"singing drummer\\" of the successful Hull jangle pop band The Housemartins, who had scored seven UK Top 40 singles and two Top 10 albums between 1986 and 1988. (Heaton was with the Housemartins for their entire existence; Hemingway joined in time for their second and final album.) The band was known for blending overt socialist politics and a form of Christianity, having baited the British monarchy, the building industry and South African apartheid in their songs as well as including gospel elements in their music. The Housemartins often claimed to have set a fixed lifespan for themselves, and the members duly brought the band to an end in 1988 at the height of its success. Heaton and Hemingway immediately began work on setting up a new band, naming it \\"The Beautiful South\\" as a sarcastic comment on their staunch Northern roots. The third initial bandmember was Dave Rotheray, a songwriting guitarist who'd previously played with Hemingway in two other Hull bands, The Newpolitans and The Velvetones. At the time Rotheray was studying for a PhD at the University of Hull and living on Grafton Street, where Heaton also lived. Rotheray and Heaton became the songwriting team for The Beautiful South, which was conceived as a quintet with Heaton and Hemingway (who was no longer drumming) as the two lead singers. The core band was completed by Dave Stead (ex- Luddites/Vicious Circle) on drums, and former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass guitar. Also important to the band's sound was studio keyboard player Damon Butcher ‚Äî though never an official member of the group, he would end up playing virtually all the piano and keyboard parts on the band's albums. =Debut album release= Their first album Welcome to the Beautiful South was released in 1989, and promptly produced a Number 2 UK Singles Chart hit, \\"Song For Whoever\\". With the follow-up single \\"You Keep It All In\\" reaching number 8 and \\"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\\" reaching number 31, the band were soon set to equal or surpass the success of The Housemartins, while the songwriting built on and expanded the trenchant social critiques which the previous band had been known for (topics included nationalism, domestic violence, football hooliganism and the self-serving industry of love songs, and the album's disturbing cover art also drew attention). Northern Irish singer Briana Corrigan was featured as a background vocalist on the album. Her contributions proved so successful that she was soon promoted to full membership status, as the band's third vocalist. = Choke = In 1990, the Beautiful South released their second album, Choke. Two singles‚Äî\\"My Book\\" and \\"Let Love Speak Up Itself\\"‚Äîcharted outside the Top 40, but the album also provided the band's only Number 1 hit, a Hemingway/Corrigan duet called \\"A Little Time\\". The video, featuring the aftermath of a domestic fight, won the 1991 BRIT Award for Best Video. =Third album and Corrigan's departure= The band's third album 0898 Beautiful South followed in 1992. It provided another Top 20 hit in the shape of \\"Bell Bottomed Tear\\" as well as two further Top 30 hits, \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" and \\"We Are Each Other\\", although a fourth single \\"36D\\" only placed in the Top 50. \\"We Are Each Other\\" also became the band's biggest hit in the United States, peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1992. Both Choke and 0898 Beautiful South illustrated the growing fullness of the band's sound. Both featured Pete Thoms and Gary Barnacle as regular contributors on brass and woodwind, and also featured Corrigan as lead vocalist on several tracks. Her contribution helped to characterise the bittersweet kitchen sink dramas played out in the band's often barbed songs, and allowed Heaton and Rotheray to explore and express female perspectives in their songwriting. However, the latter approach had mixed success, demonstrated later in 1992 when Corrigan chose to leave the band to pursue a solo career. Although her decision was partly prompted by a desire to record and promote her own material (which was not getting exposure within The Beautiful South), she had also had ethical disagreements over some of Heaton's lyrics, most notably \\"Mini-correct\\", \\"Worthless Lie\\" and the 0898 Beautiful South single \\"36D\\", which criticised the British glamour industry via scathing comments about glamour models. Five years later, Hemingway would admit \\"we all agree that we should have targeted the media as sexist instead of blaming the girls for taking off their tops\\". =Jacqui Abbott joins the group= In 1994, St Helens supermarket shelf-stacker Jacqui Abbott was brought on board to fill in as the new third lead vocalist for the band. Heaton had heard her sing at an after-show party in St Helens and remembered her vocal talents. Heaton referred to her as \\"the lass from the glass\\"‚Äîa reference to the Pilkington factory in St Helens. Abbott's first album with the band was Miaow in the same year. Hits included \\"Good as Gold (Stupid as Mud)\\" and a cover of Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\", previously popularised by Harry Nilsson. = Carry On Up the Charts = November 1994 saw the release of Carry on up the Charts, a \\"best of\\" compilation consisting of the singles to date plus new track \\"One Last Love Song\\". Released at a time when the group's album sales had been waning, the album was a huge commercial success. It secured the Christmas number one spot on the charts and became the second-best selling album of the year. In 1995, the band was one of the support acts for R.E.M. on the British leg of their world tour. On this tour the band played an extra night when Oasis pulled out of their Huddersfield appearance. The Beautiful South played \\"Some Might Say\\" and dedicated it to any Oasis fans at the gig. = Blue Is the Colour = The 1996 album Blue Is the Colour sold over a million copies, and featured hit singles \\"Rotterdam\\" and \\"Don't Marry Her\\". The album demonstrated the band's gradual shift towards a country music sound, and was well received by the public and on BBC and commercial radio. In 1997, the Beautiful South headlined stadium concerts for the first and last time, in Huddersfield and at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. Support for the Huddersfield concert was provided by Cast and the Lightning Seeds. = Quench = The album Quench (1998) was released with similar commercial success, again reaching number one in the UK album charts. \\"Perfect 10\\", the first single to be released from the album, also provided the band with further singles chart success. The album is also notable for being more uptempo, and being the first on which Heaton and Hemingway's former Housemartins colleague Norman Cook was used in a consultancy role. = Painting It Red release and Abbott's departure= Although 2000's Painting It Red album reached Number 2 in the UK charts, the band suffered difficulties in its promotion and in touring, and a substantial number of the CDs were faulty. Jacqui Abbott left the band in the same year, discouraged by the pressures of touring and needing to concentrate on looking after her son, who had just been diagnosed with autism. After completing their tour obligations, the band marked time with a second greatest-hits album (Solid Bronze) in 2001, and took time off to refresh themselves. Heaton embarked on a solo career under the Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crakerman) alias and released the Fat Chance album in 2001. It did not sell well, despite being critically acclaimed, and was reissued under Heaton's own name the following year. = Gaze = The Beautiful South regrouped in 2003, with new recruit Alison Wheeler taking on the role of female singer. This lineup recorded Gaze in 2003, following it with 2004's Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs, an album of unusually arranged cover tunes including \\"Livin' Thing\\", \\"You're The One That I Want\\", \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\" and \\"I'm Stone in Love With You\\". One track from the album, \\"This Old Skin\\", was presented as a cover of a song by an obscure band called \\"The Heppelbaums\\"; it was later revealed to be an original Heaton/Rotheray composition. =Final album released= The final Beautiful South album Superbi was released on 15 May 2006. It was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios, a farm in Bakewell and at producer Ian Stanley's studio in Enniskerry, County Wicklow. It was mixed by Bill Price (Sex Pistols, Clash, Guns N' Roses). Paul Heaton's hand is recognisable in quirky song titles such as \\"The Rose of My Cologne\\", \\"The Cat Loves The Mouse\\" and \\"Never Lost A Chicken to a Fox\\". The first single, \\"Manchester\\", started off as a poem‚Äî\\"If rain makes Britain great, then Manchester is greater\\"‚Äî\\"a sodden tribute\\" to the city in which he now lived, said Heaton. =Split= After a band meeting on 30 January 2007, they decided to split. They released a statement on 31 January 2007, in which they joked that their reasons for splitting were \\"musical similarities\\"‚Äîan ironic reference to \\"musical differences\\" which are often cited as the reason for a band's split. \\"The band would like to thank everyone for their 19 wonderful years in music\\", the statement also said. In May 2007, the band's music was used in a jukebox musical entitled The Slide (book by Adrian Davis). It was premiered at the Wyvern Theatre, Swindon.  After the Beautiful South  = Paul Heaton solo = With the 2007 dissolution of The Beautiful South, Heaton formed a new band \\"The Sound of Paul Heaton\\". Heaton's second solo album The Cross Eyed Rambler was released on 7 July 2008, and was preceded by the single \\"Mermaids and Slaves\\" on 30 June, and he toured in support of it throughout July. The album charted at number 43. Heaton released his third solo album, Acid Country in September 2010. In 2011, the Manchester International Festival endorsed the writing by Heaton of an anthology of songs based on the 7 deadly sins, to be called The 8th. The song was broken down into a section for each sin, which was to be performed by a different artist. The singers for the original piece were: Wayne Gidden, Aaron Wright, King Creosote, Simon Aldred, Cherry Ghost, Jacqui Abbott, Yvonne Shelton, and Mike Greaves. The individual sections were incorporated with a narration written by Che Walker. The 8th debuted in July 2011 at the Festival Pavilion Theatre in Manchester's Albert Square. After the debut, six further performances of The 8th were announced for the Summer of 2012. = David Rotheray solo and Homespun = Dave Rotheray continued his work with Homespun for another year, before splitting the band in 2008 to pursue a solo career. Rotheray announced the release of his first 'solo' album The Life of Birds for 16 August 2010, on the Proper Music label.Never Enough Notes Although ostensibly a solo effort, the record featured collaborations with ten different singer/songwriters including Alasdair Roberts, Jim Causley, Eliza Carthy and Camille O'Sullivan. = Briana Corrigan solo = After leaving the band in 1992, Corrigan moved to Dublin, Ireland, where she wrote and recorded an album with Dave Couse. The album was never released, although both have recorded songs from that period in later solo works. She was also part of the Dublin music collective, Lokomotive, which released a number of singles on an independent label. Corrigan then stepped away from the music industry to secure a master's degree in Creative writing from Queen's University Belfast and split her time between bringing up her young family, acting and writing. In 2006, she performed in the first Irish tour of 'Mum's The Word' ‚Äì a West End hit described by The Stage magazine as \\"a wickedly funny account of motherhood that nobody should miss\\". In 2006, she returned to the studio to write and record a new album. The end result was the 2012 album, Red Bird, released on her own label, Redbird & Anchor Records. The same year she wrote her first play which toured nationally throughout Ireland and Scotland in Autumn, 2012. = Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott = Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbot worked together in June 2011 when she performed in his musical The 8th, then in 2013 they reunited to record new material. The result, What Have We Become?, was released on 19 May 2014, and reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart. On working with Abbott once again, Heaton said: \\"Working with Jacqui again was like going into your garage and discovering a beautiful, covered up Rolls Royce that hadn't been started in years. Jacqui is one of the best singers I've worked with and is also part of my past. It was only a matter of time before I asked her.\\" Abbott and Heaton toured the UK and Ireland in May and June 2014 performing at sold-out shows including London's Shepherd's Bush Empire, The Lowry in Salford, and Hull City Hall. The tour and album campaign saw the pair make publicity appearances on a variety of TV and radio programmes, including The One Show, Live at Edinburgh Castle, Sunday Night Live at the Palladium, Aled Jones' ITV show Weekend, Channel 4's Sunday Brunch, and Pointless Celebrities. On Sunday 29 June 2014 they appeared live on BBC Two at Glastonbury Festival performing acoustic versions of second single \\"Moulding Of A Fool\\" and a cover version of Dolly Parton's \\"Islands in the Stream\\". During the summer of 2014, Paul and Jacqui performed at a series of festivals across the UK and Ireland including Glastonbury Festival, Latitude Festival, V Festival and Festival No.6. On 11 November 2014, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a world premiere of \\"Real Hope\\", featuring The Grimethorpe Colliery Band, from the deluxe edition of What Have We Become?. In November 2014 the pair toured the UK with sold out shows across the country, including at London's The Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo and Sheffield City Hall. In 2015 Abbott and Heaton released a second album, Wisdom, Laughter and Lines, with a third, Crooked Calypso, following in 2017. Their fourth album, Manchester Calling, was released in March 2020 and went straight to No 1 in the UK album chart. = The South = In 2008, former Beautiful South members Dave Hemingway, Dave Stead and Alison Wheeler formed \\"The New Beautiful South\\", along with long-time collaborators keyboardist Damon Butcher, saxophonist Gaz Birtles and trumpeter Tony Robinson. In 2010, the band changed its name to \\"The South\\". The band performs songs by The Beautiful South, as well as writing and releasing new material. The debut South album, Sweet Refrains, was recorded at CowShed Studios in London during June and July 2012. Dave Hemingway's departure from The South was announced 2 February 2017, with Damon Butcher also departing the band around the same time. As of 2019, The South is fronted by Alison Wheeler and Gaz Birtles.

Owing to the influence from calligraphy, italics normally slant slightly to the right. Italics are a way to emphasise key points in a printed text, to identify many types of creative works, to cite foreign words or phrases, or, when quoting a speaker, a way to show which words they stressed. One manual of English usage described italics as \\"the print equivalent of underlining\\"; in other words, underscore in a manuscript directs a typesetter to use italic. The name comes from the fact that calligraphy-inspired typefaces were first designed in Italy, to replace documents traditionally written in a handwriting style called chancery hand. Aldus Manutius and Ludovico Arrighi (both between the 15th and 16th centuries) were the main type designers involved in this process at the time. Different glyph shapes from Roman type are usually usedanother influence from calligraphyand upper-case letters may have swashes, flourishes inspired by ornate calligraphy. An alternative is oblique type, in which the type is slanted but the letterforms do not change shape: this less elaborate approach is used by many sans-serif typefaces. History Niccoli's cursive script, which developed into Italic type. Catherine of Siena, Epistole (\\"Letters\\"), published in Venice by Aldo Manuzio in September 1500: illustrated table in which appear the first words ever printed in italics: iesus, inside the heart in the left hand and iesu dolce iesu amore inside the book in the right hand. Aldus Manutius' italic, in a 1501 edition of Virgil. The initial is hand-lettered. Italic type was first used by Aldus Manutius and his press in Venice in 1500. Manutius intended his italic type to be used not for emphasis but for the text of small, easily carried editions of popular books (often poetry), replicating the style of handwritten manuscripts of the period. The choice of using italic type, rather than the roman type in general use at the time, was apparently made to suggest informality in editions designed for leisure reading. Manutius' italic type was cut by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo (who later following a dispute with Manutius claimed to have conceived it). It replicated handwriting of the period following from the style of Niccol√≤ de' Niccoli, possibly even Manutius' own.Berthold Louis Ullman, The origin and development of humanistic script, Rome, 1960, p. 77 The first use in a complete volume was a 1501 edition of Virgil dedicated to Italy, although it had been briefly used in the frontispiece of a 1500 edition of Catherine of Siena's letters. In 1501, Aldus wrote to his friend Scipio: Manutius' italic was different in some ways from modern italics, being conceived for the specific use of replicating the layout of contemporary calligraphers like Pomponio Leto and Bartolomeo Sanvito. The capital letters were upright capitals on the model of Roman square capitals, shorter than the ascending lower-case italic letters, and were used at the start of each line followed by a clear space before the first lower-case letter. While modern italics are often more condensed than roman types, historian Harry Carter describes Manutius' italic as about the same width as roman type. To replicate handwriting, Griffo cut at least sixty-five tied letters (ligatures) in the Aldine Dante and Virgil of 1501. Italic typefaces of the following century used varying but reduced numbers of ligatures. Italic type rapidly became very popular and was widely (and inaccurately) imitated. The Venetian Senate gave Aldus exclusive right to its use, a patent confirmed by three successive Popes, but it was widely counterfeited as early as 1502. Griffo, who had left Venice in a business dispute, cut a version for printer Girolamo Soncino, and other copies appeared in Italy and in Lyons. The Italians called the character Aldino, while others called it Italic. Italics spread rapidly; historian H. D. L. Vervliet dates the first production of italics in Paris to 1512. Some printers of Northern Europe used home-made supplements to add characters not used in Italian, or mated it to alternative capitals, including Gothic ones. A page from La Operina by Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, showing the chancery writing style.Jan van Krimpen's Cancelleresca Bastarda, a twentieth-century revival of the chancery italic style. Besides imitations of Griffo's italic and its derivatives, a second wave appeared of \\"chancery\\" italics, most popular in Italy, which Vervliet describes as being based on \\"a more deliberate and formal handwriting [with] longer ascenders and descenders, sometimes with curved or bulbous terminals, and [often] only available in the bigger sizes.\\" Chancery italics were introduced around 1524 by Arrighi, a calligrapher and author of a calligraphy textbook who began a career as a printer in Rome, and also by Giovanni Antonio Tagliente of Venice, with imitations rapidly appearing in France by 1528. Chancery italics faded as a style over the course of the sixteenth century, although revivals were made beginning in the twentieth century. Chancery italics may have backward- pointing serifs or round terminals pointing forwards on the ascenders. Italic capitals with a slope were introduced in the sixteenth century. The first printer known to have used them was Johann or Johannes Singriener in Vienna in 1524, and the practice spread to Germany, France and Belgium. Particularly influential in the switch to sloped capitals as a general practice was Robert Granjon, a prolific and extremely precise French punchcutter particularly renowned for his skill in cutting italics. Vervliet comments that among punchcutters in France \\"the main name associated with the change is Granjon's.\\" The evolution of use of italic to show emphasis happened in the sixteenth century and was a clear norm by the seventeenth. The trend of presenting types as matching in typefounders' specimens developed also over this period. Italics developed stylistically over the following centuries, tracking changing tastes in calligraphy and type design. One major development that slowly became popular from the end of the seventeenth century was a switch to an open form h matching the n, a development seen in the Romain du roi type of the 1690s, replacing the folded, closed-form h of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century italics, and sometimes simplification of the entrance stroke. Examples Here is an example of normal (roman) and true italics text: Example text set in both roman and italic type Here is the same text as oblique text: The same example text set in oblique type True italic styles are traditionally somewhat narrower than roman fonts. Below are some examples, besides the slant, of other possible differences between roman and italic type that vary according to how the types are designed. (The graphics illustrate transformations from roman to italic.) Image:One-story-a.svga \\"round\\" or one-storey a, Image:E-curved-bowl.svgan e whose bowl is curved rather than pointed, Image:F-tail.svgan f with a tail (known as a descender), Image:k-loop-or-ballterminal.svga k with a looped bowl, a k with a ball terminal, Image:P-intersect.svga p with an intersection at the stem (ascender), Image:Vw-swash-curve.svga v and w with swashes and curved bottoms, Image:Z-stress.svga z with the stress on the horizontal strokes as opposed to the diagonal vertical one. Cyrillic characters in italics and nonitalics None of these differences are required in an italic; some, like the \\"p\\" variant, do not show up in the majority of italic fonts, while others, like the \\"a\\" and \\"f\\" variants, are in almost every italic. Other common differences include: * Double-loop g replaced by single-loop version. * Different closing height where the forked stroke intersects with the stem (e.g. : a, b, d, g, p, q, r, √æ). * Bracketed serifs (if any) replaced by hooked serifs. * Tail of Q replaced by tilde (as in, for example, the Garamond typeface). Less common differences include a descender on the z and a ball on the finishing stroke of an h, which curves back to resemble a b somewhat. Sometimes the w is of a form taken from old German typefaces, in which the left half is of the same form as the n and the right half is of the same form as the v in the same typeface. There also exist specialised ligatures for italics, such as when sp is formed by a curl atop the s that reaches the small ascender at the top of the p. In addition to these differences in shape of letters, italic lowercases usually lack serifs at the bottoms of strokes, since a pen would bounce up to continue the action of writing. Instead they usually have one-sided serifs that curve up on the outstroke (contrast the flat two-sided serifs of a roman font). One uncommon exception to this is Hermann Zapf's Melior. (Its outstroke serifs are one-sided, but they don't curve up.) Four ampersands in regular and italic styles. Outside the regular alphabet, there are other italic types for symbols: * Ampersand resembles an ET ligature more than the Roman version (e.g.: ITC Garamond) * Asterisk is rotated instead of slanted (e.g.: Bookman Old Style, ITC Garamond). * Question mark resembles a reversed Latin S. Usage A common view of when to use italics and bold text. An additional option for emphasis is to use small capitals for a word or name to stand out. * Emphasis: \\"Smith wasn't the guilty party, it's true\\". This is called stress in speech. * The titles of works that stand by themselves, such as books (including those within a larger series), albums, paintings, plays, television shows, movies, and periodicals: \\"He wrote his thesis on The Scarlet Letter\\". Works that appear within larger works, such as short stories, poems, newspaper articles, songs, and television episodes are not italicised, but merely set off in quotation marks. When italics are unavailable, such as on a typewriter or websites that do not support formatting, an underscore or quotes are often used instead. * The names of ships: \\"The Queen Mary sailed last night.\\" * Foreign words, including the Latin binomial nomenclature in the taxonomy of living organisms: \\"A splendid coq au vin was served\\"; \\"Homo sapiens\\". * The names of newspaper and magazine companies: \\"My favorite magazine is Psychology Today, and my favorite newspaper is the Chicago Tribune.\\" * Mentioning a word as an example of a word rather than for its semantic content (see use‚Äìmention distinction): \\"The word the is an article\\". ** Using a letter or number mentioned as itself: *** John was annoyed; they had forgotten the h in his name once again. *** When she saw her name beside the 1 on the rankings, she finally had proof that she was the best. * Introducing or defining terms, especially technical terms or those used in an unusual or different way: \\"Freudian psychology is based on the ego, the super-ego, and the id.\\"; \\"An even number is one that is a multiple of 2.\\" * Sometimes in novels to indicate a character's thought process: \\"This can't be happening, thought Mary.\\" * Italics are used in the King James Version to de-emphasise words \\"that have no equivalent in the original text but that are necessary in English\\". * Algebraic symbols (constants and variables) are conventionally typeset in italics: \\"The solution is x = 2.\\" * Symbols for physical quantities and mathematical constants: \\"The speed of light, c, is approximately equal to 3.00√ó108 m/s.\\".

Oblique type compared to italics Three sans-serif italics. News Gothic, a 1908 grotesque design, has an oblique 'italic', like many designs of the period. Gothic Italic no. 124, an 1890s grotesque, has a crisp true italic resembling Didone serif families of the period. Seravek, a modern humanist family, has a more informal italic in the style of handwriting. Oblique type (or slanted roman, sloped roman) is type that is slanted, but lacking cursive letterforms, with features like a non-descending f and double-storey a, unlike \\"true italics\\". Many sans-serif typefaces use oblique designs (sometimes called \\"sloped roman\\" styles) instead of italic ones; some have both italic and oblique variants. Type designers have described oblique type as less organic and calligraphic than italics, which in some situations may be preferred. Contemporary type designer Jeremy Tankard stated that he had avoided a true italic 'a' and 'e' in his sans-serif Bliss due to finding them \\"too soft\\", while Hoefler and Frere-Jones have described obliques as more \\"keen and insistent\\" than true italics. Adrian Frutiger has described obliques as more appropriate to the aesthetic of sans-serifs than italics. In contrast, Martin Majoor has argued that obliques do not contrast enough from the regular style. Almost all modern serif fonts have true italic designs. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of type foundries such as American Type Founders and Genzsch & Heyse offered serif typefaces with oblique rather than italic designs, especially display typefaces but these designs (such as Genzsch Antiqua) have mostly disappeared. An exception is American Type Founders' Bookman, offered in some releases with the oblique of its metal type version. An unusual example of an oblique font from the inter-war period is the display face Koch Antiqua. With a partly-oblique lower case, it also makes the italic capitals inline in the style of blackletter capitals in the larger sizes of the metal type. It was developed by Rudolph Koch, a type designer who had previously specialised in blackletter font design (which does not use italics); Walter Tracy described his design as \\"uninhibited by the traditions of roman and italic\\". The printing historian and artistic director Stanley Morison was for a time in the inter-war period interested in the oblique type style, which he felt stood out in text less than a true italic and should supersede it. He argued in his article Towards an Ideal Italic that serif book typefaces should have as the default sloped form an oblique and as a complement a script typeface where a more decorative form was preferred. He made an attempt to promote the idea by commissioning the typeface Perpetua from Eric Gill with a sloped roman rather than an italic, but came to find the style unattractive; Perpetua's italic when finally issued had the conventional italic 'a', 'e' and 'f'. Morison wrote to his friend, type designer Jan van Krimpen, that in developing Perpetua's italic \\"we did not give enough slope to it. When we added more slope, it seemed that the font required a little more cursive to it.\\" A few other type designers replicated his approach for a time: van Krimpen's Romulus and William Addison Dwiggins' Electra were both released with obliques. Morison's Times New Roman typeface has a very traditional true italic in the style of the late eighteenth century, which he later wryly commented owed \\"more to Didot than dogma\\". Some serif designs primarily intended for headings rather than body text are not provided with an italic, Engravers and some releases of Cooper Black and Baskerville Old Style being common examples of this. In addition, computer programmes may generate an 'italic' style by simply slanting the regular style if they cannot find an italic or oblique style, though this may look awkward with serif fonts for which an italic is expected. Professional designers normally do not simply tilt fonts to generate obliques but make subtle corrections to correct the distorted curves this introduces. Many sans-serif families have oblique fonts labelled as italic, whether or not they include \\"true italic\\" characteristics. More complex usage =Italics within italics= If something within a run of italics needs to be italicised itself, the type is normally switched back to non-italicized (roman) type: \\"I think The Scarlet Letter had a chapter about that, thought Mary.\\" In this example, the title (\\"The Scarlet Letter\\") is within an italicised thought process and therefore this title is non- italicised. It is followed by the main narrative that is outside both. It is also non-italicised and therefore not obviously separated from the former. The reader must find additional criteria to distinguish between these. Here, apart from using the attribute of italic‚Äìnon-italic styles, the title also employs the attribute of capitalization. Citation styles in which book titles are italicised differ on how to deal with a book title within a book title; for example, MLA style specifies a switch back to roman type, whereas The Chicago Manual of Style (8.184) specifies the use of quotation marks (A Key to Whitehead's \\"Process and Reality\\"). An alternative option is to switch to an 'upright italic' style if the typeface used has one; this is discussed below. =Left-leaning italics= A 'backslanted' italic Didone typeface, made for display use by the Figgins foundry of London. The typeface is an example of the increasingly attention-grabbing, bold and dramatic fonts becoming popular in British display typography in the early nineteenth century. Left-leaning italics are now rare in Latin script, where they are mostly used for the occasional attention-grabbing effect. They were once more common, however, being used for example in legal documents.Reverse italics at StudioType They are more common in Arabic script. 4 shapes of Adobe Arabic font (Normal, Italic, Bold, Bold-Italic) 4 shapes of Farsi font (Normal, Iranic, Bold, Bold- Iranic) In certain Arabic fonts (e.g.: Adobe Arabic, Boutros Ads), the italic font has the top of the letter leaning to the left, instead of leaning to the right. Some font families, such as Venus, Roemisch, Topografische Zahlentafel, include left leaning fonts and letters designed for German cartographic map production, even though they do not support Arabic characters. Iranic font style In the 1950s, Gholamhossein Mosahab invented the Iranic font style, a back-slanted italic form to go with the right-to-left direction of the script. =Upright italics= Computer Modern's 'upright italic' font. Since italic styles clearly look different from regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have 'upright italic' designs that have a cursive style but remain upright. In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex texts where a section of text already in italics needs a 'double italic' style to add emphasis to it. Donald Knuth's Computer Modern has an alternate upright italic as an alternative to its standard italic, since its intended use is mathematical typesetting. Font families with an upright or near-upright italic only include Jan van Krimpen's Roman√©e, Eric Gill's Joanna, Martin Majoor's FF Seria and Frederic Goudy's Deepdene. The popular book typeface Bembo has been sold with two italics: one reasonably straightforward design that is commonly used today, and an alternative upright 'Condensed Italic' design, far more calligraphic, as a more eccentric alternative. This italic face was designed by Alfred Fairbank and named \\"Bembo Condensed Italic\\", Monotype series 294. Some Arts and Crafts movement-influenced printers such as Gill also revived the original italic system of italic lower-case only from the nineteenth century onwards. =Parentheses= Monotype Garamond's italic replicates the work of 17th- century punchcutter Jean Jannon quite faithfully, with a variable slant on the italic capitals. The Chicago Manual of Style suggests that to avoid problems such as overlapping and unequally spaced characters, parentheses and brackets surrounding text that begins and ends in italic or oblique type should also be italicised (as in this example). An exception to this rule applies when only one end of the parenthetical is italicised (in which case roman type is preferred, as on the right of this example). In The Elements of Typographic Style, however, it is argued that since Italic delimiters are not historically correct, the upright versions should always be used, while paying close attention to kerning. =Substitutes= In media where italicization is not possible, alternatives are used as substitutes: * In typewritten or handwritten text, underlining is typically used. * In plain-text computer files, including e-mail communication, italicised words are often indicated by surrounding them with slashes or other matched delimiters. For example: ** I was /really/ annoyed. ** They >completely< forgot me! ** I had _nothing_ to do with it. (Commonly interpreted as underlining, which is an alternative to italics.) ** It was *absolutely* horrible. (Commonly interpreted as bold. This and the previous example signify italic in Markdown.) * Where the italics do not indicate emphasis, but are marking a title or where a word is being mentioned, quotation marks may be substituted: ** The word \\"the\\" is an article. ** The term \\"even number\\" refers to a number that is a multiple of 2. ** The short story \\"A Sound of Thunder\\" was written by Ray Bradbury. =OpenType= OpenType has the \`ital\` feature tag to substitute a character to italic form with single font. In addition, the OpenType Font Variation has \`ital\` axis for the transition between italic and non-italic forms and \`slnt\` axis for the oblique angle of characters. =Web pages= In HTML, the \`<i>\` element is used to produce italic (or oblique) text. When the author wants to indicate emphasised text, modern Web standards recommend using the \`<em>\` element, because it conveys that the content is to be emphasised, even if it cannot be displayed in italics. Conversely, if the italics are purely ornamental rather than meaningful, then semantic markup practices would dictate that the author use the Cascading Style Sheets declaration \`font- style: italic;\` along with an appropriate, semantic class name instead of an \`<i>\` or \`<em>\` element.

Personal life Drucker was born in Brooklyn, New York City, with some sources listing his birth date as March 22, 1929, and others as March 29. He was the son of Sarah (Spielvogel), a homemaker, and Edward Drucker, a businessman. (note death date anomaly in title) His family was Jewish. He attended Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School. There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to Long Island, living in Syosset, where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren.\\"Man Behind the Drawing Board\\", The Adventures of Bob Hope 87, 1963. Career Drucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on the Publishers-Hall newspaper comic strip Debbie Dean in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from Will Eisner. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications (DC Comics), where he worked as a retoucher. While at DC, Drucker also ghosted \\"The Mountain Boys\\", Paul Webb's regular gag panel for Esquire Magazine. Early in the 1950s, Drucker left his DC staff gig and began doing full-time freelance work for a number of comic book publishers such as Dell, Atlas and St. John's, as well as several humor and war titles for his former employer. =Mad= In the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of Mads founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Drucker found his way to Mad. His first visit to the magazine's offices coincided with a World Series broadcast, and publisher Bill Gaines told Drucker that if the Brooklyn Dodgers won the game, he would be given a drawing assignment. The Dodgers won. Capricious though Drucker's alleged audition process may have been, it was a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, \\"We would have hired him anyway.\\" Drucker had arrived at the Mad offices with pages from his Hopalong Cassidy comic book work for DC Comics and some of his \\"Mountain Boys\\" strips, as well as a humorous \\"little situation\\" featuring The Lone Ranger and Tonto that he had specifically drawn for the interview. Though this work was unlike the likenesses and continuities he would become best known for, the Mad staff reacted favorably. The first to review Drucker's portfolio was Mad associate editor Nick Meglin, who admitted, \\"I didn't spot how great he was at caricatures. Not at first. But then, he wasn't that great then.\\" Drucker said that he \\"just wanted to be an artist ... to get paid for drawing anything,\\" and only started focusing on caricature work, because he started getting more of those assignments. \\"That's when I realized I'd found my calling,\\" said Drucker.Evanier, Mark, MAD Art, Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002 At the time of Drucker's arrival, Mad did not regularly feature television and movie satires. Editor Al Feldstein credited Drucker's style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue. For well over a decade, Mad had difficulty obtaining promotional photos that Drucker could use as source material for his drawings.Jacobs, Frank, The Mad World of William M. Gaines, Lyle Stuart Inc., 1972, pgs. 45-46 When he was illustrating Mad parodies, Drucker's colleague Angelo Torres brought a camera into movie theaters and snapped pictures of the screen. Eventually, a generation of Mad fans grew up and some became Hollywood publicists, making Drucker's research easier. By the time he wound down his Mad career 55 years later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any Mad artist. Drucker has the most bylined articles by any Mad artist who does not also write his own material, with more than 400. =Other work= Drucker also remained active for DC, illustrating War Stories, among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DC's The Adventures of Bob Hope comic book. Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career because it focused his work on caricature.MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 12 In 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer Paul Laikin on the highly successful JFK Coloring Book (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies. Two decades later, Drucker illustrated similar coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald Reagan.Pacific Stars and Stripes, August 24, 1987. His film posters include Universal's American Graffiti (1973), directed by George Lucas with Drucker also drawing the high school yearbook pictures in the film trailer. Drucker also pursued assignments in television animation, movie poster art and magazine illustration, including covers for Time, some of which are in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. His album covers include art for the pop band The Bears and the Anthrax album State of Euphoria, as well as humor albums in the vein of his own \\"JFK Coloring Book\\" including \\"The LBJ Menagerie\\" and \\"The New First Family, 1968.\\" In addition to books collecting his own work, he has provided illustrations for numerous books by others, including children's books, humor books and satire. He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, Rumple. Between 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with Jerry Dumas (and John Reiner) on the daily comic strip Benchley. Set in the White House, the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president Ronald Reagan. Dumas commented, \\"Nobody ever did a strip about the government. It's a wonderful place to set a strip. There's so much room for humor in the White House.\\"\\"Comic strip set in White House\\", Lethbridge Herald (Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada), July 5, 1984. Benchley was syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate. In 1990, Drucker designed the Supercup for Target. The following year, for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, Drucker and executive Mitchell Erick created the Frugies (pronounced fru-jees) to promote June as National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. The campaign included such characters as Lord Mushroom, Pepe L'Pepper, Penelope Pear and Adam Apple.Frederick News-Post, June 12, 1991.  Style  In 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his Mad assignments: > I've always considered a caricature to be the complete person, not just a > likeness. Hands, in particular, have always been a prime focus for me as > they can be as expressive of character as the exaggerations and distortions > a caricaturist searches for. I try to capture the essence of the person, not > just facial features ... I've discovered through years of working at > capturing a humorous likeness that it's not about the features themselves as > much as the space between the features. We all have two eyes, a nose, a > mouth, hair, and jaw lines, but yet we all look different. What makes that > so is the space between them. > > The artist is actually creating his own storyboard for the film. I become > the \\"camera\\" and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long > shots ‚Äî just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually > interesting way he can. My first sketches are as much composition and design > ideas as they are character and action images ... I don't want to get too > involved in the juicy parts since some of what I'm doing will be modified or > discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling.

Sundowner Offshore Services, 523 U.S. 75 (1998), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court. The case arose out of a suit for sex discrimination by a male oil-rig worker, who claimed that he was repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by his male co-workers with the acquiescence of his employer. The Court held that the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against workplace discrimination \\"because of... sex\\" applied to harassment in the workplace between members of the same sex.. Background In late October 1991, Joseph Oncale was working for Sundowner Offshore Services on a Chevron USA Inc. oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. He was employed as a roustabout on an eight-man crew. On several occasions, Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actions against him by his coworkers in the presence of the rest of the crew. Oncale was also sodomized with a bar of soap and threatened with rape. Oncale's complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action. Instead, the company's Safety Compliance Clerk called him a name suggesting homosexuality. Oncale eventually quit, asking that his pink slip reflect that he \\"voluntarily left due to sexual harassment and verbal abuse.\\" Oncale filed a complaint against Sundowner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment because of his sex. Relying on earlier precedents, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant: \\"Mr. Oncale, a male, has no cause of action under Title VII for harassment by male co-workers.\\" Oncale appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision. After granting a petition for writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed the decision. Decision Justice Scalia, writing for the unanimous court (with Justice Thomas concurring), reversed the decision of the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with the instruction that a male can be discriminated against by members of the same sex under Title VII. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services set the precedent for analyzing same-sex harassment and sexual harassment without motivation of \\"sexual desire\\" by stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable if it places the victim in an objectively-disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of the victim or the harasser. The application of the Oncale case has caused some difficulty in the lower federal courts, which have struggled with how to determine whether any particular case of same-sex harassment is \\"because of sex.\\" In particular, courts have struggled with how to deal with harassment that appears to be based on actual or perceived sexual orientation because employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly forbidden by federal law. Impact and implementation In July 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and used the Oncale decision as a basis. Because it set a precedent regarding harassment \\"because of sex,\\" Oncale v. Sundowner has been lauded as a landmark gay rights case, even though all those involved were heterosexual.

His reign lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, without Empress Dowager Cixi's influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the Hundred Days' Reform, but was abruptly stopped when the empress dowager launched a coup in 1898, after which he was put under house arrest until his death. His regnal name, \\"Guangxu\\", means \\"glorious succession\\". Accession to the throne and upbringing Zaitian was the second son of Yixuan (Prince Chun), and his primary spouse Yehenara Wanzhen, a younger sister of Empress Dowager Cixi. On 12 January 1875, Zaitian's cousin, the Tongzhi Emperor, died without a son to succeed him. Breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor, candidates were considered from the generation of the Tongzhi Emperor. Empress Dowager Ci'an suggested choosing one of Prince Gong's sons to be the next emperor, but was overruled by her co-regent, Empress Dowager Cixi. Instead, Cixi nominated Zaitian (her nephew) and the imperial clan eventually agreed with her choice because Zaitian was younger than other adoptable children of the same generation. Zaitian was named heir and successor to his late uncle, the Xianfeng Emperor, rather than his cousin and predecessor, the Tongzhi Emperor, so as to maintain the father-son succession law. He ascended to the throne at the age of four and adopted \\"Guangxu\\" as his regnal name, therefore he is known as the \\"Guangxu Emperor\\". He was adopted by Empress Dowager Ci'an and Cixi. For her part, she remained as regent under the title \\"Holy Mother, Empress Dowager\\" (ËÅñÊØçÁöáÂ§™Âêé) while her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci'an was called \\"Mother Empress, Empress Dowager\\" (ÊØçÂêéÁöáÂ§™Âêé). Beginning in 1876, the Guangxu Emperor was taught by Weng Tonghe, who had also been involved in the disastrous upbringing of the Tongzhi Emperor yet somehow managed to be exonerated of all possible charges.Kwong, Luke S.K. A Mosaic of the Hundred Days: Personalities, Politics and Ideas of 1898 (Harvard University Press, 1984), pg. 45 Weng instilled in the Guangxu Emperor a duty of filial piety toward the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci'an.Kwong, pgs. 52 & 53 In 1881, when the Guangxu Emperor was nine, Empress Dowager Ci'an died unexpectedly, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi as sole regent for the boy. In Weng's diaries during those days, Guangxu was reportedly seen with swollen eyes, had poor concentration and was seeking consolation from Weng. Weng too expressed his concern that Cixi was the one who had been suffering from chronic ill health, not Ci'an. During this time, the imperial eunuchs often abused their influence over the boy emperor.Kwong, pgs. 47 & 48 The Guangxu Emperor had also reportedly begun to hold some audiences on his own as an act of necessity.Kwong, pg. 54 Taking over the reins of power In 1887, the Guangxu Emperor was old enough to begin to rule in his own right, but the previous year, several courtiers, including Prince Chun and Weng Tonghe, had petitioned Empress Dowager Cixi to postpone her retirement from the regency. Despite Cixi's agreement to remain as regent, by 1886 the Guangxu Emperor had begun to write comments on memorials to the throne. In the spring of 1887, he partook in his first field-plowing ceremony, and by the end of the year he had begun to rule under Cixi's supervision. Eventually, in February 1889, in preparation for Cixi's retirement, the Guangxu Emperor was married. Much to the emperor's dislike, Cixi selected her niece, Jingfen, to be empress. She became known as Empress Longyu. She also selected a pair of sisters, who became Consorts Jin and Zhen, to be the emperor's concubines. The following week, with the Guangxu Emperor married, Cixi retired from the regency. Years in power Even after the Guangxu Emperor began formal rule, Empress Dowager Cixi continued to influence his decisions and actions, despite residing several months of the year at the Summer Palace. Weng Tonghe reportedly observed that while the emperor attended to day-to-day state affairs, in more difficult cases the emperor and the Grand Council sought Cixi's advice.Kwong, pgs. 26 & 27 In fact, the emperor often journeyed to the Summer Palace to pay his respects to his aunt and to discuss state affairs with her. In March 1891, the Guangxu Emperor received the foreign ministers to China at an audience in the \\"Pavilion of Purple Light\\", in what is now part of Zhongnanhai, something that had also been done by the Tongzhi Emperor in 1873. That summer, under pressure from the foreign legations and in response to revolts in the Yangtze River valley that were targeting Christian missionaries, the emperor issued an edict ordering Christians to be placed under state protection.Seagrave, Sterling Dragon Lady: the Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China (Knopf, 1992), pg. 291 The Guangxu Emperor, while growing up, apparently had been instilled with the importance of frugality. In 1892, he tried to implement a series of draconian measures to reduce expenditures by the Imperial Household Department, which proved to be one of his few administrative successes.Kwong, pg. 56 But it was only a partial victory, as he had to approve higher expenditures than he would have liked to meet Cixi's needs. 1894 saw the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War. During the war, even though the Guangxu Emperor was nominally the sovereign ruler of the Qing Empire, officials often ignored him and instead sent their memorials to Cixi for her approval.Kwong, pg. 27 Eventually, two sets of Grand Council memoranda were created, one for the emperor and the other for the empress dowager, a practice that continued until it was rendered unnecessary by the events in the autumn of 1898. Following the Qing Empire's defeat and forced agreement to the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Guangxu Emperor reportedly expressed his wish to abdicate.Seagrave, pg. 186 The emperor and the Qing government faced further humiliation in late 1897 when the German Empire used the murders of two priests in Shandong Province as an excuse to occupy Jiaozhou Bay, prompting a \\"scramble for concessions\\" by other foreign powers. Following the war and the scramble for concessions, the Guangxu Emperor came to believe that by learning from constitutional monarchies like Japan, the Qing Empire would become more politically and economically powerful. In June 1898, the emperor began the Hundred Days' Reform, aimed at a series of sweeping political, legal and social changes. For a brief time, after Cixi's supposed retirement, the Guangxu Emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms with the help of more progressive officials such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Beiyang official newspaper in Guangxu 29 year Changes ranged from infrastructure to industry and the civil examination system. The Guangxu Emperor issued decrees allowing the establishment of a modern university in Beijing, the construction of the Lu-Han railway, and a system of budgets similar to that of Western governments. The initial goal was to make China a modern constitutional empire, but still within the traditional framework, as with Japan's Meiji Restoration. The reforms, however, were not only too sudden for a China still under significant neo-Confucian influence and other elements of traditional culture, but also came into conflict with Cixi, who held real power. Many officials, deemed useless and dismissed by the Guangxu Emperor, begged her for help. Although Cixi did nothing to stop the Hundred Days' Reform from taking place, she knew the only way to secure her power base was to stage a military coup. The Guangxu Emperor became aware of such a plan, so he asked Kang Youwei and his reformist allies to plan his rescue. They decided to use the help of Yuan Shikai, who had a modernized army, albeit only 6,000-strong. Cixi relied on Ronglu's army in Tianjin. Zaitian Portrait of Emperor Guangxu. Illustration. Ronglu also had an ally, General Dong Fuxiang, who commanded 10,000 Muslim Kansu Braves, including generals such as Ma Fuxiang and Ma Fulu, stationed in the Beijing metropolitan area. Armed with more advanced firearms and artillery, they sided with Cixi's conservative faction during the coup. The day before the staged coup was supposed to take place, Yuan Shikai revealed everything to Ronglu, exposing the Guangxu Emperor's plans. This gained Yuan Shikai the trust of Cixi, as well as the status of lifetime enemy of the Guangxu Emperor as well as the emperor's younger half-brother, Zaifeng. Following the exposure of the plot, the emperor and empress dowager met, and the emperor retreated to the Yingtai Pavilion, a palace on a lake that is now part of the Zhongnanhai Compound. Lei Chia-sheng (Èõ∑ÂÆ∂ËÅñ), a Taiwanese history professor, proposes an alternative view: that the Guangxu Emperor might have been led into a trap by the reformists led by Kang Youwei, who in turn was in Lei's opinion tricked by British missionary Timothy Richard and former Japanese prime minister It≈ç Hirobumi into agreeing to appoint It≈ç as one of many foreign advisors.Richard, Timothy, Forty-five Years in China: Reminiscences publ. Frederick A. Stokes (1916) British ambassador Claude MacDonald claimed that the reformists had actually \\"much injured\\" the modernization of China.Correspondence Respecting the Affairs of China, Presented to Both Houses of Parliament by Command of Her Majesty (London, 1899.3), No. 401, p. 303. Lei claims that Cixi learned of the plot and decided to put an end to it to prevent China from coming under foreign control.Lei Chia-shengÈõ∑ÂÆ∂ËÅñ, Liwan kuanglan: Wuxu zhengbian xintan ÂäõÊåΩÁãÇÁÄæÔºöÊàäÊàåÊîøËÆäÊñ∞Êé¢ [Containing the furious waves: a new view of the 1898 coup], Taipei: Wanjuan lou Ëê¨Âç∑Ê®ì, 2004. Under house arrest after 1898 Portrait of the Guangxu Emperor in his study Guangxu Emperor's bed photographed by the French Army (1900-1901). The Guangxu Emperor's duties after 1898 became rather limited. The emperor was effectively removed from power as emperor (despite keeping the title), but he did retain some status. The emperor was kept informed of state affairs, reading them with Cixi prior to audiences,Derling, Princess Two Years in the Forbidden City, (New York: Moffat Yard & Company, pgs. 69-70 (New York: Moffat Yard & Company, 1911), accessed June 25th, 2013 http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DerYear.html and was also present at audiences, sitting on a stool to Cixi's left hand while Cixi occupied the main throne. He discharged his ceremonial duties, such as offering sacrifices during ceremonies, but never ruled alone again. In 1898, shortly after the collapse of the Hundred Days' Reform, the Guangxu Emperor's health began to decline, prompting Cixi to name Pujun, a son of the emperor's cousin, the reactionary Prince Duan, as heir presumptive. Pujun and his father were removed from their positions after the Boxer Rebellion. He was examined by a physician at the French Legation and diagnosed with chronic nephritis; he was also discovered to be impotent at the time. During the Boxer Rebellion, Emperor Guangxu fiercely opposed the idea of using usurpers as a means to counter foreign invasion. His letter to then United States president Theodore Roosevelt is still preserved in U.S. government archives. On 14 August 1900, the Guangxu Emperor, along with Cixi, Empress Longyu and some other court officials, fled from Beijing as the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance marched on the capital to relieve the legations that had been besieged during the Boxer Rebellion. Returning to the capital in January 1902, after the withdrawal of the foreign powers, the Guangxu Emperor spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks, which had been a childhood fascination, some say in an effort to pass the time until Cixi's death. He also read widely and spent time learning English from Cixi's Western-educated lady-in-waiting, Yu Deling. His relationship with Empress Longyu, Cixi's niece (and the Emperor's own first cousin), also improved to some extent. Death It is said that this is a photograph of the Guangxu Emperor in 1901 (fourth from the left with his officials.) The Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, a day before Cixi's death, at the age of 37. For a long time there were several theories about the emperor's death, none of which were completely accepted by historians. Most were inclined to believe that Cixi, herself very ill, poisoned the Guangxu Emperor because she was afraid he would reverse her policies after her death. Another theory is that the Guangxu Emperor was poisoned by Yuan Shikai, who knew that if the emperor were to come to power again, Yuan would likely be executed for treason.Mu, Eric. Reformist Emperor Guangxu was Poisoned, Study Confirms\\". Danwei. 3 November 2008. Retrieved 2 November 2011. There were no reliable sources to prove who murdered the Guangxu Emperor. In 1911, Cixi's former eunuch Li Lianying was murdered, possibly by Yuan, implying that they had conspired in the emperor's murder. This theory was offered by Puyi in his biography; he claimed he heard it from an old eunuch. The medical records kept by the Guangxu Emperor's physician show the emperor suffered from \\"spells of violent stomachaches\\", and that his face had turned blue, typical symptoms of arsenic poisoning. To dispel persistent rumors that the emperor had been poisoned, the Qing imperial court produced documents and doctors' records suggesting that the Guangxu Emperor died from natural causes, but these did not allay suspicion. On 4 November 2008, forensic tests revealed that the level of arsenic in the Guangxu Emperor's remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people. Scientists concluded that the poison could only have been administered in a high dose at one time. China Daily quoted a historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi might have known of her imminent death and worried that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death. The Guangxu Emperor was succeeded by Cixi's choice as heir, his nephew Puyi, who took the regnal name \\"Xuantong\\". The Guangxu Emperor's consort, who became Empress Dowager Longyu, signed the abdication decree as regent in 1912, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Longyu died childless in 1913. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911‚Äì1912, the Chinese Republic funded the construction of the Guangxu Emperor's mausoleum in the Western Qing Tombs. The tomb was robbed during the Chinese Civil War and the underground palace (burial chamber) is now open to the public. Appraisal In 1912, Sun Yat-sen praised the Guangxu Emperor for his educational reform package that allowed China to learn more about Western culture. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, historian Fan Wenlan (ËåÉÊñáÁÄæ) called the Guangxu Emperor \\"a Manchu noble who could accept Western ideas\\". Some historians believe that the Guangxu Emperor was the first Chinese leader to implement modernizing reforms and capitalism. Imperial power in the Qing dynasty saw its nadir under Guangxu, and he was the only Qing emperor to have been put under house arrest during his own reign.

The emperor was forced by Empress Dowager Cixi to marry her niece (his cousin) Jingfen, who was two years his senior. Jingfen's father, Guixiang (Cixi's younger brother), and Cixi selected her to be the Guangxu Emperor's Empress Consort in order to strengthen the power of her own family. After the marriage, Jingfen was made empress and was granted the honorific title of \\"Longyu\\", meaning \\"auspicious and prosperous\\" () after the death of her husband. However, the Guangxu Emperor detested Empress Longyu, and spent most of his time with his favorite concubine, Consort Zhen (), (better known in English as the \\"Pearl Consort\\"). Rumors allege that in 1900, Consort Zhen was drowned by being thrown into a well on Cixi's order after Consort Zhen begged Empress Dowager Cixi to let the Guangxu Emperor stay in Beijing for negotiations with the foreign powers. That incident happened before Empress Dowager Cixi was preparing to leave the Forbidden City due to the occupation of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. Like his predecessor, the Tongzhi Emperor, the Guangxu Emperor died without issue. After the Guangxu Emperor's death in 1908, Empress Dowager Longyu reigned in cooperation with Zaifeng (Prince Chun). \\\\---- Consorts: * Empress Xiaodingjing, of the Yehe Nara clan (; 28 January 1868 ‚Äì 22 February 1913), first cousin, personal name Jingfen () * Imperial Noble Consort Wenjing, of the Tatara clan (; 6 October 1873 ‚Äì 24 September 1924) * Imperial Noble Consort Keshun, of the Tatara clan (; 27 February 1876 ‚Äì 15 August 1900) Ancestry See also * Chinese emperors family tree (late) * List of unsolved murders  References   External links  * Category:1870s in China Category:1871 births Category:1880s in China Category:1890s in China Category:1900s in China Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century Chinese monarchs Category:20th- century Chinese monarchs Category:Child rulers from Asia Category:Chinese dissidents Category:Chinese people of the Boxer Rebellion Category:Deaths by poisoning Category:Emperors from Beijing 3 3 3 Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Red Eagle Category:Male murder victims Category:Murdered Chinese emperors Category:Murdered royalty Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Recipients of the Order of the Double Dragon Category:Recipients of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I Category:Qing dynasty emperors Category:Unsolved murders in China ","title":"Guangxu Emperor"},{"id":"265940","text":"The Tongzhi Emperor (27 April 1856 ‚Äì 12 January 1875), born Zaichun of the Aisin Gioro clan,http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/TSAI-CH'UN.html was the tenth Emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the eighth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. His reign, from 1861 to 1875, which effectively lasted through his adolescence, was largely overshadowed by the rule of his mother, Empress Dowager Cixi. Although he had little influence over state affairs, the events of his reign gave rise to what historians call the \\"Tongzhi Restoration\\", an unsuccessful modernization program. Life The only surviving son of the Xianfeng Emperor and Empress Dowager Cixi, the Tongzhi Emperor attempted political reform in the period of the Tongzhi Restoration. His first regnal name was Qixiang (Á•∫Á••; Manchu: Feng≈°engge sabingga), but this name was later changed, as per tradition upon his succession, to \\"Tongzhi\\". The regnal name means 'order and prosperity' coming from the Confucian teaching that \\"there are many ways of being a good government, and they can all be summarized as order and prosperity\\".(Empress Dowager Cixi, pg 51) The Tongzhi Emperor became emperor at the age of five upon the death of his father, the Xianfeng Emperor. His father's choice of a regent, Sushun, was removed in favor of a partnership between his mother Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Dowager Ci'an. While there had most likely been hopes that the Tongzhi Emperor would become a leader like the Kangxi Emperor (who ascended the throne as a child in 1661), those hopes would soon come to naught, as the Tongzhi Emperor grew up to become an obstinate and dissolute young man. In the fall of 1872, the teenage emperor married Empress Xiaozheyi and two official concubines. The Tongzhi Emperor apparently had wanted to take up power immediately, prompting a quarrel at court regarding the dismantling of the regency and the timing of it. However, the two empresses dowager stuck by the intended date of February 23, 1873.Seagrave, Sterling Dragon Lady: the Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China (Knopf, 1992), pp. 130‚Äì131 The day after the Tongzhi Emperor took up the reins of power, the foreign powers requested an audience with the teenage emperor. The request precipitated a sharp disagreement between the ministers at the foreign legations, who made it clear that they would not perform the ritual kowtow to the emperor, and the Zongli Yamen (foreign affairs ministry), regarding the protocol to be observed. The Qing government was also loath to hold the audience within the confines of the Forbidden City, eventually settling on the \\"Pavilion of Purple Light\\" at one of the lakeside palaces to the west of the Forbidden City, which is now part of Zhongnanhai.Seagrave, pg. 131 The audience was finally held on 29 June 1873. After the audience, however, the foreign representatives made clear their annoyance at being received in a hall initially used by the Qing emperors to receive envoys of tributary states. In the fall of 1874, the Tongzhi Emperor got into a clash with his ministers, which included his two uncles, Prince Gong and Prince Chun, largely over the emperor's plans to rebuild the Old Summer Palace at a time in which the empire was bankrupt, and over his dissolute behavior. The emperor reacted by firing the ministers, but Empresses Dowager Ci'an and Cixi intervened, and he had them reinstated. That December, it was announced that he was ill with smallpox, and the Empress Dowagers resumed the regency. He died on 12 January 1875, leaving no sons to succeed him. The Tongzhi Emperor's death left the court in a succession crisis as he was childless. Eventually, the empresses dowager designated the Tongzhi Emperor's three-year-old cousin, Zaitian, as the heir to the throne. Zaitian was biologically Prince Chun's son, but was symbolically adopted as the Xianfeng Emperor's son to make him eligible to succeed the Tongzhi Emperor. Zaitian was thus enthroned as the Guangxu Emperor, with Empresses Dowager Ci'an and Cixi resuming their roles as regents. Empress Alute, Tongzhi's wife, refused to eat after his death and died seventy days after he did in an act of marital piety. Taiping Rebellion Hong Xiuquan (1814-1864) was peculiarly affected by the social instability of the Canton region. He belonged to a family of modestly well-off peasants from Hua county north of Canton, members of the Hakka community ubiquitous in the region. Hong created his own version of Christianity with a total transformation of the Chinese nationJen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 4-7 (1973)C. A. Curwen, Taiping Rebel: The Deposition of Li Hsiu-ch'eng 1 (1977) to start his Taiping Rebellion. In late 1851, Taiping army occupied its first walled city Yongan. Taiping break out of the Qing encirclement When 5-year-old Tongzhi Emperor ascend the throne in 1861, the Taiping rebellion was threatening Shanghai. This move prompted several foreign missions of British, French, and Americans to the Heavenly Capital, to warn the Taiping against interference with Western commerce. Foreign neutrality was beginning to fray as Western intelligence of the Taiping revealed both its unorthodox religious ideology and its lack of understanding of the Western world. In order to save Shanghai, Tongzhi Emperor ordered Zeng Guofan to counter-attack the rebel. Zeng's appointment was the turning point in the Taiping war. Zeng was a virtual generalissimo directing a supra- provincial campaign by armies raised and led by his various lieutenants and proteges, supported by the extrodinary mobilization of revenues including the likin tax and customs revenues. His strategy was to move from the west down the Yangzi taking successive cities, while Li Hongzhang, his principal lieutenant, advanced from the east through Jiangsu toward Nanjing. The Heavenly Capital fell in July 1864. Hong Xiuquan was already dead, on June 1, 1864. The fall of the city was followed by a great massacre. Remnant Taiping forces fled south, including Hong's son the Junior King and Hong Rengan, to continue the movement, but both were soon captured and executed. The last Taiping forces were destroyed in Guangdong in early 1866, having come geographically almost full circle in the course of fifteen years. The Self- Strengthening Movement Tongzhi Emperor The inspiration for the Self- Strengthening Movement from the 1840s arose from this notion that China's defense in the face of war and rebellion must come from within, as the superior man strengthens himself under imperative of Heaven's robust action. the costs of war and rebellion dictated that Qing dynasty undertake vigorous measures to ensure its survival. Moreover, the very survival of China itself was now at stake. Self-strengthening efforts evolved in a succession of stages over a period of almost half a century. In 1840 Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu, impressed by the power of British warships in the initial battles of the Opium War, advocated adoption of Western naval technology. The paddle-wheel steamer Nemsis had run circles around cumbersome Chinese war junks. Some Chinese at first believed the paddle-wheels were powered by men inside the ship, but soon came to appreciate the power of steam, Commissioner Lin was the first self-strengthener. Self-strengthening enterprises, including arsenals, shipyards, and technical schools, were now established in the principal treaty ports where access to Western technology was most direct. By 1860, the overwhelming bulk of the Chinese scholarly class had become cognizant of the enormity of changes that were taking place due to the skyrocketing Western presence in China. They now proclaimed that change was irresistible and advocated for deeper studies of Western technology. Many reforms were proposed and implemented, but ultimately the failure of reforms was due to multiple factors such as political machinations.

During his reign the Qing dynasty experienced several wars and rebellions including the Taiping Rebellion, Nian Rebellion, and Second Opium War (Arrow War). He was the last Chinese emperor to have total executive ruling power. After his death, the Qing dynasty was controlled by Empress Dowager Cixi.  Family and early life  Yizhu was born in 1831 at the Old Summer Palace, eight kilometres northwest of Beijing. He was from the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan, and was the fourth son of the Daoguang Emperor. His mother was the Noble Consort Quan, of the Manchu Niohuru clan, who was made Empress in 1834, and is known posthumously as Empress Xiaoquancheng. Yizhu was reputed to have an ability in literature and administration which surpassed most of his brothers, which impressed his father, who therefore decided to make him his successor.  Early reign  Yizhu succeeded the throne in 1850, at age 19, and was a relatively young emperor. He inherited a dynasty that faced not only internal but also foreign challenges. Yizhu's reign title, Xianfeng, which means \\"Universal Prosperity\\", did not reflect the situation. In 1850, the first of a series of popular rebellions began that would nearly destroy the Qing dynasty. The Taiping Rebellion began in December 1850, when Hong Xiuquan, a Hakka leader of a syncretic Christian sect, defeated local forces sent to disperse his followers. Hong then proclaimed the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the rebellion spread to several provinces with amazing speed. The following year, the Nian Rebellion started in North China. Unlike the Christian-influenced Taiping rebels, the Nian movement lacked a clear political program, but they became a serious threat to the Qing capital, Beijing, with the mobility of their cavalry-based armies. The Qing imperial forces suffered repeated defeats at the hands of both rebel movements.  Rebellions and wars  In 1853, the Taiping rebels captured Nanjing and for a while it seemed that Beijing would fall next; but the Taiping northern expedition was defeated and the situation stabilized. The Xianfeng Emperor dispatched several prominent mandarins, such as Zeng Guofan and the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen, to crush the rebellions, but they only obtained limited success. The biggest revolt of the Miao people against Chinese rule in history started in 1854, and ravaged the region until finally put down in 1873. In 1856, an attempt to regain Nanjing was defeated and the Panthay Rebellion broke out in Yunnan. Portrait of the Xianfeng Emperor in his gardens Meanwhile, an initially minor incident on the coasts triggered the Second Opium War. Anglo-French forces, after inciting a few battles (not all victories for them) on the coast near Tianjin, attempted \\"negotiation\\" with the Qing government. The Xianfeng Emperor believed in Chinese superiority and would not agree to any colonial demands. He delegated Prince Gong for several negotiations but relations broke down completely when a British diplomat, Sir Harry Parkes, was arrested during negotiations on 18 September. The Anglo- French invasion clashed with Sengge Rinchen's Mongol cavalry on 18 September near Zhangjiawan before proceeding toward the outskirts of Beijing for a decisive battle in Tongzhou District, Beijing. On 21 September, at the Battle of Palikao, Sengge Rinchen's 10,000 troops, including his elite Mongol cavalry, were completely annihilated after several doomed frontal charges against the concentrated firepower of the Anglo-French forces, which entered Beijing on 6 October. On 18 October 1860, the British and French forces went on to loot and burn the Old Summer Palace and Summer Palace. Upon learning about this news, the Xianfeng Emperor's health quickly deteriorated. During the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, China lost part of Manchuria to the Russian Empire. In 1858, according to the Treaty of Aigun, the territory between Stanovoy Mountains and Amur River was ceded to Russia, and in 1860, according to the Treaty of Beijing, the same thing happened also to the area east of Ussuri River. After that treaty, the Russians founded the city of Vladivostok in the area they had annexed. While negotiations with the European powers were being held, the Xianfeng Emperor and his imperial entourage fled to Jehol province in the name of conducting the annual imperial hunting expedition. As his health worsened, the emperor's ability to govern also deteriorated, and competing ideologies in court led to the formation of two distinct factions ‚Äî one led by the senior official Sushun and the princes Zaiyuan and Duanhua, and the other led by Noble Consort Yi, who was supported by the general Ronglu and the Bannermen of the Yehe Nara clan. Death The Xianfeng Emperor died on 22 August 1861, from a short life of overindulgence, at the Chengde Mountain Resort, 230 kilometres northeast of Beijing. His successor was his surviving six-year-old son, Zaichun. A day before his death, the Xianfeng Emperor had summoned Sushun and his supporters to his bedside and gave them an imperial edict that dictated the power structure during his son's minority. The edict appointed eight men ‚Äì Zaiyuan, Duanhua, Jingshou, Sushun, Muyin, Kuangyuan, Du Han and Jiao Youying ‚Äì as an eight-member regency council to aid Zaichun, who was later enthroned as the Tongzhi Emperor. Xianfeng gave the eight men the power of regency, but their edicts would have to be endorsed by Noble Consort Yi and Empress Consort Zhen. By tradition, after the death of an emperor, the emperor's body was to be accompanied to the capital by the regents. Noble Consort Yi and Empress Consort Zhen, who were now known as Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci'an travelled ahead to Beijing and planned a coup with Prince Gong that ousted the eight regents. Empress Dowager Cixi then effectively ruled China over the subsequent 47 years as a regent. The Xianfeng Emperor was interred in the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometres/75 miles east of Beijing, in the Ding (ÂÆö; lit. \\"Quietude\\") mausoleum complex. Legacy Yanbozhishuang Hall, where the Xianfeng Emperor died on 22 August 1861 The Qing dynasty continued to decline during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor. Rebellions in the country, which began the first year of his reign, would not be quelled until well into the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor and resulted in millions of deaths. The Xianfeng Emperor also had to deal with the British and French and their ever-growing appetite to expand trade further into China. The Xianfeng Emperor, like his father, the Daoguang Emperor, understood very little about Europeans and their mindset. He viewed non-Chinese as inferior and regarded the repeated requests by the Europeans for the establishment of diplomatic relations as an offence. When the Europeans introduced the long-held concept of an exchanged consular relationship, the Xianfeng Emperor quickly rebuffed the idea. At the time of his death, he had not met with any foreign dignitary. Despite his tumultuous decade of reign, the Xianfeng Emperor was commonly seen as the last Qing emperor to have held paramount authority, ruling in his own right. The reigns of his son and subsequent successors were overseen by regents, a trend present until the fall of the Qing dynasty.

His reign was marked by \\"external disaster and internal rebellion,\\" that is, by the First Opium War, and the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion which nearly brought down the dynasty. The historian Jonathan Spence characterizes the Daoguang Emperor as a \\"well meaning but ineffective man\\" who promoted officials who \\"presented a purist view even if they had nothing to say about the domestic and foreign problems surrounding the dynasty.\\"  Early years  The Daoguang Emperor was born in the Forbidden City, Beijing, in 1782, and was given the name Mianning (). It was later changed to Minning () when he became emperor. The first character of his private name was changed from Mian to Min to avoid the relatively common character Mian. This novelty was introduced by his grandfather, the reigning Qianlong Emperor, who thought it inappropriate to use a common character in the emperor's private name due to the longstanding practice of naming taboo. Mianning was the second son of Prince Yongyan, the 15th son and heir of the Qianlong Emperor. Even though he was Yongyan's second son, he was first in line after Prince Yongyan to his grandfather's throne. This was because according to the dishu system, his mother, Lady Hitara, was Yongyan's primary spouse whereas his elder brother was born to Yongyan's concubine. Mianning was favoured by his grandfather, the Qianlong Emperor. He frequently accompanied his grandfather on hunting trips. On one such trip, at the age of nine, Mianning successfully hunted a deer, which greatly amused the Qianlong Emperor. The emperor would abdicate five years after that incident, in 1796, when Mianning was 14. Mianning‚Äôs father Prince Yongyan was then enthroned as the Jiaqing Emperor, after which he made Lady Hitara (Mianning's mother) his empress consort. The elderly Qianlong would live three more years in retirement before dying in 1799, aged 88, when Mianning was 17. In 1813, while he was still a prince, Mianning also played a vital role in repelling and killing Eight Trigrams invaders who stormed the Forbidden City.  Reign  The Daoguang Emperor inspecting his guards at the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City = Khoja rebellion in Xinjiang = The Daoguang Emperor is presented with prisoners of the campaign to pacify rebels in Xinjiang at the Meridian Gate in 1828 In September 1820, at the age of 38, Mianning inherited the throne after the Jiaqing Emperor died suddenly of unknown causes. He became the first Qing emperor who was the eldest legitimate son of his father. Now known as the Daoguang Emperor, he inherited a declining empire with Westerners encroaching upon the borders of China. The Daoguang Emperor had been ruling for six years when the exiled heir to the Khojas, Jahangir Khoja, attacked Xinjiang from Kokand in the Afaqi Khoja revolts. By the end of 1826, the former Qing cities of Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Yangihissar had all fallen to the rebels. After a friend betrayed him in March 1827, Khoja was sent to Beijing in an iron litter and subsequently executed, while the Qing Empire regained control of their lost territory. = First Opium War = During the Daoguang Emperor's reign, China experienced major problems with opium, which was imported into China by British merchants. Opium had started to trickle into China during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, but was limited to approximately 200 chests annually. By the time of the Qianlong era, this amount had increased to 1,000 chests, 4,000 chests by the Jiaqing era and more than 30,000 chests during the Daoguang era. Destroying Chinese war junks during the First Opium War The Daoguang Emperor issued many imperial edicts banning opium in the 1820s and 1830s, which were carried out by Lin Zexu, whom he appointed as an Imperial Commissioner. Lin Zexu's efforts to halt the spread of opium in China led directly to the First Opium War. With the development of the First Opium War, Lin Zexu was made a scapegoat. The Daoguang Emperor removed his authority and banished him to Yili. Meanwhile, in the Himalayas, the Sikh Empire attempted an occupation of Tibet but was defeated in the Sino-Sikh war (1841‚Äì1842). On the coasts, the Qing Empire lost the war, exposing their technological and military inferiority to European powers, and ceded Hong Kong to the British in the Treaty of Nanjing in August 1842. = Anti-Christianity = In 1811, a clause sentencing Europeans to death for spreading Catholicism had been added to the statute called \\"Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses\\" (Á¶ÅÊ≠¢Â∏´Â∑´ÈÇ™Ë°ì) in the Great Qing Legal Code. Protestants hoped that the Qing government would discriminate between Protestantism and Catholicism, since the law mentioned the latter by name, but after Protestant missionaries gave Christian books to Chinese people in 1835 and 1836, the Daoguang Emperor demanded to know who were the \\"traitorous natives\\" in Guangzhou who had supplied them with books. =Nobility titles= The Daoguang Emperor granted the title of \\"Wujing Boshi\\" () to the descendants of Ran Qiu. Death and legacy The Daoguang Emperor died on 26 February 1850 at the Old Summer Palace, 8 km/5 miles northwest of Beijing, being the last Qing emperor to pass away in that Palace before it was burnt down by Anglo-French troops during the Second Opium War, a decade later. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Yizhu, who was later enthroned as the Xianfeng Emperor. The Daoguang Emperor failed to understand the intention or determination of the Europeans, or the basic economics of a war on drugs. Although the Europeans were outnumbered and thousands of miles away from logistical support in their native countries, they could bring far superior firepower to bear at any point of contact along the Chinese coast. The Qing government was highly dependent on the continued flow of taxes from southern China via the Grand Canal, which the British expeditionary force easily cut off at Zhenjiang. The Daoguang Emperor ultimately had a poor understanding of the British and the industrial revolution that Britain and Western Europe had undergone, preferring to turn a blind eye to the rest of the world, though the distance from China to Europe most likely played a part. It was said that the emperor did not even know where Britain was located in the world. His 30-year reign introduced the initial onslaught by Western imperialism and foreign invasions that would plague China, in one form or another, for the next one hundred years.

He was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. During his reign, he prosecuted Heshen, the corrupt favorite of his father, and attempted to restore order within the Qing Empire while curbing the smuggling of opium into China. Early years Yongyan was born in the Old Summer Palace, 8 km (5 mi) northwest of the walls of Beijing. His personal name, \\"Yongyan\\" (Ê∞∏Áê∞), was later changed to \\"Yongyan\\" (È°íÁê∞) when he became the emperor. The Chinese character for yong in his name was changed from the more common Ê∞∏ to the less common È°í. This novelty was introduced by the Qianlong Emperor, who believed that it was not proper to have a commonly used Chinese character in an emperor's personal name due to the longstanding practice of naming taboo in the imperial family. Yongyan was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Ling, the daughter of Wei Qingtai (È≠èÊ∏ÖÊ≥∞), a Han Chinese official whose family had been long integrated into the Manchu Eight Banners as part of a Han Banner. The Qianlong Emperor originally had two other sons in mind for succeeding him, but both of them died early from diseases, hence in December 1773 he secretly chose Yongyan as his successor. In 1789, the Qianlong Emperor instated Yongyan as \\"Prince Jia of the First Rank\\" (ÂòâË¶™Áéã; or simply \\"Prince Jia\\"). Accession to the throne In October 1795, the 60th year of his reign, the Qianlong Emperor announced his intention to abdicate in favour of Prince Jia. He made this decision because he felt that it was disrespectful for him to rule longer than his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, who was on the throne for 61 years. Prince Jia ascended the throne and adopted the era name \\"Jiaqing\\" in February 1796, hence he is historically known as the Jiaqing Emperor. For the next three years however, the Jiaqing Emperor was emperor in name only because decisions were still made by his father, who became a Taishang Huang (emperor emeritus) after his abdication. After the death of the Qianlong Emperor in the beginning of February 1799, the Jiaqing Emperor took control of the government and prosecuted Heshen, a favourite official of his father. Heshen was charged with corruption and abuse of power, stripped of his titles, had his property confiscated, and ordered to commit suicide. Heshen's daughter-in-law, Princess Hexiao, a sister of the Jiaqing Emperor, was spared from punishment and given a few properties from Heshen's estates. At the time, the Qing Empire faced internal disorder, most importantly the large-scale White Lotus (1796‚Äì1804) and Miao (1795‚Äì1806) rebellions, as well as an empty imperial treasury. The Jiaqing Emperor engaged in the pacification of the empire and the quelling of rebellions. He endeavored to bring China back to its 18th-century prosperity and power. However, due in part to large outflows of silver from the country as payment for the opium smuggled into China from British India, the economy declined. =Renaming Vietnam= The Jiaqing Emperor refused the Vietnamese ruler Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Vi·ªát. He changed the name instead to Vi·ªát Nam.Woodside 1971, p. 120. Gia Long's ƒê·∫°i Nam th·ª±c l·ª•c contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming. =Opposition to Christianity= The Great Qing Legal Code includes one statute titled \\"Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses\\" (Á¶ÅÊ≠¢Â∏´Â∑´ÈÇ™Ë°ì). In 1811, a clause was added to it with reference to Christianity. It was modified in 1815 and 1817, settled in its final form in 1839 under the Daoguang Emperor, and abrogated in 1870 under the Tongzhi Emperor. It sentenced Europeans to death for spreading Catholicism among Han Chinese and Manchus. Christians who would not repent their conversion were sent to Muslim cities in Xinjiang, to be given as slaves to Muslim leaders and beys. =Chinese nobility= The Jiaqing Emperor granted the title Wujing Boshi () to the descendants of Han Yu. Death and burial On 2 September 1820, the Jiaqing Emperor died at the Rehe (Jehol) Traveling Palace (ÁÜ±Ê≤≥Ë°åÂÆ´), 230 km (140 mi) northeast of Beijing, where the imperial court was in summer quarters. The Draft History of Qing did not record a cause of death. Some have alleged that he died after being struck by lightning, but others prefer the theory that he died of a stroke, as the emperor was quite obese. He was succeeded by his second son, Mianning, who became known as the Daoguang Emperor. Renzong was interred amidst the Western Qing Tombs, 120 km (75 mi) southwest of Beijing, in the Chang (Êòå; lit. \\"splendid\\") mausoleum complex.

Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Retired Emperor until his death in 1799; he thus was one of the longest-reigning de facto rulers in the history of the world, and dying at the age of 87, one of the longest-lived. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms. This turned around in his late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and wastefulness in his court and a stagnating civil society. A British valet who accompanied his diplomat master to the Qing court in 1793 described the emperor: > The Emperor is about five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but > elegant form; his complexion is comparatively fair, though his eyes are > dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents > a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age > he is said to have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment > accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the > prince, evinces the amiable character of the man.

Hongli was the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, and was born to Noble Consort Xi. Hongli was adored by both his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, and his father, the Yongzheng Emperor. Some historians argue that the main reason why the Kangxi Emperor appointed the Yongzheng Emperor as his successor was because Hongli was his favourite grandson. He felt that Hongli's mannerisms were very similar to his own. As a teenager, Hongli was capable in martial arts and possessed literary ability. After his father's enthronement in 1722, Hongli was made a qinwang (first-rank prince) under the title \\"Prince Bao of the First Rank\\" (). Like many of his uncles, Hongli entered into a battle of succession with his elder half-brother Hongshi, who had the support of a large faction of the officials in the imperial court, as well as Yinsi, Prince Lian. For many years, the Yongzheng Emperor did not designate any of his sons as the crown prince, but many officials speculated that he favoured Hongli. Hongli went on inspection trips to the south, and was known to be an able negotiator and enforcer. He was also appointed as the chief regent on occasions when his father was away from the capital. Accession to the throne A likeness of Qianlong by artist and historian George S. Stuart from historical records. Hongli's accession to the throne was already foreseen before he was officially proclaimed emperor before the assembled imperial court upon the death of the Yongzheng Emperor. The young Hongli was the favourite grandson of the Kangxi Emperor and the favourite son of the Yongzheng Emperor; the Yongzheng Emperor had entrusted a number of important ritual tasks to Hongli while the latter was still a prince, and included him in important court discussions of military strategy. In the hope of preventing a succession struggle from occurring, the Yongzheng Emperor wrote the name of his chosen successor on a piece of paper and placed it in a sealed box secured behind the tablet over the throne in the Palace of Heavenly Purity (Qianqing Palace). The name in the box was to be revealed to other members of the imperial family in the presence of all senior ministers only upon the death of the emperor. When the Yongzheng Emperor died suddenly in 1735, the will was taken out and read before the entire Qing imperial court, after which Hongli became the new emperor. Hongli adopted the era name \\"Qianlong\\", which means \\"Lasting Eminence\\". Frontier wars Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Paris Qianlong emperor hunting. The Qianlong Emperor was a successful military leader. Immediately after ascending the throne, he sent armies to suppress the Miao rebellion. His later campaigns greatly expanded the territory controlled by the Qing Empire. This was made possible not only by Qing military might, but also by the disunity and declining strength of the Inner Asian peoples. Under the Qianlong Emperor's reign, the Dzungar Khanate was incorporated into the Qing Empire's rule and renamed Xinjiang, while to the west, Ili was conquered and garrisoned. The incorporation of Xinjiang into the Qing Empire resulted from the final defeat and destruction of the Dzungars (or Zunghars), a coalition of Western Mongol tribes. The Qianlong Emperor then ordered the Dzungar genocide. According to the Qing dynasty scholar Wei Yuan, 40% of the 600,000 Dzungars were killed by smallpox, 20% fled to the Russian Empire or Kazakh tribes, and 30% were killed by the Qing army,Wei Yuan, ËÅñÊ≠¶Ë®ò Military history of the Qing Dynasty, vol.4. ‚ÄúË®àÊï∏ÂçÅËê¨Êà∂‰∏≠ÔºåÂÖàÁóòÊ≠ªËÄÖÂçÅ‰πãÂõõÔºåÁπºÁ´ÑÂÖ•‰øÑÁæÖÊñØÂìàËñ©ÂÖãËÄÖÂçÅ‰πã‰∫åÔºåÂçíÊÆ≤ÊñºÂ§ßÂÖµËÄÖÂçÅ‰πã‰∏â„ÄÇ‚Äù in what Michael Edmund Clarke described as \\"the complete destruction of not only the Zunghar state but of the Zunghars as a people.\\". Historian Peter Perdue has argued that the decimation of the Dzungars was the result of an explicit policy of massacre launched by the Qianlong Emperor.. The Dzungar genocide has been compared to the Qing extermination of the Jinchuan Tibetan people in 1776, which also occurred during the Qianlong Emperor's reign. When victorious troops returned to Beijing, a celebratory hymn was sung in their honour. A Manchu version of the hymn was recorded by the Jesuit Amoit and sent to Paris. The Qing Empire hired Zhao Yi and Jiang Yongzhi at the Military Archives Office, in their capacity as members of the Hanlin Academy, to compile works on the Dzungar campaign, such as Strategy for the pacification of the Dzungars (Pingding Zhunge'er fanglue). Poems glorifying the Qing conquest and genocide of the Dzungar Mongols were written by Zhao, who wrote the Yanpu zaji in \\"brush- notes\\" style, where military expenditures of the Qianlong Emperor's reign were recorded. The Qianlong Emperor was praised as being the source of \\"eighteenth- century peace and prosperity\\" by Zhao Yi. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince Ching√ºnjav had plotted with the Dzungar leader Amursana and led a rebellion against the Qing Empire around the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing army crushed the rebellion and executed Ching√ºnjav and his entire family. Throughout this period there were continued Mongol interventions in Tibet and a reciprocal spread of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. After the Lhasa riot of 1750, the Qianlong Emperor sent armies into Tibet and firmly established the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, with a Qing resident and garrison to preserve Qing presence. Further afield, military campaigns against Nepalese and Gurkhas forced the emperor into stalemate where both parties had to submit. William Alexander, 1793 The Qianlong Emperor responded to the vassal Shan states request for military aid against the attacking forces of Burma, but the Sino-Burmese War ended in complete failure. He initially believed that it would be an easy victory against a barbarian tribe, and sent only the Green Standard Army based in Yunnan, which borders Burma. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765‚Äì66 and 1766‚Äì67 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military manoeuvres nationwide in both countries. The third invasion (1767‚Äì1768) led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from the capital, Ava.Hall, pp. 27‚Äì29 However, the Manchu Bannermen of northern China could not cope with \\"unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases\\", and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, King Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier. With the Qing forces completely encircled, a truce was reached between the field commanders of the two sides in December 1769. The Qing forces kept a heavy military lineup in the border areas of Yunnan for about one decade in an attempt to wage another war while imposing a ban on inter-border trade for two decades. When Burma and China resumed a diplomatic relationship in 1790, the Qing government unilaterally viewed the act as Burmese submission, and claimed victory.Dai, p.145 The circumstances in Vietnam were not successful either. In 1787, L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng, the last ruler of the Vietnamese L√™ dynasty, fled from Vietnam and formally requested to be restored to his throne in ThƒÉng Long (present-day Hanoi). The Qianlong Emperor agreed and sent a large army into Vietnam to remove the T√¢y S∆°n (peasant rebels who had captured all of Vietnam). The capital, ThƒÉng Long, was conquered in 1788, but a few months later the Qing army was defeated and the invasion turned into a debacle due to the surprise attack during T·∫øt (Vietnamese New Year) by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, the second and most capable of the three T√¢y S∆°n brothers. The Qing Empire gave formal protection to L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng and his family, and would not intervene in Vietnam for another 90 years. Despite setbacks in the south, overall the Qianlong Emperor's military expansion nearly doubled the area of the already vast Qing Empire, and brought into the fold many non-Han-Chinese peoples‚Äîsuch as Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, Evenks and Mongols‚Äîwho were potentially hostile. It was also a very expensive enterprise; the funds in the Imperial Treasury were almost all put into military expeditions.Schirokauer, Conrad & Clark, Donald N. Modern East Asia: A Brief History, 2nd ed. pp. 35. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston & New York. 2008 . Though the wars were successful, they were not overwhelmingly so. The Qing army declined noticeably and had a difficult time facing some enemies: the campaign against the Jinchuan hill peoples took 2 to 3 years‚Äîat first the Qing army were mauled, though Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) later took control of the situation. The battle with the Dzungars was closely fought, and caused heavy losses on both sides. The Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghur Muslims against the Manchus occurred after Uyghur women were gang raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng. It was said that Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son's] hides and eat their flesh. because of the rape of Uyghur Muslim women for months by the Manchu official Sucheng and his son. The Manchu Qianlong Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, the Qing forces enslaved all the Uyghur children and women and slaughtered the Uyghur men. Manchu soldiers and Manchu officials regularly having sex with or raping Uyghur women caused massive hatred and anger against Manchu rule among Uyghur Muslims. The invasion by Jahangir Khoja was preceded by another Manchu official, Binjing, who raped a Muslim daughter of the Kokan aqsaqal from 1818-1820. The Qing sought to cover up the rape of Uyghur women by Manchus to prevent anger against their rule from spreading among the Uyghurs. At the end of the frontier wars, the Qing army had started to weaken significantly. In addition to a more lenient military system, warlords became satisfied with their lifestyles. Since most of the warring had already taken place, warlords no longer saw any reason to train their armies, resulting in a rapid military decline by the end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign. This was the main reason for the Qing military's failure to suppress the White Lotus Rebellion, which started towards the end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign and extended into the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor. Cultural achievements Giuseppe Castiglione, 18th century The Qianlong Emperor Viewing Paintings The Qianlong Emperor, like his predecessors, took his cultural role seriously. First of all, he worked to preserve the Manchu heritage, which he saw as the basis of the moral character of the Manchus and thus of the dynasty's power. He ordered the compilation of Manchu language genealogies, histories, and ritual handbooks and in 1747 secretly ordered the compilation of the Shamanic Code, published later in the Siku Quanshu. He further solidified the dynasty's cultural and religious claims in Central Asia by ordering a replica of the Tibetan Potala Palace, the Putuo Zongcheng Temple, to be built on the grounds of the imperial summer palace in Chengde.Jonathan D. Spence. The Search for Modern China. (New York: Norton, 3rd, 2013 ), p. 98. In order to present himself to Tibetans and Mongols in Buddhist rather than in Confucian terms, he commissioned a thangka, or sacred painting, depicting him as Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.Freer Sackler The Qianlong Emperor was a major patron and important \\"preserver and restorer\\" of Confucian culture. He had an insatiable appetite for collecting, and acquired much of China's \\"great private collections\\" by any means necessary, and \\"reintegrated their treasures into the imperial collection.\\" The Qianlong Emperor, more than any other Manchu emperor, lavished the imperial collection with his attention and effort: > The imperial collection had its origins in the first century BC, and had > gone through many vicissitudes of fire, civil wars and foreign invasions in > the centuries that followed. But it was Qianlong who lavished the greatest > attention on it, certainly of any of the Manchu rulers...

The Qianlong Emperor's massive art collection became an intimate part of his life; he took landscape paintings with him on his travels in order to compare them with the actual landscapes, or to hang them in special rooms in palaces where he lodged, to inscribe them on every visit there. \\"He also regularly added poetic inscriptions to the paintings of the imperial collection, following the example of the emperors of the Song dynasty and the literati painters of the Ming dynasty. They were a mark of distinction for the work, and a visible sign of his rightful role as emperor. Most particular to the Qianlong Emperor is another type of inscription, revealing a unique practice of dealing with works of art that he seems to have developed for himself. On certain fixed occasions over a long period he contemplated a number of paintings or works of calligraphy which possessed special meaning for him, inscribing each regularly with mostly private notes on the circumstances of enjoying them, using them almost as a diary.\\" \\"Most of the several thousand jade items in the imperial collection date from his reign. The (Qianlong) Emperor was also particularly interested in collecting ancient bronzes, bronze mirrors and seals,\\" in addition to pottery, ceramics and applied arts such as enameling, metal work and lacquer work, which flourished during his reign; a substantial part of his collection is in the Percival David Foundation in London. The Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum also have collections of art from the Qianlong era. \\"The Qianlong Emperor was a passionate poet and essayist. In his collected writings, which were published in a tenfold series between 1749 and 1800, over 40,000 poems and 1,300 prose texts are listed, making him one of the most prolific writers of all time. There is a long tradition of poems of this sort in praise of particular objects ('yongwu shi), and the Qianlong Emperor used it in order to link his name both physically and intellectually with ancient artistic tradition.\\" One of the Qianlong Emperor's grandest projects was to \\"assemble a team of China's finest scholars for the purpose of assembling, editing, and printing the largest collection ever made of Chinese philosophy, history, and literature.\\" Known as the Four Treasuries Project (or Siku Quanshu), it was published in 36,000 volumes, containing about 3,450 complete works and employing as many as 15,000 copyists. It preserved numerous books, but was also intended as a way to ferret out and suppress political opponents, requiring the \\"careful examination of private libraries to assemble a list of around eleven thousand works from the past, of which about a third were chosen for publication. The works not included were either summarised or‚Äîin a good many cases‚Äîscheduled for destruction.\\" =Burning of books and modification of texts= A visit by the Emperor to the tombs of his ancestors. Qianlong Emperor entering Suzhou and the Grand Canal. Some 2,300 works were listed for total suppression and another 350 for partial suppression. The aim was to destroy the writings that were anti-Qing or rebellious, that insulted previous \\"barbarian\\" dynasties, or that dealt with frontier or defence problems.Alexander Woodside, \\"The Ch‚Äôien- Lung Reign,\\" in The full editing of the Siku Quanshu was completed in about ten years; during these ten years, 3,100 titles (or works), about 150,000 copies of books were either burnt or banned. Of those volumes that had been categorised into the Siku Quanshu, many were subjected to deletion and modification. Books published during the Ming dynasty suffered the greatest damage.Guy (1987), p. 167. The authority would judge any single character or any single sentence's neutrality; if the authority had decided these words, or sentence, were derogatory or cynical towards the rulers, then persecution would begin.Guy (1987), p. 166. In the Qianlong Emperor's time, there were 53 cases of Literary Inquisition, resulting in the victims executed by beheading or slow slicing (lingchi), or having their corpses mutilated (if they were already dead). =Literary works= In 1743, after his first visit to Mukden (present-day Shenyang, Liaoning), the Qianlong Emperor used Chinese to write his \\"Ode to Mukden,\\" (Shengjing fu/Mukden-i fujurun bithe), a fu in classical style, as a poem of praise to Mukden, at that point a general term for what was later called Manchuria, describing its beauties and historical values. He describes the mountains and wildlife, using them to justify his belief that the dynasty would endure. A Manchu translation was then made. In 1748, he ordered a jubilee printing in both Chinese and Manchu, using some genuine pre- Qin forms, but Manchu styles which had to be invented and which could not be read. =Languages= In his childhood, the Qianlong Emperor was tutored in Manchu, Chinese and Mongolian, arranged to be tutored in Tibetan, and spoke Chagatai (Turki or Modern Uyghur) and Tangut. However, he was even more concerned than his predecessors to preserve and promote the Manchu language among his followers, as he proclaimed that \\"the keystone for Manchus is language.\\" He commissioned new Manchu dictionaries, and directed the preparation of the Pentaglot Dictionary which gave equivalents for Manchu terms in Mongolian, Tibetan and Turkic, and had the Buddhist canon translated into Manchu, which was considered the \\"national language\\". He directed the elimination of loanwords taken from Chinese and replaced them with calque translations which were put into new Manchu dictionaries. Manchu translations of Chinese works during his reign were direct translations contrasted with Manchu books translated during the Kangxi Emperor's reign which were transliterations in Manchu script of the Chinese characters. The Qianlong Emperor commissioned the Yuding Xiyu Tongwen Zhi (Ê¨ΩÂÆöË•øÂüüÂêåÊñáÂøó; \\"Imperial Western Regions Thesaurus\\") which was a thesaurus of geographic names in Xinjiang in Oirat Mongol, Manchu, Chinese, Tibetan, and Turki (Modern Uyghur). =Tibetan Buddhism= Engraving of the Qianlong Emperor Qianlong Emperor on a hunting trip The long association of the Manchu rulership with the Bodhisattva Manjusri and his own interest in Tibetan Buddhism gave credence to the Qianlong Emperor's patronage of Tibetan Buddhist art and patronage of translations of the Buddhist canon. The accounts in court records and Tibetan language sources affirm his personal commitment. He quickly learned to read the Tibetan language and studied Buddhist texts assiduously. His beliefs are reflected in the Tibetan Buddhist imagery of his tomb, perhaps the most personal and private expression of an emperor's life. He supported the Yellow Church (the Tibetan Buddhist Gelukpa sect) to \\"maintain peace among the Mongols\\" since the Mongols were followers of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama of the Yellow Church, and the Qianlong Emperor had this explanation placed in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing on a stele entitled \\"Lama Shuo\\" (on Lamas) in 1792, and he also said it was \\"merely in pursuance of Our policy of extending Our affection to the weak.\\" which led him to patronize the Yellow Church.Elisabeth Benard, \\"The Qianlong Emperor and Tibetan Buddhism,\\" in Dunnell & Elliott & Foret & Millward 2004, pp. 123-4. Mark Elliott concludes that these actions delivered political benefits but \\"meshed seamlessly with his personal faith.\\" This explanation of supporting the \\"Yellow Hats\\" Tibetan Buddhists for practical reasons was used to deflect Han criticism of this policy by the Qianlong Emperor, who had the \\"Lama Shuo\\" stele engraved in Tibetan, Mongol, Manchu and Chinese, which said: \\"By patronizing the Yellow Church, we maintain peace among the Mongols. This being an important task we cannot but protect this (religion). (In doing so) we do not show any bias, nor do we wish to adulate the Tibetan priests as (was done during the) Yuan dynasty.\\"Lopez 1999, p. 20.Berger 2003, p. 35. The Qianlong Emperor turned the Palace of Harmony (Yonghe Palace) into a Tibetan Buddhist temple for Mongols in 1744 and had an edict inscribed on a stele to commemorate it in Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese, and Manchu, with most likely the Qianlong Emperor having first wrote the Chinese version before the Manchu.Berger 2003, p. 34. Persecution of Christians by his father became even worse during his reign.Jocelyn M. N. Marinescu (2008). Defending Christianity in China: The Jesuit Defense of Christianity in the \\"Lettres Edifiantes Et Curieuses\\" & \\"Ruijianlu\\" in Relation to the Yongzheng Proscription of 1724. ProQuest. pp. 29, 33, 136, 240, 265. . =Anti-Islam laws= Qing policy on Muslims and Islam was changed during the reign of the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors. While the Kangxi emperors proclaimed Muslims and Han to be equal, his grandson the Manchu Qianlong emperor endorsed Han officials harsh recommendations towards treatment of Muslims. The Kangxi emperor said that Muslim and Han Chinese were equal when people argued for Muslims to be treated differently. The Qing Yongzheng emperor held the opinion that Islam was foolish, but he felt it did not pose a threat when a judge in Shandong petitioned him to destroy mosques and ban Islam. Yongzheng then fired an official for demanding Muslims be punished more harshly than non-Muslims. This policy changed in the reign of the Qianlong emperor, the son of the Yongzheng emperor and grandson of the Kangxi emperor. Chen Hongmou, a Qing official, said that Muslims needed to be brought to law and order by being punished more harshly and blaming Muslim leaders for criminal behavior of Muslims in a letter to the Board of Punishments called Covenant to Instruct and Admonish Muslims that he wrote in 1751. Although the Board of Punishment did nothing, the Shaanxi-Gansu Governor-General in 1762 then proceeded to implement his recommendation and had Muslim criminals punished severely more than Han Chinese ones. He also implemented the policy that the criminal deeds of Muslim congregants of Mosques ended up with their Imams being punished and held responsible for them. These anti-Muslim policies by the governor general received endorsement from the Manchu Qianlong emperor. Great changes happening to Chinese Muslims, like the introduction of a Sufi order, the Naqshbandiyya to the Hui, causing the Qianlong emperor to adopt this harsh attitude against Muslims in contrast to his grandfather and father. This led to larger connections between the Hui and the broader Islamic world from the west, as the Naqshbandiyya order came east to the Hui when Hui scholars in Suzhou were converted to Naqshbandiyya by Muhammad Yusuf. Khoja Afaq, Muhammad Yusuf's son, also further spread Naqshbandi orders among Chinese Muslims like Tibetan Muslims, Salars, Hui and other Muslim ethnicities in Hezhou, Gansu (now Linxia) and Xining in Qinghai and Lanzhou. Ma Laichi was the leader of one of these orders and he personally studied in the Islamic world in Bukhara to learn Sufism, and Yemen and in Mecca where he was taught by Mawlana Makhdum. This brought him prestige among Chinese Muslims. In an argument over the breaking of fast during Ramadan Ma Laichi said that before praying in the mosque, fast should be broken, not vice versa and this led to him getting many Naqshbandi converts from Hui and Turkic Salars. It came to court in 1731 when the Muslims arguing over how to break Ramadan fast filed lawsuits. The Muslim plaintiffs were told by the Qing authorities at the court to resolve the themselves, as the legal authorities who had no idea about Ramadan fasting. The dispute was not solved and continued to go on and was compounded by even more disputes like how to perform dhikr in Sufism, in a jahri (vocal) as taught by Ma Mingxin, another Sufi who learned in the western Islamic lands like Bukhara, or khufi (silent) like what Ma Laichi did. The Zabid Naqshbandiyyas in Yemen taught Ma Mingxin for two decades. They taught vocal dhikr. Ma Mingxin was also affected by another series of events in the Middle Eastern Muslim world, revivalist movements among Muslims like the Saudis who allied with Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab. This renewal tajdid influenced Ma Mingxin in Yemen. While Ma Mingxin was in Yemen and away from China, all of Muslim Inner Asia was conquered by the \\"infidel\\" Qing dynasty giving even more relevance to his situation and views. Ma Laichi and Ma Mingxin again sued each other in court but this second time the Qing passed a verdict in favor of the quiet dhikr faction, the Silentist Khafiyya of Ma Laichi and gave it the status of orthodoxy while damning as heterodox the Aloudist Jahriyya of Ma Mingxin. Ma Mingxin ignored the order and kept proselytizing in Shaanxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang going to Guangchuan from Hezhou in 1769 after being kicked out and banned from Xunhua district. Turkic Salars in Xunhua followed his orders even after the Qing banned him from there and he continued to have further lawsuits and legal issues with the Khafiyya and Ma Laichi as the Qing backed the Khafiyya. A violent battle where a Qing official and Khafiyya followers were among one hundred slaughtered by a Jahriyya assault headed by Su Forty-three, a supporter of Ma Mingxin in 1781 led to Ma Mingxin declared a rebel and taken to jail in Lanzhou. The Qing executed Ma Mingxin after his release was demanded by the armed followers of Su Forty-three. A Jahriyya rebellion all over northwest China ensued after Ma Mingxin was executed. In response, the Manchus in Beijing sent Manchu Grand Secretary Agui with a battalion to slaughter Jahriyya chiefs and exile the adherents of the Sufi order to the border regions. Tian Wu led another Jahriyya rebellion 3 years after that, which was crushed by the Qing, and the Ma Datian, the Jahriyya's 3rd leader was exiled to Manchuria in 1818 by the Qing and died. This continual build up of conflict between Muslims and the Qing court led to the 19th century full scale wars with Muslim rebellions against the Qing in southern and northern China. The change in Manchu attitudes towards Muslims, from tolerating Muslims and regarding them as equal to Han Chinese, before the 1760s, to the violence between the Qing state and Muslims after the 1760s, was due to progressive Qing involvement in the conflict between the Sufi orders Jahriyya and Khafiyya making it no longer possible for the Qing to keep up with the early rhetoric of Muslim equality. The Manchu court under Qianlong began approving and implementing Chen Hongmou's anti-Muslim laws that targeted Muslims for practicing their religion and the violence by the Qing state, the communal violence between Jahriyya and Khafiyya coincided with the Jahriyya's major expansion. Qing incompetence destroyed the economy of the places where Muslims lived in leading to even more tension. Chen Hongmou's policies were implemented as laws in 1762 by the Qing government's Board of Punishments and the Qing Manchu Qianlong emperor leading to severe tensions with Muslims. State authorities were mandated to receive all reports of Muslim criminal behaviour by local officials and all criminal behaviour by Muslims had to be reported by Muslim leaders to Qing authorities under these laws. This led to an inundation of anti-Muslim reports filing in Qing offices as the Qing court received information that Muslims were inherently violent and Muslim bandits were committing crimes as report after report were filed by local officials and Muslim crimes inundated court records. The Qing became even more anti- Muslim after receiving these reports about criminal behavior and started passing even more anti-Muslim laws one of them being that if any weapon was found in a group of 3 or more Muslims all of those Muslims would by sentenced as criminals by the Qing. A new criminal category or act, brawling (dou'ou) was designated by the Qing Manchu court of the Manchu Qianlong emperor in the 1770s especially as an anti-Muslim measure to arrest Muslims leading to even non-Jahriyya Muslims to join with Jahriyya against the Qing and leading the Qing court to be even more anti-Muslim, apprehensive of anti-Qing rebellion by Muslims. This led to the execution of Ma Mingxin in 1781 and the rebellion and violence was compounded by lack of Qing intelligence. A Qing official who was tasked with ending the Jahriyya and Khafiyya communal violence mistakenly thought the people he were talking to were Khafiyya when they were in fact Jahriyya, and he told them that the Qing would massacre all Jahriyya adherents. This led to him being murdered by the Jahriyya mob, which led to the Qing sending Manchu Grand Secretary Agui on a full scale pacification crackdown campaign against the Jahriyya. The military victory of the Qing against the Jahriyya led to even more Jahriyya anger. Officials went overboard in massacring Muslims deemed as state enemies to impress the Qing court, leading to further growth in Jahriyya membership, leading in turn to the 1784 rebellion by Tian Wu. The Qianlong emperor asked his minister what was going on as he was puzzled as to how the Muslims from many regions gathered together for revolt. He asked if the investigation of Muslim behavior b y Li Shiyao got leaked leading to rebels to incite violence by telling Muslims the government would exterminate them. He then pondered and said none of these could be why and kept asking why. To solve the issue of the 1784 revolt, northwestern China was put under military occupation by the Qing for 50 years until the Taiping rebellion of southern China forced the Qing to move them away from northwest China leading to the massive 1860s and 1870s Muslim revolts in the northwest caused by growing violence. The sudden questions about Halal in Islam that Mongol Buddhists had in the 18th century was caused by all these things, northwestern China right next to Mongolia getting militarized, the Qing government officially declaring Muslims to be anti-Qing and violent and revivalist Islam coming to China =Palaces= Consorts and children of the Qianlong Emperor Consorts of the Qianlong Emperor The Qianlong Emperor watching a wrestling match The Qianlong Emperor was an aggressive builder. In the hills northwest of Beijing, he expanded the villa known as the \\"Garden of Perfect Brightness\\" (Yuanmingyuan) (now known as the Old Summer Palace) that was built by his father. He eventually added two new villas, the \\"Garden of Eternal Spring\\" and the \\"Elegant Spring Garden\\". In time, the Old Summer Palace would encompass , five times larger than the Forbidden City. To celebrate the 60th birthday of his mother, Empress Dowager Chongqing, the Qianlong Emperor ordered a lake at the \\"Garden of Clear Ripples\\" (Qingyiyuan) (now known as the Summer Palace) dredged, named it Kunming Lake, and renovated a villa on the eastern shore of the lake.Rawski, Evelyn The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions (University of California Press, 1998) pgs. 23 & 24 The Qianlong Emperor also expanded the imperial summer palace in Rehe Province, beyond the Great Wall. Rehe eventually became effectively a third capital and it was at Rehe that the Qianlong Emperor held court with various Mongol nobles. The emperor also spent time at the Mulan hunting grounds north of Rehe, where he held the imperial hunt each year. European styles For the Old Summer Palace, the Qianlong Emperor commissioned the Italian Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione for the construction of the Xiyang Lou, or Western-style mansion, to satisfy his taste for exotic buildings and objects. He also commissioned the French Jesuit Michel Benoist, to design a series of timed waterworks and fountains complete with underground machinery and pipes, for the amusement of the imperial family. The French Jesuit Jean Denis Attiret also became a painter for the emperor.ËóèÂìÅ/ÁªòÁîª/ÁéãËá¥ËØö‰πæÈöÜÂ∞ÑÁÆ≠ÂõæÂ±è Jean-Damasc√®ne Sallusti was also a court painter. He co-designed, with Castiglione and Ignatius Sichelbart, the Battle Copper Prints. Other architecture During the Qianlong Emperor's reign, the Emin Minaret was built in Turpan to commemorate Emin Khoja, a Uyghur leader from Turfan who submitted to the Qing Empire as a vassal in order to obtain assistance from the Qing to fight the Zunghars. =Descendants of the Ming dynasty's imperial family= In 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor bestowed a hereditary marquis title on a descendant of Zhu Zhilian, a descendant of the imperial family of the Ming dynasty. Zhu was also paid by the Qing government to perform rituals at the Ming tombs and induct the Chinese Plain White Banner into the Eight Banners. Zhu was posthumously awarded the title \\"Marquis of Extended Grace\\" in 1750, and the title was passed on for 12 generations in his family until the end of the Qing dynasty. However, it has been argued that Zhu Zhilian, in fact, had no relation to the imperial family at all. =Banner system= Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione (known as Lang Shining in Chinese) (1688‚Äì1766) The Qianlong Emperor instituted a policy of \\"Manchu-fying\\" the Eight Banner system, which was the basic military and social organisation of the dynasty. In the early Qing era, Nurhaci and Huangtaiji categorised Manchu and Han ethnic identity within the Eight Banners based on culture, lifestyle and language, instead of ancestry or genealogy. Han Bannermen were an important part of the Banner System. The Qianlong Emperor changed this definition to one of descent, and demobilised many Han Bannermen and urged Manchu Bannermen to protect their cultural heritage, language and martial skills. The emperor redefined the identity of Han Bannermen by saying that they were to be regarded as of having the same culture and being of the same ancestral extraction as Han civilians Conversely, he emphasised the martial side of Manchu culture and reinstituted the practice of the annual imperial hunt as begun by his grandfather, leading contingents from the Manchu and Mongol banners to the Mulan hunting grounds each autumn to test and improve their skills. The Qianlong Emperor's view of the Han Bannermen also differed from that of his grandfather in deciding that loyalty in itself was most important quality. He sponsored biographies which depicted Chinese Bannermen who defected from the Ming to the Qing as traitors and glorifying Ming loyalists. Some of the Qianlong Emperor's inclusions and omissions on the list of traitors were political in nature. Some of these actions were including Li Yongfang (out of his dislike for Li Yongfang's descendant, Li Shiyao) and excluding Ma Mingpei (out of concern for his son Ma Xiongzhen's image). The identification and interchangeability between \\"Manchu\\" and \\"Banner people\\" (Qiren) began in the 17th century. Banner people were differentiated from civilians (Chinese: minren, Manchu: irgen, or Chinese: Hanren, Manchu :Nikan) and the term Bannermen was becoming identical with \\"Manchu\\" in the general perception. The Qianlong Emperor referred to all Bannermen as Manchu, and Qing laws did not say \\"Manchu\\", but \\"Bannermen\\". Select groups of Han Chinese bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han Chinese to Manchu. Han Chinese bannermen of Tai Nikan Âè∞Â∞ºÂ†™ (watchpost Chinese) and Fusi Nikan ÊäöÈ°∫Â∞ºÂ†™ (Fushun Chinese) backgrounds into the Manchu banners in 1740 by order of the Qing Qianlong emperor. It was between 1618‚Äì1629 when the Han Chinese from Liaodong who later became the Fushun Nikan and Tai Nikan defected to the Jurchens (Manchus). These Han Chinese origin Manchu clans continue to use their original Han surnames and are marked as of Han origin on Qing lists of Manchu clans. =Anti-gun measures= The Solons were ordered by the Qianlong Emperor to stop using rifles and instead practice traditional archery. The emperor issued an edict for silver taels to be issued for guns turned over to the government. =Chinese nobility= The Qianlong Emperor granted the title of Wujing Boshi (‰∫îÁªèÂçöÂ£´; ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨) to the descendants of Zhang Zai, Fu Sheng, and Yan Hui.Â≠îÊ∞èÂÆó‰∫≤ÁΩë-Â≠îÂ≠êÂêéË£îÁöÑÁΩë‰∏äÂÆ∂Âõ≠-Ê∏ÖÊúùÂØπÂú£Èó®ÂêÑË¥§Ë£îÁöÑÂ∞ÅËµ† The Manchu prince Abatai's daughter was married to the Han Chinese general Li Yongfang (ÊùéÊ∞∏Ëä≥).ÊõπÂæ∑ÂÖ®ÔºöÈ¶ñ‰∏™ÊäïÈôçÂêéÈáëÁöÑÊòéÂ∞ÜÊùéÊ∞∏Ëä≥ ‚Äî ÊäöÈ°∫‰∏ÉÂçÉÂπ¥(wapÁâà) The offspring of Li received the \\"Third-class Viscount\\" () title. Li Yongfang was the great-great-great-grandfather of Li Shiyao (Êùé‰æçÂ†Ø), who, during the Qianlong Emperor's reign, was involved in graft and embezzlement, demoted of his noble title and sentenced to death; however, his life was spared and he regained his title after assisting in the Taiwan campaign.LI SHIH-YAO FANG CHAO-YING Dartmouth College Chinese political identity and frontier policy The Qianlong Emperor and his predecessors, since the Shunzhi Emperor, had identified China and the Qing Empire as the same, and in treaties and diplomatic papers the Qing Empire called itself \\"China\\".Zhao 2006, p. 7. The Qianlong Emperor rejected earlier ideas that only Han could be subjects of China and only Han land could be considered as part of China, so he redefined China as multiethnic, saying in 1755 that \\"there exists a view of China (zhongxia), according to which non-Han people cannot become China's subjects and their land cannot be integrated into the territory of China. This does not represent our dynasty's understanding of China, but is instead that of the earlier Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties.\\"Zhao 2006, p. 4. The Qianlong Emperor rejected the views of Han officials who said Xinjiang was not part of China and that he should not conquer it, putting forth the view that China was multiethnic and did not just refer to Han.Zhao 2006, pp. 11-12. The Qianlong Emperor compared his achievements with that of the Han and Tang ventures into Central Asia.Millward 1998, p. 25. Han settlement Han Chinese farmers were resettled from north China by the Qing government in the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation. Wasteland was reclaimed by Han squatters in addition to other Han people who rented land from Manchu landlords. Despite officially prohibiting Han settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing government decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. Due to this, Han people farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s. The Qianlong Emperor allowed Han peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740-76.Scharping 1998, p. 18. Han tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the \\"imperial estates\\" and Manchu Bannerlands in the area. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta was settled by Han people during the Qianlong Emperor's reign, and Han people were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800. To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing government sold lands along the Sungari which were previously exclusively for Manchus to Han Chinese at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, and Han people filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s, according to Abb√© Huc. Later years The Qianlong Emperor in his old age In his later years, the Qianlong Emperor became spoiled with power and glory, disillusioned and complacent in his reign, and started placing his trust in corrupt officials such as Yu Minzhong and Heshen. As Heshen was the highest ranked minister and most favoured by the Qianlong Emperor at the time, the day-to-day governance of the country was left in his hands, while the emperor himself indulged in the arts, luxuries and literature. When Heshen was executed by the Jiaqing Emperor, the Qing government discovered that Heshen's personal fortune exceeded that of the Qing Empire's depleted treasury, amounting to 900 million silver taels, the total of 12 years of Treasury surplus of the Qing imperial court. The Qianlong Emperor began his reign with about 33.95 million silver taels in Treasury surplus. At the peak of his reign, around 1775, even with further tax cuts, the treasury surplus still reached 73.9 million silver taels, a record unmatched by his predecessors, the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors, both of whom had implemented remarkable tax cut policies. However, due to numerous factors such as long term embezzlement and corruption by officials, frequent expeditions to the south, huge palace constructions, many war and rebellion campaigns as well as his own extravagant lifestyle, all of these cost the treasury a total of 150.2 million silver taels. This, coupled with his senior age and the lack of political reforms, ushered the beginning of the gradual decline and eventual demise of the Qing Empire, casting a shadow over his glorious and brilliant political life.Palace Museum: Qianlong Emperor (‰πæÈöÜÁöáÂ∏ù) =Macartney Embassy= Lord Macartney's embassy, 1793 The French Jesuit Joseph-Marie Amiot (1718‚Äì1793) was the official translator of Western languages for the Qianlong Emperor. Illustration depicting the last European delegation to be received at the Qianlong Emperor's court in 1795 ‚Äì Isaac Titsingh (seated European with hat, far left) and A.E. van Braam Houckgeest (seated European without hat) During the mid-18th century, European powers began to pressure for increases in the already burgeoning foreign trade and for outposts on the Chinese coast, demands which the aging Qianlong emperor resisted. In 1793 King George III sent a large-scale delegation to present their requests directly to the emperor in Beijing, headed by George Macartney, one of the country's most seasoned diplomats. The British sent a sample of trade goods that they intended to sell in China; this was misinterpreted as tribute that was adjudged to be of low quality. Historians both in China and abroad long presented the failure of the mission to achieve its goals as a symbol of China's refusal to change and inability to modernize. They explain the refusal first on the fact that interaction with foreign kingdoms was limited to neighbouring tributary states. Furthermore, the worldviews on the two sides were incompatible, China holding entrenched beliefs that China was the \\"central kingdom\\". However, after the publication in the 1990s of a fuller range of archival documents concerning the visit, these claims have been challenged. Some assert that China's present day autonomy and successful modernization put the Qianlong Emperor's actions in a new light. One historian summed the newly revised view by characterizing the emperor and his court as \\"clearly clever and competent political operators\\". They acted within the formal claims of Qing claims to universal rule, but also simply reacted prudently by placating the British with unspecified promises in order to avoid military conflicts and loss of trade. Macartney was granted an audience with the Qianlong Emperor on two days, the second of which coincided with the emperor's 82nd birthday. There is continued debate about the nature of the audience and what level of ceremonials were performed. Macartney wrote that he resisted demands that the British trade ambassadors kneel and perform the kowtow and debate continues as to what exactly occurred, differing opinions recorded by Qing courtiers and British delegates.For a conventional European perspective of the audience question, see Alain Peyrefitte, The Immobile Empire, translated by Jon Rotschild (New York: Knopf: Distributed by Random House, 1992.) For a critique, see James L. Hevia, Cherishing Men from Afar: Qing Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy of 1793.(Durham: Duke University Press, 1995). For a discussion on Hevia's book, see exchange between Hevia and Joseph W. Esherick in Modern China 24, no. 2 (1998). Qianlong gave Macartney a letter for the British king stating the reasons that he would not grant Macartney's requests: > Yesterday your Ambassador petitioned my Ministers to memorialise me > regarding your trade with China, but his proposal is not consistent with our > dynastic usage and cannot be entertained. Hitherto, all European nations, > including your own country's barbarian merchants, have carried on their > trade with our Celestial Empire at Canton. Such has been the procedure for > many years, although our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific > abundance and lacks no product within its own borders.

Emperor Qianlong's skepticism toward the British Empire would later prove prophetic. After Great Britain began importing Chinese tea, the balance of trade no longer favored Britain, and the empire came up with a strategy to force China to become a market for a good that British traders could sell as the Qing Dynasty's trade policy only allowed their merchants to accept silver as payment for tea exports. British traders would be responsible for smuggling large quantities of opium to southern China, causing a national addiction crisis and resulting in two wars. =Titsingh Embassy= A Dutch embassy arrived at the Qianlong Emperor's court in 1795, which would turn out to be the last time any European appeared before the Qing imperial court within the context of traditional Chinese imperial foreign relations.O'Neil, Patricia O. (1995). Missed Opportunities: Late 18th century Chinese Relations with England and the Netherlands. [PhD dissertation, University of Washington] Representing Dutch and Dutch East India Company interests, Isaac Titsingh traveled to Beijing in 1794‚Äì95 for celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Qianlong Emperor's reign.Duyvendak, J.J.L.

Titsingh's French translator, Chr√©tien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes, published his own account of the Titsingh mission in 1808. Voyage a P√©kin, Manille et l'Ile de France provided an alternate perspective and a useful counterpoint to other reports that were then circulating. Titsingh himself died before he could publish his version of events. In contrast to Macartney, Isaac Titsingh, the Dutch and VOC emissary in 1795 did not refuse to kowtow. In the year following Mccartney's rebuff, Titsingh and his colleagues were much feted by the Chinese because of what was construed as seemly compliance with conventional court etiquette.van Braam, An authentic account..., Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 283‚Äì288. Abdication In October 1795, the Qianlong Emperor officially announced that in the spring of the following year he would voluntarily abdicate his throne and pass the throne to his son. It was said that the Qianlong Emperor had made a promise during the year of his ascension not to rule longer than his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, who had reigned for 61 years. The Qianlong Emperor anticipated moving out of the Hall of Mental Cultivation (Yangxindian) in the Forbidden City. The hall had been conventionally dedicated for the exclusive use of the reigning sovereign, and in 1771 the emperor ordered the beginning of construction on what was ostensibly intended as his retirement residence in another part of the Forbidden City: a lavish, two-acre walled retreat called the \\"Palace of Tranquil Longevity (Ningshou Palace)\\", which is today more commonly known as the \\"Qianlong Garden\\". The complex, completed in 1776, is currently undergoing a ten-year restoration led by the Palace Museum in Beijing and the World Monuments Fund (WMF). The first of the restored apartments, the Qianlong Emperor's Juanqinzhai, or \\"Studio of Exhaustion From Diligent Service,\\" began an exhibition tour of the United States in 2010. The Qianlong Emperor relinquished the throne at the age of 85, after almost 61 years on the throne, to his son, the 36-year-old Jiaqing Emperor, in 1796. For the next three years, he held the title \\"Taishang Huang (or Emperor Emeritus)\\" (Â§™‰∏äÁöá) even though he continued to hold on to power and the Jiaqing Emperor ruled only in name. He never moved into his retirement suites in the Qianlong Garden. He died in 1799.Palace Museum: Jiaqing Emperor (ÂòâÂ∫ÜÁöáÂ∏ù) Legends A legend, popularised in fiction, says that the Qianlong Emperor was the son of Chen Shiguan (Èô≥‰∏ñÂÄå), a Han Chinese official from Haining County, Zhejiang Province. In his choice of heir to the throne, the Kangxi Emperor required not only that the heir be able to govern the empire well but that the heir's son be of no less calibre, thus ensuring the Manchus' everlasting reign over China. The son of Yinzhen, the Kangxi Emperor's fourth son, was a weakling so Yinzhen surreptitiously arranged for his daughter to be exchanged for Chen Shiguan's son, who became the favourite grandson of the Kangxi Emperor. Yinzhen succeeded his father and became the Yongzheng Emperor, while his \\"son\\", Hongli, succeeded him in turn as the Qianlong Emperor. During his reign, the Qianlong Emperor went on inspection tours to southern China and stayed in Chen Shiguan's house in Haining, where he wrote calligraphy. He also frequently issued imperial edicts to waive off taxes from Haining County. However, there are major problems with this story. First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and had the potential to ascend the throne. Indeed, since Hongshi was the son forced to commit suicide, it would have been far more logical for him to be the adopted son, if any of them were. Stories about the Qianlong Emperor's six inspection tours to southern China in disguise as a commoner have been a popular topic for many generations. In total, he visited southern China six times ‚Äì the same number of times as his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor.

It is an updated version of Ren√© Descartes's evil demon thought experiment originated by Gilbert Harman.Harman, Gilbert 1973: Thought, Princeton/NJ, p.5. Common to many science fiction stories, it outlines a scenario in which a mad scientist, machine, or other entity might remove a person's brain from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its neurons by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such stories, the computer would then be simulating reality (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the \\"disembodied\\" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences, such as those of a person with an embodied brain, without these being related to objects or events in the real world. Uses The simplest use of brain-in-a-vat scenarios is as an argument for philosophical skepticism and solipsism. A simple version of this runs as follows: Since the brain in a vat gives and receives exactly the same impulses as it would if it were in a skull, and since these are its only way of interacting with its environment, then it is not possible to tell, from the perspective of that brain, whether it is in a skull or a vat. Yet in the first case, most of the person's beliefs may be true (if they believe, say, that they are walking down the street, or eating ice-cream); in the latter case, their beliefs are false. Since the argument says one cannot know whether one is a brain in a vat, then one cannot know whether most of one's beliefs might be completely false. Since, in principle, it is impossible to rule out oneself being a brain in a vat, there cannot be good grounds for believing any of the things one believes; a skeptical argument would contend that one certainly cannot know them, raising issues with the definition of knowledge. The brain-in-a-vat is a contemporary version of the argument given in Hindu Maya illusion, Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Zhuangzi's \\"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly\\", and the evil demon in Ren√© Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy.  Philosophical debates  While the disembodied brain (the brain in a vat) can be seen as a helpful thought experiment, there are several philosophical debates surrounding the plausibility of the thought experiment. If these debates conclude that the thought experiment is implausible, a possible consequence would be that we are no closer to knowledge, truth, consciousness, representation, etc. than we were prior to the experiment. = Argument from biology = One argument against the BIV thought experiment derives from the idea that the BIV is not ‚Äì and cannot be ‚Äì biologically similar to that of an embodied brain (that is, a brain found in a person). Since the BIV is dis embodied, it follows that it does not have similar biology to that of an embodied brain. That is, the BIV lacks the connections from the body to the brain, which renders the BIV neither neuroanatomically nor neurophysiologically similar to that of an embodied brain. If this is the case, we cannot say that it is even possible for the BIV to have similar experiences to the embodied brain, since the brains are not equal. However, it could be counter-argued that the hypothetical machine could be made to also replicate those types of inputs. = Argument from externalism = A second argument deals directly with the stimuli coming into the brain. This is often referred to as the account from externalism or ultra-externalism. In the BIV, the brain receives stimuli from a machine. In an embodied brain, however, the brain receives the stimuli from the sensors found in the body (via touching, tasting, smelling, etc.) which receive their input from the external environment. This argument oftentimes leads to the conclusion that there is a difference between what the BIV is representing and what the embodied brain is representing. This debate has been hashed out, but remains unresolved, by several philosophers including Uriah Kriegel, Colin McGinn, and Robert D. Rupert, and has ramifications for philosophy of mind discussions on (but not limited to) representation, consciousness, content, cognition, and embodied cognition.

He was responsible for consolidating the empire that his father Nurhaci had founded and laid the groundwork for the conquest of the Ming dynasty, although he died before this was accomplished. He was also responsible for changing the name of the Jurchen ethnicity to \\"Manchu\\" in 1635, and changing the name of his dynasty from \\"Great Jin\\" to \\"Great Qing\\" in 1636. The Qing dynasty lasted until 1912.  Names and titles  It is unclear whether \\"Hong Taiji\\" was a title or a personal name. Written Hong taiji in Manchu, it was borrowed from the Mongolian title Khong Tayiji. That Mongolian term was itself derived from the Chinese huang taizi ÁöáÂ§™Â≠ê (\\"crown prince\\", \\"imperial prince\\"), but in Mongolian it meant, among other things, something like \\"respected son\\". Alternatively, historian Pamela Crossley argues that \\"Hung Taiji\\" was a title \\"of Mongolian inspiration\\" derived from hung, a word that appeared in other Mongolian titles at the time. Early seventeenth-century Chinese and Korean sources rendered his name as \\"Hong Taiji\\" (). The modern Chinese rendering \\"Huang Taiji\\" (), which uses the character huang (\\"imperial\\"), misleadingly implies that Hong Taiji once held the title of \\"imperial prince\\" or heir apparent, even though his father and predecessor Nurhaci never designated a successor. \\"Hong Taiji\\" was very rarely used in Manchu sources, because they observed a taboo on the personal names of emperors. In redacted documents, Hong Taiji was simply called the \\"Fourth Beile\\" or \\"fourth prince\\" (duici beile), indicating that he was the fourth ranked among the eight beile Nurhaci had designated from among his sons. However, an archival document rediscovered in 1996 and recounting events from 1621 calls him \\"Hong Taiji\\" in a discussion concerning the possible naming of Nurhaci's heir apparent, a title that the document refers to as taise. Tatiana Pang and Giovanni Stary, two specialists of early Manchu history, consider this document as \\"further evidence\\" that Hong Taiji was his real name, \\"not being at all connected with the Chinese title huang taizi\\". Historian Mark Elliott views this as persuasive evidence that Hong Taiji was not a title, but a personal name. Western scholars used to refer to Hong Taiji as \\"Abahai\\", but this appellation is now considered mistaken. Hong Taiji was never mentioned under this name in Manchu and Chinese sources; it was a mistake first made by Russian clergyman G.V. Gorsky and later repeated by sinologists starting in the early twentieth century. Giovanni Stary states that this name may have originated by confusing \\"Abkai\\" with Abkai sure, which was Hong Taiji's era name in the Manchu language. Though \\"Abahai\\" is indeed \\"unattested in Manchu sources\\", it might also have derived from the Mongol word Abaƒ°ai, an honorary name given to the younger sons of hereditary monarchs. According to another view, Hong Taiji was mistakenly referred to as Abahai as a result of a confusion with the name of Nurhaci's main consort Lady Abahai. Hong Taiji was the second Khan of the Later Jin and then Emperor of the Qing dynasty, after he changed its name. His title as Great Khan was Bogd S√©c√©n Khaan (Manchu: Gosin Onco H≈´waliyasun Enduringge Han). His reign names, which were used in his lifetime to record dates, were Tiancong (\\"heavenly wisdom\\"; Manchu: Abka-i sure) from 1627 to 1636, and Chongde (\\"lofty virtue\\"; Manchu: Wesihun erdemungge, Mongolian: Deged√º Erdemt√º) from 1636 to 1643. Hong Taiji's temple name, by which he was worshipped at the Imperial Ancestral Temple, was Taizong Â§™ÂÆó, the name that was conventionally given to the second emperor of a dynasty. His posthumous name, which was chosen to reflect his style of rule, was \\"Wen Huangdi\\" (Manchu: ≈°u h≈´wangdi), which means \\"the culturing emperor\\" or \\"the emperor of letters\\". Consolidation of power Hong Taiji in regular clothing. Hong Taiji was the eighth son of Nurhaci, whom he succeeded as the second ruler of the Later Jin dynasty in 1626. Although it was always thought of as gossip, he was said to be involved in the suicide of Prince Dorgon's mother, Lady Abahai in order to block the succession of his younger brother. This is speculated because at the time of Nurhaci's death, there were four Lords/Beile with Hong Taiji as the lowest rank, but also the most fit one. Originally, at the end of Nurhaci's reign, Hong Taiji got hold of the two White Banners, but after Lady Abahai's death, he switched his two banners with Dorgon and Dodo's two Yellow banners (Nurhaci gave his two Yellow Banners to the two). In the end, Hong Taiji had control over the two strongest/highest class banners- the Plain and Bordered Yellow Banners and the most influence. From there, he slowly got rid of his competitor's powers. Later, he would also receive the Plain Blue Banner from his fifth brother Mangg≈´ltai, which was the third strongest banner. Those three banners would officially become the Upper Three Banners during the early part of the Qing dynasty. Ethnic policies During his reign, Hong Taiji started recruitment of Han ethnicity officials. After a 1623 revolt, Nurhaci came to mistrust his Nikan (Manchu: , means \\"Han people\\") followers so Hong Taiji began their assimilation into the country and government. A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and Hong Taiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.ed. Walthall 2008, p. 148. It is the predecessor of Mongol Yamen ( ËíôÂè§Ë°ôÈñÄ, monggo jurgan) which was established for indirect government of Inner Mongolia after the Mongols were conquered by Hong Taiji. In 1638 it was renamed to Lifanyuan. Initially, the ministerial affairs were settled, while vice-ministers were set up as vice-ministers. Expansion He continued the expansion of the state in the region later known as Manchuria, pushing deeper into Mongolia and raiding Korea and Ming China. His personal military abilities were widely praised and he effectively developed the military-civil administration known as the Eight Banners or Banner system. This system was well-suited to accept the different peoples, primarily Chinese and Mongols, who joined the Manchu state either following negotiated agreements or military defeat. Although Hong Taiji patronized Tibetan Buddhism in public, in private he disdained the Buddhist belief of the Mongols and thought it was destructive of Mongol identity. He is quoted to have said that, \\"The Mongolian princes are abandoning the Mongolian language; their names are all in imitation of the lamas.\\" The Manchus themselves such as Hong Taiji did not personally believe in Tibetan Buddhism and few wanted to convert. Hong Taiji described some Tibetan Buddhist lamas as \\"incorrigibles\\" and \\"liars\\", but still patronized Buddhism in order to harness the Tibetans' and Mongols' belief in the religion. Hong Taiji started his conquest by subduing the potent Ming ally in Korea. February 1627 his forces crossed the Yalu River which had frozen. In 1628, he attempted to invade China, but was defeated by Yuan Chonghuan and his use of artillery. During the next five years, Hong Taiji spent resources in training his artillery to offset the strength of the Ming artillery. Hong Taiji upgraded the weapons of the Empire. He realized the advantage of the Red Cannons and later also bought the Red Cannons into the army. Though the Ming dynasty still had more cannons, Hong Taiji now possessed the cannons of equal might and Asia's strongest cavalry. Also during this time, he sent several probing raids into northern China which were defeated. First attack went through the Jehol Pass, then in 1632 and 1634 he sent raids into Shanxi. In 1636, Hong Taiji invaded Joseon Korea (see the Second Manchu invasion of Korea), as the latter did not accept that Hong Taiji had become emperor and refused to assist in operations against the Ming. With the Joseon dynasty surrendered in 1637, Hong Taiji succeeded in making them cut off relations with the Ming dynasty and force them to submit as tributary state of the Qing Empire. Also during this period, Hong Taiji took over Inner Mongolia in three major wars, each of them victorious. From 1636 until 1644, he sent 4 major expeditions into the Amur region. In 1640 he completed the conquest of the Evenks, when he defeated and captured their leader Bombogor. By 1644, the entire region was under his control. Huang Taji's plan at first was to make a deal with the Ming dynasty. If the Ming was willing to give support and money that would be beneficial to the Qing's economy, the Qing in exchange would not only be willing to not attack the borders, but also admit itself as a country one level lower than the Ming dynasty; however, since Ming court officials were reminded of the deal that preceded the Song dynasty's wars with the Jin Empire, the Ming refused the exchange. Huang Taiji rejected the comparison, saying that, \\"Neither is your Ming ruler a descendant of the Song nor are we heir to the Jin. That was another time.\\" Hong Taiji had not wanted to conquer the Ming. The Ming's refusal ultimately led him to take the offensive. The people who first encouraged him to invade China were his Han Chinese advisors Fan Wencheng, Ma Guozhu, and Ning Wanwo. Hong Taiji recognized that the Manchus needed Han Chinese defectors in order to assist in the conquest of the Ming, and thus explained to other Manchus why he also needed to be lenient to recent defectors like Ming general Hong Chengchou, who surrendered to the Qing in 1642. Government When Hong Taiji came into power, the military was composed of entirely Mongol and Manchu companies. By 1636, Hong Taiji created the first of many Chinese companies. Before the conquest of China, the number of companies organized by him and his successor was 278 Manchu, 120 Mongol, and 165 Chinese. By the time of Hong Taiji's death there were more Chinese than Manchus and he had realized the need for there to be control exerted whilst getting approval from the Chinese majority. Not only did he incorporate the Chinese into the military, but also into the government. The Council of Deliberative Officials was formed as the highest level of policy-making and was composed entirely of Manchu. However, Hong Taiji adopted from the Ming such institutions as the Six Ministries, the Censorate and others. Each of these lower ministries was headed by a Manchu prince, but had four presidents: two were Manchu, one was Mongol, and one was Chinese. This basic framework remained, even though the details fluctuated over time, for some time. The change from Jin to Qing Edict by Hong Taiji in Mongolian. Was given to many Mongolian lords who were in military service in Ming In 1635, Hong Taiji changed the name of his people from Jurchen (Manchu: 15px ju≈°en) to Manchu, or 15px manju in the Manchu language. The original meaning of Manju is not known and so the reasons for its adoption remain opaque. There are many theories as to the reason for the choice of name but two of the most commonly cited are its sounding similar to the Manchu word for \\"brave\\" and a possible connection with the Bodhisattva Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, of whom Nurhaci claimed to be an incarnation. The dynastic name Later Jin was a direct reference to the Jin dynasty founded by the Jurchen people, who ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234. As such, the name was likely to be viewed as closely tied to the Jurchens and would perhaps evoke hostility from Chinese who viewed the Song dynasty, rival state to the Jin, as the legitimate rulers of China at that time. Hong Taiji's ambition was to conquer China proper and overthrow the Ming dynasty, and to do that required not only a powerful military force but also an effective bureaucratic administration. For this, he used the obvious model, that of the Ming government, and recruited Ming officials to his cause. If the name of Later Jin would prove an impediment to his goal among many Chinese, then it was not too much to change it. At the same time, Hong Taiji conquered the territory north of Shanhai pass by Ming Dynasty and Ligdan Khan in Inner Mongolia. He won one of the Yuan Dynasty's imperial jade seal (Chinese: ) and a golden Buddha called \\"Mahakala\\".Ê∏ÖÂ§™ÂÆóÂØ¶ÈåÑ \\"Qing Taizong shilu\\" Part 20 In April 1636, Mongol nobility of Inner Mongolia, Manchu nobility and the Han mandarin held the Kurultai in Shenyang, recommended khan of Later Jin to be the emperor of Great Qing empire.Marriage and inequality in Chinese society By Rubie Sharon Watson, Patricia Buckley Ebrey, p.177Tumen jalafun jecen ak≈´: Manchu studies in honour of Giovanni Stary By Giovanni Stary, Alessandra Pozzi, Juha Antero Janhunen, Michael Weiers Russian archive contains translations of the 1636 year Hong Taiji decree with the provision that after the fall of the Qing dynasty Mongols will return to their previous laws, i.e. independence Kuzmin S.L. and Batsaikhan O.

Whatever the precise motivation, Hong Taiji proclaimed the establishment of the Qing dynasty and also changed his era name to Ch√≥ngd√© in 1636. The reasons for the choice of Qing as the new name are likewise unclear, although it has been speculated that the sound ‚Äì Jin and Qing are pronounced similarly in Manchu ‚Äì or wuxing theory ‚Äì traditional ideas held that fire, associated with the character for Ming, was overcome by water, associated with the character for Qing ‚Äì may have influenced the choice. Another possible reason may be that Hong Taiji changed the name of the dynasty from (Later) Jin to Qing in 1636 because of internecine fraternal struggle and skirmish between brothers and half brothers for the throne. According to Taoist philosophy, the name Jin has the meaning of metal and fire in its constituent, thereby igniting the tempers of the brothers of the Manchu Royal household into open conflicts and wars. Hong Taiji therefore adopted the new name of Great Qing (Â§ßÊ∏Ö), the Chinese character of which has the water symbol [3 strokes] on its left hand side. The name, which means clear and transparent, with its water symbol was hoped to put out the feud among the brothers of the Manchu Royal household. The banners status Before Hong Taiji was emperor, he controlled the two White banners. Upon Nurhaci's death, Hong Taiji immediately switched his two White Banners with Nurhaci's two Yellow Banners, which should have been passed on to Dorgon and his brothers. As emperor, he was the holder of three banners out of eight. He controlled the Upper Three Banners or the Elite banners which at the time were the Plain/Bordered Yellow Banners and Plain Blue Banner. Later the Plain Blue Banner was switched by Dorgon to the Plain White Banner as the third Elite Banner. At the end of his reign, Hong Taiji gave the two Yellow Banners to his eldest son Hooge. Daisan, who was the second son of Nurhaci, and his son controlled the two Red Banners. Dorgon and his two brothers controlled the two White Banners and ≈†urhaci's son Jirgalang controlled the remaining Bordered Blue Banner.  Death and succession  Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 just as the Qing was preparing to attack Shanhai Pass, the last Ming fortification guarding access to the north China plains.; ; Because he died without having named an heir, the Qing state now faced a succession crisis. The Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers debated on whether to grant the throne to Hong Taiji's half-brother Dorgon a proven military leader or to Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge. As a compromise, Hong Taiji's five-year-old ninth son Fulin was chosen, while Dorgon alongside Nurhaci's nephew Jirgalang was given the title of \\"prince regent\\". Fulin was officially crowned emperor of the Qing dynasty on 8 October 1643 and it was decided that he would reign under the era name \\"Shunzhi.\\" A few months later, Qing armies led by Dorgon seized Beijing, and the young Shunzhi Emperor became the first Qing emperor to rule from that new capital. That the Qing state succeeded not only in conquering China but also in establishing a capable administration was due in large measure to the foresight and policies of Hong Taiji. His body was buried in Zhaoling, located in northern Shenyang. Legacy As the emperor, he is commonly recognized as having abilities similar to the best emperors such as Yongle, Emperor Taizong of Tang because of his effective rule, effective use of talent, and effective warring skills. According to half historian and half writer Jin Yong, Hong Taiji had the broad and wise views of Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Gaozu of Han, Emperor Guangwu of Han, Emperor Wen of Sui, Emperor Taizong of Tang, Emperor Taizu of Song, Kublai Khan, the Hongwu Emperor, and the Yongle Emperor. His political abilities were paralleled only by Genghis Khan, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and Emperor Guangwu of Han. In this sense, Hong Taiji is considered by some historians as the true first emperor for the Qing dynasty. Some historians suspect Hong Taiji was overall underrated and overlooked as a great emperor because he was a Manchu.

Chariot racing was dangerous to both drivers and horses as they often suffered serious injury and even death, but these dangers added to the excitement and interest for spectators. Chariot races could be watched by women, who were banned from watching many other sports. In the Roman form of chariot racing, teams represented different groups of financial backers and sometimes competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers. As in modern sports like football, spectators generally chose to support a single team, identifying themselves strongly with its fortunes, and violence sometimes broke out between rival factions. The rivalries were sometimes politicized, when teams became associated with competing social or religious ideas. This helps explain why Roman and later Byzantine emperors took control of the teams and appointed many officials to oversee them. The sport faded in importance in the West after the fall of Rome. It survived much longer in the Byzantine Empire, where the traditional Roman factions continued to play a prominent role for several centuries, gaining influence in political matters. Their rivalry culminated in the Nika riots, which marked the gradual decline of the sport. Early chariot racing It is unknown exactly when chariot racing began, but it may have been as old as the chariots themselves. It is known from artistic evidence on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described in the Iliad by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus.Homer. The Iliad, 23.257‚Äì23.652. The participants in this race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also was said to be the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory. Olympic Games black-figure hydria from Attica, ca. 510 BC In the ancient Olympic Games, as well as the other Panhellenic Games, there were both four-horse (tethrippon, Greek: œÑŒ≠Œ∏œÅŒπœÄœÄŒøŒΩ) and two-horse (synoris, Greek: œÉœÖŒΩœâœÅ·Ω∂œÇ) chariot races, which were essentially the same aside from the number of horses. The chariot racing event was first added to the Olympics in 680 BC with the games expanding from a one-day to a two-day event to accommodate the new event (but was not, in reality, the founding event). The chariot race was not so prestigious as the foot race of 195 meters (stadion, Greek: œÉœÑŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ), but it was more important than other equestrian events such as racing on horseback, which were dropped from the Olympic Games very early on. The races themselves were held in the hippodrome, which held both chariot races and riding races. The single horse race was known as the \\"keles\\" (keles, Greek: Œ∫Œ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ). The hippodrome was situated at the south-east corner of the sanctuary of Olympia, on the large flat area south of the stadium and ran almost parallel to the latter. Until recently, its exact location was unknown, since it is buried by several meters of sedimentary material from the Alfeios River. In 2008, however, Annie Muller and staff of the German Archeological Institute used radar to locate a large, rectangular structure similar to Pausanias's description. Pausanias, who visited Olympia in the second century AD, describes the monument as a large, elongated, flat space, approximately 780 meters long and 320 meters wide (four stadia long and one stade four plethra wide). The elongated racecourse was divided longitudinally into two tracks by a stone or wooden barrier, the embolon. All the horses or chariots ran on one track toward the east, then turned around the embolon and headed back west. Distances varied according to the event. The racecourse was surrounded by natural (to the north) and artificial (to the south and east) banks for the spectators; a special place was reserved for the judges on the west side of the north bank. The Charioteer of Delphi, one of the most famous statues surviving from Ancient Greece The race was begun by a procession into the hippodrome, while a herald announced the names of the drivers and owners. The tethrippon consisted of twelve laps around the hippodrome, with sharp turns around the posts at either end. Various mechanical devices were used, including the starting gates (hyspleges, Greek: ·ΩïœÉœÄŒªŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥ŒµœÇ; singular: hysplex, Greek: ·ΩïœÉœÄŒªŒ∑Œ≥Œæ) which were lowered to start the race. According to Pausanias, these were invented by the architect Cleoitas, and staggered so that the chariots on the outside began the race earlier than those on the inside. The race did not begin properly until the final gate was opened, at which point each chariot would be more or less lined up alongside each other, although the ones that had started on the outside would have been traveling faster than the ones in the middle. Other mechanical devices known as the \\"eagle\\" and the \\"dolphin\\" were raised to signify that the race had begun, and were lowered as the race went on to signify the number of laps remaining. These were probably bronze carvings of those animals, set up on posts at the starting line. In most cases, the owner and the driver of the chariot were different persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself.Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, 6.16.2. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot.Pindar. Isthmian Odes, 1.1. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy. The charioteer was usually either a family member of the owner of the chariot or, in most cases, a slave or a hired professional. Driving a racing chariot required unusual strength, skill, and courage. Yet, we know the names of very few charioteers, One of them is Carrhotus who is praised by Pindar for keeping his chariot unscathed (Pindar. Pythian, 5.25‚Äì5.53). Unlike the majority of charioteers, Carrhotus was friend and brother-in-law of the man he drove for, Arcesilaus of Cyrene; so his success affirmed the success of the traditional aristocratic mode of organizing society ( and victory songs and statues regularly contrive to leave them out of account. Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude, probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a sleeved garment called a xystis. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt. Two straps that crossed high at the upper back prevented the xystis from \\"ballooning\\" during the race. The chariots themselves were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels and an open back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, at least for the spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway. Other festivals As a result of the rise of the Greek cities of the classic period, other great festivals emerged in Asia Minor, Magna Graecia, and the mainland providing the opportunity for athletes to gain fame and riches. Apart from the Olympics, the best respected were the Isthmian Games in Corinth, the Nemean Games, the Pythian Games in Delphi, and the Panathenaic Games in Athens, where the winner of the four-horse chariot race was given 140 amphorae of olive oil (much sought after and precious in ancient times). Prizes at other competitions included corn in Eleusis, bronze shields in Argos, and silver vessels in Marathon. Another form of chariot racing at the Panathenaic Games was known as the apobatai, in which the contestant wore armor and periodically leapt off a moving chariot and ran alongside it before leaping back on again. In these races, there was a second charioteer (a \\"rein-holder\\") while the apobates jumped out; in the catalogues with the winners both the names of the apobates and of the rein-holder are mentioned. Images of this contest show warriors, armed with helmets and shields, perched on the back of their racing chariots. Some scholars believe that the event preserved traditions of Homeric warfare. Roman era The plan of the Circus Maximus The Romans probably borrowed chariot racing as well as the design of the racing tracks from the Etruscans, who themselves borrowed them from the Greeks, but the Romans were also influenced directly by the Greeks. According to Roman legend, chariot racing was used by Romulus just after he founded Rome in 753 BC as a way of distracting the Sabine men. Romulus sent out invitations to the neighbouring towns to celebrate the festival of the Consualia, which included both horse races and chariot races. Whilst the Sabines were enjoying the spectacle, Romulus and his men seized and carried off the Sabine women, who became wives of the Romans. Chariot races were a part of several Roman religious festivals, and on these occasions were preceded by a parade (pompa circensis) that featured the charioteers, music, costumed dancers, and images of the gods. While the entertainment value of chariot races tended to overshadow any sacred purpose, in late antiquity the Church Fathers still saw them as a traditional \\"pagan\\" practice, and advised Christians not to participate. Bas-relief of a quadriga race in the Circus Maximus (2nd‚Äì3rd century) Depiction of a chariot race in the Roman era In ancient Rome, chariot races commonly took place in a circus. The main centre of chariot racing was the Circus Maximus in the valley between Palatine Hill and Aventine Hill, which could seat 250,000 people. It was the earliest circus in the city of Rome. The Circus supposedly dated to the city's earliest times, but Julius Caesar rebuilt it around 50 BC to a length and width of about and , respectively. One end of the track was more open than the other, as this was where the chariots lined up to begin the race. The Romans used a series of gates known as carceres, equivalent to the Greek hysplex. These were staggered like the hysplex, but in a slightly different manner since the center of Roman racing tracks also included medians (the spinae). The carceres took up the angled end of the track, where ‚Äì before a race ‚Äì the chariots were loaded behind spring-loaded gates. Typically, when the chariots were ready the emperor (or whoever was hosting the races, if outside of Rome) dropped a cloth known as a mappa, signalling the beginning of the race. The gates would spring open at the same time, allowing a fair start for all participants. Chariot race of Cupids; ancient Roman sarcophagus in the Museo Archeologico (Naples). Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection Once the race had begun, the chariots could move in front of each other in an attempt to cause their opponents to crash into the spinae (singular spina). On the top of the spinae stood small tables or frames supported on pillars, and also small pieces of marble in the shape of eggs or dolphins. The spina eventually became very elaborate, with statues and obelisks and other forms of art, but the addition of these multiple adornments had one unfortunate result: they obstructed the view of spectators on lower seats. At either end of the spina was a meta, or turning point, consisting of large gilded columns. Spectacular crashes in which the chariot was destroyed and the charioteer and horses incapacitated were called naufragia, a Latin word that also means \\"shipwreck\\". A charioteer of the White team; part of a mosaic of the third century AD, showing four leading charioteers from the different colors, all in their distinctive gear The race itself was much like its Greek counterpart, although there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so that there could be even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two- horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to show off his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical. The technique and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from those used by the Greeks. Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this, the Romans could not let go of the reins in a crash, so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves. In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident, they carried a falx, a curved knife. They also wore helmets and other protective gear. In any given race, there might be a number of teams put up by each faction, who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by ganging up on opponents, forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and expose themselves to accident and injury. Spectators could also play a part as there is evidence they threw lead \\"curse\\" amulets studded with nails at teams opposing their favourite. A winner of a Roman chariot race, from the Red team Another important difference was that the charioteers themselves, the aurigae, were considered to be the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and probably some money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity driver was Scorpus, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old. The most famous of all was Gaius Appuleius Diocles who won 1,462 out of 4,257 races. When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24-year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35,863,120 sesterces ($US 15 billion), making him the highest paid sports star in history. The horses, too, could become celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses. Seats in the Circus were free for the poor, who by the time of the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer involved in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace. Mosaic from Lyon illustrating a chariot race with the four factions: Blue, Green, Red and White Chariot races in the Roman era The driver's clothing was color-coded in accordance with his faction, which would help distant spectators to keep track of the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively.Tertullian. De Spectaculis, 9. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today. A rivalry between the Reds and Whites had developed by 77 BC, when during a funeral for a Red driver a supporter of the Reds threw himself on the driver's funeral pyre. No writer of that time, however, referred to these factions as official organizations, as they were to be described in later years. Writing near the beginning of the third century, a commentator wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars, the Whites to the Zephyrs, the Greens to Mother Earth or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. During his reign of 81‚Äì96 AD, the emperor Domitian created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, but these disappeared soon after he died. The Blues and the Greens gradually became the most prestigious factions, supported by emperors and the populace alike. Records indicate that on numerous occasions, Blue against Green clashes would break out during the races. The surviving literature rarely mentions the Reds and Whites, although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse tablets. Byzantine era Hippodrome today, with the Walled Obelisk in the foreground and Thutmose's Obelisk on the right Like many other aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing continued in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did. In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics, several short epigrams in verse were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers. The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals almost nothing about him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him. Constantine I (r. 306‚Äì337) preferred chariot racing to gladiatorial combat, which he considered a vestige of paganism. However, the end of gladiatorial games in the Empire may have been more the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games, than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379‚Äì395) in 393, perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport.Tertullian (De Spectaculis, 16) and Cassiodorus called chariot racing an instrument of the Devil. Salvian criticized those who rushed into the circus in order to \\"feast their impure, adulterous gaze on shameful obscenities\\" (). Public spectacles were also attacked by John Chrysostom (). Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during the early days of the Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457‚Äì474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491‚Äì518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations. The chariot races were important in the Byzantine Empire, as in the Roman Empire, as a way to reinforce social class and political power, including the might of the Byzantine emperor, and were often put on for political or religious reasons. In addition, chariot races were sometimes held in celebration of an emperor's birthday. An explicit parallel was drawn between the victorious charioteers and the victorious emperor. The factions addressed their victors by chanting \\"Rejoice ... your Lords have conquered\\" while the charioteer took a victory lap, further indicating the parallel between the charioteer's victory and the emperor's victory. Indeed, reliefs of Porphyrius, the famous Byzantine charioteer, show him in a victor's pose being acclaimed by partisans, which is clearly modeled on the images on the base of Emperor Theodosius's obelisk. The races could also be used to symbolically make religious statements, such as when a charioteer, whose mother was named Mary, fell off his chariot and got back on and the crowd described it as \\"The son of Mary has fallen and risen again and is victorious.\\" The Hippodrome of Constantinople (really a Roman circus, not the open space that the original Greek hippodromes were) was connected to the emperor's palace and the Church of Hagia Sophia, allowing spectators to view the emperor as they had in Rome. Citizens used their proximity to the emperor in the circuses and theatres to express public opinion, like their dissatisfaction with the Emperor's errant policy. It has been argued that the people became so powerful that the emperors had no choice but to grant them more legal rights. However, contrary to this traditional view, it appears, based on more recent historical research, that the Byzantine emperors treated the protests and petitions of their citizens in the circuses with greater contempt and were more dismissive of them than their Roman predecessors. Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), for instance, seems to have been dismissive of the Greens' petitions and to have never negotiated with them at all. There is not much evidence that the chariot races were subject to bribes or other forms of cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there does not seem to have been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress. The Triumphal Quadriga is a set of Roman or Greek bronze statues of four horses, originally part of a monument depicting a quadriga. They date from late Classical Antiquity and were long displayed at the Hippodrome of Constantinople. In 1204 AD, Doge Enrico Dandolo sent them to Venice as part of the loot sacked from Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade. Chariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the Roman racing clubs, which continued to play a prominent role in these public exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (V√©netoi) and the Greens (Pr√°sinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites (Leuko√≠) and Reds (Ro√∫sioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red. These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost- cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens. Adopting the color of their favorite charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty to that particular racer or faction. Many of the young men in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, \\"Hunnic\\" hair-styles, and \\"Persian\\" facial hair. There is evidence that these young men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence probably had similarities to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, even when it was taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans did not change their allegiance to their color. The Blues and the Greens were now more than simply sports teams. They gained influence in military, political, and theological matters, although the hypothesis that the Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, in spite of the fact that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue‚ÄìGreen rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent. The Blue‚ÄìGreen rivalry often erupted into gang warfare, and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527), who took measures to restore order, when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian, which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor. Chariot racing seems to have declined in the course of the seventh century, with the losses the Empire suffered at the hands of the Arabs and the decline of the population and economy. The Blues and Greens, deprived of any political power, were relegated to a purely ceremonial role. After the Nika riots, the factions grew less violent as their importance in imperial ceremony increased. In particular, the iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775) courted the factions for their support in his campaigns against the monks. They aided the emperor in executing his prisoners and by putting on shows in which monks and nuns held hands while the crowd hissed at them. Constantine V seems to have given the factions a political role in addition to their traditionally ceremonial role. The two factions continued their activity until the imperial court was moved to Blachernae during the 12th century. The Hippodrome in Constantinople remained in use for races, games, and public ceremonies up to the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the sack of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the spina, the central reservation, robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; by the end of the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD. See also * Harness racing * Oval track racing Footnotes References Sources =Primary sources=  Pausanias.

Despite its name, it is not an ionic hydride but rather an alloy of palladium with metallic hydrogen that can be written PdHx. At room temperature, palladium hydrides may contain two crystalline phases, Œ± and Œ≤ (sometimes called Œ±'). Pure Œ± phase exists at x < 0.017 whereas pure Œ≤ phase is realised for x > 0.58; intermediate x values correspond to Œ±-Œ≤ mixtures. Phase diagram for Palladium-Hydrogen System Hydrogen absorption by palladium is reversible and therefore has been investigated for hydrogen storage. Palladium electrodes have been used in some cold fusion experiments, under the hypothesis that the hydrogen could be \\"squeezed\\" between the palladium atoms to help them fuse at lower temperatures than would otherwise be required. History The absorption of hydrogen gas by palladium was first noted by T. Graham in 1866 and absorption of electrolytically produced hydrogen, where hydrogen was absorbed into a palladium cathode, was first documented in 1939. Graham produced an alloy with the composition PdH0.75. Chemical structure and properties Palladium is sometimes metaphorically called a \\"metal sponge\\" (not to be confused with more literal metal sponges) because it soaks up hydrogen \\"like a sponge soaks up water\\". At room temperature and atmospheric pressure (standard ambient temperature and pressure), palladium can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen.Ralph Wolf; Khalid Mansour. \\"The Amazing Metal Sponge: Soaking Up Hydrogen\\" . 1995. As of 1995, hydrogen can be absorbed into the metal-hydride and then desorbed back out for thousands of cycles. Researchers look for ways to extend the useful life of palladium storage.\\"Extending the Life of Palladium Beds\\" . The absorption of hydrogen produces two different phases, both of which contain palladium metal atoms in a face-centered cubic (fcc, rocksalt) lattice, which is the same structure as pure palladium metal. At low concentrations up to PdH0.02 the palladium lattice expands slightly, from 388.9 pm to 389.5 pm. Above this concentration the second phase appears with a lattice constant of 402.5 pm. Both phases coexist until a composition of PdH0.58 when the alpha phase disappears. Neutron diffraction studies have shown that hydrogen atoms randomly occupy the octahedral interstices in the metal lattice (in an fcc lattice there is one octahedral hole per metal atom). The limit of absorption at normal pressures is PdH0.7, indicating that approximately 70% of the octahedral holes are occupied. The absorption of hydrogen is reversible, and hydrogen rapidly diffuses through the metal lattice. Metallic conductivity reduces as hydrogen is absorbed, until at around PdH0.5 the solid becomes a semiconductor. =Superconductivity= PdHx is a superconductor with a transition temperature Tc of about 9 K for x = 1\\\\. (Pure palladium is not superconducting). Drops in resistivity vs. temperature curves were observed at higher temperatures (up to 273 K) in hydrogen-rich (x ~ 1), nonstoichiometric palladium hydride and interpreted as superconducting transitions. These results have been questioned and have not been confirmed thus far. =Surface absorption process= The process of absorption of hydrogen has been shown by scanning tunnelling microscopy to require aggregates of at least three vacancies on the surface of the crystal to promote the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule. The reason for such a behaviour and the particular structure of trimers has been analyzed. Uses The absorption of hydrogen is reversible and is highly selective. Industrially, a palladium-based diffuser separator is used. Impure gas is passed through tubes of thin walled silver-palladium alloy as protium and deuterium readily diffuse through the alloy membrane. The gas that comes through is pure and ready for use. Palladium is alloyed with silver to improve its strength and resistance to embrittlement. To ensure that the formation of the beta phase is avoided, as the lattice expansion noted earlier would cause distortions and splitting of the membrane, the temperature is maintained above 300 ¬∞C.

Binary nickel hydrides and related materials \\"The existence of definite hydrides of nickel and platinum is in doubt\\". This observation does not preclude the existence of nonstoichiometric hydrides. Indeed, nickel is a widely used hydrogenation catalyst. Experimental studies on nickel hydrides are rare and principally theoretical. Hydrogen hardens nickel (as it does most metals), inhibiting dislocations in the nickel atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying hydrogen and the form of its presence in the nickel hydride (precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting nickel hydride. Nickel hydride with increased hydrogen content can be made harder and stronger than nickel, but such nickel hydride is also less ductile than nickel. Loss of ductility occurs due to cracks maintaining sharp points due to suppression of elastic deformation by the hydrogen, and voids forming under tension due to decomposition of the hydride. Hydrogen embrittlement can be a problem in nickel in use in turbines at high temperatures. In the narrow range of stoichiometries adopted by nickel hydride, distinct structures are claimed. At room temperature, the most stable form of nickel is the face-centred cubic (FCC) structure Œ±-nickel. It is a relatively soft metallic material that can dissolve only a very small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.002 wt% at , and only 0.00005% at . The solid solution phase with dissolved hydrogen, that maintains the same structure as the original nickel is termed the Œ±-phase. At 25 ¬∞C 6kbar of hydrogen pressure is needed to dissolve in b=nickel, but the hydrogen desorbs at pressures below 3.4 kbar. =Surface= Hydrogen dissociates on nickel surfaces. The dissociation energies on a Ni(111), Ni(100), and Ni(11O) are respectively 46, 52, and 36 kJ/mol. The H2 dissociates from each of these surfaces at distinct temperatures: 320‚Äì380, 220‚Äì360, and 230‚Äì430 K. =High pressure phases= Crystallographically distinct phases of nickel hydride are produced with high pressure hydrogen gas at 600 MPa. Alternatively it can be produced electrolytically. The crystal form is face-centred cubic or Œ≤-nickel hydride. Hydrogen to nickel atomic ratios are up to one, with hydrogen occupying an octahedral site. The density of the Œ≤-hydride is 7.74 g/cm3. It is coloured grey. At a current density of 1 Amp per square decimeter, in 0.5 mol/liter of sulfuric acid and thiourea a surface layer of nickel will be converted to nickel hydride. This surface is replete with cracks up to millimeters long. The direction of cracking is in the {001} plane of the original nickel crystals. The lattice constant of nickel hydride is 3.731 √Ö, which is 5.7% more than that of nickel. The near- stoichiometric NiH is unstable and loses hydrogen at pressures below 340 MPa. Molecular nickel hydrides A large number of nickel hydride complexes are known. Illustrative is the complex trans-NiH(Cl)(P(C6H11)3)2.

It is about a boy, named Calamity James (a pun on Calamity Jane), who has disastrous luck. He first appeared on 1 November 1986, in issue no. 2311. A copy of his first strip is viewable here. His strip replaced Biffo the Bear and Little Plum, which had both been reduced to a half-page by this time. He has a pet called Alexander Lemming, (a pun on Alexander Fleming). Creation and Concept There were several variations of the visual appearance of Calamity James before a final image was decided on. Calamity James has black hair, wears black trousers, and has a red jumper with the number 13 on it. He has big eyes, and many buck teeth, but he originally had small eyes and only two buck teeth. In earlier strips, he was also shown under a permanent black rain cloud. According to the 4 December 2014 issue of the Beano, he has a crush on Minnie the Minx and hopes to become her boyfriend one day. With much surreal and incidental background detail, various themes recur: notably the \\"Little Squelchy Things\\" which appear in a wide variety of guises and tend to be visual gags, though they may take part in the story (for instance, James may trip over one), and a constant scatter of winning lottery tickets, notes with a large sum of money on them, diamonds, gold bars, and bags with 'Vast Dosh' written on them which James walks past yet somehow never manages to notice. Once, when he was complaining about his lack of money, Alex told him to look around (he was surrounded by one of each of the above), as if he had just noticed them, but then it turns out he was referring to busking. Another recurring feature is the appearance of bizarrely-named factories and other buildings, such as \\"Lumpy Custard Factory\\" and \\"Knicker Elastic Testing Sheds\\", that appear in the background throughout the strips (all accompanied by appropriate sounds). Tom Paterson has been the main artist for the strip, although Steve Bright has drawn it on occasions, and Bob Dewar ghosted the strip in the 1980s. John Geering and Henry Davies drew some preliminary sets for the character before he first appeared in the comic. He hasn't appeared as regularly as some other characters, as Paterson has also drawn other strips for the same comic including Minnie the Minx, The Numskulls and Dennis the Menace. =Alexander Lemming= James' long-suffering lemming friend and pet, who rarely has as much bad luck as his owner. One of Alexander's hobbies is plummeting from great heights, which often helps James overcome his fate. He also tends to anoint James with balm or ointment if he gets hurt. In one strip, James gave his shirt to Alexander Lemming, and he had a day of bad luck and James had a day of good luck. Soon, Alexander got fed up with the jumper and gave it back. This credits the belief that James' number 13 is a source of his bad luck. As loyal a friend as he seems to be, he rather seems to enjoy watching his friend suffer. His name is a play on \\"Alexander Fleming\\", the famous biologist and discoverer of penicillin. Timeline 1 November 1986 Calamity James debuts in the comic. Issue No. 2311 22 November 1986 James' pet, Alexander Lemming, debuts. Issue No. 2314 29 October 1988 \\"Little Squelchy Things\\" debut. Issue No. 2415 c.1989 James' eyes were enlarged and he was given more buckteeth. 1993 The strip is rendered in full colour 1997 the strip is digitally rendered in brighter, shinier colour 2001 Tom Paterson takes over Minnie the Minx. By 2003 this, and Paterson's other work for D.C. Thomson, means that James begins to appear on an increasingly infrequent basis. 2004 Steve Bright draws several strips during the year. Of the James strips in 2004, 11 were drawn by Paterson and 8 were drawn by Bright. 2007 the strip is retired, as Tom Paterson starts drawing Dennis the Menace. His final appearance in the weekly comic came in Issue No. 3375. 31 October 2009 James's strip makes a surprise reappearance in the weekly Beano. Issue No. 3507. 7 November 2012 James' strip returns permanently. Issue No. 3660. Reception and Legacy Due to the artwork and humour of the character, as well as his relatability, Calamity James has been regarded as a classic British Comic character. The scripts behind the strip commonly satirise consumerist values, which may be held by the writer. Some readers, such as George Gale see James' misfortunes as a cruel punishments for him being poor, ugly and stupid, whilst others relate to his misfortunes and can see themselves in such positions. James can be seen as a symbol of inspiration, because even though everything in his life seems to end badly, he always tries to lead a normal life. Because of his goalkeeping mishaps, English goalkeeper David James has been nicknamed after the character. As the Beano editor Alan Digby was not keen on the strip, Calamity James gradually appeared less frequently, became reprints and was eventually dropped. However, ex-Beano editor Euan Kerr, who had played a significant role in the creation of the character, was editing the monthly BeanoMax, which he continued to appear in, although Digby has since become editor of that publication. He has appeared as reprints, both in the weekly Beano and BeanoMax and returns in new strips in the Beano Annuals.

It began in the late 1970s. Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the UK, U.S., Japan, Singapore, India, South Korea and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as Sri Lanka. The maze is made up of a 16√ó16 grid of cells, each 180 mm square with walls 50 mm high.https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/micromouse/Rules/Maze_Solver_Rules.pdf The mice are completely autonomous robots that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. The mouse needs to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. Having reached the goal, the mouse will typically perform additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from the start to the finish. Once the optimal route has been found, the mouse will run that route in the shortest possible time. Competitions and conferences are still run regularly.  Half-Size Micromouse  A new version of Micromouse called the Half-Size Micromouse has been introduced for 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition 2009.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN5vYrrSdKQ Instead of a 16√ó16 maze, the new competition uses up to a 32√ó32 maze. Cell and wall dimensions have been reduced by half, providing a new challenge There have been half-size competitions in Europe in Hungary in 2015 and the UK in 2018.  Maze solving  Mice can use various searching algorithms. Common search algorithms use variations of the Bellman flood-fill method,http://www.micromouseonline.com/micromouse-book/mazes-and-maze- solving/solving-the-maze/#axzz1uapduejO Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search algorithm, among various graph traversal and tree traversal algorithms.  Performance  Mice can run at over three meters per second, depending on the maze design. Some of the best micromouse builders are Kato- san,http://blog.livedoor.jp/robolabo/ Ng Beng Kiathttps://sites.google.com/site/ngbengkiat/ and Nakashima-san. The current world record is 3.921 secondshttps://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/meet-the-new-worlds- fastest-micromouse and is held by Ng Beng Kiat. Performance in recent years has improved considerably. As of 2015, winning mice are likely to run with forward acceleration and braking well over 10 m/s2. Cornering with centripetal acceleration as high as 2g is possible. Micromice are among the highest- performing autonomous robots. Most recently, robots are being equipped with a fan to create a partial vacuum under the mouse while it is running. The additional downforce available has made possible a huge improvement in performance. Compared to a non-fan mouse, the newer robots are likely to be able to achieve centripetal accelerations of 6g or more. Straight line accelerations can easily exceed 2.5g.

Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954; however, the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by Anglo-Saxons between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed by them in 954. It was closely associated with the much longer-lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period.  History  A map of the routes taken by the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 878 York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of Eboracum and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of Eoforwic. It was first captured in November 866 by Ivar the Boneless, leading a large army of Danish Vikings, called the \\"Great Heathen Army\\" by Anglo-Saxon chroniclers, which had landed in East Anglia and made their way north, aided by a supply of horses with which King Edmund of East Anglia bought them off and by civil in-fighting between royal candidates in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria between the leaders of its two sub-kingdoms; Bernicia and Deira. Declaring a truce, the rivals for the throne of Northumbria joined forces but failed to retake the city in March 867, and with their deaths Deira came under Danish control as the Kingdom of Northumbria and the Northumbrian royal court fled north to refuge in Bernicia. A Viking attempt against Mercia the same season failed, and in 869 their efforts against Wessex were fruitless in the face of opposition from Kings Ethelred and Alfred the Great. The archbishop, Wulfhere, seems to have temporised and collaborated with the Norse, for he was expelled from York when a Northumbrian uprising in 872 was only temporarily successful; he was recalled and held his seat until his death. The Viking king Guthred was buried in York Minster, a signal that he and the archbishop had reached a lasting accommodation.Both suggestions are made by Richard Hall, \\"A kingdom too far: York in the early tenth century\\", in N. J. Higham and D. H. Hill, Edward the Elder, 899‚Äì924, 2001:188. All the Viking coinage appears to have emanated from the mint at York, a mark of the city's unique status in Northumbria as an economic magnet. York's importance as the seat of Northumbria was confirmed when the Scandinavian warlord, Guthrum, headed for East Anglia, while Halfdan Ragnarsson seized power in AD 875.Haywood (1995), p. 70. While the Danish army was busy in Britain, the Isle of Man and Ireland, the Swedish army was occupied with defending the Danish and Swedish homelands where Halfdan's brothers were in control. Seated Eric Bloodaxe and Gunnhild are confronted by Egill Skallagr√≠msson. Native Danish rulers who eventually made Jelling in Jutland the site of Gorm the Old's kingdom, were in the East Anglian kingdom. The Five Burghs/Jarldoms were based upon the Kingdom of Lindsey and were a sort of frontier between each kingdom. King Canute the Great would later \\"reinstall\\" a Norwegian dynasty of jarls in Northumbria (Eric of Hlathir), with a Danish dynasty of jarls in East Anglia (Thorkel). Northern England would continue to be a source of intrigue for the Norwegians until Harald III of Norway's death at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 just prior to the Battle of Hastings and the Norman conquest. The Old Norse placename Konungsgurtha, Kings Court, recorded in the late fourteenth century in relation to an area immediately outside the site of the porta principalis sinistra, the east gatehouse of the Roman encampment, perpetuated today as King's Square, which nucleates the Ainsty, perhaps indicates a Viking royal palace site based on the remains of the east gate of the Roman fortress.Richard Hall, Viking Age archaeology, 1995:28; Richard Hall, \\"A kingdom too far: York in the early tenth century\\", in N. J. Higham and D. H. Hill, Edward the Elder, 899‚Äì924, 2001. New streets, lined by regular building fronts for timber houses were added to an enlarging city between AD 900 and 935, dates arrived at by tree-ring chronology carried out on remaining posts preserved in anaerobic clay subsoil. With the violent death of the last King of York, Eric Bloodaxe, in 954, the Viking kingdom was fully absorbed into England. After the Kingdom of Northumbria was remerged (by now an Earldom of England under the House of Wessex), the title King of J√≥rv√≠k became redundant and was succeeded by the title Earl of York, created in 960. Loss of political independence did not cramp the region's economic success: by ca 1000, the urban boom brought the city to a population total second only to that of London within Great Britain. Although some of the early Earls of York were Nordic like the J√≥rv√≠k Kings, they were succeeded by Normans after the Norman conquest. William the Conqueror ended the region's last vestiges of independence and established garrisoned castles in the city. The Earldom of York was abolished by King Henry II. =Aftermath= Between 1070 and 1085, there were occasional attempts by the Danish Vikings to recapture their Kingdom of J√≥rv√≠k; however, these attempts did not materialise into the return of the kingdom. The title Duke of York, a title of nobility in British peerage, was created in 1341, but was merged with the Crown when the 4th Duke became King Edward IV. Subsequently, the title of Duke of York has usually been given to the second son of the King or Queen. Kings of J√≥rv√≠k  Archaeological findings  From 1976 to 1981, the York Archaeological Trust conducted a five-year excavation in and around the street of Coppergate in central York. This demonstrated that, in the 10th century, J√≥rv√≠k's trading connections reached to the Byzantine Empire and beyond: a cap made of silk survives, and coins from Samarkand were familiar enough and respected enough for a counterfeit to have passed in trade. Both these items, as well as a large human coprolite known as the Lloyds Bank coprolite, were famously recovered in York a millennium later. Amber from the Baltic is often expected at a Viking site and at J√≥rv√≠k an impractical and presumably symbolic axehead of amber was found. A cowrie shell indicates contact with the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. Christian and pagan objects have survived side-by-side, usually taken as a sign that Christians were not in positions of authority. After the excavation, the York Archaeological Trust took the decision to recreate the excavated part of J√≥rv√≠k on the Coppergate site, and this is now the Jorvik Viking Centre.

Robert I was never known by the nickname 'the devil' in his lifetime. 'Robert the Devil' was a fictional character who was confused with Robert I, Duke of Normandy sometime near the end of the Middle Ages. See: Fran√ßois Neveux, A Brief History of the Normans, trans. Howard Curtis (Constable & Robinson, Ltd. London, 2008), p. 97 & n. 5. 22 June 1000 ‚Äì 1‚Äì3 July 1035), was the duke of Normandy from 1027 until his death in 1035. Owing to uncertainty over the numbering of the dukes of Normandy he is usually called Robert I, but sometimes Robert II with his ancestor Rollo as Robert I. He was the son of Richard II and brother of Richard III, who preceded him as the duke. Less than a year after his father's death, Robert revolted against his brother's rule, but failed. He would later inherit Normandy after his brother's death. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son, William the Conqueror, who became the first Norman king of England in 1066, following the Norman conquest of England.  Biography  Falaise, France Family tree Robert was the son of Richard II of Normandy and Judith, daughter of Conan I, Duke of Brittany. He was also grandson of Richard I of Normandy, great- grandson of William I of Normandy and great-great grandson of Rollo, the Viking who founded Normandy. Before he died, Richard II had decided his elder son Richard III would succeed him while his second son Robert would become Count of Hi√©mois.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumieges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Vol. II, Books V-VIII, ed. Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995), pp. 40‚Äì1 In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became duke, but soon afterwards Robert rebelled against his brother, was subsequently defeated and forced to swear fealty to his older brother Richard.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 46 = Early reign = When Richard III died a year later, there were suspicions that Robert had something to do with his death. Although nothing could be proved, Robert had the most to gain.David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), p. 32 The civil war Robert I had brought against his brother Richard III was still causing instability in the duchy. Private wars raged between neighbouring barons. This resulted in a new aristocracy arising in Normandy during Robert's reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser nobility left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern Italy and elsewhere. Soon after assuming the duchy, possibly in revenge for supporting his brother against him, Robert I assembled an army against his uncle, Robert, Archbishop of Rouen and Count of √âvreux. A temporary truce allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile but this resulted in an edict excommunicating all of Normandy, which was only lifted when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and his countship was restored.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 48 Robert also attacked another powerful churchman, his cousin Hugo III d'Ivry, Bishop of Bayeux, banishing him from Normandy for an extended period of time.Fran√ßois Neveux.

Robert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, Queen Constance, who favored her younger son Robert to succeed to the French throne after his father Robert II.Elisabeth M C Van Houts, The Normans in Europe (Manchester University Press, Manchester and New York, 2000), p. 185 For his help Henry I rewarded Robert with the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began expanding his influence from the area of Rennes and appeared to have designs on the area surrounding Mont Saint- Michel.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 50 After sacking Dol and repelling Alan's attempts to raid Avranches, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to their uncle, Archbishop Robert of Rouen, who then brokered a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III. His cousins, the Athelings Edward and Alfred, sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and Athelred, King of England had been living at the Norman Court and at one point Robert, on their behalf, attempted to mount an invasion of England but was prevented in doing so, it was said, by unfavorable winds,Christopher Harper-Bill; Elisabeth Van Houts, A Companion to the Anglo- Norman World (Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 2003), p. 31 that scattered and sank much of the fleet. Robert made a safe landing in Guernsey. Gesta Normannorum Ducum stated that King Cnut sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred.

See: David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), p. 411 on the return journey at Nicaea on 2 July 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.Fran√ßois Neveux, A Brief History of the Normans, trans. Howard Curtis (Constable & Robinson, Ltd. London, 2008), p. 110 According to the historian William of Malmesbury, decades later his son William sent a mission to Constantinople and Nicaea, charging it with bringing his father's body back to Normandy for burial.William M.

Concubines and children  By his mistress or concubine, Herleva of Falaise,The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumi√®ges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Ed. & Trans. Elizabeth M.C.

Elisabeth Van Houts ['Les femmes dans l'histoire du duch√© de Normandie', Tabularia ¬´ √âtudes ¬ª, n¬∞ 2, 2002, (10 July 2002), p. 23, n. 22] makes the argument that Robert of Torigny in the GND II, p. 272 (one of three mentions in this volume of her being William's sister) calls her in this instance William's 'uterine' sister' (soror uterina) and is of the opinion this is a mistake similar to one he made regarding Richard II, Duke of Normandy and his paternal half-brother William, Count of Eu (calling them 'uterine' brothers). Based on this she concludes Adelaide was a daughter of Duke Robert by a different concubine. Kathleen Thompson [\\"Being the Ducal Sister: The Role of Adelaide of Aumale\\", Normandy and Its Neighbors, Brepols, (2011) p. 63] cites the same passage in GND as did Elisabeth Van Houts, specifically GND II, 270‚Äì2, but gives a different opinion. She noted that Robert de Torigni stated here she was the uterine sister of Duke William \\"so we might perhaps conclude that she shared both mother and father with the Conqueror.\\" But as Torigni wrote a century after Adelaide's birth and in that same sentence in the GND made a genealogical error, she concludes that the identity of Adelaide's mother remains an open question.David C.

Titles =Choice of names= Snowdon, chosen for the earldom, had previously been used for a peerage title with royal associations. The title of Baron Snowdon had been conferred in 1726 along with the Dukedom of Edinburgh on Prince Frederick Louis, grandson of George I and future Prince of Wales. It merged in the Crown in 1760, when its holder acceded as George III. Linley, chosen for the viscountcy, comes from the 1st Earl of Snowdon's maternal great- grandfather, the English cartoonist and illustrator Edward Linley Sambourne. Nymans, chosen as territorial designation of the viscountcy, relates to an English garden near Handcross in West Sussex, where Anne Armstrong-Jones, n√©e Messel, mother of the 1st Earl of Snowdon, had grown up. =Life peerage= In November 1999, the 1st Earl of Snowdon received a life peerage as Baron Armstrong-Jones, under a device designed to allow first-generation hereditary peers to retain their seats in the House of Lords, after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.
