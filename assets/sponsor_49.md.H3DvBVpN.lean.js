The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless, meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the thread's major diameter. If a set screw does have a head, the thread will extend all the way to the head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A set screw is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or a slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole. A potentiometer knob with a set screw for locking it in place. An example application is when a set screw is screwed into a pulley hub so that its end- point bears firmly against the shaft. The fastening action is by friction between the screw and the shaft, often (but not always) with some amount of elastic or plastic deformation of one or both. Terminology Set screw or setscrew in the UK refers to a bolt which is fully threaded, with no smooth shank. These commonly have a hex head, but are also found with socket or screw heads. This contrasts with usage in the US where a set screw is almost universally a grub screw or small-headed bolt. A fully threaded bolt is commonly called a cap screw in the US. Torque resistance or transmission Isometric projection of a grub screw with a hex socket head. Set screws are not always the best way to resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of slipping and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a \\"flat\\") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as they make the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength. For longer life, set screws are usually made of alloy steel and case hardened. Hardened set screws often leave a plastic deformation, in the form of a circular or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the screw sets against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially \\"making its own detent\\" on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most set screw applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis- assembly if a bearing or other tightly toleranced part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem. Point types This advertisement from 1913 illustrates various set screw point types Set screws appear with a variety of tip (point) types. The different shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip.. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated lock washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high- vibration applications. Common points include the following: * Flat point * Domed point * Cone point * Cup point * Extended point (pilot point, dog point) * Knurled cup point =Knurled cup point= Knurl point screws are generally used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the knurl cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging action of the cup point with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.https://www.fastenal.com/products/details/81805 Fastenal Companyhttp://www.kdfasteners.com/set-screws.html KD Fasteners, Inc. Knurl point set screws should not be reused because the cutting edges of the knurls are deflected when tightened. During removal, the cutting edges are torn and no longer have full strength to resist unscrewing. ISO standard for Knurled cup point set screw is ISO 4029. Drive types Set screws are made with a variety of drive styles, including the following: * Straight slot * Hex socket * Square socket * External hex * External square * Bristol spline History The concept of set screws is centuries old, predating the metal screw by at least several hundred years. Early materials included wood, bone, horn, antler and ivory. Headless set screws have been around for a long time, with the straight slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan \\"safety first\\",. swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was ubiquitous in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The \\"safety craze\\" created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.

She is played by actress Marcia Cross, who has received multiple awards and nominations for her portrayal, including an Emmy Award nomination, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Cross' portrayal of Bree has been widely praised by critics and fans. Cross originally auditioned for the role of Mary Alice Young, but series creator Marc Cherry thought she was better suited for the role of Bree. Dana Delany, who eventually was cast as Katherine Mayfair, was originally chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in Pasadena. Bree's main struggle throughout the series has been her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She has been married three times; to Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp), Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), and Trip Weston (Scott Bakula). Character profile Bree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in Desperate Housewives. Bree grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her step-mother's demands, Bree left for Lake Forest College near Chicago. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she ever was given from her step-mother. Bree met Rex Van de Kamp at a meeting of the Young Republicans. After they graduated, they married and had two children, Andrew and Danielle, and moved to Fairview. Bree is very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans; she has been called a \\"hyper-uptight WASP\\". Bree is recognized for her perfectionist attitude and work ethic, which at times border on neurosis and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. While the writers have shied away from an official diagnosis, the character is recognized as suffering from obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder. The character herself refers to her \\"quirks\\" in terms of anal retentiveness but Rex once mentioned it by the name. Bree's perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit and run; a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better. Bree is known for her homemaking talents on the level of Martha Stewart, particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats and pineapple bran muffins. She is also well versed in firearms; she owns four guns and is a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and is also known for being a member of the local Presbyterian church, as seen in the episode Sunday. Her neighbors Angie Bolen, Gabrielle Solis and Renee Perry have nicknamed her \\"Nancy Reagan\\" on occasions. Bree has lived at 4354 Wisteria Lane in Fairview since 1994 and is also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses. Bree is based on creator Marc Cherry's own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while Lynette Scavo's family is based on Marc Cherry's childhood years. Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of Marc Cherry's previous failed sitcoms, The 5 Mrs. Buchanans (Bree) and The Crew (Rex). Both of Bree's marriages have broken down and ended in divorce (however, Rex died before their divorce was finalized) following the request for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband Orson Hodge did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with Karl Mayer, her divorce lawyer and ex- husband of her friend, Susan Delfino. However, Bree did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband. Bree is the only one of the main four housewives not to appear in every episode. Appearing only as a stand-in in \\"My Husband, The Pig\\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\\"Dress Big\\", \\"Liaisons\\", \\"God, That's Good\\", \\"Gossip\\", \\"Into the Woods\\" and \\"What Would We Do Without You?\\") due to Cross' pregnancy. Overview=Past= Bree Mason was born in the year 1962. When she was 10 years old, her mother taught her a lesson about \\"masking\\" so she could hide true feelings and emotions, which prevented her from being able to be hurt by men. Shortly after, during Christmas 1972, her mother died in hospital after a car accident. Bree stayed at home and cleaned her mother's blood from the driveway. She felt relieved after that. Her father then married Eleanor. Bree had to earn respect from her stepmother and so worked very hard. Eleanor said to her stepdaughter that she was very lucky and possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight: weapons all women needed to survive in the world. Her dad took care of his daughter and tried to raise her to be a classic lady. She got engaged to her boyfriend, Ty Grant, but met Rex Van de Kamp and the two fell in love during college. Bree and Rex got married in 1987. Bree gave birth to her son Andrew in 1988 and daughter Danielle in 1989. The family moved in 1994 to 4354 Wisteria Lane, Fairview. She gave a bad first impression to Mary Alice Young and Susan Mayer, local neighbours and friends, after Andrew stole a ceramic frog from the Youngs' backyard. Bree, Susan and Mary Alice become close friends. In 1998 Lynette Scavo joined the group. 5 years later, after a short and difficult first impression of Gabrielle Solis, all four women accepted the ex-model as their friend. =Season 1= Bree Van de Kamp is introduced as the \\"perfect\\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearances makes her family resent her, and as her husband Rex put it \\"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore\\". She insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counseling when he wants a divorce, and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down Juanita Solis, leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \\"persuaded\\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, George Williams, but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in S&M; scenarios with him. Concerned about Andrew's worsening behavior, she is cheered when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately this doesn't make any difference so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is gay. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counseling on lifestyle, believing that his soul is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears. =Season 2= In Season 2, Bree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She so annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief that Bree tells her that she cannot attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers Phyllis reported her friendship with George to the company handling Rex's life insurance. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the local paper, an ex-fianc√©e of his visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends the woman away but she is proved right when George loses his temper with an old school friend of Bree's, so she ends their relationship. He tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund. Events with Rex, George and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins AA but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter, and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbors, the Applewhites are hiding from the police and is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund. She dumps Peter and throws Andrew out after discovering that they slept together and in her bed. Bree's mental health deteriorates rapidly following this and nobody can help her as her behavior becomes erratic and spirals out of control including creating a scene at Danielle's birthday party. Danielle, meanwhile, starts dating Matthew Applewhite and moves out to be with him. However, Matthew's mother, Betty Applewhite, realizes Matthew murdered an ex-girlfriend, Melanie Foster. She tells Bree, who has checked herself into a psychiatric unit and later escapes after they refuse to let her leave. Bree and Betty rush to Bree's house to find Matthew and Danielle have taken money from Bree's safe. Bree confronts Matthew about Melanie and refuses to let them leave, so he threatens to shoot her, but the police, called by Betty, shoot him first. Bree then has to console Danielle. Bree's final scenes involve her beginning a new friendship with the mysterious Orson Hodge. =Season 3= Season three sees Bree marrying Orson after a six-month relationship, but their marriage is troubled by the belief that Orson physically abused his first wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey), and murdered her. Shortly after the wedding, Orson persuades Andrew to come home and they reconcile. However, the arrival of Orson's mother, Gloria (Dixie Carter), and Alma's return, cause more trouble. They drug and rape Orson but Bree intervenes, learning that Gloria murdered Orson's mistress, Monique Polier, so he would stay with Alma. Gloria tries to kill Bree but Orson intervenes. Gloria has a severe stroke after Orson holds her head under water to get her to let go of the knife about to be used to kill Bree. Orson carries Gloria's body outside and places it next to Alma's body after she died when falling from the roof of her house. Danielle, meanwhile, finds herself pregnant by Edie's nephew Austin (Josh Henderson). She is sent away so the neighborhood won't learn of her pregnancy and Bree and Orson decide to fake a pregnancy so they can raise Danielle's child as their own. Bree is not in episodes 3.16 to 3.22 as she is on honeymoon with Orson and Danielle. Bree returns for Gabrielle and Victor's wedding, heavily pregnant or so it seems... =Season 4= In season four, Bree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant but is dismayed by people wanting to feel the baby move. Phyllis, Rex's mother, discovers Bree's pregnancy hoax and tries convincing Danielle to raise the child herself. Bree and Orson, however, persuade Danielle to give them the baby by offering to send her to college and buy her a convertible. Danielle has a baby boy and gives him to Bree ‚Äî who names him Benjamin Tyson Hodge (surname later changed to Katz) ‚Äî and agrees that Bree and Orson will raise him. Bree develops a rivalry with new neighbor, Katherine Mayfair. Bree and Katherine are very similar, leading to a series of feuds before eventually becoming friends and go into business together, catering dinner parties. After a tornado damages Bree's house, she, Orson and Benjamin stay with Susan, and Orson admits being responsible for putting Mike in a coma. Horrified, Bree kicks him out. During their separation, Edie Britt comes onto Orson, leading to a feud between her and Bree. Edie discovers Benjamin is Bree's grandson and attempts to blackmail her. Bree, however, tells the other housewives the truth, so they all snub Edie. In the season finale, Katherine saves Bree's life by telling her ex-husband, Wayne, her secrets. When Katherine kills Wayne, Bree and the other housewives tell the police that Katherine was terrified of a stalker so she doesn't go to prison. When the events of the series shift ahead by five years in the fourth-season finale, it is revealed that Bree is now a famous cookbook author and her son, Andrew, works with her as her assistant. Bree and Orson have evidently worked out their problems and are still together. =Season 5= The fifth season opens with Bree just having published her own cookbook, and successfully running the catering business. She and Orson reconcile after he went to prison for running over Mike. A flashback sequence reveals that while Bree awaited Orson's release, Danielle returned and took Benjamin, leaving her completely alone. Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine. Bree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. In revenge, Orson begins stealing - initially to punish people who he feels have been rude, and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when Bree learns that he was injured while attempting to rob an old woman (which led to Edie Britt's death) and that he has been trying to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires Karl Mayer as her divorce lawyer, who convinces her to stage a fake burglary so she can hide her precious/expensive things in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings. However, Orson discovers her plan, threatening to send her to prison for insurance fraud unless she stays with him. Bree agrees reluctantly but shares a passionate kiss with Karl. =Season 6= In the first episode, Bree is unwilling to sleep with Karl, despite her marriage being strained. Orson, however, is determined to salvage their relationship, commenting that guilt is sometimes necessary for happiness, and defending his use of blackmail so that she'll stay with him. Bree takes this motto as her own and consummates her affair with Karl. When Julie is hospitalized after being attacked, Bree worries that she will lose Susan's friendship on hearing that Susan would hypothetically no longer talk to a friend who dated Karl. However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business and only realizes the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbor, Angie Bolen, hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree. She discovers the tryst but confronts Bree, who explains that she connects intellectually with Orson but sexually with Karl, and is worried that their relationship will only ever be physical, despite his promises to change. Bree's fears are realized when Susan also finds out about her and Karl. They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does, indicating she has evidence of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce. Stunned, Orson tells Bree that he wouldn't send her to prison for fraud and goes to pack, but discovers her affair with Karl. They fight and Bree tries intervening but when an airplane crashes into Wisteria Lane, Karl is killed and Orson is paralyzed. Feeling guilty, Bree insists Orson come home so she can look after him but he is disgusted by her infidelity and takes advantage. Angry about his lack of manners and personal hygiene, Bree hoses him down but stops when he explains how angry he is with the way his life is now. Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, Bree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile. A young man named Sam Allen visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to see a photo of Rex and Sam. Sam admits Rex was his father and that he spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love- and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson says Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react. In the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he knows how Andrew ran over Carlos' mother years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree agrees to do so and then says she feels sorry for Sam for losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for the man. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for his hit-and-run of Mike but hiding Andrew's crime. He is both appalled and furious at Bree for this and announces he's moving out. Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle. =Season 7= Bree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mom Mama Solis (Lupe Ontiveros). Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring Keith Watson (Brian Austin Green), to help but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agreed to go out clubbing with Renee Perry. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith. Later Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he could have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then kisses Bree all of a sudden and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing Paul Young's plan to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistaken him as an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to beat Keith up. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the sky and this triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an assassination attempt, proceed to flee, resulting in a riot that goes out of control. Bree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \\"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want.\\" Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves. Bree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go into rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years and that they're no longer friends and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends. Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she will not end her friendship with Bree. While the Solis' are staying with Bree she has a run in with Detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake) who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman. Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number and the Solis' move out of Bree's and back with Carlos. Chuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women's center. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's sincere words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards. During the \\"progressive dinner party\\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered Alejandro Perez, Gaby's stepfather. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years. =Season 8= Following their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement, and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of Paul Young, asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past he sends her away. However, he later calls her back urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate, and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into Martha Huber's death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband and Bree is at first supportive until she finds her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money. Having avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help Ben Faulkner in a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless and Bree realizes that's wrong. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how this is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. At first happy about helping, Bree is horrified to realize the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink. Chuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice. Bree asks her asking if she is happy after having killed herself who replies, \\"I'm not unhappy\\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her and telling her she's \\"nothing more than a skank in a Nancy Reagan nightie\\", Renee notices the gun and the note. After reading it she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \\"You're welcome.\\" Renee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little and Bree ends up going with a man, skinny-dipping in a pool before the owner of the house comes home. Bree soon is going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree comes to the bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When Karen McCluskey says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed-hopping to the point where she hits upon a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention at which point Bree reaches boiling point and blasts them for their less than friend like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree only to be interrupted by a wheelchair-bound Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \\"cleaning up each other's messes.\\" Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence to the Fairview Police. Bree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet. Meanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help of his cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she has nothing to do with it. But as she was drinking her cup of tea, her fingerprints were on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body, and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. But they do not stop there - a detective tracks down a call of Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it. In order to defend herself, Bree asks Bob Hunter for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a crime lawyer. He recommends lawyer Trip Weston, whom he calls a \\"shark\\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth, and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree marries Trip and moves to Louisville, Kentucky where she joins a club for conservative women. Later she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council, then the following November she is elected to the Kentucky Legislature. Reception=Critical= Bree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal. In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle called Cross \\"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\\", and applauds her for \\"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect.\\" At the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role, following the first year's emphasis on Susan Mayer. Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season, Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery. Cross retained her center-stage position for the show's third season, which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband Orson. Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third, and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \\"loss of steam\\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season. Season 4's \\"fake pregnancy\\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \\"hysterical [storyline] yet\\", and singling Cross out for praise. Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight. Following the five year leap, a new direction was taken with Bree's character as she made the transition from housewife to author/businesswoman, a development which received positive reception. This change in character development was continued into season 6, with another side to Bree's personality being shown, which includes an affair with Karl Mayer. Critics lauded the comic relief provided by these developments, as well as the more poignant and emotional turn mid-season as Bree deals with Orson's paralysis. In Season 7, Bree finds herself newly divorced and embarks on a relationship with Keith Watson, a move which was praised for allowing \\"the for-so-long uptight Bree letting her hair down and having some fun for a change.\\" By the climax of season 7, Bree is central in covering up the murder of Gabrielle's stepfather, a move which was praised as a sound set up for the final season. =Awards= Marcia Cross has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Bree. For her work on the second season of the show, she garnered the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy (her second nomination), and has also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series twice as part of the cast (being nominated a further three times). In 2005, Cross was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the season one episode, \\"Running to Stand Still\\". She also made the Top 10 Pre-Nomination Finalist listing for the same award three subsequent times, for her work on the second-season episode \\"Next\\", third-season episode \\"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\\", and fourth-season episode \\"Now You Know\\". She has received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, for Best Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy, for her work on the first three seasons of the show, and has also received three nominations at the Prism Awards (for Performance in a Comedy Series, in relation to Bree's alcoholism), and a nomination from the Television Critics Association for Individual Achievement in Comedy in 2005. =Cultural influences and impact= Bree is spoofed in MADtv's Desperate Housewives parody,YouTube - MADtv Desperate Housewives Spoof in which they mock the character's plastic exterior and demeanor. In a 2006 interview with Charmed Magazine, Michelle Stafford admitted that her character Mandi in Charmed episode \\"Desperate Housewitches\\" was almost entirely modeled on Marcia Cross as Bree. Looking at pictures and episodes of Bree to gain a sense of her posture and body language, she laughed, \\"I'm just mimicking her. I'm just ripping her off.\\" In 2007, Madame Alexander released a line of 16-inch fashion dolls of the series' main characters, including Bree.

Life She was a daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria (1073-1136), from his second marriage with Agnes (1072-1143), the only daughter of the Salian emperor Henry IV. She thereby was a niece of Emperor Henry V, the chronicler Otto of Freising was one of her older brothers. King Conrad III of Germany was her half-brother from her mother's first marriage with the Hohenstaufen duke Frederick I of Swabia; Emperor Frederick Barbarossa was her nephew. By his marriage, Judith's father Leopold had climbed into the first row of Imperial princes. In 1125 he even was one of the possible candidates in the election as King of the Romans, he nevertheless forwent in favour of his stepson Duke Frederick II of Swabia. About 1133, Judith married the Aleramici marquess William V of Montferrat (d. 1191), by whom she bore at least eight children. The Aleramici were among the leading dynasties in the Crusades; William accompanied his nephew King Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade of 1147. Of Judith's five sons, four became prominent in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of Byzantium: *William Longsword (d. 1177), Count of Jaffa and Ascalon; father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem. *Conrad of Montferrat (d. 1192), King of Jerusalem *Boniface of Montferrat (d. 1207); his successor to Montferrat and founder of the Kingdom of Thessalonica. *Frederick of Montferrat, Bishop of Alba *Renier of Montferrat (d. 1183); married into the Byzantine imperial family.

William V was a loyal supporter of Judith's nephew Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, their matrimony aided to Frederick's betrothal with Countess Beatrice I of Burgundy, a relative of William's mother Gisela, in 1156. Judith was still living in 1168, but seems to have died before her husband went to the Kingdom of Jerusalem after their grandson Baldwin's coronation as King of Jerusalem in the 1180s.

It is the southern boundary of the entrance to the long estuary of the Chesapeake Bay. Across the mouth of the bay to the north is Cape Charles the opposite point of the Bay's gateway. Named for two sons of King James I of England in 1607, together Cape Henry and Cape Charles form the Virginia Capes. History Cape Henry was named on April 26, 1607 in honor of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the elder of two sons of King James I of England to survive to the age of 18 and heir-apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of England (later united in 1707 with neighboring Scotland as the Kingdom of Great Britain), by an expedition of the London Company branch of the proprietary Virginia Company headed by Captain Christopher Newport. After an unusually long voyage of 144 days from England, it was their first landfall, an event which has come to be called \\"The First Landing\\". Soon after this landing the English colonists erected a wooden cross and gave thanks for a successful crossing to a new land.National Park Service; United States Government In the First Charter of Virginia, King James I devoted parcels of land for the purpose of spreading the Christian religion. The Charter reads in part: \\"We greatly commending, and graciously accepting of, their Desires for the Furtherance of so noble a Work, which may, by the Providence of Almighty God, hereafter tend to the Glory of his Divine Majesty, in propagating of Christian Religion to such People, as yet live in Darkness and miserable Ignorance...\\" Captain Newport, with his three ships, Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery, and the group of 104 men and boys, subsequently explored inland and established Jamestown on an island for protection offshore from the north shore further upstream on the James River which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. Cape Henry Weather Bureau 1900 The following year of 1608, Captain John Smith took a crew with a small boat outfitted with a sail and proceeded north up the Chesapeake Bay exploring and mapping its coasts and rivers, creeks and bays up to the later named Susquehanna River which fed the Bay. In 1781, the waters off of these Virginia Capes and the entrance to the Chesapeake and Hampton Roads harbor were the site of an important naval clash between warships of the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England near the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) in the Battle of the Capes. The victory of the French Navy over the British Royal Navy cut off the King's Army troops of Lord Charles Cornwallis surrounded, bombarded and under siege for a month at Yorktown, Virginia, a short distance up the Bay on the Western Shore's York River. They had been pursued after a series of clashes for several years in the Southern Theater in Georgia and the Carolinas by rebel patriot regular forces of soldiers under the command of Gen. Nathanael Greene and Daniel Morgan, along with irregular bands of guerilla partisans sniping and wearing down the Redcoats by attrition. As Cornwallis headed northward to the rich untouched colony of Virginia and also hoping to be reinforced / resupplied or evacuated if necessary on the ragged shores of the Carolina coast or the Chesapeake where British seapower and naval dominance could be brought to bear. The French fleet under Admiral deGrasse sent from the Caribbean Sea and West Indies islands with an unusual naval victory over the British taskforce who also had sent a second fleet from occupied New York retreating back northward which was supposed to reinforce and guard Cornwallis' seaward side. The British general was forced to surrender in October 1781 to a combined jointly commanded American-French Army with German states mercenary allies under Gen. George Washington, Gen. Marquis de Lafayette and French Army troops under Gen. Rochambeau who had deceived Gen. William Howe commander in New York where the Northern Theater had stalemated and sneaked out slipping and gaining several weeks march southward down the East Coast to surprise and catch Cornwallis' Redcoats camped at Yorktown in a siege. Finally for the first time in the six year long rebellion, the insurgents had numerical superiority in numbers and artillery along with adequate cooperating seapower from the French allies. The often little known sea Battle of the Capes a few miles off the American Virginia coast was the nail in the coffin to assure colonial independence as the War ended a year and a half later with the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

Alethic modality is often associated with epistemic modality in research, and it has been questioned whether this modality should be considered distinct from epistemic modality which denotes the speaker's evaluation or judgment of the truth. The criticism states that there is no real difference between \\"the truth in the world\\" (alethic) and \\"the truth in an individual's mind\\" (epistemic). An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities would be formally distinguished, for example by the means of a grammatical mood. In such a language, \\"A circle can't be square\\", \\"can't be\\" would be expressed by an alethic mood, whereas for \\"He can't be that wealthy\\", \\"can't be\\" would be expressed by an epistemic mood. As we can see, this is not a distinction drawn in English grammar. \\"You can't give these plants too much water.\\" is a well- known play on the distinction between perhaps alethic and hortatory or injunctive modalities. The dilemma is fairly easily resolved when listening through paralinguistic cues and particularly suprasegmental cues (intonation).

His father was a supervisor of studies (pion), later a teacher, and unfaithful to Jules' mother. Jules was a brilliant student. The Revolution of 1848 in France found him participating in protests in Nantes where his father had been assigned to teach. It was during this period that he began to align himself with the budding socialist movement. After being sent to Paris to prepare for his entrance into Lyc√©e Condorcet (1850) he neglected his studies altogether. He took part in the uprising against Napoleon III during the French coup of 1851, fighting together with his friend Arthur Ranc at one of the rare barricades on December 2. Vall√®s later fled to Nantes, where his father had him committed to a mental institution.(ref 1978, Bernard No√´l e.a.) Thanks to help from his friend Antoine Arnould, he managed to escape a few months later. He returned to Paris, where he joined the staff of Le Figaro, and became a regular contributor to the other leading journals. In 1853 he was arrested for conspiring against Napoleon III, but was later freed due to a lack of evidence. He lived in poverty, writing journalism for bread (the stock market page of the Figaro even, until fired for his bias against capitalism). It was under these conditions that he wrote his first book L'Argent (1857). Les Amours de Paille (1859), a comedy written in collaboration with Poupart-Davyl, was a failure.(ref 1990 Alain Viala) At the insistence of his colleague Henri Rochefort he found an administrative job issuing birth certificates for the Vaugirard town hall.(1860) He became a steady friend of Hector Malot and began to live with his lover, Jos√©phine Lapointe. He decided to become a pion himself in Caen, but was quickly discharged. Back in Paris, his friend Hector Malot helped him reacquire his job at the town hall. In 1864-1865 he wrote literary criticism for Progr√®s de Lyon. In 1865 he collected much of his newspaper work in a book Les Refractaires that sold well. A second collection in 1866 La Rue had less success. In 1867 he started the newspaper La Rue, which was later suppressed by the government after a mere eight months of publication. Republican opposition Vall√®s caricatured in 1867 by Andr√© Gill. By this time he was a recognized leader of the republican opposition against the Second French Empire. In 1865 he had lost his job at Vaugirard for a speech he gave against the capitalist society of the Second Empire, eluding the censorship by advertising a talk on Balzac. In 1868 he was twice convicted for press crimes: one month in prison for criticizing the police, two months for criticising the Empire. At the elections of 1869 he was the candidate to the left opposing the moderate Jules Simon. He lost the election and went to work for La Marseillaise the newspaper of Henri Rochefort, meanwhile contributing to La Libert√© of √âmile de Girardin. In the summer of 1869 members of several \\"Chambres syndicales\\" of Paris workers rented a space at nr 6, Place de la Corderie to hold the meetings of the \\"Chambre f√©d√©rale des Soci√©t√©s ouvri√®res\\", the \\"Conseil f√©d√©ral des sections parisiennes de l'Internationale\\", and as the events unfolded the \\"Comit√© central r√©publicain des Vingt Arrondissements\\" (1870) and the \\"Comit√© central de la Garde nationale\\". (March 1871) It was to be the very organisational center of the Paris Commune. Its activities are prominently described in Jacques Vingtras:L'Insurg√©. Jules Vall√®s had friends and connections among all the tendencies represented: Proudhon, Blanquist, Marxist and while he was himself independent of all of them he represented the active force of each. He was well known and well liked and when in 1870 the Government of National Defence spread the rumour that the candidates of the extreme left including Vall√®s had been on the payroll of the Imperial police at the 1869 elections, the Corderie gave him a vote of confidence. 1870 The year leading up to the Paris Commune began with the assassination of Victor Noir (January 10). Jules Vall√®s and Henri Rochefort found themselves at the head of the mass manifestation at Victor Noir's funeral (January 12); Rochefort interceding with the blanquist Gustave Flourens who wanted to begin the anti-imperial insurrection there and then. In July Napoleon III embroiled France in the Franco-Prussian War. Vall√®s was among the very few anti-war protesters, and was jailed as a consequence (August 6). On September 2 Napoleon III capitulated at Sedan and was captured. On September 4 the Third French Republic was proclaimed and the Government of National Defence installed.(Gambetta) Vall√®s was freed from prison and took part in the popular manifestations leading to the formation of the \\"Comit√© central r√©publicain des Vingt arrondissements\\" of which he -like many other leaders of the Paris Commune- became a prominent member; heading even, for a while, a battalion of the \\"Garde nationale\\". On September 18 the Prussians laid siege on a Paris unwilling to accept defeat and calling for all out war by the provinces. On October 5, Flourens marched the five battalions \\"Garde nationale\\" of Belleville in disciplined military fashion to the H√¥tel de Ville to show preparedness. On October 31, a first blanquist uprising erupted at Belleville with Vall√®s in command of his battalion occupying the town hall of la Vilette. The uprising failed and Vall√©s had to go in hiding. 1871 and the Paris Commune At the start of 1871 Jules Vall√®s at the initiative of the \\"Comit√© central r√©publicain des Vingt arrondissements\\" edited the \\"Affiche Rouge\\" posted on January 7 : the first call for the proclamation of the Paris Commune. On Mars 11, Vall√®s was judged for his participation in the October plot. He escaped from the tribunal after hearing himself condemned to six months in prison, and his Le Cri du Peuple which he had started on February 22, banned from further appearance. On March 18, the Commune was officially proclaimed; March 21, Le Cri du Peuple reappeared to become one of the most successful newspapers of the Commune - together with P√®re Duch√™ne. On March 26 he was elected by the 15th district (Vaugirard: 4,403 votes of 6,467 voters) to the Conseil de la Commune; nominated to the commission of Public Education (March 29). Although quick to the march when it came to demand individual liberties Jules Vall√®s was also a voice for opposite opinion: he claimed his reserve when the separation of Church and State was proclaimed (April 2), opposed the suppression of the \\"reactionary\\" newspapers (April 26), he voted against the institution of the Comit√© de Salut with its jacobin tendencies, and together with 22 other prominent members - among them his old friend Arnould, the painter Gustave Courbet, Vermorel, Varlin...he signed the manifest of the minority which he published in his newspaper. (May 15) On May 21 the Versailles troops entered Paris through the porte Saint-Cloud while Vall√®s, among minority members reintegrated in the Commune, presided over its last session - in judgement over Cluseret and his failure to hold the fort of Issy (and with Vall√®s in sympathy with the defendant). During the Semaine Sanglante (May 21 ‚Äì May 28) he took part in the fighting, making a last stand in the rue de Paris (now rue de Belleville) on May 28 with his steadfast friend Gabriel Ranvier. Together they managed to escape the fusillades and went into exile. In 1872 both were given death sentences in absentia. Le Cri du Peuple Jules Vall√®s' newspaper Le Cri du Peuple -Journal politique quotidien, 10 centimes was among the most successful of the Paris Commune. Only Journal Officiel, La Commune, Le Mot d'Ordre, le P√®re Duch√™ne and le Vengeur appear to have been contending rivals. Its style has been described as \\"simple firmity, sympathetic authority, reflected realism due to a conviction rendered spontaneously lyrical by its sincerity\\" by Bernard No√´l, who read through the entire press produced in Paris 1871 for his Dictionnaire de la Commune (1978). After the paper was banned by General Vinoy (1871) on March 11 (nr18), it was reissued on March 21 (nr19) and was published without interruption until Tuesday May 23 (nr83). Its collaborators were: Casimir Bouis, Jean-Baptiste Cl√©ment, Pierre Denis, and Charles Rochat, with occasional articles by Henry Bauer (1851‚Äì1915), Courbet, and Andr√© Leo. Because of the communal tasks taken up by most other editors, the work of chief editor in practice fell to Pierre Denis, who set the tone with accent on the Proudhonian ideology. He represented his views in the First International, of which he was a member: recognition of individual liberties, suppression of the permanent army and police, \\"La√Øcit√©\\" and free education, entire benefit of work produced, autonomy of the commune -or Voluntary association, autonomy, federation, and union. Jacques Vingtras and exile The foregoing events were all chronicled in the three parts of Jules Vall√®s major work: Jacques Vingtras: L'Enfant, Le Bachelier, L'insurg√©. Vall√®s wrote Jacques Vingtras during his bitter exile following the Paris Commune. Vall√®s went to live in exile in London. In 1875 Vall√®s, in the absence of his companion Jos√©phine Lapointe, had an affair with another woman. She bore his daughter, but when the girl died at 10 months, Vall√®s quickly separated from the mother. This period in 1876 marked his complete destitution. His friend Hector Malot negotiated the publication of his novel Jacques Vingtras - L'Enfant as a serial (feuilleton) in the newspaper Le Si√®cle (June‚ÄìAugust 1878). The extreme realism combined with corrosive irony resulted in a negative public reaction and dropping of the project. In January‚ÄìMay 1879 Le Bachelier appeared in La R√©volution fran√ßaise under the title Les M√©moires d'un r√©volt√©. The first book Jacques Vingtras - L'Enfant, Le Bachelier was published by Charpentier and signed 'Jean La Rue' (Vall√®s had tried to start the paper La Rue in Brussels that same year - a failure). In 1879-1880 he came to know S√©verine, whose friendship secured the final draft of L'Insurg√©. She persuaded Charpentier to publish the book in 1886, after Vall√®s's death. Among the French authors most influenced by the racy, concise and ironic style of Jules Vall√®s is Jules Renard, author of the child's portrait Poil de Carotte. S√©verine at least recognised the quality of the prose of her friend in his writings (see: Jules Renard Journal 1897-1910). Amnesty and last days After his liberation on 11 June 1879, Blanqui had managed to get support from Gambetta for the plight of the many thousand destitutes who had been implicated in the Paris Commune. On 11 July 1880 the government issued a general pardon, in the wake of which Vall√®s was able to return to Paris. There he renewed his journalism with vigour. In 1881 he was among the 100,000 mourners in procession for Blanqui's funeral. In 1883 he was entirely successful in restarting Le Cri du Peuple as a voice for libertarian and socialist ideas. At the same time he became increasingly ill with diabetes. During a health crisis in November 1884, he was taken to the house of doctor Guebhard and his secretary S√©verine. He assigned Hector Malot to be the executor of his will and died on 14 February 1885. His funeral was also a major public event, attracting a procession of some 60,000 following the coffin to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

Often known locally simply as Stanford, the town is within the unitary authority of Thurrock and located 23.8 miles (38.4 km) east of Charing Cross in London. Its principal claim to fame is that Joseph Conrad lived and wrote there. Unlike some other areas of Thurrock, Stanford-le-Hope is surrounded by countryside and farmland. Geography Stanford-le-Hope is bordered to the north by the A13 road and to the south by the Thames Estuary. It is located 12.7 miles (20.5 km) west of Southend-on-Sea. The town centre has a village feel with its 800-year-old church, St Margarets making a prominent and attractive landmark around which shops, pubs and restaurants have grown to create a lively core to the town. As Stanford-le-Hope grows in size, it has started to incorporate neighbouring settlements such as Corringham, Mucking and Fobbing, the latter of which was the scene of one of the uprisings which led to the Peasants' Revolt. The River Hope, a tributary of the Thames, runs through the town. Locally there are a number of parks and nature reserves, notably Thurrock Thameside Nature Reserve, with a visitor centre providing views up and down the Thames across both industrial and natural landscapes including the Mucking Flats SSSI. In 2014, a group of residents led a restoration project which raised funds to finance a restoration of the war memorial, as part of the commemoration of the 1914-1919 conflict in Europe. Transport and industry The town is served by Stanford- le-Hope railway station. The town is home to many commuters working in London, thanks to its proximity to the capital and its c2c-operated London, Tilbury and Southend Railway rail connections. Until 1999 the town benefitted from two refineries located on the nearby Thames, Shell Haven and Coryton. The Shell site ceased operating in 1999 and has been redeveloped as the London Gateway deepwater container port with attendant logistics and commercial development. Coryton refinery ceased to operate in 2013, demolition of the process units continues and the site is now under redevelopment as a fuels storage and distribution terminal in a joint venture between Greenergy and Shell. It is also an enterprise zone. Many residents also travel along the nearby A13 to work in the Lakeside Shopping Centre, as well as the industrial and commercial businesses along the north bank of the Thames running west towards the Port of London. Politics , Stanford-le-Hope is represented on Thurrock Council by seven councillors from the Conservative Party (Shane Hebb, Terry Piccolo, James Halden, Pauline Tolson, Gary Collins, Colin Churchman and Alex Anderson). There remains one Thurrock Independent councillor (who was elected on a UKIP ticket, but left the party in 2018), Jack Duffin. The serving Member of Parliament is Stephen Metcalfe from the Conservative Party, who was re- elected for the fourth time at the 2019 UK general election.

Early career Martin was born in Midleton, County Cork, Ireland but emigrated with his parents to Sydney, Australia at the age of one. He was educated at Dame's School, Parramatta and, despite his family's poverty, the Sydney Academy and Sydney College under the tutelage of William Timothy Cape, and left school at the age of 16 to become a reporter. In 1838, Martin published the Australian Sketch Book, a series of character sketches he dedicated to Sydney barrister George Robert Nichols, for whom he was then working as an articled clerk in 1840. Martin qualified as a solicitor in 1845, and combined his legal career with employment as a newspaper editor and publisher. He married Isabella Long on 20 January 1853 and together they produced 15 children. Early political career In February 1848 Martin nominated as a candidate for a by-election for the electorate of Durham in the New South Wales Legislative Council, but withdrew before polling day. In the general election held later in the same year he was a candidate for the electorate of Counties of Cook and Westmoreland, which he won with a margin of 16%. His election however was declared void on the grounds that he did not meet the property qualifications to stand, however he was re-elected unopposed. Martin subsequently sued the Speaker of the Legislative Council, Charles Nicholson and the Sergeant at Arms, William Christie, for trespass for having him removed when there had been no decision of the Electoral Court in accordance with the Electoral Act 1843. The Full Court of the Supreme Court held that under the Electoral Act 1843 it was only the Electoral Court that could determine there was a vacancy and not the Governor.Martin v Nicholson Supreme Court (Full Court) (NSW), per Stephen CJ, Dickinson and Therry JJ. Martin was an effective legislator but his sharp tongue and intemperate speeches to the House made him few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. His most notable political achievement in his first eight years in office was to initiate the Parliamentary debate that led to the establishment of a branch of the royal mint in Sydney. In 1856 the partly elected unicameral Legislative Council was abolished and replaced with a new parliament with elected members of the Legislative Assembly and appointed members of the Legislative Council. Martin was elected as one of two members for Cook and Westmoreland. When that electorate was largely replaced by the single member electorate of Hartley, Martin successfully stood for the new four member electorate of East Sydney. He was subsequently the member for Orange, Tumut, Monaro, Lachlan and East Macquarie. In August 1856 he was made Attorney-General of New South Wales in the first ministry of Charles Cowper. The appointment was controversial, as Martin was the first holder of the office who had not been admitted as a barrister. He had to resign his seat as a result of accepting the office, however he was re-elected unopposed. The appointment was brief, as the government was defeated in a no-confidence motion in October 1856 and Martin returned to the backbench. Martin was admitted to the bar in 1856 and was made a Queen's Counsel in 1857. He returned as Attorney General in the second Cowper Ministry in September 1857, and was again re-elected unopposed. As Attorney General however, his reputation for intemperate language continued and after a series of conflicts with fellow Ministers he resigned the office in November 1858. Premier of New South Wales In October 1863, Martin was asked by the Governor of New South Wales to form a government with a mandate to address rising State deficits and rural unemployment. As Premier and Colonial Secretary Martin promptly introduced measures to reduce immigration and increase tariffs, but was unable to secure Parliamentary support for many of his reforms. With limited achievements to its credit, the government suffered a substantial swing at the 1865 election and Martin stepped down to make way for the return of Charles Cowper. Cowper was once again defeated in a no-confidence motion in December 1865, and in January 1866 Martin became Premier for the second time as leader of a coalition government with former rival Henry Parkes. His government resigned in October 1868, but he returned to the Premiership for a third and final time between December 1870 and May 1872. After politics Martin retired from Parliament in November 1873 and was immediately named to the vacant position of Chief Justice of New South Wales. He held the post for 13 years, despite considerable ill health in later life. James Martin died at home in Potts Point, Sydney on 4 November 1886 and buried in St Judes churchyard in Randwick, NSW. in 1909 his remains were moved to a new underground vault in the impressive Waverley Cemetery. Honours Martin was made a Queen's Counsel in 1857, and was knighted in 1869. Martin Place, a pedestrian mall in the central business district of Sydney was named after him in 1892. 'Lady Martin Beach' a small beach accessible to the public from Wolseley Road, Point Piper, New South Wales is named after his wife, Isabella who resided at nearby Woollahra House.

Is located 496 km north of the state capital. The first settlers were German, Italian and Polish immigrants who arrived in the region in 1927, though the city was created only in 1955. Nowadays, most of the inhabitants are of German-Brazilian descent. Supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen was born and raised in Horizontina. The city has an average annual temperature of 20.8 ¬∞C. With 79.4% of the population living in the urban area, the city counted in 2009 with eleven healthcare facilities. Its Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.783, considered high by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the 11th largest in the Rio Grande do Sul state, the 110th of Brazil and the first of its micro-region. The colonization of the city occurred in 1927, when the first German colonists arrived in the region. A year later came more families from other ethnic groups, causing the place to develop. The first name of the city council was Belo Horizonte, later becoming Vila Horizonte, Horizonte and the current name, Horizontina, in 1944. Before being elevated to a municipality, it was a district in the municipality of Santa Rosa. Only in December 1954 the district was emancipated. The city is known as the \\"Cradle of National Harvesters Automotive\\", due to construction of the first Brazilian automotive harvester in the city in 1965. Even today, a unit of US company John Deere is installed in Horizontina, generating about 80% of all tax revenues of the city.  Regional language  The German dialect Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch is a regional language and as such an integral part of the history of many municipalities throughout the state of Rio Grande do Sul since pioneer days, including Horizontina. The dialect is spoken by millions of people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, it is also part of the history of Horizontina and the state's northwest region. In 2012 the Legislative Assembly voted unanimously in favor of official recognition of Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch, the German dialect more spoken in Brazil, and with the highest concentration of speakers in Rio Grande do Sul, as part of the intangible cultural heritage to be preserved and protected.

The Salt Range contains the great mines of Khewra, Kalabagh and Warcha which yield vast supplies of salt. Coal of a medium quality is also found. *Sakaser is the highest peak of Salt Range. *Namal Lake, Khabikki Lake and Uchhali Lake are lakes in the Salt Range. History The Awan, Gakhars, and Janjuas had engaged in an endless battle for sovereignty over the Salt Range. But later in the 16th century, the Wan drove out Janus and Sakharov from the western parts of the Salt Range. According to the Emperor Ba bar, the Jude and the Janjuha were \\"two races descended from the same father, \\"Autobiography translated by Erskine, p251 who from old times had been rulers of the hills between Nilab and Bhera, that is, of the Salt Range. \\"On one-half of the hill lived the Jud, and on the other half the Janjua.\\" The Awans now occupy western half of these hills towards Nilab and Janjuas (Rajputs) on eastern part of these Hills. Juds are actually a sub-clan of Janjuas and there are still 7 seven villages of Juds near Dhrabi Area of Chakwal including Dhrabi village and Dam. They are descendants of Raja Jodh who was 2nd Prince of Janjua King Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua.There are several forts on these hills and all of them were built by Janjua Rajputs and there ancestors the Pandav's at Katas Raj as well as the Janjua Shahi Dynasty of 2nd Kabul Shahis at Nandna fort. Also this area is known as the first ever Muslim Rajputs Kingdom and Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua was the founder of This Kingdom. He was from Chandravanshi Rathore Rajputs clan and he was from the bloodline of famous Indian Mahabharata Warrior Prince Arjun Dev Pandav. About 1500 Janjua Rajputs warrior cavalry fought in the battle of Panipat from this area in support of Babur under the command Malik Hast Khan Janjua (Asad). Sultan Lashkar Janjua and Raja Sanghral Ali Khan Janjuas were also commanding their own Muslim Janjua Rajputs during Battle of Panipat and Battle of Khanwa against Rana Sanga. All of them were rulers of these Hills and chieftains of this ruling Rajput clan. Before these hills were known as Koh-e-jodh, it was on the name of Raja Jodh Janjua son of Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua.Four reports made during the years, 1862‚Äì63‚Äì64‚Äì65, Volume 2, by Sir Alexander Cunningham, p.17 Kathwai Two interesting sites are close to Kathwai, Kutte Mar, and Tulaja fort. At Kuttee Mar to the Northeast of Kathwai are Muslim graves made of Kangar and the purported grave of a dog that is said to have died defending the wedding procession of its owner from an attack by bandits. Kutte Mar may have been the place where the Khura inscription of Toramana was found (Buhler 1891‚Äì92, 238‚Äì41; Sircar 1965: 422‚Äì4). If this assessment is correct, a Buddhist monastery was established here around 500. A.D. This inscription and another fragmentary inscription found at Sakaser (Pakistan Archaeology 5, 1968: 284-70) confirm that this area was a flourishing, center for Buddhism, which is borne out by the extensive archaeological remains. The Tulaja fort is located on a huge rock outcropping with sheer cliffs overlooking the shrine of Kacchianwalla and the Punjab plains. The entire area is covered with the ruins of defensive walls, houses, and other structures made of large stone blocks. Although one building has been identified as a mosque, it is very difficult to distinguish other religious, military or civil structures. One of the most interesting features is a large square tank made of the flat rectangular bricks, which may have supplied water so that the fort could withstand a siege. Comparing this tank with those in other forts may help in assigning a relative date to its construction. In addition to architectural styles, evidence from any coins, which are found here, may help to indicate if this city belonged to the period of the Turk Sultans, Lodhis or Mughals. Extensive remains of a cemetery and other settlements are on the slopes below the fort. There are also supposed to be some remains on Tulaji across the valley from Talaja.

Churchill (February 13, 1891 - September, 1969) was a car dealer in Bismarck, North Dakota who funded an integrated baseball team in the mid- thirties more than a decade before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. Business Churchill joined Wickham Corwin's Bismarck automobile dealership in 1925 and the company became Corwin-Churchill Motor Co. A colleague said he \\"was a hell of a salesman--a smart fellow and real promoter.\\" In 1937, when Corwin moved to Fargo, Churchill stayed in Bismarck. When Churchill retired in 1952 he sold his share of the business to the Corwin family. He also owned the Prince Hotel, Bismarck. Baseball Immediately after World War I Churchill took up baseball with the Bismarck semi-pro team and became their star player. He bought the team in 1933 and, from his experience of playing against black touring teams, he decided that recruiting black players would strengthen his new team. He called Abe Saperstein to recruit some Negro League players. The first three black players to join the Bismarck Churchills were Quincy Trouppe (Chicago American Giants catcher, Red Haley (Memphis Red Sox (infielder), and Roosevelt Davis (Pittsburgh Crawfords) pitcher. When these proved insufficient to beat Bismarck's great rivals in Jamestown, Churchill recruited Satchel Paige from the Crawfords. Gus Greenlee, the Crawfords' owner, threatened to knife Churchill for the 'theft' of Paige. Paige arrived from Chicago on the day of the game in October 1933. It was the first time that he had played alongside white players. Churchill won his bet of $1000 with a Jamestown politician that his team would win. A rematch was held a few days later in Jamestown before a crowd of 4000. After twelve innings the game was ended, unresolved, by darkness. Churchill challenged Jamestown to a three-game series in Bismarck. Bismarck won that series and the state championship. Next season (1934), Churchill spent $5,000 (using personal and city funds, and federal emergency relief labor) improving on the Bismarck ball park. He built a 3000-seat grandstand, children's bleachers, and a 500-space car park, with a clear view of the game along the outfield fence. Churchill's 1935 team included Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, Quincy Trouppe (who joined the team in early June), and Ted \\"Double Duty\\" Radcliffe (who joined on June 21 after securing his release from the Brooklyn Eagles).

She was also responsible for the hiring of puppeteer Steve Whitmire (who would later take over performing Kermit the Frog and Ernie of \\"Sesame Street\\" after the death of Jim Henson in 1990) in 1978 after he gave her an impromptu audition in an Atlanta, Georgia airport restaurant. In 1990, the Henson Company went into an agreement with Disney to present a live stage show: Here Come The Muppets, at Disney/MGM Studio. Jane was the main developer in the training of performers and profile creation for the walk-around versions of the Muppets. She was able to share the Henson spirit of the ten characters that joined Disney at the time: Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great, Bean Bunny, as well as five members of the Electric Mayhem Band. Towards the end of her life, Jane conceived the idea of a stylized puppet show based on the Gospel accounts of the birth of Jesus. Together with a small group of collaborators, she created a live theatre piece featuring tabletop manger figure puppets built by the Jim Henson Creature Shop. Jane Henson's Nativity Story premiered at the 2010 Orlando Puppet Festival.

Biography Uzawa was born on July 21, 1928 in Yonago, Tottori to a farming family. He attended the Tokyo First Middle School (currently the Hibiya High School ) and the First Higher School, Japan (now the University of Tokyo's College of Arts and Sciences faculty). He graduated from the Mathematics Department of the University of Tokyo in 1951; he was a special research student from 1951 to 1953. At that time, he discovered the true nature of economics in the words of John Ruskin, ‚ÄúThere is no wealth, but life.‚Äù which was quoted in the foreword to by Hajime Kawakami, and decided to study economics. A paper on decentralized economic planning written by him caught the eye of Kenneth Arrow at the Stanford University, he went to study Economics at Stanford University in 1956 with Fulbright fellowship, and became a research assistant, then assistant professor in 1956, then assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1960, and then associate professor at Stanford in 1961. Meanwhile, in 1962, he received a Ph.D. from Tohoku University. He afterwards was professor at the University of Chicago in 1964, and later assumed the position of professor of the Department of Economics at the University of Tokyo in 1969. He also taught at Niigata University, Chuo University, and United Nations University. Joseph E. Stiglitz and George A. Akerlof did research under Uzawa at the University of Chicago and David Cass studied under Uzawa at Stanford University. Uzawa was a senior fellow at the social, commonness, and capital research center of Doshisha University. He held the position of the president of the Econometric Society from 1976 to 1977. He also held the position of Counsel for the Development Bank of Japan's Research Institute of Capital Formation (RICF) from 1968 until his passing.  Contributions  Uzawa initiated the field of mathematical economics in postwar days and formulated the growth theory of neoclassical economics. This is reflected in the Uzawa‚ÄìLucas model, the Uzawa iteration, the Uzawa condition, and Uzawa's Theorem, among others. In his 1962 paper, Uzawa proved that the two of Walrasian equilibrium and Brouwer's fixed-point theorem are equivalent.

The laws or patent practices of many countries provide that certain subject-matter is excluded from patentability, even if the invention is novel and non-obvious. Together with criteria such as novelty, inventive step or nonobviousness, utility, and industrial applicability, which differ from country to country, the question of whether a particular subject matter is patentable is one of the substantive requirements for patentability.  Legislations  The subject-matter which is regarded as patentable as a matter of policy, and correspondingly the subject- matter which is excluded from patentability as a matter of policy, depends on the national legislation or international treaty. = Canada = According to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) patents may only be granted for physical embodiments of an idea, or a process that results in something that is tangible or can be sold. This excludes theorems and computer programs per se. However, business methods are patentable.Amazon.com v Commissioner of Patents, 2011 FCA 328 = European Patent Convention = The European Patent Convention does not provide any positive guidance on what should be considered an invention for the purposes of patent law. However, it provides in a non- exhaustive list of what are not to be regarded as inventions, and therefore not patentable subject matter: then qualifies Art. 52(2) EPC by stating: (In a previous EPC version some further items are excluded under , as formally being not industrially applicable, notable medical methods as applied by a physician or a veterinarian. Nowadays these methods are excluded directly under Art. 53 EPC, together with other policy exclusions).  Practice at the European Patent Office  Under , \\"European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are susceptible of industrial application.\\" So, four questions need to be assessed: #Is there an invention? #Is the invention susceptible of industrial application? #Is the invention novel? #Does the invention involve an inventive step? The first question \\"Is there an invention?\\" is equivalent to: \\"Is the claimed subject-matter as a whole within the realm of patentable subject-matter?\\" The invention question or patentable subject-matter question precedes the three further questions, which cannot, and need not, be assessed if there is no invention.See : \\"An invention shall be considered as susceptible of industrial application if (...)\\", : \\"An invention shall be considered to be new if (...)\\", and : \\"An invention shall be considered as involving an inventive step (...)\\") According to the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, the question \\"Is there an invention?\\" also implicitly implies the further question: \\"Does the claimed subject-matter have a technical character?\\" \\"Having technical character is an implicit requirement of the EPC to be met by an invention to be an invention within the meaning of \\".T 931/95 (Pension Benefit Systems Partnership) Patentable subject-matter considerations also intervene again at a secondary level, during the inventive step assessment. In T 641/00 (Comvik/Two Identities), the Board held that, \\"An invention consisting of a mixture of technical and non-technical features and having technical character as a whole is to be assessed with respect to the requirement of inventive step by taking account of all those features which contribute to said technical character whereas features making no such contribution cannot support the presence of inventive step.\\" The non-technical features are the ones that are excluded from the realm of patentable subject- matter as a matter of policy. T 258/03 (Hitachi/Auction Method) further developed this test for patentable subject-matter. Under this test, a patent application or patent which does not provide a technical solution to a technical problem would be refused (under ) or revoked (under ) as lacking inventive step. The European Patent Office provides guidelines for evaluating the patent-eligibility of computer-implemented inventions (CII), such as in particular based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). For instance, AI-based image processing programs are considered technical and therefore patent-eligible. Conversely, AI-based text processing programs with a text classification only based on the content of the text are not considered technical. These are excluded from patentability because attaching meaning to words is a cognitive task and not a technical implementation. Practice in the United Kingdom Following the 2006 Court of Appeal judgment in Aerotel v Telco and Macrossan's application, which contains a lengthy discussion of case law in the area, the UKPO has adopted the following test:Patents Act 1977: Patentable subject matter : (1) properly construe the claim : (2) identify the actual contribution : (3) ask whether it falls solely within the excluded subject matter : (4) check whether the actual or alleged contribution is actually technical in nature. The Court decided that the new approach provided a structured and more helpful way of applying the statutory test for assessing patentability which was consistent with previous decisions of the Court. This test is quite different from the test used by the EPO, as expressed in T 641/00 (Comvik/Two Identities) and T 258/03 (Hitachi/Auction Method), but it is considered that the end result will be the same in nearly every case. = United States = Section 101 of Title 35 U.S.C. sets out the subject matter that can be patented: In October 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued interim guidelinesUnited States Patent and Trademark Office, Interim Guidelines for Examination of Patent Applications for Patent Subject Matter Eligibility , OG Notices: 22 November 2005 (html) for patent examiners to determine if a given claimed invention meets the statutory requirements of being a useful process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (). These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result to be patentable. It does not matter whether the process is within the traditional technological arts or not. A price for a financial product, for example, is considered to be a concrete useful and tangible result (see State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group). However, on August 24, 2009, the USPTO issued new interim guidelinesUnited States Patent and Trademark Office, New Interim Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Examination Instructuons, August 24, 2009 so that examination would comport with the Federal Circuit opinion in In re Bilski, which held that the \\"useful, concrete, and tangible\\" test for patent- eligibility is incorrect and that State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group is no longer valid legal authority on this point. Instead, the Federal Circuit and the new USPTO guidelines use a machine-or-transformation test to determine patentability for processes. The Supreme Court determined that the claims in the Bilski case covered non-statutory subject matter as it was too abstract and broad. The USPTO has reasserted its position that literary works, compositions of music,Some new forms of musical notation, however, have been patented in the United States. See Music notation#Patents. compilations of data, legal documents (such as insurance policies), and forms of energy (such as data packets transmitted over the Internet), are not considered \\"manufactures\\" and hence, by themselves, are not patentable. Nonetheless, the USPTO has requested comments from the public on this position. The Federal Circuit has ruled, in In re Nuijten,500 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) that signals are not statutory subject matter, because articles of manufacture (the only plausible category under ) do not include intangible, incorporeal, transitory entities. The USPTO was prompted to issue the guidelines by a recent decision by their board of appeals, Ex Parte Lundgren.Precedential opinion, Paper No. 78, United States Patent and Trademark Office, Before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, Ex parte Carl A. Lundgren , Appeal No. 2003-2088, Application 08/093,516 April 20, 2004 This decision asserted that according to US judicial opinions, inventions do not have to be in the \\"technological arts\\" to satisfy the requirements of . They must, however, produce a concrete, useful and tangible result. As indicated above, however, In re Bilski supersedes that legal test (as to the \\"useful, concrete, and tangible\\" test). The Bilski majority opinion also rejects the \\"technological arts\\" test, although three Federal Circuit judges (Mayer, dissenting, and Dyk and Linn, concurring) stated that they considered being technological an indispensable condition of patent-eligibility. On May 22, 2019, in Washington D.C. a bipartisan, bicameral draft bill that would reform Section 101 of the Patent Act was released. It was proposed by the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and its Ranking Member, Senator Chris Coons (D-DE). They were joined by the House of Representatives Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Hank Johnson (D-GA-4), the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and the Courts, and Representative Steve Stivers (R-OH-15) The proposal was released prior to a round-table the Senators and Representatives were holding the following day and intended to solicit feedback. Introduction of a bill has been delayed by lack of agreement among stakeholders such as the American Bar Association's IP law section, the IP Owner's Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association and BIO.Malathi Nayak, IP Groups Developing Fresh Patent Eligibility Bill Proposal (2), Bloomberg Law, Oct. 17, 2019 Abstract ideas and patent-eligibility for computer- implemented inventions  The Alice Supreme Court reduced the patent- eligibility of software patents or patents on software for business methods, excluding abstract ideas from the list of eligible subject matters. After much confusion within the patent examiners and patent practitioners, the USPTO prepared a list of examples of software patent claims that are deemed patent- eligible or not. The algorithm exception and the patent-eligibility trilogy  The exception to patenting algorithms arose out of three Supreme Court cases commonly referred to as the \\"Supreme Court Trilogy\\" or \\"patent- eligibility trilogy\\". This is a designation for three Supreme Court cases (Gottschalk v. Benson, Parker v. Flook, and Diamond v. Diehr) decided within a decade on whether, and in what circumstances, a claimed invention was within the scope of the US patent system (that is, was eligible to be considered for a patent grant). The three cases of the trilogy can be harmonized on the basis of when a claimed implementation of an idea or principle is old or departs from the prior art in only a facially trivial way, the claim is patent- ineligible (as Nielson and Morse said, and Flook reaffirmed, it must be treated as if in the prior art). =Gottschalk v. Benson= The invention in this case was a method of programming a general-purpose digital computer using an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers. The Supreme Court noted that phenomena of nature, mental processes and abstract intellectual concepts were not patentable, since they were the basic tools of scientific and technological work. However, new and useful inventions derived from such discoveries are patentable. The Court found that the discovery in Benson was unpatentable since the invention, an algorithm, was no more than abstract mathematics. Despite this holding, the Court emphasized that its decision did not preclude computer software from being patented, but rather precluded the patentability of software where the only useful characteristic was an algorithm. The Court further noted that validating this type of patent would foreclose all future use of the algorithm in question. Therefore, like the traditional exceptions to patentable subject matter, the purpose of the algorithm exception was to encourage development of new technologies by not granting patents that would preclude others from using abstract mathematical principles. =Parker v. Flook= The invention in this case was a method of calculating alarm limits by using a \\"smoothing algorithm\\" to make the system responsive to trends but not momentary fluctuations in process variables (such as temperature). Because it was conceded that the implementation of the algorithm was conventional, the Court found that the inventor did not even purport to have invented anything on which a patent could be granted.See Flook, 437 U.S. at 594. The Court did so on the basis of the principle that the nonstatutory subject matter (the algorithm) must be regarded as already in the prior art. Therefore, there was nothing left on which a patent could issue. In a case in which a patent was sought on an implementation of a principle (the algorithm), the implementation itself must be inventive for a patent to issue. Since that was not so, the Court held that the patent office had properly rejected Flook's claim to a patent. The Court relied on the decision in Neilson v. Harford, an English case that the Supreme Court had relied upon in O'Reilly v. Morse, for the proposition that an idea or principle must be treated as if it were already in the prior art, irrespective of whether it was actually new or old.Lower court cases using this rule include Armour Pharm. Co. v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 396 F.2d 70, 74 (3d Cir.1968) (facially-trivial device-implementation of newly-discovered natural phenomenon); National Lead Co. v. Western Lead Co., 324 F.2d 539 (9th Cir.1963) (similar); Davison Chem. Corp. v. Joliet Chems., Inc., 179 F.2d 793 (7th Cir.1950) (similar); Loew's Drive-In Theatres v. Park- In Theatres, 174 F.2d 547 (1st Cir.1949). This approach is something like that of analytic dissection in computer-software copyright law, although its use in patent law preceded its use in copyright law by a century or more. =Diamond v. Diehr= In this case the Court backed away from the analytic dissection approach, and insisted that patent-eligibility must be decided on the basis of the claim (or invention) considered as a whole. The requirement of bypassing analytic dissection is found in the statute, but only for section 103 (governing obviousness or inventive step) and not for section 101 (governing patent-eligibility). Despite this difference in emphasis, however, Diehr can be harmonized with Flook and Benson, and the Diehr Court studiously avoided stating that Flook and Benson were overruled or limited. =Bilski v. Kappos= On June 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Bilski v. KapposBilski v. Kappos Supreme Court slip opinion that Bernard Bilski's patent application for a method of hedging the seasonal risks of buying energy is an abstract idea and is therefore unpatentable. However, it also said that business methods are not inherently unpatentable, and was silent on the subject of software patents. The majority opinion also said that the Federal Circuit's \\"machine or transformation\\" test, while useful, is not an exclusive test for determining the patentability of a process. Instead, the Supreme Court reviewed the \\"Supreme Court Trilogy\\" described above and said that future decisions should be grounded in the examples and concepts expressed in those opinions. As has been reported,Bilski v. Kappos: The Supreme Court Strikes a Blow for Inventors by Thomas Carey the decision leaves many questions unanswered, including the patentability of many medical diagnostic technologies and software. In May 2013, the Federal Circuit handed down an en banc decision in CLS Bank v. Alice applying the various concepts in the \\"Supreme Court Trilogy\\". The claims at issue were found unpatentable by a narrow margin, but the differences in positions of the various judges on the panel were dramatic and not definitive.http://www.natlawreview.com/article/cls-bank-v-alice-chasing- rabbit-down-bilski-hole-re-patent-litigation =Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories= On March 20, 2012, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. Supreme Court slip opinion that a process patent, which Prometheus Laboratories had obtained for correlations between blood test results and patient health in determining an appropriate dosage of a specific medication for the patient, is not eligible for a patent because the correlation is a law of nature. The court reasoned ‚Äúthe steps in the claimed processes (aside from the natural laws themselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.‚Äù The decision has been criticized for conflating two separate patent law concepts (patent eligibility under Section 101 and obviousness for patentability under Section 103), and potentially invalidating many patents relating to the biotech, medical diagnostics and pharmaceutical industries. Others, such as the American Medical Association (AMA), praised the decision for invalidating patents that would have hampered the ability of physicians to provide quality patient care. Under Section 287(c) of the Patent Act, however, a claim of patent infringement cannot be maintained against a medical practitioner for performing a medical activity, or against a related health care entity with respect to such medical activity, unless the medical practitioner is working in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. =Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics= On June 13, 2013, the United States Supreme Court in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics held that patent claims directed to isolated DNA used for detecting a patient's genetic propensity of contracting breast cancer were not patentable subject matter. =Diamond v. Chakrabarty= On June 16, 1980, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that a living non-naturally genetically modified bacterium is patent eligible as a composition of matter under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101, which provides for the issuance of a patent to a person who invents or discovers \\"any\\" new and useful \\"manufacture\\" or \\"composition of matter.\\"Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980).35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 (1952). As a result of the ruling, the patented invention included claims drawn to a non-naturally occurring bacterium that was genetically modified to be capable of degrading hydrocarbons. This ruling set the precedent for animate material as patentable subject matter.Howe, Kevin F., \\"The right to obtain patent protection on living material: the causes and consequences of the United States Supreme Court decision in the case of Diamond v. Chakrabarty\\" (2007). Retrospective Theses and Dissertations. 15033. (See Abstract). = Japan = Legal controversies  The question of what should and should not be patentable subject matter has spawned a number of battlegrounds in recent years, setting against each other those in each area supporting patentability, claiming that patents would cause increased innovation and public good, against opponents with views that patentability is being sought only for private good but would do public harm. Flashpoints have included the patenting of naturally occurring biological material, genetic sequences, stem cells, \\"traditional knowledge,\\" programs for computers, and business methods. In March 2010, a federal district court judge in the Southern District of New York ruled against Myriad Genetics and in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union that purified DNA sequences and the inventions using them are unpatentable.Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Court decision. As has been discussed,\\"Federal Judge Would Invalidate All DNA Patents, But His Rationale Is Controversial\\" by Justin P. Huddleson and Bruce Sunstein Judge Sweet relied entirely upon Supreme Court precedent and ignored contrary case law of the Federal Circuit Court of AppealsIn re Duel, 51 F3d 1552(Fed Cir 1995); In re Bell, 991 F.2d 781 (Fed Cir. 1993). to conclude that isolated DNA is of the same fundamental quality as natural DNA and is thus unpatentable under section 101 of the Patent Act; and that the method claims of the patents were abstract mental processes that were also unpatentable. His rationale was controversial and his ruling was appealed to the Federal Circuit.Federal District Court Rules Isolated DNA Claims are Not Patentable: Myriad to Appeal Decision to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals The appeal court reversed the ruling deciding that isolated DNA had a \\"markedly different chemical structure\\" from other human genetic material. In 2013 The US Supreme Court partly reversed the decision again deciding that DNA was not patentable, Justice Antonin Scalia writing \\"the portion of the DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state\\". However, the Supreme Court also decided that complementary DNA can be patented because it is not naturally occurring. When the news was announced ACLU welcomed the decision and Myriad Genetics share prices rose. In October 2015, the High Court of Australia ruled against Myriad Genetics, holding that a mutated gene associated with susceptibility to breast cancer cannot give rise to a patentable invention under Australian law.D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc [2015] HCA 35 (7 October 2015) AustLII  See also  * Computer programs and the Patent Cooperation Treaty * Software patents under the European Patent Convention * Software patents under TRIPs Agreement * Software patents under United Kingdom patent law  References and notes  Further reading  * Peter Mole, Economics, ethics and the subject-matter definition of the EPC, The CIPA Journal, April 2003 * Justine Pila, The Requirement for an Invention in Patent Law, Oxford University Press, 2010, * Emir Crowne, The Utilitarian Fruits Approach to Justifying Patentable Subject Matter (June 19, 2011).

Harry Altham wrote of him in A History of Cricket, \\"Maurice Read had been recognised as a dashing player up to Test Match form, to say nothing of being a wonderful fielder in the country.\\" A hard-hitting and, according to Lord Hawke, \\"magnificent batsman who never had pretensions to be even a moderate change bowler\\", Read did little bowling except in 1883, when he claimed 27 first-class wickets including his career best of 6‚Äì41 against Kent. Born in 1859 in Thames Ditton, Surrey, Read joined the Thames Ditton Cricket Club in 1879, made his first- class debut for Surrey in 1880, and played regularly for his county for fifteen years. His most productive year was 1886, when he scored 1,364 runs at an average of 34.97, including two centuries and seven fifties. He was also extremely productive in the first half of 1889, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1890, but his season was affected later in the year by a bad finger injury. Test debut and career Read made his debut in the Oval (his home ground) Test Match against Australia in 1882, the match famous for bringing about the Ashes. According to the Manchester Guardian, Read's selection \\"was admittedly something of an experiment. He has played two or three lucky innings lately, but these do not make a cricketer any more than two or three swallows make a summer.\\" A week or so prior the Test, however, Read had shared in a 158-run partnership against the tourists with fellow professional and England player Billy Barnes. Read finished on 130 and, like most of his team-mates, went into the match in good form. In England's first innings, the local boy was cheered all the way to the middle by an avid Oval crowd. Fred Spofforth, however, soon walloped the hero three excruciating blows ‚Äî one in the ribs, another on the knee and one more on the elbow. Read was compelled to hold up the game on two of these occasions to take time to convalesce, and it was, by all reports, an exceptionally valiant knock. Read finished unbeaten on nineteen, the second-best score of the innings, and the masses cheered him all the way back to the pavilion. There are copious examples in this match which serve to support Altham's affirmation that Read was \\"a wonderful fielder in the country\\" (i.e. outfield). He is frequently recorded in contemporary accounts of the game as chasing the ball down as fast as he could, and he certainly managed to bring to a halt plenty of potential Australian boundaries. In the second innings, Read was one of the many victims of England captain Monkey Hornby's spectacular alteration of the batting order, promoted in front of the apparently nerveless CT Studd. When he came into view from the pavilion, Read was again cheered stridently all the way to the wicket, but, when Spofforth bowled him for a duck, the Australians were the ones, wrote Charles Pardon in Bell's Life, who \\"exhibited to the full their increasing delight\\". This was the game which launched the legend of The Ashes after the Australians won by seven runs. When he came back to Australia in 1886/87, Read was flabbergasted at the pickiness of the Australian public, and he wrote of it: \\"If you have a bit of bad luck and make nothing two or three times, you are not of much account in Australia, and out of the team you should go, even if you have scored excellently on occasions.\\" In England, however, it was different. \\"There,\\" he reckoned, \\"if you are a recognised player, half a dozen successive noughts will not exclude you from a team.\\" Read remained a regular selection for England until 1893, being awarded that year's Oval Test (against South Africa) as a benefit. Although his batting at this level was not spectacular ‚Äì he passed fifty only twice in his 29 Test innings ‚Äì his fielding at third man was excellent. He also appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen on 17 occasions. Read and Lohmann George Lohmann, for one, preferred watching Read (and even AE Stoddart) to Arthur Shrewsbury, the man whom WG Grace placed second only to himself. Indeed, Read and Lohmann were extremely good friends, and they even shared a few personal jokes. (\\"Look out!\\" Lohmann would say to Read; \\"I'm going to bowl at the sticks now!\\"‚Äîand Read would watch with amusement as his comrade sent down all manner of strange deliveries to tempt the batsman into hitting out.) Read was sent along to South Africa with Lohmann in 1892 to be of assistance to the great bowler in his recuperation following a ghastly (but altogether foreseeable) physical collapse as a result of overbowling. The pair sailed from Southampton on Christmas Eve, and, in March 1893, when Lohmann was healthy enough to be left on his own, Read made his homecoming for the start of the new season. (Lohmann later broke down again, however, eventually dying in South Africa.) Incidentally, another colleague of Read's who suffered the effects of being overbowled was Tom Richardson, a Surrey and Thames Ditton team-mate. Read was one of the first to forecast what would eventually happen to this great fast bowler, conjecturing ominously about the strenuous effects that the 1897/98 tour might have on Richardson's body. He was, of course, proven correct. Career's end After scoring 131 to help Surrey defeat Hampshire by an innings in 1895, Read retired from first-class cricket at the age of 36 ‚Äì relatively young by 19th century standards ‚Äì to work on the Tichborne Park estate in Hampshire, although he continued to bat with great success in minor cricket for the Tichborne side for some years thereafter, scoring hundreds in successive weekends in 1921 (v Martyn Worthey and Kilmeston) He died at the age of 70 in Winchester after a long illness. George Giffen called him \\"one of the most genuine cricketers I met\\". Read's uncle (by marriage) Heathfield Stephenson had a long career with Surrey, and his brother Frederick Read also played one first-class game for the county.

A kite shield is a large, almond-shaped shield rounded at the top and curving down to a point or rounded point at the bottom. The term \\"kite shield\\" is a reference to the shield's unique shape, and is derived from its supposed similarity to a flying kite, although \\"leaf-shaped shield\\" and \\"almond shield\\" have also been used in recent literature. Since the most prominent examples of this shield have appeared on the Bayeux Tapestry, the kite shield has become closely associated with Norman warfare. History The first known illustration of a kite shield appeared in the Gospels of Otto III, made between 983 and 991, indicating it was in use with Western European armies by the late tenth century. The shield was developed for mounted cavalry, and its dimensions correlate to the approximate space between a horse's neck and its rider's thigh. A narrow bottom protected the rider's left leg, and the pronounced upper curve, the rider's shoulder and torso. This was a vast improvement over more common circular shields, such as bucklers, which afforded poor protection to the horseman's left flank, especially when he was charging with a lance. Though their great length and unwieldy nature made them cumbersome and inconvenient for foot soldiers, kite shields nevertheless gained popularity, spreading throughout Western Europe during the 1000s. In the Bayeux Tapestry, most of the English are depicted on foot with kite shields, while a minority still use round shields. Aside from Normandy, they also appeared early on in parts of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. It is unclear from which of these three regions the design originated. A common theory is that the kite shield was inherited by the Normans from their Viking predecessors. However, no documentation or remains of kite shields from the Viking era have been discovered, and they were not ideally suited to the Vikings' highly mobile light infantry. Kite shields were depicted primarily on eleventh century illustrations, largely in Western Europe and the Byzantine Empire, but also in the Caucasus, the Fatimid Caliphate, and among the Kievan Rus'. For example, an eleventh century silver engraving of Saint George recovered from Bochorma, Georgia, depicts a kite shield, as do other isolated pieces of Georgian art dating to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Kite shields also appear on the Bab al-Nasr in Cairo, which was constructed around 1087. Arab historians usually described them as tariqa or januwiyya. Around the mid to late twelfth century, traditional kite shields were largely replaced by a variant in which the top was flat, rather than rounded. This change made it easier for a soldier to hold the shield upright without limiting his field of vision. Flat-topped kite shields were later phased out by most Western European armies in favour of much smaller, more compact heater shields. However, they were still being carried by Byzantine infantrymen well into the thirteenth century. Construction To compensate for their awkward nature, kite shields were equipped with enarmes, which gripped the shield tightly to the arm and facilitated keeping it in place even when a knight relaxed his arm; this was a significant departure from most earlier circular shields, which possessed only a single handle. Some examples were apparently also fitted with an additional guige strap that allowed the shield to be slung over one shoulder when not in use. Byzantine soldiers frequently carried kite shields on their backs, sometimes upside down. At the time of the First Crusade, most kite shields were still fitted with a domed metal centrepiece (shield boss), although the use of enarmes would have rendered them unnecessary. It is possible that shields may have been fitted with both enarmes and an auxiliary hand grip. A typical kite shield was at least three feet high, being constructed of laminated wood, stretched animal hide, and iron components. Records from Byzantium in the 1200s suggests that the shield frame accounted for most of the wood and iron; its body was constructed out of hide, parchment, or hardened leather, similar to the material used on drum faces.

His father, William White, a member of the Nonconformist community of the Bunyan Meeting, became well known as a doorkeeper at the House of Commons and wrote sketches of parliamentary life for the Illustrated Times. A selection of his parliamentary sketches was published posthumously, in 1897, by Justin McCarthy, the Irish nationalist MP, as The Inner Life of the House of Commons.William White, The Inner Life of the House of Commons, edited with a preface by Justin McCarthy, MP, London, T.

There he was trained for the Congregational ministry, but the development of his views prevented his taking up that career; the same unconventional views got him expelled from New College, London, and he eventually became a clerk at the Admiralty. In 1861 he began writing newspaper articles to increase his income, having met and married Harriet Arthur and started a family. He had already served an apprenticeship to journalism before he made his name, or rather his pen name, \\"Mark Rutherford\\", famous with three novels, supposedly edited by one Reuben Shapcott: The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford (1881), Mark Rutherford's Deliverance (1885) and The Revolution in Tanner's Lane (1887).Max Saunders, \\"Autobiografiction,\\" Times Literary Supplement (3 October 2008), 13-15.

Hale White died in Groombridge on 14 March 1913. There is now a Mark Rutherford School in Bedford and a blue plaque commemorates White at 19 Park Hill in Carshalton.

In 1907, the widowed White met aspiring novelist Dorothy Smith, who was forty-five years his junior. They fell in love and were married three and a half years later, but enjoyed only two years of married life before his death.

They were mainly done in Australia in the 1970s, led by the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) and used to protect parkland, low- income housing and buildings with historical significance. Background Green bans were first conducted in Australia in the 1970s by the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). Green bans were never instigated unilaterally by the BLF, all green bans were at the request of, and in support of, residents' groups. The first green ban was put in place to protect Kelly's Bush, the last remaining undeveloped bushland in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. A group of local women who had already appealed to the local council, mayor, and the Premier of New South Wales, approached the BLF for help. The BLF asked the women to call a public meeting, which was attended by 600 residents, and formally asked the BLF to prevent construction on the site. The developer, A V Jennings, announced that they would use non-union labour as strikebreakers. In response, BLF members on other A V Jennings construction projects stopped work. A V Jennings eventually abandoned all plans to develop Kelly's Bush. Jack Mundey summarised the philosophy of the Green Bans as such: > \\"Yes, we want to build. However, we prefer to build urgently-required > hospitals, schools, other public utilities, high-quality flats, units and > houses, provided they are designed with adequate concern for the > environment, than to build ugly unimaginative architecturally-bankrupt > blocks of concrete and glass offices... Though we want all our members > employed, we will not just become robots directed by developer-builders who > value the dollar at the expense of the environment. More and more, we are > going to determine which buildings we will build... The environmental > interests of three million people are at stake and cannot be left to > developers and building employers whose main concern is making profit. > Progressive unions, like ours, therefore have a very useful social role to > play in the citizens' interest, and we intend to play it.\\" The BLF was involved in many more green bans. Not only did the BLF represent all unionised builders' labourers in the construction industry; but the BLF also influenced the opinion of other unionised construction workers, and acted as a political leadership of the construction unions in the era. Fifty-four bans were imposed in NSW between 1971 and 1974. Green bans helped to protect historic nineteenth century buildings in The Rocks from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the Royal Botanic Gardens from being turned into a carpark for the Sydney Opera House. The BLF stopped conducting green bans in 1974 after the federal leadership under Norm Gallagher dismissed the leaders of the New South Wales branch. One of the last bans to be removed was to prevent development of Victoria Street in the suburb of Potts Point. This ban involved hundreds of residents, trade union members, and other activists and was successful for a number of years, despite facing a well- connected developer who employed thugs to harass residents. Arthur King, the head of the residents' action group, was kidnapped in 1973. It was suspected, though never proved, that the men who kidnapped him had been hired by the property developer, Frank Theeman. The New South Wales Police collaborated with Theeman and his employees during the ban and eventually carried out a forced mass eviction of squatters and residents, which saw squatters barricade themselves in a siege for 2 days. The green ban was broken in 1974 when the conservative federal leadership of the BLF, under pressure from New South Wales politicians, dismissed the leaders of the New South Wales branch, and replaced them with more conservative people who did not support the ban. Activists, led by activist, resident, and journalist Juanita Nielsen, then convinced another union, the Water Board Employees Union, to impose a ban which was continued for some time. Nielsen was then kidnapped and murdered in 1975. The struggle ended with a stand-off in 1977. The developer had been forced to alter his plans, but the residents had been forced out. Although green bans have been implemented on a number of occasions since the 1970s, they have not been so prevalent, nor so comprehensive in their effect. One estimate of the effect of the BLF's green bans puts the amount of development prevented at A$3 billion between 1971 and 1974 (approximately A$25 billion ). Outcomes and impacts In February 1973, Jack Mundey coined the term \\"green ban\\" to distinguish them from the traditional union \\"black bans\\". Mundey argued that the term \\"green ban\\" was more appropriate as they were in defence of the environment. Green bans saved many vital urban spaces and over 100 buildings were considered by the National Trust to be worthy of preservation. Another example of a green ban in Sydney was the proposed North-Western Expressway that was planned by the Department of Main Roads in the early 1970s. The expressway would have cut through the working class residential areas of Ultimo, Glebe, Annandale, Rozelle and Leichhardt. In July 1972, the Save Lyndhurst Committee requested a green ban from the Builders Labourers' Federation to prevent the destruction of historic Lyndhurst (built 1833-1835) in Darghan Street, Glebe. Many battles with police took place, including a confrontation between police and squatters on 18 August 1972. The Federal Labor Whitlam Government purchased the Glebe estate in 1973 from the Anglican Diocese of Glebe to preserve the area. In 1978, the Wran-Labor Government decided to abandon much of the inner-urban expressway link and the 19th century character of Glebe remains intact. =Local legacies: New South Wales= Green bans influenced local NSW planning structures as well as national planning systems. \\"The Green ban movement in Sydney and Melbourne of the early 1970s, led by the Builder Labourers Federation, was the most profound external indication of the need for planning reform.\\" In 1977 an editorial from the Australian quoted \\"bans were an inevitable result of official attitudes which regarded people as irrelevant factors to development\\". He also indicated that the decision making process then was devoid of appropriate involvement by relevant communities and individuals. During the movement infamous redevelopment projects were discarded or scale down, and the planning reform finally began. The previously confined approach to land use planning, due to a \\"paradigm meltdown\\", started to incorporate concerns from community. On one hand, new historical buildings legislations were founded in the 1970s across several states, and on the other the ground legislation of the current planning system =National reforms: Australia= The green bans in the 1970s initiated a democratic National and State planning systems in which heritage as well as environmentally significant sites became a part of a development proposal. 'In 1997 the Director of the Urban Research Unit of the Australian National University, stated that the green bans of the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation (NSW BLF) had a \\"subtle influence\\" in transforming the culture of urban planning in ways that now evince greater sensitivity to environmental concerns, better appreciation of heritage, the need to publicise proposed developments well in advance and to seek approval from the people affected'. Similar union bans were started in other cities in Australia including Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra and Hobart however to a lesser level than Sydney. The green ban movement became a powerful tool of influencing city developments by involving the wider community to sign petitions in order to prevent destruction of a heritage or environmentally significant sites. Ultimately, the green bans led to the Wran government introducing two acts, Firstly the Heritage legislation- The Heritage Act 1977 and secondly Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (EP&A;) 1979. =International influences= Although green bans were conducted for only three to four years in Australia, they influenced international politics significantly because this movement is considered to have contributed to the integration of the word \\"green\\" into the world's political idioms. The German politician Petra Kelly came to Australia around the middle of the 1970s and witnessed green bans opposing undesirable development in Sydney by the cooperation between the BLF and local citizens. She was very impressed with this movement, the connection accomplished between environmentalists and the BLF, and the success they made in many campaigns. It is also known that she often stated that green bans had a great impact on both herself and her philosophy. Subsequently, she brought back the idea of green bans as well as the terminology \\"green\\" to Germany, and established the German Green Party in 1979. This is regarded as the point at which the word \\"green\\" was first applied to politics in Europe. Petra Kelly acknowledged that Australian green bans broadened the possibilities of the environmental movement as well as gave it a new dimension, and they made it possible to involve a much broader range of the population in environmental groups and ecological actions. Therefore, green bans in Australia were significant events not only locally and nationally but also internationally.

It operated from 1981 to 1983 with financial support from the State of California. It was the first overnight service between the two cities since the Southern Pacific Railroad discontinued the Lark in 1968 and one of few state-supported Amtrak trains with sleeper service. The train used the Southern Pacific's Coast Line, complementing the Coast Starlight which served the route on a daytime schedule.  History  The last overnight service on the Southern Pacific's Coast Line was the Lark, which ended on April 8, 1968. During the 1970s Amtrak operated the Coast Starlight, which departed Los Angeles every morning for Seattle, Washington. The southbound Coast Starlight arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area in the morning and in Los Angeles by dinnertime, and at the time did not serve Sacramento, the state capital. The new train departed Los Angeles at 8:25 PM, arriving in Sacramento at 9:30 AM the next morning. The southbound train departed at 7:55 PM and arrived at 9:00 AM the next day. The California Department of Transportation, Caltrans, budgeted $1.7 million towards the train's first year of operation and expected 160,000 passengers the first year, rising to 300,000 in five years. The train carried coaches, a cafe, and two sleeping cars. Service began on October 25, 1981. Caltrans held a naming contest, with the winner \\"Spirit of California\\" announced on December 24. After taking office in January 1983, Governor George Deukmejian cut funding for the train, and Amtrak supporters scrambled to find additional funding. It was proposed that the state of Nevada fund the train for service to Reno, but this proposal was never passed by the Nevada legislature.

Two matches were played in 1806, but the fixture was not repeated until 1819. Thereafter it was played most years between 1819 and 1962, typically twice each summer. The distinction between the two teams arose from the English class structure of the 19th century: originally the Players were working class cricketers who earned their living through the game, whilst the Gentlemen were middle- and upper-class, usually products of the public school system, who played cricket for leisure. Whereas the Players were paid wages by their county clubs or fees by match organisers, the Gentlemen nominally only claimed expenses. Rules to distinguish amateurs from professionals were established by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The system of allowable expenses was controversial; some leading amateurs were paid more for playing cricket than any professional. The fixture struggled to gain public interest during the mid-19th century, as the Players often easily defeated the Gentlemen. Various efforts to improve competitiveness were tried, including different-sized wickets for each team and a system of 'given men', in which the Players would loan one or more of their best players to the Gentlemen. These were generally unsuccessful, with the Players continuing to win most matches. The fixtures became more competitive and gained prestige in the late 1800s, coinciding with the career of W. G. Grace, who played for the Gentlemen with great success. During the period 1860‚Äì1914, the fixture was seen as one of the highlights of the cricket season. The increasing popularity of international Test cricket (which began in 1877) saw interest in Gentlemen v Players begin to decline, a process accelerated by the weakening of the social class system in the 20th century. After the Second World War, the concepts of amateurism and selecting teams based on social class were seen as increasingly anachronistic. In 1963, the MCC abolished amateur status, causing all first-class cricketers to become professionals. As the official distinction between the teams no longer existed, the Gentlemen v Players fixture was discontinued. No direct substitute was implemented, instead England's first domestic one day cricket competition began that summer. A total of 274 Gentlemen v Players matches were held from 1806‚Äì1962, with the Players winning 125 and the Gentlemen 68; there were 80 draws and one tie. History Gentlemen, captained by W. G. Grace, versus Players at Lord's, 1899 At its height from the 1860s until 1914, the fixture was a prestigious one, though in terms of quality it fell far short of Test matches and even of the rival North v. South fixture. Until the 1860s, the Gentlemen teams were often very weak compared with the professionals, and on occasion the fixture had to be arranged on an odds basis, so that the Players eleven took on a greater number of Gentlemen. The Gentlemen famously became competitive during the career of W. G. Grace, whose performances were so outstanding that the Gentlemen could enjoy some long-awaited success. The fixture often confirmed the commonly held view of an imbalance between amateur and professional in that amateurs tended to be batsmen first and foremost, hence there were few good amateur bowlers. The Players could nearly always field a strong bowling side. The game was played over three days on all but a handful of occasions throughout its history. The most frequent venue for the match was Lord's, but a number of other grounds were used, notably The Oval and Scarborough, and it was at Scarborough that the last Gentlemen v Players game was played, in September 1962. The same format of amateurs playing professionals was used in a number of other fixtures, some of which were given first-class status (for example, \\"Gentlemen of Nottinghamshire v Players of Nottinghamshire\\"), but these matches became less common after the beginning of the 20th century, and the last such game was \\"Gentlemen of the South v Players of the South\\" in 1920, after which all first-class Gentlemen v Players matches were between teams known simply by those names. The Gentlemen v Players series ended after the 1962 season, when the distinction between amateur and professional players was abolished. Charles Williams has described several reports on the subject which were submitted to MCC by its Amateur Status Standing Committee (ASSC) and, on 31 January 1963, the MCC committee unanimously agreed to abolish amateurism. Williams says a substitute fixture was sought but it was decided not to pursue this as the new Gillette Cup limited overs competition was beginning in 1963. There were contrasting views about the end of amateurism and the passing of Gentlemen v Players. Some traditionalists like E. W. Swanton and the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack \\"lamented the passing of an era\\" but social change had rendered the whole concept an anachronism and Fred Trueman spoke for many when he summarised amateurism as a \\"ludicrous business\\" that was \\"thankfully abolished\\" after the 1962 season.Trueman, Ball of Fire, p.57. =First matches= The inaugural fixture was a three-day match at the original Lord's ground from 7 to 9 July 1806. It was soon followed by the second, held on the same ground from 21 to 25 July. In the first match, the Gentlemen played with two \\"given men\\" and these were the two outstanding professionals of the day, Billy Beldham and William Lambert. Lambert made a significant contribution with the bat and the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. For the return, the Gentlemen retained Lambert. Beldham played for the Players. The Gentlemen won a low-scoring game by 82 runs and Lambert was again a significant factor, although the leading amateur Lord Frederick Beauclerk made two good scores. A curiosity of these matches is that they featured the veteran professional Tom Walker and the rookie amateur John Willes. These are the two players both credited with devising the roundarm style of bowling, but there is no evidence to suggest they used roundarm in 1806. Described by H. S. Altham as the \\"most famous of all domestic matches\\", the fixture disappeared until 1819. Altham says he does not know why but the Napoleonic Wars must have been a factor as cricket was in decline from 1810 until after Waterloo in 1815. In 1819, the amateurs agreed to play the professionals on equal terms but lost by six wickets. There was only one run between the sides on first innings but the Gentlemen collapsed in the second against the bowling of Tom Howard and John Sherman to be all out for only 60. This match was held at the \\"new\\" Lord's ground, the present one, which had opened in 1814. The fourth match was played at Lord's in June 1820 and the Gentlemen, now with star bowler Howard as a given man, won by 70 runs. The fifth match earned notoriety. It was scheduled to be played at Lord's from 23 to 25 July 1821 but ended on the second day after the Gentlemen conceded. Known as the \\"Coronation Match\\" because it celebrated the accession of the unpopular George IV it was described by Derek Birley as \\"a suitably murky affair\\". The Gentlemen had batted first and were quickly dismissed for 60. Then they had to spend a long time in the field through most of the first and second days while the Players steadily built a big lead. At 270 for six, the Gentlemen decided to \\"give up\\" and the match ended. =Odds on= After this, the fixture struggled for many years to regain credibility. In twelve of the fourteen matches played from 1824 to 1837, the Players were handicapped, usually by the Gentlemen having extra men. In one match the Gentlemen had eighteen and in two more seventeen. In 1832, the Gentlemen defended a smaller- than-normal wicket of 22 by 6 inches and in 1837, in what became known as the \\"Barn Door Match\\", the Players defended an outsize wicket of four stumps measuring 36 by 12 inches. The tide turned somewhat in the 1840s when Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix were playing for the amateurs. In nine equal terms matches from 1842 to 1849, the Gentlemen won six against two for the Players and one drawn. That run of success ended and, apart from a solitary victory in 1853 and one draw in 1862, the Gentlemen lost every one of the next 25 games up to July 1865. =The halcyon days of amateur cricket= According to Harry Altham, the period from about 1860 into the 1880s were the \\"halcyon days of amateur cricket\\". This refers in part to the success of cricketers who came through the public schools and universities in the period but in the main to the achievements of Gentlemen teams who won 27 matches against the Players whilst losing only five. The key figure in this remarkable turnaround was W. G. Grace. Altham says that \\"the pendulum of power\\" had swung in the amateur direction and \\"never again was it found pointing so unequivocally to (amateur supremacy)\\". =Final years= Social change after the Second World War led to a reaction against the concept of amateurism in English cricket and in 1963 all first-class cricketers became nominally professional as, in effect, \\"Players\\". The last edition of the fixture was played 8, 10 and 11 September 1962 at Scarborough, with the Gentlemen captained by Mike Smith (Ted Dexter was originally appointed as captain, but was forced to withdraw due to illness) and Fred Trueman captaining the Players. The Players won the game by 7 wickets. The events leading to the abolition of amateurism are described by Charles Williams in his book, Gentlemen & Players, appropriately subtitled The Death of Amateurism in Cricket.

Alter was 13 when he began playing piano in theaters showing silent films. He studied at the New England Conservatory of Music under the tutelage of Stuart Mason. Biography He was born on June 18, 1902, in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Alter played in vaudeville houses as the accompanist for headliners Ir√®ne Bordoni and Nora Bayes. He appeared with Bayes from 1924 until her death in 1928, touring the United States and abroad.Laurie, Joe, Jr. Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace. New York: Henry Holt, 1953. pp. 326‚Äì7. Since he had previously written some songs for Broadway shows, Alter decided to concentrate on songwriting after Bayes' death. His first hit was \\"Manhattan Serenade\\" (1929), originally an instrumental that later became the theme music of the Easy Aces radio program. There are numerous recordings of \\"Manhattan Serenade,\\" and it was featured prominently in Nancy Groce's book, New York: Songs of the City (Watson- Guptill, 1999). Alter recalled: :I was a great fan of Whiteman when I first came down here from Boston. He was the first big name I actually followed around and met. I was having a love affair with New York when Whiteman commissioned me to write a tone poem. I walked around this city for six months absorbing the sights and sounds. And then suddenly it came to me. Once I plunged into it I finished it in two hours.Automatic Musical Instrument Collectors Association, April 1975. Films and Broadway In 1929, Alter moved to Hollywood, where he wrote songs for films, beginning with The Hollywood Review of 1929, and he continued to provide piano accompaniment for various singers, including Beatrice Lillie and Helen Morgan. His contributions to Broadway musicals included songs in Sweet and Low (1930) and Ballyhoo (1931). His first song hit was \\"Hugs and Kisses\\" in 1926. In 1928, Alter composed the music and wrote the lyrics of Paris (1928 musical). Other top tunes by Alter include \\"My Kinda Love,\\" \\"You Turned the Tables on Me,\\" \\"Nina Never Knew,\\" \\"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans\\" (for the 1947 film New Orleans), \\"Blue Shadows\\" and \\"Rainbow on the River.\\" He wrote \\"A Melody from the Sky\\" and \\"Twilight on the Trail\\" for The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936). His collaborators included Oscar Hammerstein II, Charlotte Kent, Raymond Klages, Sidney D. Mitchell, and Jo Trent. World War II and later years In 1941, Alter signed on with the United States Air Force, performing for troops and also coordinating shows and other entertainment at various West Coast air bases. As a piano soloist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he performed at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1942, \\"Manhattan Serenade\\" once again became a hit after Harold Adamson added lyrics. Alter also composed large- scale pieces for piano and orchestra, including American Serenade and Metropolitan Nocturne. In later years, Alter lived in New York and maintained a summer residence on Fire Island. Awards Twice nominated for Academy Awards (\\"Dolores,\\" \\"A Melody from the Sky\\"), he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975. Death He died on November 5, 1980 at age 78, of pneumonia at Saint Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Hurricane Katrina After Hurricane Katrina, his song \\"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans\\" took on a different kind of meaning in 2005‚Äì06 and experienced a revival due to its use in various post-Katrina documentary films and TV shows. It was used for strong emotional effect in Spike Lee's four-hour When the Levees Broke (2006) and an equally moving dramatic sketch by Billy Crystal on HBO's Comic Relief 2006.

The stadium is home to Harlequins rugby union team, who play in the Gallagher Premiership. The stadium has a capacity of 14,800 and is situated just across the road from Twickenham Stadium. History=Harlequins before the Stoop= In 1906, Harlequins were invited by the Rugby Football Union to use the new national stadium in Twickenham. In those early days, only one or two internationals were played there during the season, and it wasn't long before the RFU ground became the headquarters of the Harlequin Football Club. =Early days= In 1963, the Quins acquired an athletics ground with 14 acres (57,000 m2) just across the road from the RFU ground, which became the Harlequins training pitch. The ground was named the \\"Stoop Memorial Ground\\" after Adrian Stoop, a former England international, longtime Harlequins player, and club president. In 2005, the club renamed the stadium \\"Twickenham Stoop Stadium\\", but it is generally known as \\"The Stoop\\" with even the Harlequins' official website frequently using the informal name. =The stadium today= Twickenham Stadium (bottom left) and The Twickenham Stoop (top right)  IG Stand  Four Nations game between the Kangaroos and the Kiwis Constructed for the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season, the IG Stand (West Stand) is the Stoop's main stand, with a capacity of approximately 4,000. This stand has the changing rooms, a row of executive boxes across the top of the stand, a Members' Bar, the club's offices, toilets and a club shop. At the top of the stand under the roof there is also a scoreboard and a gantry where the television cameras populate.  DHL Stand  The Etihad Stand The DHL Stand (East Stand) has a capacity of approximately 4,000 and has a row of corporate boxes across the top. The East Stand was the first to be constructed as part of the 1997 redevelopment of The Stoop. A score board also hangs under the roof. The stand has toilets, the main public bar, Debenture Lounge and Players' Lounge. The area is also home to the \\"Mighty Quins Village\\" which is an area for children which consists of bouncy castle and face painting. The main public bar also has a stage where a live band performs after matches. South Stand Four Nations game between Australia and New Zealand The South Stand was opened for the 2009‚Äì10 season. It has new toilets, a real ale bar, the Quins Head, which sells Green King IPA and guest ales and a club shop. The back of the stand also has a clock for the match.  North Stand  The North Stand The North Stand is a temporary structure with an estimated life of 10 years, and is the most recent to be developed for the 2011‚Äì12 season. It houses approximately 2,000 and is the only stand with supporting pillars. There is a time clock to the top left of the stand. The corner of the North and IG Stand has a memorial for Nick Duncombe who was a promising scrum half for Harlequins and won two caps for England. He also played for the England Sevens team in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He died of meningitis in 2003. Redevelopment The ground's official name changed in July 2005 from the Stoop Memorial Ground to Twickenham Stoop Stadium. The club owns the ground freehold through its subsidiary Harlequin Estates (Twickenham) Limited. According to the 2012 annual report submitted by the club's operating company to Companies House, in 2010 external valuers placed the combined value of the land and buildings at ¬£27.19 million on a depreciated replacement cost basis. In an interview with the fans website on 23 April 2012, the Chief Executive, David Ellis confirmed that an architect has visited the club and given ideas on possible improvement and further expansion of The Stoop which will be further considered if Harlequins can sell out nine or ten games a season in comparison with the six games sold out in the 2011‚Äì12 season. David Ellis also said there are some immediate concerns for development such as increasing the size of the debenture lounge and the members bar. He also mentioned the queues for drinks at the bars are too long so that will be looked into as well. On 5 September 2012 Harlequins announced that they had begun a programme of significant investment in upgrading Twickenham Stoop Stadium. All four of the stands have been deep cleaned, this has included the installation of anti-roosting netting that features an unobtrusive fine mesh, secured high in the stands that will prevent damage to the seats and decking caused by the local pigeon population. Replacement of the broken or sun-bleached seating has also commenced and eventually all seating will be replaced block by block in a rolling programme over the coming seasons. The public areas of the stands, including the toilets, are also in the process of being decorated and upgraded. Four new turnstiles have been constructed at Gate 3 by the corner of the South and Etihad Stand to improve access and a new PA system to improve sound quality throughout the stadium. The hospitality facilities in the Etihad and LV= Stands have also undergone renovations and redecorations. Among the major improvements about to begin is the resurfacing of the North car park. =Current redevelopment plans= In November 2017, Harlequins unveiled plans to build a new state-of-the-art 25,000-seat stadium on the same Twickenham site. The project is being led by architects Populous, designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium ‚Äì the largest club stadium in London. The redevelopment is expected to cost in the region of ¬£50m. Concrete plans have not yet been released, and consultation with the local community and Richmond Council is currently ongoing. Rugby League St Helens in 2006 In 1995‚Äì96 and again from 1997 to 1999, the rugby league club, London Broncos, joined Harlequins at The Stoop, and they returned again in 2006‚Äì2013, becoming Harlequins RL. In 2006 the stadium held a Harlequins rugby union match and a Harlequins rugby league game on the same day. The rugby union match was played first, and in just a few hours the stadium was switched over for the Super League match. This involved changing field markings, advertising boardings and such. Between 2006 and 2011, The Stoop hosted the annual Rugby League Varsity Match between Oxford University and Cambridge University. On 24 October 2009 the ground hosted the second match of the 2009 Rugby League Four Nations between world champions New Zealand and defending tournament champions (in Tri-Nations mode), Australia which resulted in a 20-all draw, 12,360 people attended the game making it the largest rugby league crowd at the venue beating the 1997 World Club Championship match between the London Broncos and Canberra Raiders where 7,819 people attended. Women's International Rugby Union The ground played host to the final of the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup. In 2015, it began hosting what was intended to be an annual event in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. All matches were held at The Stoop except for the third-place match and Cup final, which were played at Twickenham Stadium. However, the Women's Sevens Series did not return to London for 2015‚Äì16. The Stoop has become a regular venue for England Women's games, hosting Six Nations games and Autumn International Series games. On 17 January 2016 The Stoop hosted the Women's Premiership final, for the first time. Concert venue In the Summer of 2017, The Stoop hosted its first music concerts, with the aim of diversifying the range of events hosted, establishing itself as a music venue, as well as sports. The Stoop has hosted artists such as Elton John and Little Mix.

Play modes include Free for All (Deathmatch), Team Match, Duel, Domination, and Mega Target. Players have three \\"health canisters\\", and every hit diminishes one of them. After three hits, the player counts as \\"dead\\" and has to respawn after a delay. The game is based on a heavily modified Quake engine,Game announcement \\"LaserArena Game\\", Shacknews, November 16, 2000Demo release \\"Laser Arena Demo\\", Shacknews, November 29, 2000LaserArena Enhanced Mod \\"Laser Arena Homebase\\", Playspoon', June 15th, 2011 and despite being a budget-title, features some elements that were unique at the time of release. For example, the game models \\"Lasertag Grenades\\" which emit a vast number of shots in all directions, tagging every player in the vicinity. The \\"Mega Target\\" game mode is rather novel in that it requires players to hit three targets strewn across the playing arena, before they are allowed to enter a \\"core\\" in which they shoot a final target to score a point. As an added element, automated defense turrets shoot at enemy players, and some can be converted to fight for your team by shooting at a sensor above the turret. This disables the turret for a few seconds and, if it's a convertible turret, makes it fight for your side until an enemy deactivates/converts it again. The game does not feature different weapons, instead the player can collect powerups that increase the firing rate or the hit damage (thus reducing an enemy's energy canisters by two instead of one) for a limited time. The graphics engine offers Glide, OpenGL, and software rendering. Multiplayer supports up to 8 players either competitively or against bots via LAN or GameSpy. Although not officially supported, the game is moddable, and a single mod named \\"LaserArena Enhanced\\" exists, improving textures and sounds as well as adding some useful keybinds that were not available in the original game.

The term refers to how many frames, on average, a group of pinsetters is able to operate without a stop, which is a malfunction or other condition which requires human assistance to fix the machine. The goal for a center is to maximize this value. A higher frames per stop leads to less work required for the pin chasers and mechanics as well as more satisfied customers who are not waiting for repairs. A typical goal value for frames per stop is 1500 (150 lines) while well maintained pinsetters can run 2000 or more frames per stop. The busiest bowling centers can easily fit 100 lines (1000 frames) per day per lane. Preventative maintenance can easily increase this value. There are many centers out there doing between 4 and even 5000 FPS because of many innovations, modifications that mechanics have come up with throughout the years, that have been came up with to retro fit onto older Pinsetters of either brand. Many of these innovations have turned into aftermarket parts that many good mechanics prefer to buy for these reasons. These altercations have boosted performance and overall labor spent on these machines to keep them running efficiently. Pin off spots (pins sliding off spot to a certain range when the ball hits them) and setup calls caused by late pin falls or a pin that stood back up at the right time can cause these kinds of stops. These particular stops are not Pinsetter malfunction stops, those are usually accounted for in overall frames per stop. Newer AMF machines have used the overall basic mechanics since they were originally introduced in the late 1940s. The newer brunswick design of modern Pinsetters has been changed in the mid 1980s. Newer high tech scoring systems and properly setup lane machines also play a big factor in overall Pinsetter frames per stop. It is trickier to determine frames per stop on string pinsetters (used in five pin and rubberband duckpin) as some mechanics will consider a string entanglement as a stop. String entanglement is very unpredictable and is often a function of the bowling skill level of those currently bowling. This is one big down fall to string machines verses free fall. Entanglement usually happens more frequently during league than during public bowling.

Early life Born in South Norwood, South London, Budd became interested in music at an early age and began to play the piano when he was two, initially by ear and then by copying various melodies he heard by listening to the radio. When he was six, two Austrian music experts visited him at home and after various tests, found that he had perfect pitch. In 1953, he made his public concert debut at the London Coliseum. By the age of eight, he could play the Wurlitzer organ and four years later he was appearing on television at the London Palladium. Although widely thought to be a self- taught pianist, he did also receive piano lessons from a lady called Mrs Sax who also lived in Mitcham. In 1950 and 1951 he featured on the Carroll Levis show on radio. Roy also won a talent competition on a television talent show hosted by Bert Weedon in 1952. He sang some Jerry Lee Lewis songs when he was eleven years old with his brother Peter and a friend at the Sutton Granada under the name The Blue Devils. He formed the Roy Budd Trio with bassist Peter McGurk and his cousin, drummer Trevor Tomkins before leaving school and embarking on a career as a jazz pianist. Roy later reformed the trio with Tony Archer or Jeff Clyne on bass and Chris Karan on drums. Clyne was later replaced by Pete Morgan, creating a line-up that was maintained until his death. Budd met composer Jack Fishman while working at the Bull's Head club in London. Fishman got him signed to Pye, which released his single \\"Birth of the Budd\\" in 1965 and his album Pick Yourself Up!! This Is Roy Budd in 1967. His first recording was \\"Birth of the Budd\\", a single recording. His first recorded LP was Pick Yourself Up on Pye issued in 1967 with Peter McGurk on bass with the orchestra and Dave Holland on bass on the four tracks featuring the trio without orchestra. Chris Karan was on drums and Tony Hatch and Johnny Harris arranged the orchestral tracks. In his sleeve notes, Hatch refers to seeing Budd on the David Frost show on television in February 1967 playing the Frank Loesser composition \\"I've Never Been in Love Before\\", which is on the album. Around that same time, he also recorded an album named simply Roy Budd featuring Ian Carr on trumpet, Dick Morrissey on tenor sax, Trevor Tomkins on drums, playing arrangements by fellow pianist Harry South. Film career In 1970, Budd made his film score d√©but for director Ralph Nelson, who was looking for an English composer for his western Soldier Blue. Budd recorded a tape of his own interpretation of music by composers Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Max Steiner, Dimitri Tiomkin and Lalo Schifrin. Apart from the main theme, which he based on Buffy Sainte-Marie's hit song of the same title, he composed all the music required for the film and conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which Nelson commissioned at the start of the film's production. In 1971, still in his early twenties, he composed one of his best known scores, the music for the film Get Carter. The film's budget reputedly allowed only ¬£450 for the score, but he overcame this restriction by using only three musicians, including himself playing electric piano and harpsichord simultaneously. In 1981 The Human League covered the film's theme on their album Dare. Also in 1971, Budd was asked by Nelson to compose the music to Flight of the Doves, and worked with Dana who sang the film's theme; and composed the scores for the adventure Kidnapped and the western Catlow. In 1972 he recorded the score to Fear Is the Key, which was based on the Alistair MacLean novel. Whilst recording the score, Budd was influenced by Ronnie Scott, Tubby Hayes and Kenny Baker, thus giving the music a jazz-sounding theme. Scott played the saxophone for the car chase sequence. Budd later worked for the producer Euan Lloyd on films, including Paper Tiger (1975), The Wild Geese (1978), The Sea Wolves (1980), Who Dares Wins (1982) and Wild Geese II (1985). Later career Budd's film work in the eighties included the scores for Mama Dracula (1980), Field of Honor (1986), and Picha's adult cartoons The Missing Link (1980) and The Big Bang (1987). Returning to his first love, he played jazz shows at Duke's Bar in Marylebone, London, partnering with harmonica player, Larry Adler. He also arranged for and accompanied Bob Hope, Tony Bennett, and Charles Aznavour. Budd recorded two albums of film music with the London Symphony Orchestra.

Early life and education Rethel was born in Aachen in 1816. He showed an interest in art in his early life, and at the age of thirteen he executed a drawing which procured his admission to the academy of D√ºsseldorf. Here he studied for several years, and produced, among other works, a figure of St Boniface, which attracted much attention. Career Nemesis, 1837 Dance of Death, 1848 At the age of twenty, Rethel moved to Frankfurt, and was selected to decorate the walls of the imperial hall in the R√∂mer with Fresco paintings of figures of famous men. At the same period he produced a series of designs illustrative of Old Testament history. Four years later, Rethel was the successful competitor for the work of ornamenting the restored council house of his native city with frescoes depicting prominent events in the career of Charlemagne, but the execution of this work was delayed for some six years. Meanwhile, Rethel occupied himself with the production of easel pictures and of drawings. In 1842, he began a striking series of designs dealing with the Crossing of the Alps by Hannibal, in which the weird power which animates his later art becomes first apparent. In 1844 Rethel visited Rome, executing, along with other subjects, an altar-piece for one of the churches of his native land. In 1846, he returned to Aachen, and commenced his Charlemagne frescoes. But mental derangement, attributed, it is believed, to an accident that he suffered in childhood, began to manifest itself. While he hovered between madness and sanity, Rethel produced some of the most striking, individual, and impressive of his works. Strange legends are told of the effect produced by some of his weird subjects. He painted Nemesis pursuing a murderer across a flat stretch of landscape. A slaughtered body lies on the ground, while in front is the assassin speeding away into the darkness, and above an angel of vengeance. The picture, so the story goes, was won in a lottery at Frankfurt by a personage of high rank, who had been guilty of an undiscovered crime, and the contemplation of his prize drove him mad. Another design which Rethel executed was \\"Death the Avenger,\\" a skeleton appearing at a masked ball, scraping daintily, like a violinist, upon two human bones. The drawing haunted the memory of his artist friends and disturbed their dreams; and, in expiation, he produced his pathetic design of \\"Death the Friend.\\" Rethel also executed a powerful series of drawings \\"The Dance of Death\\" suggested by the Belgian insurrections of 1848. It is by such designs as these, executed in a technique founded upon that of Albrecht D√ºrer, and animated by an imagination akin to that of the elder master, that Rethel is most widely known. Death Alfred Rethel died on December 1, 1859, at age 43 in D√ºsseldorf from the effects of a brain disease. In his last years, his brother Otto Rethel (1822‚Äì1892) took care of him, as well as his young wife Marie Grahl, the daughter of August Grahl, and their daughter Else Sohn- Rethel.

Its goal was to accumulate capital for the acquisition of German colonial territories in overseas countries. History Peters had just returned from London, where he lived with his well-off uncle Carl Engel and studied the principles of British colonialism. In the autumn of 1884 he proceeded, together with his friends Karl Ludwig J√ºhlke and Count Joachim von Pfeil, to the Sultanate of Zanzibar. Peters had initially planned to prospect for gold in Southern African Mashonaland (in present-day Zimbabwe) but discovered that the territory had already been overrun by the British. Peters' Zanzibar expedition was a nuisance to the German government of Chancellor Bismarck, focused on good relations with both Sultan Barghash bin Said and the British Empire, and the German consul Gerhard Rohlfs made that clear to him. Peters, J√ºhlke and von Pfeil, suspiciously eyed by the British envoy John Kirk, thereupon embarked to the East African Tanganyika mainland. During their journey in November and December 1884, Peters concluded several \\"treaties of protection\\" (Schutzvertr√§ge) with tribal chiefs in the Useguha, Ussagara, Nguru, and Ukami regions as a \\"Representative of German Colonization\\". The provisions, issued in German, conferred all rights to exploit the territories on the Gesellschaft f√ºr Deutsche Kolonisation in exchange for some inexpensive gifts. Returning to Germany in February 1885, Peters demanded the implementation of an official protection status for the areas. Bismarck meanwhile had developed his own colonial strategies and from 15 November 1884 hosted the Berlin Conference that fuelled the \\"Scramble for Africa\\". Though the chancellor still expressed serious doubts regarding Peters' land acquisitions, he finally gave in with respect to the expansion of the Belgian colonial empire in Congo while the British were stuck in the Mahdist Sudan revolt. One day after the end of the Berlin Conference, on 27 February 1885, the GfdK obtained an imperial charter issued by Emperor Wilhelm I. On 2 April 1885 Peters formed the German East Africa Company (Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft, DOAG), modelled on the East India Company. He was aware that the imperial charter marked the beginning of a large-scale seizure of land to create reality, which soon resulted in an official note of protest by Sultan Barghash bin Said. Bismarck found himself constrained to send a squadron of Imperial Navy gunboats under Admiral Eduard von Knorr to the port of Zanzibar, whereafter the sultan relented and on 20 December 1885 signed a \\"treaty of friendship\\" recognising the acquisitions of German East Africa. However, Peters' ongoing impetuous advance caused further unrest, culminating in the Abushiri Revolt of 1888/89. The DOAG superseded the Gesellschaft f√ºr Deutsche Kolonisation which was merged in 1887 with the into the German Colonial Society (Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft).

Background Central District, 1992 The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration paved the way for a series of changes that would facilitate the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China (PRC). In July 1992, Chris Patten was appointed as the last British Governor of Hong Kong. By contrast with his predecessors, Sir Edward Youde and Sir David Wilson, Patten had little experience with Hong Kong or China, and spoke neither Mandarin nor Cantonese. The decade was essentially dominated by the political backdrop of the handover. Politics=The handover= Flag of Hong Kong under British rule Following China's Tiananmen Square protest in 1989, citizens feared the Chinese government would not keep its promise of autonomy after the handover in Hong Kong. As a result, various mediating measures took place in the run-up to 1997. The Hong Kong Basic Law was ratified on 4 April 1990 as a mini-constitution. The pro-Beijing bloc welcomed the Basic Law, calling it the most democratic legal system to ever exist in the PRC. The pro-democratic bloc criticised it as not democratic enough. Patten emphasised the increase in democracy in Hong Kong through a series of measures that affected the election processes of both legislators and municipal officials. In 1994, the PRC announced that it would terminate the Legislative Council (LegCo) in favour of the \\"provisional legislative council\\". In 1995, LegCo was passed and the Democratic Party denounced the provisional legislative council as illegal. The provisional legislative council operated from Shenzhen before the handover. Flag of the Hong Kong SAR At midnight on 1 July 1997, the handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre at Wan Chai North. The flag of the United Kingdom and the flag of the Crown colony were lowered. The flags of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and China were raised. This marked the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from British colonial rule to Chinese rule. Participated guests in the ceremony included H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair, President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin, Premier of the People's Republic of China Li Peng, the last Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten appointed by the United Kingdom, and Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong elected from a Beijing-controlled election. Demographics Causeway Bay, 1993 =Population= The population of Hong Kong in 1995 and 1999 was 6.3 million and 6.9 million respectively.Chan, Shun-hing. Leung, Beatrice. [2003] (2003). Changing Church and State Relations in Hong Kong, 1950‚Äì2000. Hong Kong: HK university press. Page 24. A total of 44,000 illegal immigrants from mainland China were arrested and deported in 1993, with the number decreased to 35,500 a year later. Hong Kong's fertility rate also become the lowest in the world, having declined to just 5.1 child per population of 1,000 in 1996.Fosh, Patricia. Chan, Andy. Chow, Wilson WS. Snape, Ed. Westwood, Robert. [2000] (2000) Hong Kong Management and Labour. United Kingdom: Routledge. . =Emigration= In 1990, the outflow of people reached 62,000 people, or about one per cent of the population. The emigration rate would peak in 1992 with 66,000 people, followed by 53,000 in 1993, and 62,000 in 1994. An estimated US$4.2 billion flowed from Hong Kong to Canada directly as a result.Manion, Melanie. [2004](2004). Corruption by Design: Building Clean Government in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Harvard University Press. Much renowned tycoons in Hong Kong, such as the Shaw family, left Hong Kong for fear of adverse effects to the economy after the handover. Many Hong Kong citizens emigrated to Great Britain through the British Nationality Selection Scheme. A comparable number of families also moved to Australia, Canada, and the United States. =Foreign Domestic Workers= From the late 1980s to 1990s, Hong Kong's currency stabilised. The value of the Philippine peso was dropping steadily from 17 pesos in 1984 to 30 pesos in 1993 = US$1. This caused a surge of Philippines workers going to Hong Kong in search of higher salaries under the \\"maid to order\\" services. The number of foreign workers grew from 9,000 in 1987 to 28,000 in 1992 and 32,000 in 1993. Women from the Philippines make up the majority with substantial numbers from Indonesia and Thailand. The term \\"fei yung\\" () became associated with the helpers. Families in need of the helpers generally have both parents working at full-time positions. In 1993, households were required to have a combined income of HKD $15,000. The foreign workers essentially run all home affairs from cooking, ironing, cleaning and caring for the young and old in the household. Most households had 4 to 5 members including at least 1 child under the age of 12, some have elderly over 65. The hiring of workers fuelled a number of social debates. From the worker's perspective, problems range from unfair treatments, discrimination to low wages were raised. From the family perspective, problems range from privacy invasion to abuse type cases. Newspapers, radios and TV broadcasts have covered the subjects on numerous accounts. To stir controversies, the media often claimed traditional amah Chinese servants as superior workers. Culture=Entertainment= The entertainment industry was essentially dominated by the Four Heavenly Kings, namely: Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau and Leon Lai. In the early stages in their careers, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai sang songs with Japanese melodies, but in the early to mid-1990s there was a public outcry for originality in local music. In 1993, the radio broadcasting company Commercial Radio, announced that it would play only locally-written music. The purpose was to encourage local musicians to write their own lyrics. Mark Lui was a popular composer by the late 1990s. In the early 1990s, the entertainment industry became increasingly linked to Taiwan and mainland China. Numerous television drama series, especially with themes related to ancient Chinese, were imported from Taiwan and mainland China since the early 1990s, such as Justice Bao imported from Taiwan by TVB and Romance of the Three Kingdoms imported from mainland China by ATV's Home Channel, with both dramas become very successful and created much discussion in the territory while broadcasting. A further successful example is the television drama My Fair Princess, a Taiwan-Mainland co-production. The show was broadcast in Hong Kong in 1999 by ATV's Home Channel and became popular among overseas Chinese worldwide. Another example of a popular mainland pop star was Faye Wong. She was born in Beijing and began singing in Cantonese, but later sang in both Mandarin and Cantonese as her career grew. =Cinema= The Hong Kong film industry underwent several changes in the 1990s, especially with the emergence of the mo lei tau culture, which became synonymous with comedian Stephen Chow. Some critics claimed those films were made to alleviate social tension. =Law and order= In 1999, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled that children born on the mainland would be entitled the right of abode in Hong Kong so long as either parent was a Hong Kong permanent resident. This decision led to the government's reinterpretation of the Basic Law which overturned the ruling and determined that a parent would have to be a Hong Kong permanent resident at the time of the child's birth to transmit residency. Economy Tsing Ma Bridge, opened 1997 New Hong Kong International Airport, opened 1998 =Finance= Three months after the handover in July 1997, Hong Kong was dragged into the Asian Financial Crisis. At one point, the stock market fell by 22.8% within a week. Between the summer of 1997 and 1998, the leading shares in the Hang Seng Index lost nearly of its value. The government had to intervene by buying billions of dollars worth of shares. While this may have prevented the market from collapsing and staved off pressure for the Hong Kong dollar to be unpegged from the US dollar, the move was widely criticised as it undermined Hong Kong's status of a free market economy. =Real estate= In 1998, the real estate bubble burst due to the government's housing policy, though the Asian financial crisis also had some influence. Upon the inauguration of Hong Kong SAR's first chief executive, Tung Chee Hwa announced the building of 85,000 flats a year, while reducing public housing wait time from 7 to 3 years.\\"Hong Kong's Residential Property: Prices are Likely to Have Bottomed\\", Hong Kong Trade Development Council, 6 July 2000. Retrieved on 2007-01-29. These factors combined to begin the most severe recession in Hong Kong since 1967, which was a year of ambitious government projects that used up fiscal reserves on infrastructure and structural deficit. =Transportation= In 1998, the Kai Tak Airport was closed. The new US$20 Billion Hong Kong International Airport opened for commercial use. The initial years of operation were challenging as it utilised state-of-the-art computer systems, in just about every function imaginable. The scale and size of the airport also required many innovative solutions from the Airport Authority. Over time, it became the central connecting point for many flights in the far east. The Tsing Ma Bridge, part of the Lantau Link connecting the remote airport site to the city, was the world's second largest suspension bridge when it opened on 27 April 1997. Spanning 1,377 metres (4,518 ft), it is also the largest of all bridges in the world carrying rail traffic. The Tung Chung and Airport Express MTR lines opened in 1998. Other major transport projects completed in the 1990s include the Tate's Cairn Tunnel (1991), San Tin Highway (1993), Yuen Long Highway (1993), North Lantau Highway (1997), Kap Shui Mun Bridge (1997), Western Harbour Crossing (1997), and Tai Lam Tunnel (1998). Many of these related to the airport project, or to completing the New Territories orbital highway.

During the few years it existed it was the preeminent state in Central Asia. This is the first state of the Abulkhairids, a branch of the Shaybanids. Etymology The dynasty of Abu'l-Khayr Khan and his descendants is named after him, and the states ruled by them are known as Abulkhairids, such as in the Khanate of Bukhara. They may also be referred to as Shaybanids, although this is more of an umbrella term as a rival dynasty called the Arabshahids of Khwarezm were also Shaybanids, but not Abulkhairids. History=Before Abu'l-Khayr Khan= Starting with Shiban, brother of Batu Khan who was the ruler of the Golden Horde, the Shaybanids and their descendants held land and sway over many tribes granted to Shiban by Batu. These lands included the Golden Horde domains east of the Urals, and lands north of the Syr Darya river. Central control in the Golden Horde eroded away quickly in the east and breakaway states like the Nogai Horde and the Khanate of Sibir appeared in the region. The battle between 288x288px =Abu'l-Khayr Khan= 288x288px By the time of Abu'l-Khayr's birth in 1412, the ulus of Shiban was fractured. At this time the eastern part of the Golden Horde (The Blue Horde) had become outside of complete control of the Golden Horde khans and pretenders, especially after the assassination of Barak Khan in 1427. Abu'l-Khayr was taken prisoner after a battle in 1427 and was released in 1428. After the passing of the then Khan of the Uzbeks and pretender to the throne of the Golden Horde, Barak Khan, Ulug Beg, the leader of the Timurid Empire, secretly orchestrated the title of khan to pass to Abu'l-Khayr. He began his rule by consolidating tribes in Siberia around his capital at Chimgi-Tura (Modern-day Tyumen). He was able to depose the reigning Khan of Sibir, Kazhy Mohammed, and took the entirety of the area under Shaybanid control. In 1430 or 1431, Abu'l-Khayr and his army marched south into Timurid-held Khwarezm and occupied Urganj. Between 1430 and 1446 the Uzbek Khanate took land in Transoxiana from the Timurids. Abu'l-Khayr invaded the Golden Horde sometime after this and defeated Mustafa Khan near Astrakhan. The Uzbeks lost around 4,500 men during this campaign. Prior to the death of Shah Rukh in 1448 Sighnaq and other cities in Turan such as Uzkend and Sozak were invaded and captured by the Uzbeks. Sighnaq became one of the principal cities of Central Asia during this time. In 1451 Abu'l-Khayr allied with the Timurid Abu Sa'id against his rival 'Abdullah and the two both marched on Samarkand. The Uzbek-Abu Sa'id alliance was successful and in return Abu Sa'id paid tribute to the Uzbeks. =Kazakh Insurrection= 288x288px Starting in the 1460s, the Kazakh khans warred for control of modern-day Kazakhstan, led by Janibeg and Kerei Khan, the sons of the claimant to the throne of the Golden Horde, Barak Khan, founded the Kazakh Khanate. This war was made especially difficult for the Uzbeks because of a recent war with the Dorben Oirat Mongols on the Uzbeks' eastern borders. Janibeg and Kerei sought to capitalize on Uzbek weakness following the conflict. =Death of Abu'l-Khayr Khan and Successors= Somewhere around 1468-1470, Abu'l-Khayr Khan died in battle against the Kazakhs along with several of his sons. Sheikh Haidar, also known as Baruj Oghlan (Some sources have them as the same person or different persons), the eldest of Abu'l-Khayr's sons, succeeded him. Sheikh Haidar's reign was short and was ended after conflicts with a rival khan, Ibak. Muhammad Shaybani, Abu'l-Khayr's grandson, succeeded his father, Sheikh Haidar. Shaybani had been, along with his brother, Mahmud Sultan, given refuge by the Khan of Astrakhan, Qasim. After Shaybani was helped by the Moghul Khans to reclaim land in Transoxiana, he became a Moghul vassal from 1488 until around 1500. After this point, Shaybani led his own conquests which largely consisted of cities in the fractured Timurid successor states (Such as Samarkand and Bukhara). Shaybani's main rivals were the Timurid Babur and the Persian Shah Ismail. In 1500, Shaybani officially conceded all the Kazakh held lands in Dasht-i Qipchaq to the Kazakh Khanate. Shortly after this in 1506, Shaybani captured Bukhara and the Uzbek Khanate became the Khanate of Bukhara. Muhammad Shaybani was killed in the battle of Marv by the Safavids and Shah Ismail in 1510 and had his skull turned into a jeweled drinking goblet.

It is located on the B5289 road, linking Seatoller, in the valley of Borrowdale, to Gatesgarth at the southern end of Buttermere. The pass reaches an altitude of , making it one of the highest in the region, and also one of the steepest, with gradients of up to 1-in-4 (25%). The saddle at the watershed is known as Honister Hause, using the Cumbrian word hause for such a feature. Honister Pass is one of three passes that link the tourist area around Keswick, including Derwent Water and Borrowdale, with the valley of the River Cocker, including the lakes of Buttermere, Crummock Water and Loweswater.

Of those species, seven are endemic (three of which are found only on Cocos Island), 69 are rare or accidental, and four have been introduced by humans. Another 73 are near- endemic with ranges that include only Costa Rica and Panama. Twenty-seven species, including five of the seven endemics, are globally vulnerable or endangered.IUCN 2019. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2019-2. http://www.iucnredlist.org. Downloaded on August 4, 2019. Over an area of 51,100 km2, an area smaller than West Virginia, this is the greatest density of bird species of any continental American country. About 600 species are resident, with most of the other regular visitors being winter migrants from North America. Costa Rica's geological formation played a large role in the diversification of avian species. North America and South America were initially separate continents, but millions of years of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions eventually fused the two continents together. When this happened, species from the north and south poured into the land bridge that became Central America. Birds like the hummingbird came from the south, while birds like the jay came from the north. Part of the diversity stems from the wide array of habitats, which include mangrove swamps along the Pacific coast, the wet Caribbean coastal plain in the northeast, dry northern Pacific lowlands, and multiple mountain chains that form the spine of the country and rise as high as 3,500 m. These mountain chains, the largest of which is the Cordillera de Talamanca, form a geographical barrier that has enabled closely related but different species to develop on either side of the chain. A good example of this speciation is the white-collared manakin of the Caribbean side, which is now distinct from the orange-collared manakin of the Pacific slope. In the past, higher sea levels left the mountains as highlands, and isolation again led to distinct species developing, with over thirty now endemic to the mountains, especially the Talamanca range which extends from southern Costa Rica into Panama. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, all species on the list are considered to occur regularly in Costa Rica as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence: * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Costa Rica * (R?) Residence uncertain - a species which might be resident * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Costa Rica * (E-R) Regional endemic - a species found only in Costa Rica and Panama * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Costa Rica as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Great tinamou Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of birds. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes) which includes the rheas, emu, and kiwis. * Highland tinamou, Nothocercus bonapartei * Great tinamou, Tinamus major * Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui * Thicket tinamou, Crypturellus cinnamomeus * Slaty-breasted tinamou, Crypturellus boucardi Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Black-bellied whistling-duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Construction An optode requires three components to function: a chemical that responds to an analyte, a polymer to immobilise the chemical transducer and instrumentation (optical fibre, light source, detector and other electronics). Optodes usually have the polymer matrix coated onto the tip of an optical fibre, but in the case of evanescent wave optodes the polymer is coated on a section of fibre that has been unsheathed. Operation Optodes can apply various optical measurement schemes such as reflection, absorption, evanescent wave, luminescence (fluorescence and phosphorescences), chemiluminescence, surface plasmon resonance. By far the most popular methodology is luminescence. Luminescence in solution obeys the linear Stern‚ÄìVolmer relationship. Fluorescence of a molecule is quenched by specific analytes, e.g., ruthenium complexes are quenched by oxygen. When a fluorophore is immobilised within a polymer matrix myriad micro-environments are created. The micro-environments reflect varying diffusion co-efficients for the analyte. This leads to a non-linear relationship between the fluorescence and the quencher (analyte). This relationship is modelled in various ways, the most popular model is the two site model created by James Demas (University of Virginia). The signal (fluorescence) to oxygen ratio is not linear, and an optode is most sensitive at low oxygen concentration, i.e., the sensitivity decreases as oxygen concentration increases. The optode sensors can however work in the whole region 0‚Äì100% oxygen saturation in water, and the calibration is done the same way as with the Clark type sensor. No oxygen is consumed and hence the sensor is stirring insensitive, but the signal will stabilize more quickly if the sensor is stirred after being put into the sample. Popularity Optical sensors are growing in popularity due to the low-cost, low power requirements and long term stability. They provide viable alternatives to electrode-based sensors or more complicated analytical instrumentation, especially in the field of environmental monitoringTengberg A, Hovdenes J, Andersson H, Brocandel O, Diaz R, Hebert D, Arnerich T, Huber C, Kortzinger A, Khripounoff Alexis, Rey F, Ronning C, Schimanski J, Sommer S, Stangelmayer A (2006).

LinuxWorld Conference and Expo (renamed to OpenSource World in its final year) was a conference and trade show that focused on open source and Linux solutions in the information technology sector. It ran from 1998 to 2009, in venues around the world. The show was owned and managed by IDG World Expo, a business unit of International Data Group (IDG). Keynote speakers included Linux creator Linus Torvalds, One Laptop Per Child founder Nicholas Negroponte, and Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig. Another IDG business unit, Network World, operated the LinuxWorld.com web site, which often carried audio, video, and presentation materials from the show, as well as interviews with the show's speakers. This event should not be confused with the \\"Open Source World Conference\\", an annual Spanish-language event that ran from 2004 to 2012.  History  LinuxWorld Conference & Expo award won by IBM The first LinuxWorld Conference and Expo occurred in 1998 at the San Jose Convention Center. The keynote speaker was Linus Torvalds. The event featured a debate with Torvalds, Richard Stallman and Larry Wall. At the conference an agreement was made by Patrick Op de Beeck and Mark Shuttleworth concerning cooperation between KDE and Gnome for improving each other's work. The 2001 documentary film Revolution OS includes footage from the 1999 LinuxWorld event in New York City. Writer and free software advocate Don Marti ran LinuxWorld from 2005 until its end in 2009.

It is situated within the unitary authority of North Somerset, between Clevedon and Weston-super-Mare on the North Somerset Levels. The parish has a population of 388. History The late medieval village cross stands on \\"The Triangle\\". The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton. The village suffered serious flooding in the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 when the sea walls were breached and the church in Kingston Seymour was said to have of water in it for ten days. The parish, which extends to the Severn Estuary coast, saw flooding on a regular basis as late as the 1800s. After flooding, the land was considered unsuitable for dairy cattle for some time and the resulting bad air was said to cause \\"attacks of the ague\\" in local people. Kingston Seymour school opened its doors in 1858. Closing in 1968, the building was then used as an office for the local drainage board and later as a spinning and weaving centre. It has now been converted into a private house. The village used to be on the route of the Clevedon branch line a railway line that ran from Yatton railway station to Clevedon. It was opened in 1847 and passenger services ceased in 1966. The last original bits of track, around Kingston Seymour, were lifted in the late 1980s. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency (previously Woodspring county constituency). It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. Geography The village is close to Blake's Pools a nature reserve owned by Environment Agency and leased by the Avon Wildlife Trust, on the banks of the Congresbury Yeo close to its mouth. The three freshwater and brackish pools were dug between 1983 and 1987 to attract wildlife. It forms part of the Severn Estuary Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Protection Area and RAMSAR site. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of All Saints dates from the late 14th or early 15th century and is in the Perpendicular Gothic style. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The porch contains a plaque which describes the Bristol Channel floods which affected this area of coastal Somerset in 1607. During that event the floodwaters rose over the top of the church's pews and filled the font. The plaque records the date as occurring in 1606 using the old style dating system in use at the time however the flood occurred during 1607 on the current (new style) dating system.

Zagor was first published In Italy by Sergio Bonelli Editore in 1961. Character Zagor's real name is Patrick Wilding, the son of Mike and Betty. He is a western-tarzanesque character living in a fictional forest named Darkwood, located in Pennsylvania, north eastern United States. His name Zagor comes from its Indian name \\"Za-Gor Te-Nay\\", whose fictional meaning is \\"The Spirit with the Hatchet\\". Though the writers do not mention exact dates, Zagor is supposed to be active during the first half of the 19th century, or around 1825‚Äì1830. Zagor fights to maintain peace all over his territory, protecting the Indian tribes and hunting down criminals regardless of their skin color. Son of an army official retiring to live as a pioneer and trapper in the forests of the north-east, Patrick Wilding sees his parents die at the hands of a band of Abenaki Indians, led by Salomon Kinsky. Taken in by the middle-aged trapper nicknamed \\"Wandering Fitzy\\", the boy grows up with only one thought on his mind: revenge. Fitzy teaches him how to make a deadly weapon out of a hatchet, and when he is old enough to fulfill his vengeance, Patrick goes on to track down and mercilessly slay his family's assailants. As he is about to enact his revenge on defeated Kinsky, Patrick is presented with the evidence of his father's dark past. Lieutenant Mike Wilding was a ruthless leader of the force which massacred the Abenaki community on the banks of Silver Lake, an event which saw him dishonorably discharged from the army. The attack on the Patrick's home on the shore of Clear Water river was, in fact, a rightful retribution for commander Wilding's wrongdoings. As Kinsky is about to gun down confused and distracted Patrick, Fitzy arrives in time to save the life of his prot√©g√© but, in doing so, is mortally wounded and dies in Patrick's arms. The boy's understanding of the relativity of the concepts of good, evil and justice comes in question as he is devastated with pain, grief, confusion and the genocide of his own that mirrors the one committed by Mike Wilding years ago. To atone for his father's sins, as well as his own, Patrick is compelled to transform himself (with his accomplices the Sullivans, a family of acrobats who are his image makers) into Za-Gor-Te-Nay, shortened to Zagor. He is a kind of avenger always ready to side with the weak and the oppressed, whether red, white or black, whoever they may be. Moving his shack to an island surrounded by quick-sand in a marshy area of Darkwood Forest, Zagor begins his work as a peacemaker. He takes Darkwood tribes under his wing earning himself a distinction of the Lord of Darkwood, beloved and respected by peaceful natives and trappers, and feared and hated by anyone who would endanger the peace between reds and whites. Zagor is not a typical western character, as his stories mix horror and science fiction by side with a bit of humour coming mostly from his sidekick Chico, a short, fat Mexican man who became his best friend. His full name is \\"Don\\" Chico Felipe Cayetano Lopez Martinez y Gonzales. Abilities Zagor's abilities include almost superhuman strength, agility and endurance. His fighting prowess is extraordinary whether he finds himself in a gunfight or plain brawl. If needed, Zagor is more than capable of dealing with multiple opponents and is basically invincible in a one-on-one bout. In many occasions, he is also seen fighting North American wildlife (such as cougars, alligators and even bears) with nothing more than his hatchet or knife. He is infallible with his oval bladed hatchet, whether he uses it as a melee weapon or as a projectile. Zagor is also shown possessing an incredible speed that, paired with his almost cat-like reflexes, often allows him to catch a traveling spear or even an arrow, a feats which usually leave Indians in an awe further solidifying Zagor's status of an emissary of the Great Spirit (a superstition that Zagor uses to his advantage). Zagor can quickly cover great distances using his trademark branch-to-branch way of traveling where he jumps from one treetop to another. His war cry seems to be a roar of an unidentifiable (and presumably horrific) creature. This is one of Zagor's calling cards, the one which usually leaves wrongdoers in a frantic state of mind. Throughout the series, it is strongly suggested that Zagor, although not a demi-god that he claims to be, is indeed in Manitou's good graces and on more than few occasions he has served as a champion of heavens against the forces of evil drawing his strength from the divine intervention (best example being the storyline of Hellingen's Return - episodes #275 through #280). Later stories have also hinted that Zagor's great abilities could come from him being a descendant of an Atlantean royalty or perhaps a reincarnation of an ancient African deity. Although capable of near- superhuman feats, there were rare instances when Zagor was bested by certain extraordinary individuals. In a contest of skill (trials of power, speed, reflexes, marksmanship, breath-diving and beast-fighting) against multi- talented villain Supermike, Zagor is forced into a seventh round tie-breaker - a life-or-death duel atop of a small platform surrounded by the garden of spikes and daggers (which he, eventually, wins convincingly while even managing to spare the life of an opponent). When it comes to a fair slugfest, there were very few foes able to hold their own against the Spirit with the Hatchet. Such is the case with the Alchemist Robert Gray. In the episodes Criminal Genius (#252) and The Rebellion of the Mohawks (#253) Zagor and Gray duke it out twice with Zagor coming on top the first time around and Gray winning the second duel. It is worth noting, though, that Gray had an advantage of his steel prosthetic hands thus forcing brutally beaten Zagor to dishonor himself by resorting to shoot the unarmed opponent. Another example of worthy adversary comes in the face of Captain Otto Kraus, commander of the special paramilitary unit called the Black Wolves (episode #32 - The Fugitive). Kraus, proficient practitioner of the unnamed oriental martial arts, although weary from hours of being chased by Zagor and the Pennacooke Indians, still manages to K.O. Zagor in a convincing fashion, just before he is, ironically, shot dead by a surviving member of his own unit for deserting the squad on the battlefield. Allies and enemies Notable allies: Chico (Felipe Cayetano Lopez Martinez y Gonzales) - Short obese bumbling but kindhearted Mexican. He is Zagor's loyal companion and a comic relief throughout the series. Tonka - Chief of Mohawk tribe and Zagor's blood brother. Digging Bill - Treasure hunter. Captain \\"Fishleg\\" - Commander of a whaler. Colonel Norman Perry - Military doctor and influential person in the army brass. Baron Icarus LaPlume (Feather) - An inventor obsessed with flying who always ends up victim of his own devices. Drunky Duck - Indian postman whose unorthodox ways of delivering mail infuriate Chico. \\"Doc\\" Lester - Trapper and former dentist. Has an elusive past. Rochas - Trapper always engaged in fists challenges with Zagor. Bat Batterton - Private detective who always fails the disguises. Many Eyes - Shaman which embraces white people's medicine and technology. One of the few Indians to know Zagor's true identity. Frida Lang - Austrian countess and Zagor's love interest. Memorable enemies include: Professor Hellingen - Mad scientist and Zagor's nemesis. Not only that he is capable of creating a doomsday devices but he has also managed to cheat death and return to the land of the living to wreak havoc not once, but twice. Kandrax - Celtic druid who wields mystical powers. Mortimer - Scheming genius and a conspirator. Inspired by A. C. Doyle's professor Moriarty. SuperMike - Man of many talents and abilities and Zagor's evil counterpart. The Alchemist (Robert Gray) - Terrorist with prosthetic arms and expert in chemical warfare. One of very few persons to defeat Zagor in a fistfight. One- eyed Jack - Glass-eyed outlaw. Baron Rakosi - Vampire. Popularity outside Italy Even though Zagor is popular in Italy, it is even more popular in Croatia and Serbia, where it is being published to this day; his stories are also published in other former Yugoslav republics Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia. In former Yugoslavia, Zagor was published by the Serbian publication Dnevnik in its Zlatna Serija edition from 1968. Although not as popular, Zagor comics are also published in Austria. Zagor is one of the most popular comic heroes in Turkey since the 1960s. Two unofficial Zagor movies have been produced in Turkey in 1971, Zagor - Kara Korsan'in hazineleri and Zagor - Kara Bela. Zagor was also published in Greece and in Israel in the 1970s, where, during that time, Tex Willer was published as well. In 2015, Epicenter Comics released, in U.S.A., the first English-language edition of the three-part story Zagor! Terror from the Sea, including extra essays, introduction texts and original covers.

A person under the age of 20 years cannot undertake upasampadƒÅ (i.e., become a monk (bhikkhu) or nun (bhikkhuni)), but can become a novice (m. samanera, f. samaneri). After a year or at the age of 20, a novice will be considered for upasampadƒÅ.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2007). Traditionally, the upasampadƒÅ ritual is performed within a well-demarcated and consecrated area called sima (sima malaka) and needs to be attended by a specified number of monks: \\"ten or even five in a remoter area\\".Peter Skilling, How Buddhism invented Asia, 2 April 2009. Peter Skilling interviewed by Phillip Adams. Online audio recording Regional variations Customs regarding upasampada vary between regional traditions. In the Theravada tradition, monastics typically undertake higher ordination as soon as they are eligible. In East Asia, it is more typical for monastics to defer or avoid upasampada ordination entirely, remaining novices (samanera) for most or all of their monastic careers. This difference may originate from the historical shortage of temples in East Asia able to provide higher ordination according to the Vinaya.

Theory would favor a combination of big capitalization, passive and value. Of course one could almost get that when investing in an important Index like S&P; 500, EURO STOXX or the like. Also the degree of financial leverage and diversification are also factors  Investor traits  The style is determined by * the temper and the beliefs of the investor. * some personal or social traits (investor profile) such as age, gender, income, wealth, family, tax situation... * generally, its financial return / risk objectives, assuming they are precisely set and fully rational.  Some styles  Active vs. Passive Active investors believe in their ability to outperform the overall market by picking stocks they believe may perform well. Passive investors, on the other hand, feel that simply investing in a market index fund may produce potentially higher long- term results. The majority of mutual funds underperform market indexes. Active investors feel that the small-cap market is less efficient since smaller companies are not followed as closely as larger blue-chip firms. A less efficient market should favor active stock selection. The core-/satellite concept combines a passive style in efficient market and an active style in less efficient markets. Growth vs. Value Active investors can be divided into growth and value seekers. Proponents of growth seek companies they expect (on average) to increase earnings by 15% to 25%. Value investors look for bargains ‚Äî cheap stocks that are often out of favor, such as cyclical stocks that are at the low end of their business cycle. A value investor is primarily attracted by asset-oriented stocks with low prices compared to underlying book, replacement, or liquidation values. There is also a diversification effect: Returns on growth stocks and value stocks are not highly correlated. By diversifying between growth and value, investors can help manage risk and still have high long-term return potential. Small Cap vs. Large Cap. Some investors use the size of a company as the basis for investing. Studies of stock returns going back to 1925 have suggested that \\"smaller is better.\\" On average, the highest returns have come from stocks with the lowest market capitalization (common shares outstanding times share price). But since these returns tend to run in cycles, there have been long periods when large-cap stocks have outperformed smaller stocks. Also, early on, small cap stocks had bigger premiums and were more expensive to buy and sell, but isn't easily captured in historical analysis, and in reality likely skewed total return for investors. Small-cap stocks also have higher price volatility, which translates into higher risk. Some investors choose the middle ground and invest in mid-cap stocks with market capitalizations between $500 million and $8 billion ‚Äî seeking a tradeoff between volatility and return. In so doing, they give up the potential return of small-cap stocks.

Phelan, F. Eaton, D. Burslem and E. Burslem.facts The original name, ‚ÄúCeltic Adorers‚Äù, was chosen by J. Phelan. This name changed in the early 1990s. The Magnificat Meal Movement is regarded by mainstream Christian churches as a cult. Debra Burslem, its most prominent ongoing leader, now lives in Vanuatu which some claim is for the purpose of avoiding the Australian Federal Police on multiple charges of embezzlement and tax fraud. Aims The group describes its aims as primarily prayer, service and the study of seeking the truth as revealed through the light of the ‚ÄúCeltic Corma Adoration‚Äù (CCA) research. Beliefs The Magnificat Meal Movement International seeks to maintain the \\"original light teachings established by Yashua Jesus.\\" The CCA and the MMMI recognize the 1st-century church teachings established by the Marys and Joseph of Arimathea and the original teachings of Celtic followers of the ‚Äúway‚Äù in the Celtic realm of Britain in the first century. The CCA and the MMMI have a Levitical priesthood and the global church-basilica is made up of churches throughout the world.home basilica/churches churches Adherents believe that salvation is through unity with the ‚Äòliving one‚Äô by being united with the identity of Yashua Jesus.‚Äòliving one‚Äô The CCA and the MMMI do not believe in the ‚ÄúEnd Times‚Äù or Millennial-type teachings, but advocate that we are living already in a \\"New Galactic Era\\". The most publicized home-basilica-church and teaching center for the CCA and its offshoot, the MMMI, is based in Helidon, a small town about 130 km west of Brisbane in the Lockyer Valley just east of Toowoomba in Queensland, Australia. Both the CCA and the MMMI emphasise Marian-style study and application of the Gospel of Mary. Mary is honored as an example of co-operation of the creature with the Divine. All adherents are encouraged to live a similar lifestyle of divine co-operation as they feel and study such writings as the Gospel of Mary. Humanitarian work Humanitarian work and service to others, is also important to both the CCA and the MMMI missionary offshoot, as a work of being united like 'Slaves of Love' for humanity as outlined in the ‚ÄòGospel of Thomas‚Äô Nag Hammadi Library. Most MMMI and CCA and various other support groups are involved in extensive works of prayer, unity and service to humanity which they each finance from their own businesses. Connection with Roman Catholic Church The Celtic Corma Adorers (CCA) Church, or the Magnificat Meal Movement International (MMMI) has been characterised as an offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church, having been excommunicated and barred from the Eucharist by the Catholic Bishop of Toowoomba, Bill Morris, who has made repeated statements distancing the Roman Catholic Church from the movement. Though the followers of the movement presently deny any past connection to the Roman Catholic Church, the word 'Meal' within the name of the movement referred originally to the sharing of the Eucharist. The group was initially very involved in reviving the practice of Eucharistic Adoration in Catholic parishes, and Debra Burslem, the self- proclaimed Prophetess of the movement, publicly affirmed her affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church and claims to have received support from Catholic priest Fr. Jack Salisbury. The movement was initially predominantly made up of traditionalist and conservative Novus Ordo Roman Catholic parishioners who had rejected the post-Vatican II changes to the Catholic Church and announced in the late 1990s that the Novus Ordo Mass was invalid.

Both parishes include the nearby village of Redhill. Wrington lies in the valley of the Congresbury Yeo river, about east of Weston-super-Mare and south-east of Yatton. It has a population of 2,633 according to the 2011 Census. History The village dates back to Roman times and there is strong evidence of Saxon occupation as well. Wrington was historically part of the hundred of Brent-cum-Wrington. Wrington Cottage Hospital Wrington Cottage Hospital opened in 1864 and admitted 24 patients in its first year of operation. The first surgeon was Horace Swete, who wrote the Habdy Book of Cottage Hospitals. It was referred to by Florence Nightingale in 1869. Wrington had its own railway station between 1901 and 1963, on the Wrington Vale Light Railway, which ran from Congresbury to Blagdon. Governance As a parish council, Wrington Council has responsibility for setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. Its role includes initiating maintenance and repair of parish facilities. It falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset, which was created in 1996 under the Local Government Act 1992. North Somerset covers some of the ceremonial county of Somerset, but is administered separately from today's non-metropolitan county. Its headquarters are in the town hall of Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, the parish lay in the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974, the parish was part of Axbridge Rural District. An electoral ward exists with the same name. This includes Butcombe as well as Wrington parish. The ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,851. The parish is represented in the parliamentary House of Commons as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. Church The church of All Saints The old rectory with the church in the background The Church of All Saints has 13th-century foundations. It was remodelled with the addition of a west tower about 1450. There was a restoration in 1859 and further restoration of the tower in 1948. The church includes on either side of the door stone busts to John Locke and Hannah More dating from the early 19th century. The chancel has an 1832 Gothic reredos by Charles Barry. The rood screen is from the 16th century. It has a tall four-stage tower with set-back buttresses which develop into crocketed pinnacles at the top stage. The top displays moulded string courses and a trefoil-pierced triangular parapet with gargoyles and corner pinnacles. It is Grade I listed. According to Freeman it is \\"one of the \\"highest achievements of architectural genius\\". It dates from the period 1420‚Äì1450. The belfry stair is in the south-east turret. The height of the tower is to the top of the pinnacles. The 17th-century rectory is Grade II listed. The church's bells ring automatically. Until 2012, this took place every 15 minutes even through the night, but after a noise abatement order was served, it was reduced to hourly during the night.Wrington All Saints Church clock silenced in noise row , BBC News, 25 April 2012Somerset church bell to ring again after agreement reached , BBC News, 2 December 2012 Primary school Wrington Primary School The village primary school was opened on 1 May 1857Wrington's Victorian Schools, Mark Bullen 2012 and is Grade II listed.

Biography He was born Robert Franz Julius Knauth in Halle, Germany, the son of Christoph Franz Knauth. In 1847, Christoph Knauth adopted his middle name Franz as his new surname, and his son followed suit. He suffered in early life from the hostility of his parents to a musical career. He was twenty years old when his father's animosity was conquered and he was allowed to live in Dessau to study organ playing under Friedrich Schneider. The two years of study under that famous teacher were advantageous chiefly in making him uncommonly intimate with the works of Bach and H√§ndel, his knowledge of which be shown in his editions of the former's St Matthew Passion, Magnificat and ten cantatas, and the latter's Messiah and L'Allegro, although some of these editions have long been controversial among musicians. In 1843 he published his first book of songs, which was followed by some fifty more books, containing in all about 250 songs. In his native Halle he filled various public offices, including those of city organist as well as conductor of the Singakademie and the Symphony. He also served as royal music- director and music master at the university. The first book of songs was warmly praised by Liszt and Schumann, and the latter wrote a lengthy review of it in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik and later published it separately as well. Deafness began to make itself apparent as early as 1841. Franz also suffered from a nervous disorder that in 1868 compelled him to resign his offices. His future was then provided for by Franz Liszt, Joseph Joachim and others, who gave him the receipts of a concert tour amounting to some 100,000 marks. Franz in later life, by Valerian Gribayedoff, from a painting by Curt Herrmann In 1878 or 1879, he made an extensive search for Bach manuscripts in various towns, villages and country houses in Germany. Supposedly, he discovered a park surrounding Schloss Witzthun where young trees were being protected from their supporting poles by paper instead of the customary cloth or leather. On examination, the paper turned out to be Bach manuscripts. After questioning the gardener, Franz found a trunk of them, including a number of violin sonatas. Although this account was printed in the New York Times, Franz declared it was \\"entirely untrue\\". In addition to songs, he set the 117th Psalm for double choir and wrote and a four-part Kyrie; he also edited Emanuele d'Astorga's Stabat Mater and Francesco Durante's Magnificat. He also transcribed Schubert's String Quartet in D minor (\\"Death and the Maiden\\") for piano duet (1878) and made arrangements of Mozart's Quintets in C minor and C major. He died in Halle.

Life Amhurst was born at Marden, Kent. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and at St John's College, Oxford. In 1719 he was expelled from the university, ostensibly for his irregularities of conduct, but in reality (according to his own account) because of his whig principles. His politics were sufficiently evident in many of his works: a congratulatory epistle to Addison, in Protestant Popery; or the Convocation (1718), an attack on the opponents of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly; and in The Protestant Session by a member of the Constitution Club at Oxford (1719), addressed to James, first Earl Stanhope, and printed anonymously, but doubtless by Amhurst. He had satirized Oxford morals in Strepkon's Revenge; a Satire on the Oxford Toasts (1718), and he attacked from time to time the administration of the university and its principal members. An old Oxford custom permitted, on public occasions, some person to deliver from the rostrum a humorous, satirical speech, full of university scandal. This orator was known as Terr√¶ filius. In 1721 Amhurst produced a series of bi-weekly satirical papers under this name, which ran for seven months and incidentally provides much curious information. These publications were reprinted in 1726 in two volumes as Terr√¶ Filius; or, the Secret History of the University of Oxford. He collected his poems in 1720, and wrote another university satire, Oculus Britanni√¶, in 1724. Caleb D'Anvers On leaving Oxford for London he became a prominent pamphleteer on the opposition (whig) side. On the 5 December 1726 he issued the first number of The Craftsman, a weekly periodical, which he conducted under the pseudonym of Caleb D'Anvers. The paper was aimed mainly towards the overthrow of Sir Robert Walpole's government; there is some debate about its effects, with most historians agreeing it did little more than preaching to the converted. Nevertheless, it reached a circulation of 10,000 copies and was one of the biggest magazines of its time with authors such as Henry Fielding, John Gay and Alexander Pope contributing to it. For this success Amhurst's editorship was not perhaps chiefly responsible. It was founded, and in the beginning financed, by Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke and William Pulteney, the latter being a frequent and caustic contributor. In 1737 an imaginary letter from Colley Cibber was inserted, in which he was made to suggest that many plays by Shakespeare and the older dramatists contained passages which might be regarded as seditious. He therefore desired to be appointed censor of all plays brought on the stage. This was regarded as a \\"suspected\\" libel, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of the printer. Amhurst surrendered himself instead, and suffered a short imprisonment. On the overthrow of the government in 1742 the opposition leaders did nothing for the useful editor of the Craftsman, and this neglect is said to have hastened Amhurst's death, which took place at Twickenham.

Velakali (Malayalam: ‡¥µ‡µá‡¥≤‡¥ï‡¥≥‡¥ø) is a traditional martial dance of Nair community of Kerala that is performed during temple festivals. Brightly dressed dancers wielding swords and shields depict a fight sequence between the Pandavas and Kauravas during the course of the dance.  Myth behind Velakali  There are several legends associated with the origin and history of Velakali. One such legend talks of the sage Narada witnessing Lord Krishna and his friends staging a mock battle on the banks of the Kalindi using the stalks and leaves of the water lily as swords and shields. Narada then requested the sage Villumangalam to capture the martial vigour of the mock fight in a ritualistic performance for Krishna. Villumangalam in turn requested the ruler of Ambalapuzha to teach young men to perform the dance and so the ruler asked his army chieftains Mathoor Panicker and Velloor Kurup to ready a troupe of Velakali performers. Since the dancers were originally warriors, the dance bore a close resemblance to the martial art form of Kalarippayattu. Velakali thus originated in the princely state of Chempakassery (modern Ambalappuzha). To this day it is a regular feature of the pooram at the Ambalapuzha Sri Krishnaswamy temple. Since the annexation of Ambalappuzha into Travancore, Velakali has marked the commencement of the annual Painkuni festival at Sri Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Trivandrum.  Performance  During a Velakali performance huge effigies representing the Pandavas are put up during the festival at the eastern entrance of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. In Ambalapuzha, the dance is choreographed under the guidance of Mathur Panickar a hereditary Asan and minister of the Ambalapuzha royal family. Velakali dancers represent the Kauravas and the dance represents the battle between the cousins. The dancers stop and beat a retreat once they reach the effigy of Yudhishthira. The performance represents the victory of dharma over adharma and the victory of Bheema over the Kauravas during their exile to the forest. The younger performers line up in the front and the elders make up the rear of the troupe with a group of flag bearers forming the rearmost line. The performers are also sometimes accompanied by replicas of animals like oxen that were used in warfare in the olden days. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Velakali performances in central Travancore are reenactments of supposedly historical battles rather than the Mahabharata war and are intertwined with rituals of patayani. It is at the Padmanabhaswamy temple that the performances are linked with the battle between the cousins of the Mahabharata.  Costumes  Velakali is an all-male performance. The performers dress up in traditional clothes and colorful red headgear of the medieval Nair soldiers and wear cloth garlands of beads that cover their bare chests. They wield colorful shields and long canes or bear swords and dance to the beat of panchavadyam performers who accompany the performance and there are skilful displays of swordplay.  Music  Velakali is performed to the accompaniment of panchavadyam which uses the maddalam, thavil, ilathalam, kombu and kuzhal. The music involves no lyrics and the artists move to the rhythm of the percussion instruments. Also, unlike most dance forms, bhava has no place in Velakali and the focus is solely on tala. Velakali involves several distinct movements such as the pidichakali, padakali and the vela ottam.  Recent trends  Velakali requires of its performers considerable physical training and the knowledge of the use of arms. Education and employment opportunities had gradually led to fewer youngsters taking up Velakali resulting in its gradual decline. It has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years due to the efforts of Mohanankunju Panicker. The dance was staged again at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum in 2011 after a gap of almost 40 years.

After the end of the Napoleonic Wars she continued on active service for a number of years, before spending more than two decades as a prison hulk.

In March Euryalus pressed four men of the 41 men and boys on the Liverpool privateer . Elizas owners sued Blackwood for ¬£3000, contending that Blackwood's action in ignoring the Admiralty Certificate of Protection covering Elizas crew had ended up costing them that much in prize money by reducing their share of the proceeds from a rich Spanish prize they took in April. The prize money was shared with the privateer Greyhound, which had participated in the capture, on the basis of the sizes of the two crews. despite the judge's leading instructions to the jury that emphasized Blackwood's service to England, the jury found for the plaintiffs. = Battle of Trafalgar = In 1805 she led a squadron of four other frigates in watching C√°diz to report the movements of the combined French and Spanish fleets anchored there. The combined fleet sailed from C√°diz on 20 October, shadowed through the night by Euryalus and the others that reported its position to the Royal Navy fleet on the horizon. The Day after Trafalgar ‚Äì The Victory Trying to Clear the Land with the Royal Sovereign in Tow to the Euryalus painting by Nicholas Pocock With battle imminent the following morning, Captain Blackwood suggested that Admiral Horatio Nelson transfer from to the faster Euryalus, the better to observe and control the engagement. Nelson declined the offer. Euryalus - too small to play a major role - stood off until the late afternoon when she took the badly damaged in tow and turned her to engage the French ship . The French Admiral on board the Euryalus, an etching from 1805 Following the death of Admiral Nelson, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood transferred his flag from Royal Sovereign to Euryalus. She became for the next ten days the British fleet's flagship. After the battle Euryalus took on survivors from the French ship-of-the-line , as well as the captured French Admiral Pierre de Villeneuve. Blackwood also received the surrender of the Spanish ship , after two raking broadsides to the stern by Royal Sovereign and had caused her to strike her colours. Euryalus again took Royal Sovereign in tow but the two ships collided during a sudden squall, badly damaging the frigate's masts and rigging. Once repairs were completed, Euryalus went into C√°diz Harbour to allow Blackwood to negotiate an exchange of prisoners and the repatriation of French and Spanish wounded. On 31 October, Euryalus set sail for England with Admiral Villeneuve as a prisoner. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"Trafalgar\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle. =Mediterranean, post-Trafalgar= On 5 February 1806 Blackwood was still in command of Euryalus when the privateer Mayflower, of Guernsey, captured the Spanish vessel San Jose Andrea. This gave rise to court case in which the captain of the privateer alleged that Eurylaus had not been in sight (and so entitled to share in the prize money), but had come on the scene later and that Blackwood had coerced him to sign that she had joined the chase and was in sight. The court found for Euryalus having been in sight.Robinson and Scott (1808), Vol. 6, pp. 244-249. Later that year George Dundas took command of Euryalus. Euryalus, and other warships escorted a large convoy to Oporto, Lisbon and the Mediterranean. When she arrived, she was assigned to patrol the coast between Cape St. Vincent and Cape St. Maria in the Algarve, and then to watch the port of Cartagena. After about four months she transferred to the Gulf of Lyons.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp. 421-423. In the Mediterranean her boats captured several small merchant vessels. Towards the end of 1807 Euryalus returned to England with . The two vessels escorted several thousand of the late Sir John Moore's troops from Gibraltar. On her return Euryalus went into dock at Plymouth for a refit. Her next station was the North Sea and then the Baltic under Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez. First, Euryalus transported the Duke d'Angoul√™me from Yarmouth to Gottenburg. She then escorted Baltic convoys through the Great Belt. On 11 June 1808, she and discovered several vessels at anchor close to shore at the entrance to the river Naskon. Dundas anchored at dark and sent a cutting out party in four boats from the two ships to destroy the vessels. The cutting out party burnt two large troop transports and retrieved a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The successful foray took place directly under the guns of a Danish battery of three 18-pounder guns and numerous enemy troops who lined the shore. The enemy lost seven men killed and twelve wounded; the British had one man slightly wounded. In 1816 the crews of the British ships received prize money for \\"Danish gun-boat E\\". Later that year Dundas sailed to Elbing, a small port in West Prussia about east of Dantzig. There he took on board Princess Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy (the consort of Louis XVIII), the Duc du Berry and other members of the French royal family. He carried them first to Carlscrona in southern Sweden. He then re- embarked them at Gottenburg and carried them to Harwich. On 30 July 1809, a British force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren, initiating the Walcheren Campaign. Euryalus joined the squadron under Captain Lord William Stuart in that on 11 August forced the passage of the Scheldt between the batteries at Flushing and Cadsand. Euryalus herself had no casualties although the British lost two men killed and nine wounded in other ships.James (1837), Vol. 5, p. 136. Although the Walcheren Expedition, which ended on 9 August 1809, was notably unsuccessful, Euryalus was among the myriad vessels sharing in the prize money form the campaign. Later she was stationed off Cherbourg under the orders of Captain Sir Richard King. On 18 November Euryalus was off Cherbourg where she captured the French privateer lugger Etoile of 14 guns and 48 men. Etoile was two days out from the Hogue without having made any captures. On 26 April 1810 Euryalus sailed for the Mediterranean, escorting a large convoy from Spithead to Portugal and the Mediterranean. She then joined Captain Blackwood's inshore squadron off Toulon. The squadron consisted of Blackwood's , , , Euryalus and . A strong gale on 15 July forced the squadron to seek shelter behind the √éle du Levant. The same gale drove Blackwood's ship, east to Villefranche. On 20 July a French squadron consisting of six sail-of-the line and four frigates exited Toulon. Their objective was to provide cover to a frigate and her convoy that wished to escape from Bandol where it had taken shelter. The light and variable winds made it impossible for Blackwood to block the French squadron and the frigate and her convoy from joining up. Furthermore, while Blackwood was trying to regroup his squadron, Euryalus and Shearwater were forced to sail across the front of the French force. The wind failed for Blackwood, but not the French, making it highly likely that the French would be able to capture Euryalus and Shearwater. Blackwood was able to position Warspite with Conqueror and Ajax astern where they could exchange broadsides with the French ships as they came up one at a time. Then the French tacked and the British line matched them, enabling Euryalus and Shearwater to escape, though not before Shearwater was on the receiving end of three completely ineffectual broadsides from one of the French ships of the line and a frigate. Despite its greater strength, the French force returned to Toulon rather than take on the British squadron. Early in 1811 Dundas temporarily took command of the 74-gun third rate until relieved by Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, who had transferred from . Dundas then returned to Euryalus. On 16 April 1811, Euryalus sailed for the Mediterranean. By May 1811, she was under the command of Captain George Waldegrave. On 7 June 1811 Euryalus, again under the command of Dundas, and sent their boats in pursuit of a French privateer off Corsica. After a long chase the boats captured Intrepide, which had a crew of 58 and was armed with two 8-pounders. In November 1812 Captain Thomas Ussher took command. His successor was Captain Jeremiah Coghlan. On 2 April, Euryalus, under Coghlan, drove a French vessel on shore on the coast of Sardinia. Euryalus was still in the Mediterranean when Captain (later Admiral) Charles Napier took command early in 1813. She took part in successful commerce raiding and the blockade of Toulon. On 16 May 1813, boats from and Euryalus attacked French coastal shipping at Cavalaire, east of Toulon.Fonds Marine, 1805-1826, p. 479. There they captured the French naval xebec Fortune, of ten 9-pounder guns and four swivel guns. She was under the command of Lieutenant de Vaisseaux F√©lix-Marie-Louise-Anne-Joseph-Julien Lecamus,James (1837), Vol.6, p. 242. and had a crew of 95 men who had abandoned her before the British boarded. In addition, the British captured 22 small coasting vessels. They took out 14, but then destroyed nine after removing their cargoes. Fifteen of the vessels were chiefly laden with oil, corn, lemons, etc., and one with empty casks; six of those destroyed were empty. In the attack Berwick lost one man killed, and Euryalus had one man missing. On 23 December Euryalus drove the fl√ºte , sailing from Toulon to Ajaccio, ashore near Calvi where she bilged on the rocks. Baleine was armed with 22 guns and carried a crew of 120 men. That same day, Alcmene captured the Fl√®che between Corsica and Cape Delle Molle. Fl√®che was armed with 12 guns, and carried a crew of 99 men and 24 soldiers. She was carrying the soldiers from Toulon to Corsica. French records place the capture off Vintimilles, and add that Fl√®che was escorting the storeships and Baleine, which were also carrying troops for Ajaccio, Corsica. On 21 April 1814, in company with , under the command of Ussher, Euryalus entered the harbour at Marseilles where they heard the news of Napoleon's defeat. Undaunted then sailed to Frejus Bay where she embarked Napoleon and transported him to Elba. =War of 1812= Napier next took Euryalus across the Atlantic to serve in the War of 1812. In June she sailed from Gibraltar to Bermuda as part of a squadron under Captain Andrew King. The squadron escorted transports carrying troops that had been recently employed against Genoa. Next, Napier and Euryalus participated in the expedition up the Potomac (August‚ÄìSeptember 1814), in which he was second in command of the squadron under James Alexander Gordon. On 17 August Euryalus, bombs , , and Meteor, the rocket ship , and the dispatch boat Anna-Maria were detached under Captain Gordon of to sail up the Potomac River and bombard Fort Washington, about ten or twelve miles below the capital. On the second day of the expedition Euryalus went aground on an oyster-bank at Kettle Bottoms and took several hours to be floated off. She subsequently took part in the bombardment and reduction of the forts defending the town of Alexandria. Later Euryalus contributed a boat armed with a howitzer to assist Meteor and in their unsuccessful attempt to stop the Americans from adding guns to a battery that would impede the British withdrawal. On 25 August a vicious squall hit the whole squadron; it temporarily put Euryalus almost on her beam ends and cost her bowsprit and the heads of all her topmasts. Only 12 hours were needed for refit, however.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 3, p. 8. Then on 5 September, Seahorse and Euryalus anchored close to the American battery and silenced it with their fire. With the rest of the squadron she then descended the Potomac, running the gauntlet of fire from enemy batteries; in all Euryalus lost three killed and ten wounded. One of the wounded was Napier, who took a musket ball in the neck. She returned to her anchorage at the mouth of the river on 9 September. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"The Potomac 17 Augt. 1814\\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign. On 13 September Euryalus was present at the bombardment of Fort McHenry preparatory to an expedition against Baltimore. Napier led nine boats up the Patapsco River where they fired on the American troops and drew fire from Fort McHenry that killed one man. Following these operations, on 28 January 1815 Napier issued a challenge to the captain of the frigate to meet Euryalus in single-ship combat. Constellations captain, Charles Gordon, accepted, but Euryalus was first required for the naval operations preceding the Battle of New Orleans and then peace was signed before the engagement could take place. Napier wrote to Captain Gordon that he was glad they were at peace, but should that situation change 'I trust we shall have an opportunity of being better acquainted'. During Napoleon's Hundred Days Euryalus landed troops at the mouth of the River Scheldt. Post-war Scale 1:48 model made by A.W. Curtis. Buckler's Hard Maritime Museum, Beaulieu, Hampshire, United Kingdom. Euryalus was paid off in June 1815. That same month Captain Thomas Huskisson recommissioned her. On 7 July she captured the French vessels Aimable Antoinette and Marie. At the time, , , and were in sight and so entitled to share in the prize money. A Presentation Cup given to Charles Peake by the seamen of Euryalus, 1821 From 25 August 1818 to end 1820, Euryalus was in the West Indies. She served as the flagship in the Leeward Islands from November 1819 to May 1820, and then at Jamaica from June to December. In January 1821 Captain Isaac Chapman became acting captain. From about June 1821 to August she was under the command of Wilson Braddyll Bigland. Captain Sir Augustus Clifford was appointed to Euryalus on 22 October 1821 and sailed her from St Helen's with W.J. Hamilton, the British ambassador to the Neapolitan court. She would spend from 1822 to 1825 relatively uneventfully in the Mediterranean though in 1824 she participated in the blockade of Algiers. Then in late in 1824 or early in 1825, she rendered assistance to the American brig Charles and Ellen at the island of Milos. Euryalus stayed for a week, lending some 70 to 80 men to the brig to effect repairs, a kindness acknowledged her captain, P.R. Bing and two Boston insurance companies by posting a notice in the National Intelligencer of 23 March 1825.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p. 81. Euryalus was paid off at Deptford in 1825. Fate After her return to England Euryalus was converted to a prison hulk. From 1825 to at least 1843, she was a prison for boys, the youngest being nine years old.Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons.Parliamentary papers, Volume 42, 704. In 1845 Euryalus became a coal hulk at Sheerness. In 1846-7 she was refitted as a convict ship and in that capacity she was moved to Gibraltar. In 1859 she was renamed Africa but was sold to a Mr. Recanno for breaking up in 1860.

In 1999, the ship was discovered by the members of Pro Vrouw Maria, led by Rauno Koivusaari. A dispute between the discoverers and the authorities was later resolved. The ship was in good condition when it was discovered, but only six objects from the deck of the ship have been salvaged. The cargo holds have not been disturbed, so the condition of any art on board remains unknown. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities is responsible for the ship and all recovery efforts. History A clay smoking pipe recovered from the shipwreck of Vrouw Maria. Vrouw Maria was loaded with precious artifacts including works of art belonging to Catherine the Great of Russia. The ship set sail from Amsterdam on September 5, 1771, for Saint Petersburg. One month later, on October 3, the ship was caught in a storm and ran aground near the island of Jurmo. The rocks caused only minor damage but shortly afterward the ship ran aground again and lost its rudder. The ship was released by a large wave but the crew found it leaking rapidly. Lowering anchor, the crewmen manned the pumps, but the ship continued to take on water. At dawn on October 4, the decision was made to abandon ship. The crew manned the ship's boats and safely reached nearby rocks, from which they hailed a passing boat. Help arrived the next day, but after several days no progress had been made toward stabilizing the ship, whose pump was clogged with coffee beans from the cargo. On the morning of October 9, the Vrouw Maria sank beneath the waves. While all the crew lived, only a fraction of the cargo was saved. Aftermath Various people tried to locate the wreck, but none were successful until Pro Vrouw Maria discovered it in 1999. Interest in the ship rose in the 1970s when Dr. Christian Ahlstr√∂m discovered documents regarding the incident in the national archives of Finland. He published his findings in a book called Sjunkna Skepp in 1979. =The Cargo= The cargo, as declared in Helsing√∏r, Denmark, on September 23, included sugar, fabrics and dyes. The ship also carried works of art that Catherine the Great had bought at auction in Amsterdam, July 31, 1771. The pieces formerly belonged to Gerrit Braamcamp, a Dutch art collector. The King of Denmark allowed them to pass through customs without any declaration. After the sinking, the Swedish ambassador to St Petersburg, Carl Ribbing, the landlord of Turku and Pori County baron Christopher Rappe, and the foreign minister of Russia, Nikita Panin, discussed the missing cargo but nothing further was done to save it. The paintings Catherine the Great bought are known to have included Paulus Potter's Large Herd of Oxen, bought for Fl. 9050, and Gerard ter Borch's Woman at her Toilette, bought for Fl. 1870, as well as works by Cornelis Coedyk, Gabriel Metsu, Gerard Dou (a triptych of genre scenes bought for Fl. 14,100), Philip Wouwerman, and one of the van Ostade brothers (Adriaen or Isaac).

From Das St√§ndebuch, a famous series of woodcuts of the trades by Amman (who would not usually have done his own cutting) Jost Amman (June 13, 1539 - March 17, 1591) was a Swiss-German artist, celebrated chiefly for his woodcuts, done mainly for book illustrations. Amman was born in Z√ºrich, the son of a professor of Classics and Logic. He was himself well-educated. Little of his personal history is known beyond the fact that he moved to Nuremberg in 1560, where he took on citizenship and continued to reside until his death in March 1591. He worked initially with Virgil Solis, then a leading producer of book illustrations. His productivity was very remarkable, as may be gathered from the statement of one of his pupils, who said that the drawings he made during a period of four years would have filled a hay wagon. A large number of his original drawings are in the Berlin print room. About 1,500 prints are attributed to him. He was one of the last major producers of woodcuts for books, as during his career engravings were gradually taking over that role. Although like most woodcut artists, he normally let a specialist formschneider cut the block to his drawing, he occasionally included both a cutter's knife and a quill pen in his signature on prints, suggesting he sometimes cut his own blocks. Amman was the artist for Wenzel Jamnitzer's book Perspectiva corporum regularium (1568). A series of engravings by Amman of the kings of France, with short biographies, appeared in Frankfurt in 1576. He also executed many of the woodcut illustrations for the Bible published at Frankfurt by Sigismund Feierabend, and for a topographical survey of Bavaria by Philipp Apian.Amman, Jost. Philipp Apian‚Äôs Drawings, Watercolors, and Woodcuts. Accessed May 11, 2015. Another serial work, the Panoplia Omnium Liberalium Mechanicarum et Seden-tariarum Artium Genera Continens, containing 115 plates, is of great value. Amman's drawing is correct and spirited, and his delineation of the details of costume is minute and accurate. Paintings in oil and on glass are attributed to him, but none have been identified. Amman died in Nuremberg, Bavaria, aged 51. References * *Kartenspiel. A pack of cards.

Description Earnouts are often employed when the buyer(s) and seller(s) disagree about the expected growth and future performance of the target company. A typical earnout takes place over a three to five-year period after closing of the acquisition and may involve anywhere from ten to fifty percent of the purchase price being deferred over that period. Earnouts are popular among private equity investors, who do not necessarily have the expertise to run a target business after closing, as a way of keeping the previous owners involved following the acquisition. The terms and conditions of an earnout are largely dependent on which party will actually manage the business following the closing. If the buyer will manage the business, the seller may be concerned with mismanagement by the buyer which causes the company to miss targets. On the other hand, if the seller will manage the business, the buyer may be concerned with the seller either minimizing or understating expenses or overstating revenue so as to manipulate the earnout calculation. Performance metrics The financial targets used in an earnout calculation may include revenue, net income, EBITDA or EBIT targets, and the selection of metrics also influences the terms and conditions of the earnout. Sellers tend to prefer revenue as the simplest measurement, but revenue can be boosted through business activities that hurt the bottom line of the company. On the other hand, while buyers tend to prefer net income as the most accurate reflection of overall economic performance, this number can be manipulated downward through extensive capital expenditures and other front-loaded business expenses. Some earnouts may be based on entirely non-financial targets such as the development of a product or the execution of a contract. Other performance metrics may include sales (gross or net), gross profit, operating income (EBIT), operating cash flow (EBITDA), environmental costs, cost savings from synergies, reduction of debt or derivatives of any of these. Limitations Earnouts have several fundamental limitations. They generally work best when the business is operated as envisioned at the time of the transaction, and are not conducive to changing the business plan in response to future issues. In some transactions, the buyer may have the ability to block the earnout targets from being met. Outside factors may also impact the company's ability to achieve earnout targets. Because of these limitations, sellers often negotiate earnout terms very carefully.

Life R√©gnier was born in Chartres, capital city of the current department of Eure-et-Loir, in Centre-Val de Loire region . His father, Jacques R√©gnier, was a bourgeois of good means and position; his mother, Simone Desportes, was the sister of the poet Philippe Desportes. Desportes, who was richly beneficed and in great favor at court, seems to have been regarded as Mathurin R√©gnier's natural protector and patron; and the boy himself, with a view to his following in his uncle's steps, was tonsured at eight years old. Little is known of his youth, and it is chiefly conjecture which fixes the date of his visit to Italy in a humble position in the suite of the cardinal, Fran√ßois de Joyeuse, in 1587. The cardinal was accredited to the papal court in that year as protector of the royal interests. Regnier found his duties irksome, and when, after many years of constant travel in the cardinals service, he returned definitely to France about 1605, he took advantage of the hospitality of Desportes. He early began the practice of satirical writing, and the enmity which existed between his uncle and the poet Fran√ßois de Malherbe gave him occasion to attack the latter. In 1606 Desportes died, leaving nothing to R√©gnier, who, though disappointed of the succession to Desportes's abbacies, obtained a pension of 2000 livres, chargeable upon one of them. He was also made in 1609 canon of Chartres through his friendship with the lax bishop, Philippe Hurault, at whose abbey of Royaumont he spent much time in the later years of his life. But the death of Henri IV. deprived him of his last hope of great preferments. His later life had been one of dissipation, and he died at Rouen at his hotel, the Ecu d'Orlans, in October 1613. Works About the time of his death numerous collections of licentious and satirical poems were published, while others remained in manuscript. Gathered from these there has been a floating mass of licentious epigrams, etc., attributed to R√©gnier, little of which is certainly authentic, so that it is very rare to find two editions of R√©gnier which exactly agree in contents. His undoubted work falls into three classes: regular satires in alexandrine couplets, serious poems in various metres, and satirical or jocular epigrams and light pieces, which often, if not always, exhibit considerable licence of language. The real greatness of R√©gnier consists in the vigour and polish of his satires, contrasted and heightened as that vigour is with the exquisite feeling and melancholy music of some of his minor poems. In these R√©gnier is a disciple of Pierre Ronsard (whom he defended brilliantly against Malherbe), without the occasional pedantry, the affectation or the undue fluency of the La Pl√©iade; but in the satires he seems to have had no master except the ancients, for some of them were written before the publication of the satires of Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, and the Tragiques of Agrippa d'Aubign√© did not appear until 1616. He has sometimes followed Horace closely, but always in an entirely original spirit. His vocabulary is varied and picturesque, and is not marred by the maladroit classicism of some of the Ronsardists. His verse is extraordinarily forcible and virgorous, but his chief distinction as a satirist is the way in which he avoids the commonplaces of satire. His keen and accurate knowledge of human nature and even his purely literary qualities extorted the admiration of Boileau. R√©gnier displayed remarkable independence and acuteness in literary criticism, and the famous passage (Satire ix., A Monsieur Rapin) in which he satirizes Malherbe contains the best denunciation of the merely correct theory of poetry that has ever been written. Lastly, Regnier had a most unusual descriptive faculty, and the vividness of what he called his narrative satires was not approached in France for at least two centuries after his death. All his merits are displayed in the masterpiece entitled Macette ou l'Hypocrisie dconcerte, which does not suffer even on comparison with Tartuffe; but hardly any one of the sixteen satires which he has left falls below a very high standard. Les Premieres d'Euvres ou satyres de Regnier (Paris, 1608) included the Discours au rol and ten satires. There was another in 1609, and others in 1612 and 1613. The author had also contributed to two collections : Les Muses gaillardes in 1609 and Le Temple d'Apollon in 1611. In 1616 appeared Les Satyres et autres cvuvres folastres du sieur R√©gnier, with many additions and some poems by other hands. Two famous editions by Elzevir (Leiden, 1642 and 1652) are highly prized. The chief editions of the 18th century are that of Claude Brossette (printed by Lyon & Woodman, London, 1729), which supplies the standard commentary on R√©gnier, and that of Lenglet Dufresnoy (printed by J. Tonson, London, 1733). The editions of Prosper Poitevin (Paris, 1860), of Ed. de Barthlemy (Paris, 1862), and of E. Courbet (Paris, 1875), may be specially mentioned. The last, printed after the originals in italic type, and well edited, is perhaps the best. See also Vianey's Mathurin R√©gnier (1896); M. H. Cherrier, Bibliographie de Mathurin R√©gnier (1884).

Established in 1891, Mass Maritime is the second oldest state maritime academy in the United States. Originally established to graduate deck and engineering officers for the U.S. Merchant Marine, the academy has since expanded its curriculum. Though not required, some graduates go on to serve in active and reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces. The academy operates a training ship, the USTS Kennedy. History USS Ranger Massachusetts Maritime Academy was founded by an act of the state legislature on June 11, 1891 as the Massachusetts Nautical Training School; the name was changed in 1913 to the Massachusetts Nautical School and it took its present name in 1942. The school's first training ship was the USS Enterprise on loan from the Navy. The school was located at a pier in Boston until 1936. It then was moved to Hyannis, MA on Cape Cod, where it remained until after World War II. In 1946, the Academy acquired land at the State Pier on Taylors Point in Buzzards Bay, MA at the southern end of the Cape Cod Canal with a berth deep enough to accommodate the USS Charleston, the school's new training ship. A classroom building was built, but life and education at the school continued to revolve around its training ships for the next 25 years. In 1972, the state legislature appropriated money to build brick dormitories, a cadet mess hall, the library, a second classroom building that also encompassed the school's administrative offices, a football field and baseball diamond, and a gymnasium. At that time, the structure of the Corps of Cadets shifted from ship-based watches and divisions to a platoon, company and battalion system similar to that of the Naval Academy better suited to the new dormitories. Women were first admitted to the academy in 1978, with the Class of 1981. At that time, the existing battalion structure was expanded to become a two- battalion regiment as two additional company dormitories were completed. The most recently completed building was for the school's radar simulator trainer. One unique off-campus program run by the Academy is the scale model ship- handling program (similar to the supertanker training school in France) that is run on a pond ten miles from the campus. It is the only program of its kind in the United States. Many types of 'ships' and several scale model 'ports' are set up on the pond. The quality of the training ship's officers receive from this program is such that the U.S. Coast Guard will remit a quarter of the sea time required to upgrade a deck officer's license from Chief Mate to Master upon successful completion of the course. Mass. Maritime's traditional Marine Transportation or Marine Engineering majors were expanded to include many additional maritime-related majors in 1990 (see Academic Programs, below) in time for the school's centennial celebration. At the same time, for the first time the Academy began offering master's degree programs in various disciplines. In 2008, the Academy acquired a Vestas 660-kilowatt wind turbine and began installation of solar power screens on top of the dormitories. As the windspeed across the campus averages 12 to 15 knots year round, the location is ideal for wind power. At present, 30% of the Academy's power needs are supplied by the wind turbine and solar power. The current administration hopes to eventually make Massachusetts Maritime Academy's campus self- sufficient in regard to electric power. As it is, the Academy is the 'greenest' of the twelve colleges in the state college system and one of the greenest colleges in the country. Regiment of Cadets All residential students are members of the Academy's Regiment of Cadets. Within the Regiment, cadets supervise other cadets in a broad variety of activities, including the orientation of freshmen, room inspections, Morning Formation, daily cleaning stations, study hours, sea term planning and shipboard responsibilities. Students who seek to enroll in the Facilities Engineering or the Emergency Management programs as non-uniformed commuter students must apply in writing for admission to that status. Academy freshmen, called \\"Youngies\\" (short for \\"young ladies and gentlemen\\"), arrive at the Academy in mid-August for Orientation, a two-week military-style indoctrination program that is physically and mentally demanding. It encompasses regimental training, military drill, and physical fitness. It also serves as an introduction to shipboard/maritime safety, nomenclature, and customs. The indoctrination period and cadet candidate program is essential to the preparation for the youngies' first semester at sea (sea term) in January. After Orientation, the academic year begins. For the rest of their first academic year as fourth class cadets, Youngies continue to be required to adhere to stringent rules affecting many aspects of their daily life. Second class cadets (juniors) are designated Squad Leaders and are in charge of the training of the Youngies. First class cadets (seniors) hold cadet officer positions within the regiment and/or aboard the training ship. =Special units=Regimental Band and Chorus Composed on average 60 members, the MMA Band and Chorus is the premier musical ensemble of the Academy and the official music department at MMA. It takes part in all ceremonial events at MMA as well as changes of command, military retirements, and funerals at Massachusetts National Cemetery along with other major events nationwide. The band also provides music for community events around the New England, region. The band consists of the following ensembles: *Ceremonial Field and Concert Band *Stowaway String Band *Chamber Chorus *Jazz Ensemble \\"First Watch\\" *Rock Band *Buccaneers Brass Band *Drum Line \\"The Groove Merchants\\" MMA Band Staff: *Lieutenant Commander Wayne Magee, Director *Dominic Vaccari, Drum Major *Greg Mills, Operations Officer Alpha Platoon The Alpha Platoon is the regiment's exhibition drill unit whose members are selected after a semester of mastering drill and ceremony. Honour Guard The honour guard is primarily a ceremonial colour guard consisting of at least 6 cadets. They are responsible for the posting of the colours during athletic events. It also maintains a sabre team for other events at the MMA. Academics Prior to the expansion of its offered majors in 1990, the academy was exclusively a merchant marine college, tasked with the training of future cargo ship officers. The academy only offered majors in the ship transport subjects of Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering. The academy now offers many more majors focused on maritime subjects including graduate degrees. =Sea term= USTS Enterprise in 2005 Sea terms are conducted between the two academic semesters, in January and February. Cadets register soon after the New Year holiday and prepare the USTS Kennedy for sailing, including loading provisions in the freezers and dry stores spaces. The ship sails for foreign ports of the Caribbean Sea three out of four years, and one in four formerly traveled to the Mediterranean Sea. At least one of the Caribbean voyages includes the Panama Canal and an Equator crossing. The voyage lasts about 52 days on average, and during that time a cadet will rotate through class and laboratory training at sea, ships operations including deck and engine watches, maintenance and emergency drills. Port visits offer a time to relax, but still include watch responsibilities and ship's maintenance.

Cadets spend 100 days in the Shanghai program taking maritime business, law, and marketing classes and exploring the country to gain the experience they will need in the international maritime field. Four months later, Chinese cadets make the trek to Taylor's Point and spend a semester at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. They are immersed into American culture, featuring trips to Boston, New York, Washington DC, and Plymouth Plantation. Campus alternative and renewable energy Massachusetts Maritime Academy has done a great deal of work to incorporate green and safe energy to the campus. The campus green energy initiative consists of solar panels on top of the dormitories that provide 81 kilowatts of solar power to the campus. The Academy also owns a 660 kilowatt wind turbine that provides nearly 20 percent of the campus's electricity. Combined heat and power has been installed in the dormitories. Micro-turbines (small scale combustion turbines) generate electricity for the campus while utilizing the waste heat and flue exhaust to heat the hot water used in the dormitories. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Information Commons is a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum Building. The 42,000 square foot building opened in September 2011 and was a 23 million dollar project. The construction of the building used 100% recycled steel; 20% recycled concrete; and 40% recycled insulation. The wood in the building is all bamboo as well. The building is cooled and heated by a geothermal system along with chilled beam technology. Additional light sensors and natural light are provided with skylights reducing the need for artificial lighting when enough natural light is present. The building is furnished with water conserving fixtures and the landscaping uses no irrigation for the planted areas. Water captured from the roof irrigates plantings adjacent to the building. In addition, the pitch of the roof of the ABS Information Commons increases the airflow directed towards the wind turbine by 8%. Athletics Sports teams for Massachusetts Maritime Academy compete as the Buccaneers and currently include baseball, men's and women's crew, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's lacrosse, sailing, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's track & field, and volleyball.

Dixon (also used for The Hardy Boys) and published almost exclusively by Grosset & Dunlap. The novels were produced between 1927 and 1943. The principal author was John W. Duffield, who also contributed to the Don Sturdy and Bomba the Jungle Boy series. As \\"Richard H. Stone\\" he also launched a second Stratemeyer aviation series, the Slim Tyler Air stories (1930‚Äì1932).

The Village is located along the B1145County A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, page 230 a route which runs between King's Lynn and Mundesley. English: habitational name from a place in Norfolk named in Old English with briosa 'gadfly' (Horsefly) + leah 'woodland clearing'. Brisley although not recorded in the Domesday Book, had risen to become the 8th most affluent, out of 31 parishes in the Launditch hundred, by the time of the 1334 Lay Subsidy. Notable buildings=St Bartholomews Church= St Bartholomews Church was entirely rebuilt in the period 1370‚Äì1460. It seems probable that the money for this great rebuilding was derived from wool, which was Brisley's main source of wealth at that time and the probable reason for its rapid rise in prosperity in the 14th century. Inside the church, two wall paintings of St Christopher, dating back to medieval times can be found opposite both the North and South doorways. These were whitewashed over at the Reformation and so only traces survive. The fact that there are two indicates that this was an important church for travellers. The crypt under the sanctuary may be entered through an old oak door in the chancel. It has been called a charnel house but at one time it was a place where civil prisoners could be forced to spend a night on the journey by foot to Norwich gaol. =Brisley Hall= Brisley Hall (private dwelling) is a Grade II* listed building with medieval origins. The family Athow was Lord of Manor until 1678. (Their brasses are in the church). =The Bell Inn= The Bell Inn. The Rectory Courts were held here in the 18th century.

Not only was it used as a church it was also a Sunday School. It has now been converted and lovingly restored and used as a private dwelling. It sits in a beautiful location in Norfolk over looking fields all around. Notable people=Fuller Pilch= Whilst the legendary 19th century English cricket batsman Fuller Pilch was probably raised in Brisley, it is the village of Horningtoft, about 2 km north west of Brisley which claims the honour of being his birthplace. =Richard Taverner= The village sign stands next to the church of St Bartholomew's and depicts Richard Taverner who was born here and translated the Bible into English for which he was imprisoned in the Tower of London.

History  The village can trace its origins back for more than 2000 years, when the area was inhabited by the Guanche natives. The village became known as Adfatagad in the 16th century, around the time when the struggle for control of the Canary Islands between the Guanches and the Spanish was taking place. Many of the battles in the final stages of this conflict took place in and around the Barranco de Fataga. By the end of the 19th century, Fataga had some 650 inhabitants, dedicated to the farming of cereals, vegetables and fruits, as well as cattle. At that time it was a self-sufficient farming community, owing its prosperity to the water source known as \\"El Cercado de Fataga\\" (The Orchard of Fataga) or \\"Fuente Grande\\" (Great Spring).  Description  Fataga is a very popular day-trip destination for holidaymakers staying in the coastal regions of Gran Canaria. It is a characteristic village of the island, with its old narrow lanes paved with stones and famous historic Canarian houses. It is a candidate for a listing as World Heritage Site. The village is in Fataga ravine (barranco de Fataga), an environment of brown rocks strewn with green known as the \\"valley of the thousand palms\\". The church, dedicated to St. Jos√©, was built in 1880. In the period up to the present day new farms and houses were built, often growing fruits such as oranges, lemons, apricots and grapes. However the population of the village has now dropped to around 265. Fataga has three restaurants, tourist areas, one of the oldest bakeries on the island and a watermill. Little artisan shops can be found near the church as much as near the bakery. Lastly but not least, the Arteara necropolis is halfway up from Maspalomas in Arteara.

(National Portrait Gallery, London) Robert Moffat (21 December 1795 ‚Äì 9 August 1883) was a Scottish Congregationalist missionary to Africa, father-in-law of David Livingstone, and first translator of the Bible into Setswana. Life Moffat was born of humble parentage in Ormiston, East Lothian. To find employment, he moved south to Cheshire in England as a gardener. In 1814, whilst employed at West Hall, High Legh in Cheshire he experienced difficulties with his employer due to his Methodist sympathies. For a short period, after having applied successfully to the London Missionary Society (LMS) to become an overseas missionary, he took an interim post as a farmer, at Plantation Farm in Dukinfield (where he first met Mary his future wife). The job had been found for him by William Roby, who took Moffat under his wing for a year. In September 1816, Moffat was formally commissioned at Surrey Chapel in London as a missionary of LMS (on the same day as John Williams) and was sent out to South Africa. His fianc√©e Mary Smith (1795‚Äì1870) was able to join him three years later, after he returned to Cape Town from Namaqualand. In 1820 Moffat and his wife left the Cape and proceeded to Griquatown, where their daughter Mary (who was later to marry David Livingstone) was born. The family later settled at Kuruman, to the north of the Vaal River, among the Batswana people. Here they lived and worked passionately for the missionary cause, enduring many hardships. Once he went for days without water and his mouth became so dry he was unable to speak. Often he bound his stomach to help him endure fasting when he could not find food to eat.Lorella Rouster, Testimonies of Faith, \\"Steady in All Circumstances--Robert and Mary Moffatt,\\" (Cleveland, OH:Sunday School Times/Gospel Herald, Summer Quarter, 2006), p. 156 During this period, Robert Moffat made frequent journeys into the neighbouring regions as far north as the Matabele country. He communicated the results of these journeys to the Royal Geographical Society (Journal 25-38 and Proceedings ii). Whilst in Britain on leave (1839‚Äì43) an account of the family's experience, Missionary Labours and Scenes in South Africa (1842) was published. He translated the whole of the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress into Setswana. Besides his early training as a gardener and farmer, and later as a writer, Moffat developed skills in building, carpentry, printing and as a blacksmith. Robert and Mary Moffat had ten children: Mary (who married David Livingstone), Ann, Robert (who died as an infant), Robert (who died at the age of 36, leaving an uncompleted, but published, work on the Setswana language),Robert Moffat, Jr. (1864) The \\"Standard Alphabet\\" Problem in the Sechuana Language Helen, Elizabeth (who also died as an infant), James, John, Elizabeth and Jean. Their son John Smith Moffat became an LMS missionary and took over the running of the mission at Kuruman before entering colonial service. Their grandson Howard Unwin Moffat became a prime minister of Southern Rhodesia. Mary preceded Robert in death in 1870, at home in England where they had returned because of failing health. For the last twelve years of his life, Robert spoke throughout England, seeking to raise interest in the mission work. He was presented to Queen Victoria twice at her request and was presented with a Doctor of Divinity degree from Edinburgh University.Ethel Daniels Hubbard, The Moffats, (New York: Missionay Education Movement of the U.S. & Canada, 1917) p.285-286 Robert Moffat died at Leigh, near Tunbridge Wells, on 9 August 1883, and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery. A memorial monument, paid for by public subscription, was erected at his birthplace in 1885. Legacy * Residents of High Legh organise a Robert Moffat Memorial 10 km run beginning and ending at his cottage. * His printing work in Kuruman was supported by an iron hand press that was brought to Natal in 1825 and taken to Kuruman in 1831. Rev. Moffat used it until 1870 when he retired, after which it was taken over by William Aston and A J Gould and was in use until about 1882. In 1918 it was taken to the Kimberley Public Library where it remained until it was returned to the Moffat Mission in Kuruman in 1996. It is back in occasional use printing commemorative documents.

In the parliamentary election, Issoufou's party, the PNDS, won 13 seats in the National Assembly, and Issoufou himself won a seathttp://droit.francophonie.org/df-web/publication.do?publicationId=548 as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency.http://droit.francophonie.org/df- web/publication.do?publicationId=1024 Together with other opposition parties, the PNDS then joined a coalition, the Alliance of the Forces of Change (AFC). This coalition held the majority of the newly elected seats in the National Assembly. Later in February 1993, Issoufou ran as the PNDS candidate in the presidential election. He placed third, winning 15.92 percent of the vote. The AFC then supported second-place finisher Mahamane Ousmane for president in the second round of the election, held on 27 March. Ousmane won the election, defeating Tandja Mamadou, the candidate of the National Movement of the Development Society (MNSD); with the AFC holding a parliamentary majority, Issoufou became Prime Minister on 17 April 1993. Conflict, cohabitation, and arrest: 1994-1999 On 28 September 1994, Issoufou resigned in response to a decree from Ousmane a week earlier that weakened the powers of the prime minister, and the PNDS withdrew from the governing coalition. As a result, the coalition lost its parliamentary majority and Ousmane called a new parliamentary election to be held in January 1995. Issoufou and the PNDS forged an alliance with their old opponents, the MNSD, and in the January 1995 election that alliance won a slight majority of seats; Issoufou was then elected as President of the National Assembly. The opposition's victory in the election led to cohabitation between President Ousmane and a government, backed by a parliamentary majority, that opposed him; the result was political deadlock. With the dispute between President Ousmane and the government deepening, on 26 January 1996 Issoufou requested that the Supreme Court remove Ousmane from office for alleged incapacity to govern. A day later, on 27 January 1996, Ibrahim Bar√© Ma√Ønassara seized power in a military coup. Issoufou, along with President Ousmane and Prime Minister Hama Amadou, was arrested and subsequently placed under house arrest until April 1996. They were all put on television by the military regime in February 1996 to endorse the official view that the coup was caused by flaws in the political system and that changes in the system were needed. Issoufou placed fourth (receiving only 7.60% of the vote) in the flawed and controversial 7-8 July 1996 presidential election that gave Ma√Ønassara an outright victory. Along with the three other opposition candidates, Issoufou was placed under house arrest on the second day of polling and held for two weeks. Afterward, he refused to meet with Ma√Ønassara, unsuccessfully appealed to the Supreme Court for the election to be annulled, and the PNDS called for demonstrations. On 26 July he was again placed under house arrest, along with another leading PNDS member, Mohamed Bazoum; they were freed on the order of a judge on 12 August. Following a pro-democracy demonstration on 11 January 1997, Issoufou was arrested along with Ousmane and Tandja and held until 23 January.\\"Niger: Harassment of government opponents has become systematic\\", Amnesty International, 30 April 1997. Opposition leader: 1999-2010 Ma√Ønassara was killed in another military coup in April 1999, and new elections were held in late in the year. In the first round of the presidential election, held in October, Issoufou placed second, winning 22.79% of the vote. He was later defeated by Tandja Mamadou in the November run-off, capturing 40.11% of the vote compared to Tandja's 59.89%. , democratie.francophonie.org He was backed in the second round by the unsuccessful first round candidates Hamid Algabid, Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye, and Ali Djibo, while Tandja received Ousmane's support. After the announcement of the provisional results showing Tandja's victory, Issoufou accepted them and congratulated Tandja. In the November 1999 parliamentary election, Issoufou was again elected to the National Assembly as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency. In a repeat of the 1999 election, Issoufou placed second behind incumbent Tandja in the 2004 presidential election, winning 24.60% of the vote. He was defeated in the run-off, winning 34.47% of the vote to Tandja's 65.53%; , democratie.francophonie.org . however, that was still considered an impressive result for Issoufou, as he had substantially increased his share of the vote even though the other first round candidates had backed Tandja in the second round. Issoufou, who targeted corruption in his campaign, accused Tandja of using state funds for his own campaign, along with other accusations of electoral misconduct, and said that the election was not as transparent as the 1999 election. In the December 2004 parliamentary election, Issoufou was re-elected to the National Assembly as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency. =2009 political crisis= In 2009, the PNDS strongly opposed Tandja's efforts to hold a referendum on the creation of a new constitution that would allow him to run for re-election indefinitely. At an opposition rally in Niamey on 9 May 2009, Issoufou accused Tandja of seeking \\"a new constitution to stay in power forever\\" and the establishment of \\"a dictatorship and a monarchy\\". As leader of the Front for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) opposition coalition, he said on 4 June 2009 that a planned anti-referendum protest would be held on 7 June despite an official ban. As part of the constitutional dispute, Tandja assumed emergency powers on 27 June. Accusing Tandja of undertaking a coup d'√©tat, \\"violating the constitution and ... forfeit[ing] all political and moral legitimacy\\", Issoufou called on the armed forces to ignore his orders and urged the international community to intervene. Issoufou was detained at his home by the army's paramilitary police on 30 June; he was questioned and released after about an hour. A nationwide strike called by the FDD was held on 1 July and was deemed partially successful by the press. The referendum was held on 4 August 2009, despite the opposition's furious objections and calls for a boycott, and it was successful. Speaking on 8 August, shortly after the announcement of results, Issoufou vowed that the opposition would \\"resist and fight against this coup d'etat enacted by President Tandja and against his aim of installing a dictatorship in our country\\".http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=68&art;_id=nw20090808172149889C540772 On 14 September 2009, Issoufou was charged with misappropriation of funds and then released on bail. He said that he was actually charged for political reasons. He left the country. On 29 October 2009, international warrants for the arrest of Issoufou and Hama Amadou were issued by the Nigerien government, and Issoufou returned to Niamey from Nigeria late on 30 October in order \\"to cooperate with the judiciary\\". Tandja was ousted in a February 2010 military coup, and a new transitional junta enabled the opposition leaders to return to politics in Niger while preparing for elections in 2011. At a meeting in early November 2010, the PNDS designated Issoufou as the party's candidate for the January 2011 presidential election. Issoufou said on the occasion that \\"the moment has come, the conditions are right\\", and he called on party members to \\"turn these conditions into votes at the ballot box\\". Some observers considered Issoufou to be potentially the strongest candidate in the election. Presidency: 2011-present Issoufou with Obamas in August 2014 Issoufou won the January-March 2011 presidential election in a second round of voting against MNSD candidate Seyni Oumarou and was inaugurated as President on 7 April 2011, succeeding Salou Djibo, the Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy. He named Brigi Rafini as Prime Minister. In July 2011, a planned assassination of Issoufou was allegedly uncovered. A major, lieutenant, and three other soldiers in Niger's military were arrested. On 7 November 2015, the PNDS designated Issoufou as its candidate for the 2016 presidential election.\\"Niger's President Issoufou chosen to run for second term\\", Reuters, 7 November 2015. In February 2016 Issoufou won 48% of the votes in the first round of the elections. As no candidate obtained a majority a second round was needed. A coalition of opposition parties boycotted the second round, saying that Issoufou had become increasingly authoritarian. Issoufou subsequently won with 92.5% of the votes. He has been described by The Economist as \\"a staunch ally of the West\\".

In such an agreement, one party (the promisee) will provide some performance in exchange for a promise by the other party (the testator, because they must draft a will) to make a specific bequest to the promisee party in the testator's will. Most jurisdictions recognize such contracts as valid, although a few hold them as void against public policy. Some jurisdictions will not recognize an oral contract for such a purpose, requiring instead that the contract be executed in writing and signed by both parties. Some jurisdictions require full compliance with the Statute of Wills to be effective, i.e., in writing and signed in the presence of two witnesses. The general rule, where such contracts are recognized, is that the promisee can not specifically enforce the contract if the testator later revokes or supersedes the will making the promised bequest, but can only sue the testator's estate for breach of contract. This protects the testator's very strong freedom to dispose of his property however he sees fit. For example, suppose Joey agrees to execute a will bequeathing his house to Rachel in exchange for services provided by Rachel. If Joey later revokes that will, Rachel can not force Joey's estate to convey the house to her, but can only sue for the value of the house. Typically, will contracts are made between people who have different heirs to whom they wish to leave their property at death, but they may wish for the other person to have the use of until all of their combined assets until the death of the second to die. A married couple with children from an earlier marriage is a good example. The husband may leave his separate estate to his wife at his death, instead of directly to his children from his earlier marriage and in exchange, she may agree to combine his separate estate with her separate estate at her death and split the combined estate up between all of their children. It would work the same if she died first. A will contract only becomes irrevocable only at the first party's death. Because of differences in state laws regarding will contracts, an estate planning attorney should be consulted before use of this planning device. The law behind wills becomes tedious when many parties are not present, typically in cases with limited family members. This mainly occurred after World War Two where many wills had no possible recipients so the assets went to the government. Wills are often confused with trust funds, but wills are only present at death whereas trust funds can be accessed during the time that the creator of the fund is still alive.

High Court Building  Admiralty Queensway in Admiralty The High Court Building is located at 38 Queensway, Admiralty. The 20-storey building was built in 1985 as the home of the then Supreme Court of Hong Kong, which was renamed in 1997. It was named the Supreme Court Building, and the road leading to its main entrance is still named Supreme Court Road. The High Court Building was designed by Architect K. M. Tseng. The structure is a white clad tower and has a water fountain outside its front door. Sometimes, the High Court may sit in another venue.Rules of the High Court (Cap. 4A), Order 33, rule 1 For example, a serving District Judge sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge may hear a case in a courtroom situated in the District Court building.

One of the items Aunt Ada had left is a painting of a house by a river. The picture strongly reminds Tuppence of a house she once saw and immediately liked. The painting was supposedly given to Aunt Ada by Mrs Lancaster. In Book 2 Tommy is away for a few days, so Tuppence starts looking for the mystery house on her own. Eventually she finds it in a small village called Sutton Chancellor. It turns out that the house is divided in a peculiar way. The back part of the house is rented by a middle-aged couple called the Perrys. The front part has been vacant for years. Tuppence meets with the people of Sutton Chancellor. There is an elderly vicar, a talkative B&B; landlady called Mrs Copleigh, and a Miss Bligh who seems to run the parish. Under the pretence of house hunting, Tuppence tries to get more information about the house. Mrs. Copleigh tells her a grim story about a spate of child killings some years ago. Then Tuppence fails to return home on the arranged day, having been concussed by a blow to the head. In Book 3 Tommy and his servant Albert are worried about Tuppence. Tommy does some investigation on his own. He discovers the painting was by an artist called Boscowan who died several years ago. Tommy meets with the doctor of Sunny Ridge. There have been some deaths that the doctor finds odd and he is worried about possible foul play. Tommy then talks to an investigator friend who hints the house in Sutton Chancellor might have been used as a safe house for a criminal gang. Tommy shows the painting to Mrs Boscowan, who notes that someone has added a boat to the picture. At home, Tommy learns that Tuppence is in a hospital near Sutton Chancellor with severe concussion. Tommy and Albert then find a hidden letter from Aunt Ada, in which she suspects there is malice in Sunny Ridge. In Book 4 Tuppence has recovered. An old doll she found in the mysterious house turns out to contain uncut diamonds. A party is arranged in Sutton Chancellor. Sir Phillip Starke, the local landowner, and Mrs Boscowan are invited. Tuppence has the impression that Sir Phillip knows more about the whole affair. The next day Tuppence goes to the vicarage and confronts Miss Bligh, who she suspects was the one who hit her on the head. Alone, Tuppence goes to the mystery house and to her surprise finds the missing Mrs Lancaster. She takes Tuppence to a secret part of the house and proceeds to tell her life story. She was a wild child, a dancer, who got pregnant young. After she chose to abort the baby (‚ÄúI was a dancer, I didn‚Äôt want a child... the doctor said it would be all right, but it wasn‚Äôt all right‚Äù), she took up with a criminal gang; they used the house to hide their loot. Later she left that life behind and got married, hoping to have a family, but could not conceive again and in her grief and guilt over the abortion became unhinged and started killing children. ‚ÄúThe only way to atone for the first murder was more murders‚Äî they were sacrifices, see?‚Äù One of the other residents, Mrs Moody, in Sunny Ridge had recognised her, so she had to be silenced. Miss Bligh, posing as a relative, resettled her into a new home. After her candour, Mrs Lancaster attempts to kill Tuppence, first with poisoned milk, then with a metal blade. Tuppence is saved just in time. It is revealed that Mrs Lancaster is actually the wife of Sir Phillip Starke. He had covered up her insanity and the crimes she committed. He was assisted in the cover-up by Miss Bligh, his former secretary and confidante. Tommy and Tuppence then return home. Literary significance and reception The novel is dedicated \\"to the many readers in this and other countries who write to me asking: 'What has happened to Tommy and Tuppence? What are they doing now?'\\" Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) in The Guardian's issue of 13 December 1968 admitted that, \\"This is a thriller, not a detective story, and needless to say an ingenious and exciting one; but anyone can write a thriller (well, almost anyone), whereas a genuine Agatha Christie could be written by one person only.\\"The Guardian, 13 December 1968 (p. 10). Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 17 November 1968 said, \\"Not her best though it has patches of her cosy euphoria and aura of the sinister.\\"The Observer, 17 November 1968 (p. 28) Robert Barnard said that this novel \\"Begins rather well, with a vicious old aunt of Tommy's in a genteel old people's home, but declines rapidly into a welter of half-realised plots and a plethora of those conversations, all too familiar in late Christie, which meander on through irrelevancies, repetitions and inconsequentialities to end nowhere (as if she had sat at the feet of Samuel Beckett).‚Äù He concluded his negative assessment of the plot by saying that it ‚ÄúMakes one appreciate the economy of dialogue ‚Äì all point, or at least possible point, in early Christie.\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 2005, the novel was adapted by the French director Pascal Thomas under the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit... The novel was adapted into a television film in 2006 as part of the Marple series starring Geraldine McEwan even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. The plot was altered with Tommy away on military intelligence business abroad, and Tommy's part of the story was re-written for Miss Marple. Tommy was portrayed as a self- important strong male, while Tuppence was portrayed as a maudlin alcoholic who carried a hip flask and who was resentful of her husband's success; she too was going to be signed-up by MI6 but had then not been able to fulfill this ambition as she was pregnant with their first child. Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi. The time in which this adaption is set is somewhere between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, but unclear and slightly inconsistent: a US B-17 (which left the UK soon after the war and was out of US service by 1949) overflies the village, yet US airmen wear the blue USAF uniform introduced in 1949, and there is also a 1951 Festival of Britain poster in the village shop.

Silvio Pellico (; 24 June 1789 - 31 January 1854) was an Italian writer, poet, dramatist and patriot active in the Italian unification. Biography Silvio Pellico was born in Saluzzo (Piedmont). He spent the earlier portion of his life at Pinerolo and Turin, under the tuition of a priest named Manavella. At the age of ten he composed a tragedy inspired by a translation of the Ossianic poems. On the marriage of his twin sister Rosina with a maternal cousin at Lyon, he went to reside in that city, devoting himself during four years to the study of French literature. He returned in 1810 to Milan, where he became professor of French in the Collegio degli Orfani Militari, now the Scuola Militare Teuli√©. His tragedy Francesca da Rimini was brought out with success by Carlotta Marchionni at Milan in 1818. Its publication was followed by that of the tragedy Euphemio da Messina, but the representation of the latter was forbidden. Pellico had in the meantime continued his work as tutor, first to the unfortunate son of Count Briche, and then to the two sons of Count . He threw himself heartily into an attempt to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. The Conciliatore, a review, appeared in 1818. Of the powerful literary executives that gathered about Counts Porro and Confalonieri, Pellico was the able secretary on whom most of the responsibility for the review, the organ of the association, fell. But the paper, under the censorship of the Austrian officials, ran for a year only, and the society itself was broken up by the government. In October 1820, Pellico was arrested on the charge of carbonarism and conveyed to the Santa Margherita prison. After his removal to the Piombi at Venice in February 1821, he composed several Cantiche and the tragedies Ester d'Engaddi and Iginici d'Asti. The Arrest of Silvio Pellico and Piero Maroncelli, Saluzzo, civic museum. The sentence of death pronounced on him in February 1822 was finally commuted to fifteen years of jail in harsh condition, and in the following April he was placed in the Spielberg, at Br√ºnn (today's Brno), where he was transferred via Udine and Ljubljana. His chief work during this part of his imprisonment was the tragedy Leoniero da Dertona, for the preservation of which he was compelled to rely on his memory. After his release in 1830, he commenced the publication of his prison compositions, of which the Ester was played at Turin in 1831, but immediately suppressed. In 1832, his Gismonda da Mendrisio, Erodiade and the Leoniero , appeared under the title of Tre nuove tragedie, and in the same year the work which gave him his European fame, ', an account of his sufferings in prison. The last gained him the friendship of the Marchesa Juliette Colbert de Barolo, the reformer of the Turin prisons, and in 1834 he accepted from her a yearly pension of 1200 francs. His tragedy Tommaso Moro had been published in 1833, his most important subsequent publication being the Opere inedite in 1837. On the decease of his parents in 1838, he was received into the Casa Barolo, where he remained until his death, assisting the marchesa in her charities, and writing chiefly upon religious themes. Of these works the best known is the Dei doveri degli uomini, a series of trite maxims which do honor to his piety rather than to his critical judgment. A fragmentary biography of the marchesa by Pellico was published in Italian and English after her death. He died in 1854 at Turin. He was buried in the Camposanto, Turin. The simple narrative and naive egotism of Le mie prigioni has established his strongest claim to remembrance, winning fame by his misfortunes rather than by his genius.The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read the work, in Italian, whilst staying in Naples in November 1888.Coustillas, Pierre ed.

This comfortable and intimate family setting is repeated in other pieces of Amarna art Princess of the Akhenaten family, Louvre Amarna art, or the Amarna style, is a style adopted in the Amarna Period during and just after the reign of Akhenaten (r. 1351‚Äì1334 BC) in the late Eighteenth Dynasty, during the New Kingdom. Whereas Ancient Egyptian art was famously slow to alter, the Amarna style was a significant and sudden break from its predecessor, which was restored after Akhenaten's death. It is characterized by a sense of movement and activity in images, with figures having raised heads, many figures overlapping and many scenes busy and crowded. The human body is portrayed differently; figures, always shown in profile on reliefs, are slender, swaying, with exaggerated extremities. In particular, depictions of Akhenaten give him distinctly feminine qualities such as large hips, prominent breasts, and a larger stomach and thighs. Other pieces, such as the most famous of all Amarna works, the Nefertiti Bust in Berlin, show much less pronounced features of the style. Amenhotep IV was one of the first to practice monotheism, the belief in just one god. Shortly after claiming the throne, he declared the god Aten, represented by the sun, was the only true god. To pay homage to his chosen god, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akenaten. Throughout his rule, Akenaten tried to change many aspects of Egyptian culture to celebrate or praise his god, especially the style and usage of art. The illustration of figures' hands and feet are apparently important. Fingers and toes are depicted as long and slender and are carefully detailed to show nails. Artists also showed subjects with elongated facial structures accompanied by folds within the skin as well as lowered eyelids. The figure was also illustrated with a more elongated body than the previous representation. In the new human form, the subject had more fat in the stomach, thigh, and breast region, while the torso, arm, and legs were thin and long like the rest of the body. The skin color of both male and female is generally dark brown (contrasted with the usual dark brown or red for males and light brown or white for females). Figures in this style are shown with both a left and a right foot, contrasting the traditional style of being shown with either two left or two right feet. Akenaten moved the royal capital to the city now known as Amarna and erected a number of palaces and temples there. After his death, conservative forces led by the temple priests reimposed the old religion. The new capital was abandoned, and traces of his monuments elsewhere defaced. Remains of Amarna art are therefore concentrated in Amarna itself, with other remains at Karnak, where large reliefs in the style were dismantled, and the blocks turned round to face inwards when a later building was constructed using them. These were only rediscovered in recent decades. It is now also thought that several of the objects in the tomb of Akenaten's son Tutankhamun were originally made for his father; for example, the relief on his throne. Tombs The decoration of the tombs of non-royals is quite different from previous eras. These tombs do not feature any funerary or agricultural scenes, nor do they include the tomb occupant unless he or she is depicted with a member of the royal family. There is an absence of gods and goddesses, apart from the Aten, the sundisc. However, the Aten does not shine its rays on the tomb owner, only on members of the royal family. There is neither a mention of Osiris nor other funerary figures. There is also no mention of a journey through the underworld. Instead, excerpts from the Hymn to the Aten are generally present. Akhenaten, Pharaoh of Egypt. Egyptian Museum, Cairo. Sculpture Sculptures from the Amarna period are set apart from other periods of Egyptian art. One reason for this is the accentuation of certain features. For instance, the portrayals feature an elongation and narrowing of the neck and head, sloping of the forehead and nose, a prominent chin, large ears and lips, spindle-like arms and calves, and large thighs, stomachs and hips. In a relief of Akhenaten, he is portrayed in an intimate setting with his primary wife, Nefertiti, and their children, the six princesses. His children appear to be fully grown, only shrunken to appear smaller than their parents, a routine stylistic feature of traditional Egyptian art. They also have elongated necks and bodies. An unfinished head of a princess from this time, in the Tutankhamun, and the golden age of the pharaohs exhibition, displays a very prominent elongation to the back of the head. The unusual, elongated skull shape often used in portrayal of the royal family \\"may be a slightly exaggerated treatment of a hereditary trait of the Amarna royal family\\", according to the Brooklyn Museum, given that \\"the mummy of Tutankhamun, presumed to be related to Akhenaten, has a similarly shaped skull, although not so elongated as [in typical Amarna-style art]\\". However, it is possible that the style is purely ritualistic. The hands at the end of each ray extending from Aten in the relief are delivering the ankh, which symbolized \\"life\\" in the Egyptian culture, to Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and often also reach the portrayed princesses. The importance of the Sun God Aten is central to much of the Amarna period art, largely because Akhenaten's rule was marked by the monotheistic following of Aten. In several sculptures of Akhenaten, if not most, he has wide hips and a visible paunch. His lips are thick, and his arms and legs are thin and lack muscular tone, unlike his counterparts of other eras in Egyptian artwork. Some scholars suggest that the presentation of the human body as imperfect during the Amarna period is in deference to Aten. Others think Akhenaten suffered from a genetic disorder, most likely the product of inbreeding, that caused him to look that way. Others interpret this unprecedented stylistic break from Egyptian tradition to be a reflection of the Amarna Royals' attempts to wrest political power from the traditional priesthood and bureaucratic authorities. Much of the finest work, including the famous Nefertiti bust in Berlin, was found in the studio of the second and last Royal Court Sculptor Thutmose, and is now in Berlin and Cairo, with some in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The period saw the use of sunk relief, previously used for large external reliefs, extended to small carvings, and used for most monumental reliefs. Sunk relief appears best in strong sunlight. This was one innovation that had a lasting effect, as raised relief is rare in later periods. Architecture Not many buildings from this period have survived the ravages of later kings, partially as they were constructed out of standard size blocks, known as talatat, which were very easy to remove and reuse. In recent decades, re-building work on later buildings has revealed large number of reused blocks from the period, with the original carved faces turned inwards, greatly increasing the amount of work known from the period. Temples in Amarna did not follow the traditional Egyptian design. They were smaller, with sanctuaries open to the sun, containing large numbers of altars. They had no closing doors.

Quartz Composer uses OpenGL (including GLSL), OpenCL (only in Mac OS X 10.6 and later), Core Image, Core Video, JavaScript, and other technologies to create an API and a developer tool around a simple visual programming paradigm. Apple has embedded Quartz technologies deeply into the operating system. Compositions created in Quartz Composer can be played standalone in any QuickTime-aware applicationQuartz Composer User Guide (although only on Mac OS X 10.4 and later), as a system Screen Saver,Quartz Composer Users Guide - Making a Screen Saver as an iTunes Visualizer, from inside the Quartz Composer application, or can be embedded into a Cocoa or Carbon application via supplied user interface widgets. While Quartz Composer is included with the iPhone SDK, there is no way of running Quartz Compositions on iOS devices. Starting in macOS 10.15 Catalina, the Quartz Composer framework has been deprecated, although it is still present for compatibility.Xcode 11 Release Notes Patches Quartz programming through Quartz Composer works by implementing and connecting patches.Quartz Composer User Guide - Patches Similar to routines in traditional programming languages, patches are base processing units. They execute and produce a result. For better performance, patch execution follows a lazy evaluation approach, meaning that patches are only executed when their output is needed. There are three types of patches: Consumers, Processors, and External Input patches that can receive and output mouse clicks, scrolls, and movements; MIDI and audio; keyboard; or other movements. A collection of patches can be melded into one, called a macro. Macros can be nested and their subroutines also edited. To control the order of rendering, each renderer is assigned a layer, indicated in its upper-right corner. Layers are rendered sequentially, lowest to highest. Renderers can be enabled or disabled, essentially turning on or off that particular layer. Turning off unused layers often results in better performance, since fewer upstream patches need to be evaluated. Some patches can have subpatches, which allows for global parameter changes to just the included subpatches. This is useful for lighting, 3D transformation, and GLSL shaders, among other things. Subpatch support is indicated by square corners on a patch, rather than the typical rounded corners. With Version 3.0, it became possible to turn compositions into Virtual Patches. These allow the user to reuse functionality without having to store duplicate copies in each composition. The Quartz Composer Editor allows the user to save a \\"flattened\\" copy (with the virtual patches fully expanded inside), for easy distribution. Version 4.0 extended this functionality even more, and automatically includes \\"flattened\\" copies of virtual patches for use as a fallback if the desired virtual patch isn't installed on the host system. This greatly simplifies composition distribution. Network functionality was greatly improved with the release of Leopard. It became possible to transmit data and synchronize over a network interface, and it also added support for Open Sound Control transmission and reception. =Plugins= The Quartz Composer 3.0 interface. Also new in Version 3.0 was the possibility to write custom patch plugins, using an Xcode template, and the notion of a \\"safe mode\\", where plugins and other unsafe patches fail to load. This prevents malicious compositions from performing dangerous or insecure operations. Custom patches using Apple's Xcode template are always considered unsafe. It was possible to develop custom patch plugins for Version 2.0, but the API was undocumented and private, and was never supported by Apple. Eventually, templates were released to simplify this procedure.fdiv.net: Xcode Template for Custom Quartz Composer Patches Hidden options In the Quartz Composer editor, holding the option key while selecting \\"Preferences...\\" from the menu adds 3 additional tabs of options for the user to configure. These options include System settings, Editor settings, and QuickTime integration settings. Notable options include expanded tooltips, software rendering, and uncapped framerate rendering. Multisample antialiasing (MSAA) was added as a hidden option in version 4.0, allowing for antialiasing inside the QC Editor, though it only works on GPU's that support MSAA. Native datatypes Data inside QC can be one of the following types: * Boolean - a boolean value, 0 or 1 * Index - a positive integer between 0 and 2147483647 * Number - a double precision floating point number * String - a unicode string * Color - an RGBA or CMYK quartet, or a Grayscale value * Image - a 2D image of arbitrary (possibly infinite) dimensions * Structure - a named or ordered collection of objects, including nested structures * Virtual - any of the above Two additional types were introduced in version 4.0: * Mesh - a collection of vertices, and per-vertex normals, texture coordinates, and colors in 3-space * Interaction - a valueless type used to associate user input with user-interactive elements of the composition =Type conversion= Data can usually be converted to other types transparently. In Quartz Composer 3.0, the connections between patches change color to indicate conversions that are taking place. Yellow connections mean no conversion is taking place, Orange indicates a possible loss of data from conversion (Number to Index), and Red indicates a severe conversion; Image to Boolean, for example. Compositions Quartz Composer documents are called Compositions. Compositions are Binary Property Lists (though XML versions are also supported) with a filename extension .qtz, and a com.apple.quartz-composer- composition UTI.Uniform Type Identifiers Overview Patches, their connections, and their input port states are saved in the composition file. Images can be stored inside a composition as well, making for self-contained compositions with embedded graphics. By dragging a movie file into the Quartz Composer editor, a reference to the movie file is created, providing a changing image that can be connected to a renderer. Compositions also store metadata such as composition author, copyright, and description. The user can also add arbitrary metadata items, if desired. Many image formats are supported, including JPEG, JPEG2000, GIF, PNG, TIFF, TGA, OpenEXR, BMP, ICO, PDF, PICT, ICNS, and some raw digital camera types.Using the ImageIO Framework Images are maintained in their native form for as long as possible before rasterizing for display. This means that Quartz Composer will keep vector images as vectors when cropping, scaling, rotating, or translating which allows it to work with very large logical image dimensions without consuming large amounts of memory or processing time. Such functionality is most apparent when working with text-based images, or PDFs. Version 3.0 added the ability to add annotations to areas of the composition, called notes. These notes parallel comments in other programming languages. Notes can be yellow, red, green, blue, or gray, and can overlap other notes. =Composition protocols= In Version 3.0, the concept of Composition Protocols was introduced. Protocols provide a template of required and optional inputs and outputs to qualify conforming compositions for various purposes. The following protocols are available by default: * Graphic Animation - These don't have required inputs or outputs, but are required to render to the screen. Graphic Animations are useful for animated backgrounds in applications such as Keynote. * Image Filter - Modifies an image using filters. No renderers are allowed in Image Filters, unless they are inside of a Render In Image environment. * Graphic Transition - Generates a transition from a source image to a destination image over a fixed time interval. * RSS Visualizer - Parses and Displays an RSS Feed. * Screen Saver - Integrates with Finder for animated screen savers. * Music Visualizer - Integrates with iTunes for audio visualization. There is an additional protocol that Apple uses in their private API: *Photo Visualizer - Receives an image list, provides information about total image count and currently displayed image. One new protocol was added in version 4.0: * Mesh Filter - deforms an input mesh. There is no officially supported way to add additional protocols to Quartz Composer. However, there are some undocumented methods that may make this possible in the future.Creating Your Own Protocols =Composition runtimes= In addition to protocols, compositions can also conform to different runtimes where Quartz Composer is available. In Leopard, there are runtimes for Tiger (32-bit), as well as 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the Leopard Quartz Composer runtime. The editor can also indicate used patches that are unsafe, or unavailable in Tiger to aid in making compatible compositions. =Composition repository= A System-wide Composition Repository is available as of Version 3.0.Quartz Composer User Guide: Composition Repository This allows applications to share and make use of common compositions for effects and processing. It is also possible for applications to query the repository for compositions that match certain criteria, such as protocol conformance. The Repository is spread across 3 file system locations: * /System/Library/Compositions - core system compositions (the user typically doesn't modify these) * /Library/Compositions - compositions available for all users * /Users/username/Library/Compositions - compositions available for only this user Adding compositions to the repository is as simple as adding the composition file to one of these locations. =Comparing compositions= It became possible to compare compositions in Quartz Composer 3.0. This feature allows the user to compare inputs, rendered output, and graph appearance of any two compositions. Related software=Quartz Composer Visualizer= A developer tool called Quartz Composer Visualizer was released with Quartz Composer 3.0 that allows compositions to be rendered across multiple screens on a single machine, or even spanned across several machines and displays. =Automator support= Support for some Automator actions was added with the release of Leopard. * Apply Quartz Composition Filter to Image Files * Convert Quartz Compositions to QuickTime Movies * Render Quartz Compositions to Image Files History Pierre-Olivier Latour originally developed the predecessor to Quartz Composer under the name PixelShox Studio.

She is credited with having coined the name \\"Nigeria\\". Early life She was born at 2 Dundas Terrace, Woolwich, South London, the fourth of fourteen children, the daughter of an English father, Captain (later Major General) George Shaw, and a French mother, Marie Adrienne Josephine (n√©e Desfontaines; 1826‚Äì1871), a native of Mauritius. She had nine sisters, the first and the last dying in infancy, and four brothers. Her paternal grandfather was Sir Frederick Shaw, third baronet (1799‚Äì1876), of Bushy Park, Dublin, and a member of parliament from 1830 to 1848, regarded as the leader of the Irish Conservatives. Her paternal grandmother, Thomasine Emily, was the sixth daughter of the Hon. George Jocelyn, and granddaughter of Robert Jocelyn, first Earl of Roden. Writing for children From 1878 to 1886, Shaw wrote five novels, four for children and one for young adults. In her books, young girls are encouraged to be resourceful and brave but in a traditional framework, acting in support of \\"gentlemanly\\" fathers and prospective husbands, rather than on their own behalf. Shaw's ideology is both sexually conservative and imperialist. * Castle Blair: A story of youthful days (First published London, 1877) * Hector, a story (First serialized in Aunt Judy's Magazine, 1880‚Äì1881) * Phyllis Browne (First serialized in Aunt Judy's Magazine, 1881‚Äì1882) * A Sea Change (First published London, 1885) * Colonel Cheswick's Campaign (Boston, 1886). Her first children's novel, Castle Blair, was translated into several languages and continued to be extremely popular in the UK and the US well into the 20th century. It was based on her own Anglo-Irish childhood experiences. Charlotte Yonge recommended it along with works of \\"some of the most respected and loved authors available in late Victorian England\\" as \\"wild... attractive and exciting\\". The critic John Ruskin called Castle Blair \\"good, and lovely, and true\\". Shaw also wrote a history of Australia for children, The story of Australia (London: Horace Marshall, 1897), as part of the Story of the Empire series. Journalism She began her career in journalism in 1886, writing for the Pall Mall Gazette and the Manchester Guardian. She was sent by the Manchester Guardian newspaper and was the only woman reporter to cover the Anti-Slavery Conference in Brussels. She became Colonial Editor for The Times, which made her the highest paid woman journalist of the time. In that connection, she was sent as a special correspondent to Southern Africa in 1892 and in 1901 and to Australia and New Zealand in 1892, partly to study the question of Kanaka labour in the sugar plantations of Queensland. Penneshaw, South Australia is partly named after her.Rodney Cockburn (1908) What's in a name? Nomenclature of South Australia: Fergusson Publications She also made two journeys to Canada, in 1893 and 1898, the second including a journey to the gold diggings of Klondike. Her belief in the positive benefits of the British Empire infused her writing. As a correspondent for The Times, Shaw sent back \\"Letters\\" in 1892 and 1893 from her travels in South Africa and Australia, later published in book form as Letters from South Africa (1893). Writing for the educated governing circles, she focused on the prospects of economic growth and the political consolidation of self-governing colonies within an increasingly-united empire, with a vision largely blinkered to the force of colonial nationalisms and local self-identities. The lengthy articles in a leading daily newspaper reveal a late-Victorian metropolitan imagery of colonial space and time. Shaw projected vast empty spaces awaiting energetic English settlers and economic enterprise. Observing new landscapes from a rail carriage, for example, she selected images which served as powerful metaphors of time and motion in the construction of racial identities. When she first started writing for The Times, she wrote under the name of \\"F. Shaw\\" to try to disguise that she was a woman. Later, she was so highly regarded that she wrote openly as Flora Shaw. Her pseudonym is now little-known, and she was regarded as one of the greatest journalists of her time, specialising in politics and economics. =Zebehr Pasha= Shaw first took advantage of a journalistic opportunity while she was staying with family friends, the Younghusbands, in Gibraltar in 1886. There, over four months, she visited Zebehr Pasha, a slaver and former Sudanese governor, who was incarcerated there. Her reports purportedly led to his release. =Jameson Raid = Flora was required to testify before the House of Commons Select Committee on British South Africa during the controversy on the Jameson Raid into the Transvaal on 29 December 1895. The prominent journalist had corresponded frequently with those involved or suspected of involvement, including Cecil Rhodes, Leander Starr Jameson, Colonel Francis Rhodes, and Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. She was exonerated from all charges. =Naming Nigeria= In an essay that first appeared in The Times on 8 January 1897, by \\"Miss Shaw\\", she suggested the name \\"Nigeria\\" for the British Protectorate on the Niger River. In her essay, Shaw made the case for a shorter term that would be used for the \\"agglomeration of pagan and Mahomedan States\\" to replace the official title, \\"Royal Niger Company Territories\\". She thought that the term \\"Royal Niger Company Territories\\" was too long to be used as a name of a Real Estate Property, under the Trading Company in that part of Africa. She was in search of a new name, and she coined \\"Nigeria\\", in preference to terms, such as \\"Central Sudan\\", which were associated with the area by some geographers and travellers. She thought that the term \\"Sudan\\" was associated with a territory in the Nile basin, the current Sudan. In The Times of 8 January 1897, she wrote: \\"The name Nigeria applying to no other part of Africa may without offence to any neighbours be accepted as co-extensive with the territories over which the Royal Niger Company has extended British influence, and may serve to differentiate them equally from the colonies of Lagos and the Niger Protectorate on the coast and from the French territories of the Upper Niger.\\" Lady Lugard Shaw was close to the three men who most epitomised empire in Africa: Cecil Rhodes, George Taubman Goldie and Sir Frederick Lugard. She married, on 10 June 1902, Lugard, who, in 1928, was created Baron Lugard. She accompanied him when he served as Governor of Hong Kong (1907‚Äì1912) and Governor-General of Nigeria (1914‚Äì1919). They had no children. In 1905, Shaw wrote what remains the definitive history of Western Sudan and the modern settlement of Northern Nigeria, A Tropical Dependency: An Outline of the Ancient History of the Western Soudan, With an Account of the Modern Settlement of Northern Nigeria (London: Nisbet, 1905). While they lived in Hong Kong she helped her husband establishing the University of Hong Kong. During the First World War, she was prominent in the founding of the War Refugees Committee, which dealt with the problem of the refugees from Belgium, and she founded the Lady Lugard Hospitality Committee. In the 1918 New Year Honours, she was appointed as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She died of pneumonia on 25 January 1929, aged 76, in Surrey.

Roman riding Stunt riding at the King of the Ranges competition day, Murrurundi, NSW Trick riding refers to the act of performing stunts while riding a horse, such as the rider standing upright on the back of a galloping horse, using a specially designed saddle with a reinforced steel horn, and specialized kossak loops for hands and feet. The horse is likewise galloping free. Trick riding is NOT the same as equestrian vaulting which is an internationally recognized competitive sport, governed by the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI). Horse riding stunts have been performed in many films, as well as in equestrian events such as Equitana and the official opening of the Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre, rodeos, and much more.Northern Daily Leader, \\"Inland icon opens\\", Simon Chamberlain, p.4, 23 February 2009 Horse riding stunts were also performed on the musical theatre production of \\"The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular\\". The trick riders for the show included Deborah Brennan and Zelie Bullen (n√©e Thompson) (who has also taken part in other horse shows such as Equitana). History Trick riding has a very interesting story. It has not always been an American entertainment act. It was once used as a weapon for the Ukrainian Cossacks who adopted it from the people of Caucasus and called it dzhigitovka. Cossacks were nearly unconquerable because they could easily hide from their enemies. When communism overtook Russia, the Cossacks were forced to leave the country. Many moved to America, where they used their talents for money. They became part of the entertainment community and soon Americans started catching on. Trick riding even became a rodeo event where the hardest tricks earned the most points. Trick riding as a competitive rodeo event came to an end in the 1940s. Trick riding became more dangerous and the horses became a lot faster as the trick riders became desperate for the prize money. Rodeo producers deemed trick riding too dangerous for competition and trick riding then became a specialty act in rodeos. Albert SEATON - The Cossacks published in 1972. Trick riders such as Shirley Lucas and Sharon Lucas became famous horse stunt women doubling for many movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, Lana Turner, and many more. In films, stunt riders have included Hank Durnew and Ken Maynard (1895‚Äì1973).William H. Young, Nancy K. Young The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia - Volume 2 - Page 476 - 2007 \\"... ultimately ran from 1930 until 1951. It then went on to more years on television. The credit for the first person to sing cowboy tunes in a sound movie probably belongs to Ken Maynard (1895-1973). A famous trick rider for stunts that he did\\" Rex Rossi was a World Champion Trick Rider in 1950 and 1961, World Champion Trick Roper 1971, and Hall of Fame Movie Stunt Man, a career that spanned 60 years. Rossi performed horse and falling stunts in Bonanza, Gunsmoke, and many western movies. He also stunt doubled for Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Jeff Bridges, Roy Rogers, and Bob Steele. Rossi trick rode at Madison Square Garden for 19 consecutive years. His Veach Trick Riding saddle is on display at the Gene Autry Cowboy Museum in Los Angeles. Individual tricks There are many horse riding stunts and many different variations of tricks, with each rider having an individual style. Tricks can be strap tricks or vault type tricks. Some tricks include the forward fender, layout fender (also known as the Indian Hideaway), one foot drag, spritz stand, shoulder stand, back drag, hippodrome, vault, reverse one foot stand, and spin the horn. One type of trick riding is known as \\"Roman riding\\", and is usually performed as entertainment in rodeos, circuses and horse shows. In Roman riding, the rider stands atop a pair of horses, with one foot on each horse. Roman riding is one of the older forms of riding, and was performed during the time of the Roman Empire. As many as five horses, with the rider standing on the inner three, have been ridden and jumped abreast. As many as nine horses, three teams of three abreast, have been ridden and jumped in tandem. Tricks such as trading teams while riding, riding a pony team between the horse team and jumping six- and nine-horse tandems are also performed. Sometimes riders will change teams at the trot, dance, ride backward and twirl a baton, and even jump through fire.

The armies of Pharaoh Ahmose I seized and razed the town after a three-year siege.James Henry Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Volume 2, No. 13, p. 8, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago (1906)  History  The destruction of Sharuhen was merely the first stage of a new policy of pre-emptive warfare waged by the Egyptians. Because the Egyptians of the 17th Dynasty felt deeply humiliated by the 15th and 16th Dynasty rule of the Hyksos (ca. 1650 BCE ‚Äì ca. 1540 BCE), the Theban dynasty launched an ambitious war, led by Seqenenre Tao, against the foreign king, Apepi, to reclaim lost territory. Though his own campaign to expel the Hyksos from Egypt failed, and he himself was killed in battle, his son, Kamose, launched an attack on the Hyksos capital of Avaris. It was his much younger brother, Ahmose I, however, who finally succeeded in capturing Avaris, razing it, and expelling the Hyksos rulers from Egypt altogether. The profound insult of the foreign rule to the honour and integrity of Egypt could be corrected, and its recurrence prevented, only by extending Egypt's hegemony over the Asiatics to the north and east of Egypt. Ahmose I engaged in a retaliative three-year siege of Sharuhen, thereby launching an aggressive policy of pre-emptive warfare. The town fell soon after the siege, ending the power of the Hyksos. His victories was maintained by his son, Amenhotep I, then continued by Amenhotep's successor Thutmose I, who extended Egyptian influence as far as the Mitanni kingdom in the north and Mesopotamia in the east, pushing the borders of the Egyptian empire farther than ever before. Sharuhen is mentioned in the bible in in the description of the allotment of the Tribe of Simeon.  Identification  The following sites, all within the same small area along the Nahal Besor and Nahal Gerar rivers, have been identified as possibly being ancient Sharuhen; *Many scholars today believe that Tell el-Farah (south) (), situated on Nahal Besor near the border with Gaza, was Sharuhen. Farah south was first excavated by Flinders Petrie in the late 1920s. He first identified the site as Beth-Pelet () and published the excavation reports under the names Beth-Pelet I - II. It was William F. Albright that laid the basis for identification of Tell Farah south as Sharuhen. *Flinders Petrie also excavated Tell el-Ajjul (), in the Gaza area, in the 1930s. He thought that Ajjul was the ancient town of Gaza, a theory that has since been partially misproven. The archaeologist Aharon Kempinski proposed identifying Ajjul with Sharuhen in the 1970s. Excavations at Ajjul were resumed in 1999 by a Swedish-Palestinian team under the directors Peter M. Fischer and Moain Sadeq. *Anson Rainey proposed Tel Heror, along the Nahal Gerar near the border with Gaza, and about 15 km northeast of Farah south, () as the site of Sharuhen, as well. This identification is also supported by Donald Redford, because of the site's immense size and important geographical position.Donald B. Redford, The Wars in Syria and Palestine of Thutmose III.

He is most famous for his emblem books.  Early years  Jacob Cats was born on 10 November 1577 in Brouwershaven as son of Adriaen Cornelisz. Cats and Leenken Jacob Jansdr. Breyde. Having lost his mother at an early age, he and his three brothers were adopted by his aunt Anna Breyde, sister of his mother and his uncle Doen Leenaerts. Cats was sent to school in Breda. He then studied law in Rotterdam and Paris, and, returning to Holland, he settled in The Hague, where he began to practice as a lawyer. His pleading in defense of a person accused of witchcraft brought him many clients and some reputation. He had a serious love affair about this time, which was broken off on the very eve of marriage by his catching a tertian fever (a form of malaria) which defied all attempts at cure for some two years. For medical advice and change of air Cats went to England, where he consulted the highest authorities in vain. He returned to Zeeland to die, but was cured mysteriously with the powder of a travelling doctor (later sources claim he was a quack). He married on 26 April 1605 a lady of some wealth, Elisabeth van Valckenburg from Antwerp,Jacob Cats at Geni.com and thenceforward lived at Grijpskerke in Zeeland, where he devoted himself to farming and poetry.  Diplomatic career  Landgoed Sorghvliet In 1621, on the expiration of the twelve-year truce with Spain, the breaking of the dykes drove him from his farm. He was made pensionary (stipendiary magistrate) of Middelburg; and two years afterwards of Dordrecht. In 1627 Cats came to England on a mission to Charles I, who made him a knight. In 1636 he was made Grand Pensionary of Holland, and in 1648 keeper of the great seal; in 1651 he resigned his offices, but in 1657 he was sent a second time to England on what proved to be an unsuccessful mission to Oliver Cromwell. Poetry Cats retired to the seclusion of his palatial villa \\"Sorghvliet\\" (\\"Fly From Worry\\"), which was surrounded by a vast and sumptuous formal garden; the garden (now a park) became internationally famous and featured in 17th-century collections of engravings of famous European gardens. (Located near the Hague, and now known as \\"Catshuis\\", the house has survived and is now the official residence of the Dutch Prime Minister). Here he lived from this time till his death, occupied in the composition of his autobiography (Eighty-two Years of My Life, first printed at Leiden in 1734) and of his poems. He became famous in his own lifetime from his moralistic Emblem books, most notably Sinne en Minnebeelden, for which Adrian van der Venne cut the plates. He died on 12 September 1660, and was buried by torchlight, and with great ceremony, in the Kloosterkerk at the Hague. He is still spoken of as \\"Father Cats\\" by his countrymen. Emblem from Cats' Monita amoris virginei (1620) Cats was contemporary with Hooft and Vondel and other distinguished Dutch writers in the golden age of Dutch literature, but his Orangist and Calvinistic opinions separated him from the liberal school of Amsterdam poets. He was, however, intimate with Constantijn Huygens, whose political opinions were more nearly in agreement with his own. Although hardly known outside of Holland, among his own people for nearly two centuries he enjoyed an enormous popularity ‚Äì the complete collection of his poems is said to have sold around 50,000 copies, and was reputedly the only book, other than the Bible, to be found in many Dutch homes.Mike Dash, Tulipomania (Hachette, UK, 2011), Ch. 7 His diffuseness and the antiquated character of his matter and diction, have, however, come to be regarded as difficulties in the way of study, and he is more renowned than read. A statue to him was erected at Brouwershaven in 1829. Works See Jacob Cats, Alle de wercken, so ouden als nieuwe (complete works, old and new), published by Jan Jacobsz.

In 1845, he was appointed to the chair of mineralogy and geology at Besan√ßon; in 1850, to the chair of geology at the Sorbonne in Paris; and in 1864, professor of agriculture at the Ecole des Mines. In 1878, he became inspector-general of mines. In early years as ing√©nieur des mines he investigated and described various new minerals; he proceeded afterward to the study of rocks, devising new methods for their determination, and giving particular descriptions of melaphyre, arkose, porphyry, syenite, and others. The igneous rocks of the Vosges, and those of the Alps, Corsica, etc., and the subject of metamorphism occupied his attention. He also prepared in 1858 geological and hydrological maps of Paris, with reference to the underground water, similar maps of the d√©partements of the Seine and Seine-et-Marne, and an agronomic map of the Seine-et-Marne (1880), in which he showed the relation that exists between the physical and chemical characters of the soil and the geological structure.

The Court of First Instance is the highest court in Hong Kong that can hear cases at first instance with unlimited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters.

Schwartz (born 1927) is a 20th-century American artist considered a pioneer of computer-mediated art and one of the first artists notable for basing almost her entire oeuvre on computational media. Many of her ground- breaking projects were done in the 1960s and 1970s, well before the desktop computer revolution made computer hardware and software widely available to artists. Early life and artistic training As a young girl during the Great Depression, Schwartz experimented with slate, mud, sticks, and chalk as free materials for making art. She studied to become a nurse under a World War II education program and later on found her training in anatomy, biology, and the use of plaster valuable in making art. Stationed in Japan during the postwar occupation in an area between Hiroshima and Nagasaki, she contracted polio, which paralyzed her for a time. As part of her rehabilitation, she studied calligraphy with the artist Tshiro. After her return to the United States, she continued to experiment with media, including metal and plastic sculpture. In this period, she had to have surgery for a thyroid tumor, possibly from exposure to plastic solvents. Career By 1966, Schwartz had begun working with light boxes and mechanical devices like pumps, and she became a member of the Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) group that brought together artists and engineers as collaborators. In 1968 her kinetic sculpture Proxima Centauri was included in the important early show of machine art at the New York Museum of Modern Art entitled \\"The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age.\\" This sculpture was later used as a special effect for a Star Trek episode, in which it served as a prison for Spock's brain.Schwartz, 1992. Schwartz was brought into Bell Labs in 1968 by Leon Harmon. While there, she worked with engineers John Vollaro and others, including extensive collaboration with Ken Knowlton, a software engineer and computer artist who had also had work in the 1968 Museum of Modern Art show. That collaboration produced a series of computer-animated films, each built from the output of visual generative algorithms written by Knowlton and edited by Schwartz. She took classes in programming at The New School for Social Research around that same time. She began making paintings and films with a combination of hand painting, digital collaging, computer and other image processing, and optical post-processing, initially working with Knowlton's 1963 computer graphics language, BEFLIX, his subsequent graphics language EXPLOR and also SYMBOLICS. By 1975, Schwartz and Knowlton, in collaboration, had made ten of the first digitally created computer-animated films to be exhibited as works of fine art: Pixillation, Olympiad, UFOs, Enigma, Googolplex, Apotheosis, Affinities, Kinesis, Alae and Metamorphosis. While those 10 films did not yet involve the digital editing of images or image sequences, Schwartz having edited them as physical film the conventional way, in her work of subsequent periods, Schwartz's creative cobbling together of different, often cutting-edge technologies has been said to prefigure what would later become common practice in such programs as Photoshop and Final Cut Pro. Schwartz has contributed to scientific research on color perception and sound. She had been a consultant at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, IBM‚Äôs Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratory, Exxon Research Center and Lucent Technologies Bell Labs Innovations. Notable works Schwartz used the works of Leonardo da Vinci extensively in experiments with computers. One notable work she created is Mona/Leo, for which she compared the image of a Leonardo da Vinci self- portrait with the Mona Lisa, matching the two faces feature by feature to show their underlying structural similarity. Specifically, she replaced the right side of the Mona Lisa with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the Mona Lisa eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the Mona Lisa; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style. Additionally, though the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison is held to be a self-portrait, there is no firm historical evidence to support this theory. In a similar experiment, Schwartz used a custom ray-tracing program to investigate the perspective anomalies in the drawing of da Vinci's fresco painting of the Last Supper. Her 3D computer-generated model showed that the perspective lines in the Last Supper do match up with (extend) the architecture of the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan where the fresco is located, but only because of certain changes Leonardo made to standard linear perspective. Reception of work Schwartz has been called a pioneer in \\"establishing computers as a valid and fruitful artistic medium\\" by physicist and Nobel laureate Arno Penzias and a trailblazer and virtuoso by the philosopher-artist Timothy Binkley.Schwartz, 1992. Her films have been included in the Venice Biennale and the Cannes Film Festival, among many others, and have received numerous awards. Among these is an Academy Award with Ed Emshwiller in 1980 for special effects on the film The Lathe of Heaven. In the 1980s, a computer- generated TV spot that she created for the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art in New York won an Emmy Award. Schwartz's artworks have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Centre Beauborg (Paris), Stedlijk Museum of Art (Amsterdam), the Grand Palais Museum (Paris), and at numerous galleries and festivals worldwide. Schwartz has been a visiting member of the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland; an adjunct professor at the Kean College, Fine Arts Department; an adjunct professor at Rutger's Visual Arts Department; an adjunct professor at the Psychology Department, School of Arts and Sciences, New York University; and a Member of the Graduate Faculty of The School of Visual Arts, NYC. She has also been an Artist in Residence at Channel 13, WNET, New York. She has been a fellow of the World Academy of Science and Art since 1988.

He was one of a few Metropolitans who dared openly to contradict royal authority, and it is widely believed that the Tsar had him murdered on that account. He is venerated as a saint and martyr in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Life He was born Feodor Stepanovich Kolychev into one of the noblest boyar families of Muscovy, in the city of Galich (in present-day Kostroma Oblast). However, according to some sources, he was born in Moscow.S. Bulgakov, Handbook for Church Servers, January 9 , (Kharkov, 1900), p. 22 Grand Prince Vasili III took young Theodore into the royal court. It is said that since childhood Theodore was on friendly terms with Ivan IV of Russia (\\"Ivan the Terrible\\"). According to other accounts, he was involved in the conspiracy of Prince Andrey of Staritsa against Elena Glinskaya and, when their plans were discovered, he escaped to Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea. Yet another account says that his decision to become a monk occurred on Sunday, June 5, 1537, while he was standing in church for the Divine Liturgy, on hearing the words of Jesus: \\"No man can serve two masters\\" (). According to this account, he secretly left Moscow dressed as a muzhik (peasant), and for a while he hid himself away from the world in the village of Khizna, near Lake Onega, earning his livelihood as a shepherd, later joining the monastery at Solovetsk. At any rate, he entered the monastery at Solovki at the age of 30, and a year and a half later he was tonsured (took monastic vows), receiving the religious name of Philip. In the monastery he worked at the iron forge and as a baker. Metropolitan Philip confronting Ivan the Terrible (drawing by Vasili Pukirev, 1875). Eleven years later, Philip was made hegumen (abbot) of the monastery. During his term in office, they constructed two cathedrals, a brick-yard, many water-mills and storehouses, and a network of canals connecting 72 lakes. It is said that Philip took part in all these toils together with other monks. As a result, the monastery experienced a spiritual revival. He also adopted a new monastic Rule (Typicon) for the community. Most of Philip's projects in Solovki survive to this day. The tsar heard about the indefatigable monk and asked him to fill the vacant metropolitan see of Moscow. Philip agreed on condition that Ivan would abolish Oprichnina. On June 25, 1566 Philip was consecrated a bishop and enthroned as Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia. Malyuta Skuratov approaching Metropolitan Philip in order to kill him (painting by Nikolai Nevrev, 1898). After only two years, however, Ivan the Terrible persisted with committing murders under the aegis of Oprichnina. During Great Lent, on the Sunday of the Veneration of the Cross, March 2, 1568, when the Tsar came to the cathedral for Divine Liturgy, Philip refused to bless him and publicly rebuked him for the ongoing massacre. The Massacre of Novgorod ensued, and Philip's condemnation followed. Ivan eventually deposed Philip from office by raising incredible charges of sorcery and dissolute living. Philip was arrested during Liturgy at the Cathedral of Dormition and imprisoned in a dingy cell of the Theophany (Bogoiavlenskii) Monastery, fettered with chains, with a heavy collar around his neck, and was deprived of food for a few days in succession. Then he was transferred and immured at the Monastery of the Fathers (Otroch Monastery) at Tver. In November 1568, the tsar summoned the Holy Synod, which had Philip deposed. A year later, on December 23, 1569, he was strangled by the Tsar's minion, Malyuta Skuratov at Otroch, two days before Christmas. As if aware of his approaching death, Philip had asked to receive Holy Communion three days earlier. Commemoration as a saint Reliquary of Philip II in the Dormition Cathedral After his martyrdom, monks from Solovki Monastery asked for permission to transfer the body of St. Philip to their monastery. When they opened up the tomb they found the body of the hierarch was incorrupt, and various healings began to be reported. The transfer of his remains from Tver to the Solovki Monastery took place in 1590. In 1652, Patriarch Nikon persuaded Tsar Alexis to bring Philip's relics to Moscow, where he was glorified (proclaimed a saint) later that same year. His memory is celebrated three times a year: *His main feast day falls on January 9 (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, January 9 falls on January 22 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). *The feast of the translation of his relics is celebrated on July 3 (July 16). *On October 5 (October 18) he is celebrated as one of the Hierarchs of Moscow. The celebration of a special day (Synaxis) to honor Saints Peter, Alexis, and Jonah as \\"Metropolitans and Wonderworkers of All Russia\\" was established by Patriarch Job in 1596. In 1875, St. Innocent, Metropolitan of Moscow proposed that St. Philip be included with the others.

The first sitting of the court was on 1 October 1844 presided over by the first Chief Justice, John Walter Hulme.Norton-Kyshe, John, History the Laws of Hong Kong, p64 =Appeals= For almost 70 years after establishment of the court, there was no Court of Appeal in Hong Kong. Appeals were either by way or re-hearing or direct to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. From 1913, appeals were heard by a Full Court made up of 3 judges. From 1913 to 1943, a judge of the British Supreme Court for China in Shanghai was eligible to sit on the Full Court. In the 1910s and 1920s, a Shanghai judge would regularly travel to Hong Kong to sit on the Full Court.

W. Norton & Company. First published in 1962, it has gone through ten editions; as of 2006 there are over eight million copies in print, making it the publisher's best-selling anthology. M. H. Abrams, a critic and scholar of Romanticism, served as General Editor for its first seven editions, before handing the job to Stephen Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar and Harvard professor. The anthology provides an overview of poetry, drama, prose fiction, essays, and letters from Beowulf to the beginning of the 21st century. Format=1st edition= The first edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature, printed in 1962, comprised two volumes. Also printed in 1962 was a single-volume derivative edition, called The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Major Authors Edition, which contained reprintings with some additions and changes including 28 of the major authors appearing in the original edition.The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Major Authors Edition, 1st ed., ed. Abrams et al., 1962, LCCN 62-9514 =8th edition= The eighth edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature comprises six volumes, sold in two sets of three. The first set includes the volumes \\"The Middle Ages\\", \\"The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century\\", and \\"Restoration and the Eighteenth Century\\"; the second set includes \\"The Romantic Period\\", \\"The Victorian Age\\", and \\"The Twentieth Century and After\\". The writings are arranged by author, with each author presented chronologically by date of birth. Historical and biographical information is provided in a series of headnotes for each author and in introductions for each of the time periods. Within this structure, the anthology incorporates a number of thematically linked \\"clusters\\" of texts pertaining to significant contemporary concerns. For example, \\"The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century\\" contains four such clusters under the headings, \\"Literature of The Sacred\\", \\"The Wider World\\", \\"The Science of Self and World\\", and \\"Voices of the War\\". The first of these includes four contemporary English translations of an identical passage from the Bible, those of William Tyndale, the Geneva Bible, the Douay-Rheims Version, and the Authorized (King James) Version; selections from the writings of influential Protestant thinkers of the period, including Tyndale, John Calvin, Anne Askew, John Foxe and Richard Hooker; as well as selections from the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Homilies. The eighth edition was also sold in two volumes, which simply compressed six eras into two larger volumes, or three eras in one volume. Volume 1 comprised the selection of literature from \\"'The Middle Ages\\" to the \\"English Restoration and the Eighteenth Century\\", while Volume 2 included the selection of literature from \\"The Romantic Period\\" to \\"The Twentieth Century and After\\". Another option was the \\"Major Authors\\" edition. Compressed into the single volume was a selection of major authors of each period, from the anonymous author of Beowulf to J. M. Coetzee. =9th edition= The ninth edition continues to be sold in the same format as the eighth edition. =10th edition= The tenth edition of the anthology went on sale in June 2018 and has continued to be sold in the same format as its two prior editions, while including a host of new writers into its already largely encompassing range.http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=4294994480 History Published in 1962, the first edition of Norton Anthology was based on an English literature survey course Abrams and fellow editor David Daiches taught at Cornell University.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, 6th ed., ed. Abrams et al., 1993, xxx The anthology underwent periodic revisions every few years. The fifth edition in 1986 included the addition of the full texts of James Joyce's \\"The Dead\\" and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The sixth edition, published in 1993, included Nadine Gordimer and Fleur Adcock. The seventh edition added Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf, Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, and Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart. Greenblatt joined the editorial team during the 1990s: \\"When Norton asked Greenblatt‚Äîwho was already editor of 'The Norton Shakespeare'‚Äîto join the team as Abrams's deputy in the mid-90s, Abrams said he was initially skeptical because of their different critical approaches, but quickly came around. The two had first met in the 80s, when they once delivered opposing lectures. 'It was great fun,' Abrams said. 'He always claimed that I bent his sword. I always claimed he had the better, not of the argument, but of the rhetoric of the argument.'\\" Another addition has been an increase in women writers: \\"The new edition, Greenblatt said, includes 68 women writers, more than eight times as many as in the first edition.\\"Reich, David, \\"Making the Cut in the Norton Anthology\\", Boston College Magazine. The ninth edition was released in 2012, marking 50 years of the anthology's existence.W.W. Norton - The Norton Anthology of English Literature Competing anthologies The 1970s saw the emergence of The Oxford Anthology of English Literature,; its editorial team included leading scholars Harold Bloom, Frank Kermode, and Lionel Trilling. It was discontinued. Bloom, a former student of Abrams', noted: \\"We were defeated in battle.\\" The Longman Anthology of British Literature is also a competitor. Of this relationship, Joyce Jensen of The New York Times wrote in 1999, \\"The first stone in the war between Longman and W. W. Norton, the David and Goliath of the anthology publishing world, has been cast. With the recent publication of The Longman Anthology of British Literature, Longman has mounted a challenge to Norton to become the literary anthology of choice in colleges and universities around the country.\\"Jensen, Joyce, \\"Think Tank; As Anthologies Duel, Women Gain Ground\\", The New York Times, January 30, 1999. Longman Anthology editor David Damrosch commented on the seventh edition of The Norton Anthology, arguing: The Norton Anthology responded that: Independent Canadian publisher Broadview Press also offers a six-volume anthology of British literature that competes with the Norton and Longman anthologies, and a two- volume Concise Edition that competes with Norton's two-volume Major Authors Edition and Longman's two-volume Masters of British Literature. The editorial team for The Broadview Anthology of British Literature includes leading scholars such as Kate Flint, Jerome J. McGann, and Anne Lake Prescott and has in general been very well received, though its sales have yet to match those of the competitors from the two larger publishers. Reception In 2006, Rachel Donadio of The New York Times stated: \\"Although assailed by some for being too canonical and by others for faddishly expanding the reading list, the anthology has prevailed over the years, due in large part to the talents of Abrams, who refined the art of stuffing 13 centuries of literature into 6,000-odd pages of wispy cigarette paper.\\" Sarah A. Kelen summarizes the changes to the NAEL inclusions of medieval literature through successive editions, demonstrating the way the Anthology contents reflect contemporary scholarship. Sean Shesgreen, an English professor at Northern Illinois University, published a critical history of the anthology in the Winter 2009 issue of Critical Inquiry, based on interviews with Abrams and examinations of the editor's NAEL files. Norton president Drake McFeely forcefully denounced the article in a January 23, 2009 story in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Subscription-only website.

Some sections of the route, for example Edgbaston near Bearwood, are also the route of the Elan Aqueduct which carries Birmingham's water supply from the Elan Valley.Ordnance Survey map, 1:2500 scale, 1903, annotation at junction of Hagley Road and Barnsley Road, Bearwood. History Much of the road is almost certainly medieval in origin. However, the road was laid out, essentially in its present form (except where there are modern bypasses) by a series of 18th century turnpike trusts. From Birmingham to Blakedown section was the responsibility of one trust established in 1753 to improve roads from the market house in Stourbridge. Blakedown was then part of Hagley, giving rise to the name for it of 'Hagley Road'. Sections of the route have had other names. For example, the 1903 Ordnance Survey map shows the name \\"Beech Lane\\" by Lightwoods House west of Bearwood,Ordnance Survey map, 1903 and the area south of Hagley Road between Lordswood Road and Wolverhampton Road is still referred to as \\"Beech Lanes\\"Ordnance Survey map, Sheet 139, Birmingham, 1990 editionOffice for National Statistics, area designation for enumerators working on 2011 Census The section from Blakedown to Bewdley Bridge represents two of the eight roads from the market house in Kidderminster that were maintained by a trust established in 1759. The turnpike road passed through Halesowen, following what is now A458 road and B4183 to Hayley Green. Halesowen was bypassed around the south of the town in the 1950s due to rising traffic levels and the growth of the town, and Manor Lane became part of A456. Then in the 1970s, the Quinton Expressway was opened to connect with M5 motorway junction 3, when the northern section of M5 was opened in the 1970s. From the Welsh Gate of Bewdley to Newnham Bridge, it was managed by the Bewdley Trust established in 1753. From Monksbridge (the Shropshire boundary, to Woofferton and so to Ludlow, the road was repaired by the Ludlow First Turnpike Trust of about 1751. The intervening section was handled by the Hundred House Turnpike Trust of 1753. The Hundred House at Great Witley was probably the meeting place for Doddingtree Hundred. This trust was unusual in being responsible for several roads radiating from a place that was not a town.Details of the trusts are taken from the original Acts of Parliament establishing the trusts. Route=Birmingham - Kidderminster= The A456 starts as Broad Street at the Paradise Circus junction on Queensway in the city centre, leading on to the Five Ways junction on the Middleway (A4540) in Birmingham, heading West through the Birmingham suburbs of Edgbaston and Quinton using a mixture of dual carriageway and single carriageway roads, though maintaining at least 2 lanes in each direction. Just beyond Quinton, the A458 exits towards Halesowen, while the A456 bypasses the town to the South, meeting the M5 at Junction 3. This route was completed in the 1960s, beginning with Quinton Expressway and resuming beyond the motorway junction as Manor Way (the Halesowen By-Pass). Part of the historic Staffordshire/Worcestershire border runs along the road by Lightwoods Park, and today this is the boundary between Birmingham City Council and the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell. The road resumes its original route on the West side of Halesowen, entering Worcestershire and passing over the Clent Hills. The A491 is crossed in the village of Hagley, where the road becomes single carriageway once more, passing through the village, closely followed by the village of Blakedown. Beyond there a dual carriageway section takes the road to Kidderminster, crossing the A449, before following the town's Ring Road to the North side. =Kidderminster - Woofferton= Now on the West side of Kidderminster, the road passes the General Hospital before leaving the town and passing the West Midland Safari Park. The next town of Bewdley is now bypassed by a single carriageway road to the South and West, this road being completed in 1987. Just after Bewdley the A4117 road (to Cleobury Mortimer) begins at the Fingerpost junction with the A456. Continuing West, the road is entirely rural in nature, passing the Wyre Forest eventually meeting the A443 at a \\"T\\" junction. The road passes just to the North of Tenbury Wells, the A4112 providing access to the town, and then through the village of Little Hereford (therefore passing briefly through Herefordshire). Between Newnham Bridge and Burford the road enters Shropshire, and then enters Herefordshire for about the same distance, before entering Shropshire again at its junction with the A49. The A456 terminates shortly after on the A49 in Woofferton.

He became a regular member of Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1850. He continued to act as jeune premier until he was sixty, his grace, marvellous diction and passion enchanting his audiences. It was especially in the plays of Alfred de Musset that his gifts found their happiest expression. In the 37 years during which he was a member of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Delaunay took or created nearly two hundred parts. In 1877 he was appointed professor of dramatic declamation at the Conservatoire de Paris. He retired in 1887, having been made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1883.

Details With great diplomatic cunning, the treaties enabled France to placate and divide its enemies of the First Coalition, one by one. Thereafter, Revolutionary France emerged as a major European power.Francois Furet and Mona Ozouf, eds. A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution (1989) pp 151-54 The first treaty, on 5 April 1795 between France and Prussia, had been under discussion since 1794. Prussia withdrew from the coalition that had been working on the impending partition of Poland and, where appropriate, withdrew its troops aligned against Austria and Russia. (See also the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.) In secret, Prussia recognized French control of the west bank of the Rhine, pending a cession by the Imperial Diet. France returned all of the lands east of the Rhine captured during the war. On the night of 6 April, the document was signed by the representatives of France and Prussia, Fran√ßois de Barth√©lemy and Karl August von Hardenberg. They were not face to face, each was in his own accommodation in Rosshof or the Markgr√§flerhof, and the papers were passed around by a courier. The contract that ceded the left bank of the Rhine was in a secret article, along with the promise that it would indemnify the right bank if the left bank of the Rhine should be covered in a final general peace in France. Peter Ochs drew up the Treaty and served as a mediator for a significant proportion of these financial statements. Prussia stuck to the agreement of the Treaty of Basel until 1806, when it joined the Fourth Coalition. In the second treaty, on 22 July, Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola to France in exchange for keeping Gipuzkoa. The French also came at night to sign the peace treaty between France and Spain in which Spain was represented by Domingo d'Yriarte, who signed the treaty in the mansion of Ochs, the Holsteinerhof. These treaties with Prussia and Spain had the effect of breaking the alliance between the French Republic's two main opponents of the First Coalition. On 28 August 1795, the third treaty was completed, a peace between France and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, signed by Friedrich Sigismund Waitz von Eschen. There was also an agreement to exchange the Austrian troops who had been captured in Belgium.

Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. In 2015, there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales,Magistrates' Court at judiciary.gov.uk though the government was considering closing up to 57 of these.\\"Ninety one 'surplus' courts face closure\\", BBC News, 16 July 2015 The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. Almost all criminal proceedings start at a magistrates' court. Summary offences are smaller crimes (such as public order offences or most driving matters) that can be punished under the magistrates' courts limited sentencing powers ‚Äì community sentences, fines, short custodial sentences. Indictable offences, on the other hand, are serious crimes (e.g. rape, murder); if it is found at the initial hearing of the magistrates' court that there is a case to answer, they are committed to the Crown Court, which has a much wider range of sentencing power. Either-way offences (such as theft) will ultimately fall into one of the previous categories depending on how serious the particular crime in question is (a minor theft will be dealt with in a magistrates' court; a serious theft will be dealt with in a Crown Court), although a defendant also has the right in such cases to elect for trial by jury in the Crown Court. Cases are heard by a bench of three (or occasionally two) lay judges, or by a paid district judge; there is no jury at a magistrates' court. Criminal cases are usually, although not exclusively, investigated by the police and then prosecuted at the court by the Crown Prosecution Service. Defendants may hire a solicitor or barrister to represent them, often paid for by legal aid. There are magistrates' courts in other common-law jurisdictions.  History  The current magistrates' courts are a continuation of the system of courts of petty session. Magistrates also previously presided in quarter sessions, but the abolition of these in 1972 removed the need for the distinction. In London the Middlesex Justices Act 1792 created a separate system of courts presided over by magistrates, staffed with constables ‚Äì based on the Bow Street Runners. These became known as police courts.  Jurisdiction and sentencing powers  In criminal matters, magistrates‚Äô courts (formerly known as a police courts in London, and petty sessions elsewhere) in England and Wales have been organised to deal with minor offences in a speedy manner. All criminal cases start in the magistrates' court and over 95 per cent of them will end there ‚Äì only the most serious offences go to Crown Court. Summary offences are the least serious criminal offences. They include driving offences, vandalism, criminal damage of low value, low-level violent offences and being drunk and disorderly. This kind of 'lesser' criminality will be dealt with in summary proceedings at a magistrates' court, where the defendant has no right to a jury trial and no formal indictment is necessary. Both verdict and sentence are solely in the hands of district judges or magistrates. The sentencing powers of magistrates' courts are therefore limited, usually to a maximum of six months' imprisonment. When dealing with two or more separate either-way offences, the maximum total custodial sentence is 12 months. However, should there be more than one summary only offence, the court's powers are limited to a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment, the nominal maximum sentencing powers of the magistrates' court. The maximum fine available used to be ¬£5,000. However, this was raised by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 to allow unlimited fines from March 2015 for specified offences. There is no maximum aggregate fine (in the case of two or more offences). Some driving offences are punished by endorsement (licence points) and/or disqualification from driving for a period of time. There are four types of sentence available to the magistrates - a discharge (either conditional or absolute); a financial penalty; a community order, which must include at least one of twelve possible conditions (such as supervision, unpaid work, curfew, treatment programmes for issues such as domestic violence or sexual offending, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, etc.); or custody (either immediately or as a suspended sentence). The majority of sentences are non-custodial. For either-way offences, if the magistrates feel that their powers of sentencing are insufficient, they can send the case up to a judge at the Crown Court, who can impose more severe sentences. Often the point is to achieve restorative justice (compensation of victims of crime) and reformation of the offenders. These alternative punishments are called community sentences. A community sentence would usually consist of community payback, a duty to work between 40 and 300 hours unpaid in the community. This is often complemented by some kind of programme or treatment, offering a helping hand to offenders, and engaging them at the same time ‚Äì ending a drug habit, coping with a mental illness, skills and qualifications for work, and more. Also, the judge (or magistrate) may issue orders with rules such as curfew, restraining orders (cannot go near their victim, for example) and many others. During serving of community sentences, similarly to suspended sentence, offenders usually will be supervised by a probation officer. Either way offences can be dealt with either by the magistrates' court or in the Crown Court. There will be a hearing to decide on venue, hearing an outline of the case from both prosecution and defence. The guideline is whether, taking the prosecution case at its most serious, the court believes that a magistrates' court has sufficient powers of sentence. If so, the case will be accepted, and a date will be held for a subsequent hearing in a magistrates' court ‚Äì otherwise the case will be sent to the Crown Court, as with Indictable offences below. The maximum custodial sentence the magistrates can impose for an either-way offence is six months. However, if the offender is guilty of two or more either-way offences, the maximum aggregate sentence is twelve months. The maximum fine for an either-way offence is ¬£5,000, and there is no maximum aggregate. Indictable offences, very serious crimes, will be sent to the Crown Court. Before August 2013, this was a two part process of committal and then sending. For all cases, including indictable ones, the magistrates will have to decide, however, if the defendant is to be released on bail or remanded into custody. In law in England and Wales, bail is automatically granted unless the court believes there is a chance the defendant will either abscond, reoffend during the bail period, or interfere with witnesses or the case in general. Juvenile justice deals with criminal offences by young people, who have reached the age of criminal liability (ten years old), but are not yet adults (have not reached 18). These cases are heard by specially trained magistrates sitting in a youth court. They have the power to impose a sentence of youth detention known as a detention and training order (DTO) for a period of up to two years.\\"There is a statutory presumption that a person aged under 18 will be dealt with summarily, usually in a youth court; in such circumstances, the maximum custodial sentence will be a detention and training order of no more than 24 months. Such an order may be made only for the periods prescribed ‚Äì 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months.\\" Sentencing Council: Overarching Principles ‚Äì Sentencing Youths , para 11.1, November 2009 Some civil matters, including non-payment of council tax, are heard by magistrates. Family proceedings may be held before specially trained magistrates in family proceedings courts within magistrates' courts.  Judges and other roles  Modern magistrates‚Äô courts are based on a centuries-old office of magistrate, or Justice of the Peace, so named for their responsibility for guarding the Queen's or King's peace. Today, terminological distinction is made between magistrates, who handle most cases and magistrates' courts‚Äô district judges (professional lawyers). = Magistrates = In magistrates' courts (including youth courts and family proceedings courts), less complex cases are judged by magistrates or lay judges. (Previously the term \\"lay magistrates\\" has been used to distinguish them from professional magistrates, now district judges.) They are chosen from local citizens of good character (not previously convicted), mature personality and sound judgement. It is not their job, they are not paid, only have expenses reimbursed. Magistrates sit in adult criminal courts as \\"benches\\" of three (occasionally two), ideally of mixed gender, age and ethnicity. The lead magistrate, known as the chairman, should be addressed in court as \\"sir\\" or \\"madam\\" or \\"your worship\\", and the magistrates collectively as 'your worships'. In writing, they are referred to as \\"John Smith Esq. JP\\" (for justice of the peace). The other magistrates are known as wingers. All decision making is made equally - the chairman does not carry any extra weight; they simply serve as the mouthpiece of the collective bench. Lay magistracy is an ancient institution, dating in England from at least 1327, when an Act of Parliament1 Edw. 3 Stat. 2 c. 16 provided that \\"good and lawful men\\" be appointed in every county in the land to guard the peace. = District judge = District judges (magistrates' courts), formerly known as a stipendiary magistrates, are professional lawyers permanently employed by the Ministry of Justice. They sit alone to preside over proceedings in more serious cases, usually involving remand, and in committal hearings. To qualify for the position, a law degree and 5 years of experience are necessary. District judges (MC) are referred to as District Judge or DJ , in court addressed customarily Sir or Madam and addressed in correspondence with, for example, District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) Tuff. = Legal adviser = Magistrates and district judges are assisted in court by the justices' clerk and their assistants, also known as legal advisers or court clerks, whose role is to ensure that procedures are adhered to and that the bench is properly directed as to the law and its powers, as well as seeing that the court's business is dealt with efficiently. The clerk's role is far more significant where lay magistrates are presiding because they are not legally trained and so require more advice on legal matters than a district judge. The clerk ought not to exert any influence upon the bench ‚Äì to which the advice they provide must be neutral ‚Äì but nevertheless the advice of the clerk carries considerable weight. To this end, the Practice Direction 2000 attempts to resolve issues concerning the influence of clerks over magistrates. It states that clerks should only advise on points of law and all advice should be given in open court in front of all present. = Prosecutor = The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is an authority responsible for prosecuting cases (traditionally, in the name of the Queen or the King), once the police have completed their investigation. A relative novelty in English criminal proceedings, the CPS was established by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Since its creation in 1986, it is the principal, though not the only, body that can bring a case to a criminal court in England and Wales. A minority of cases are prosecuted by other law enforcement agencies, such as English local authorities, Welsh local authorities, the Department for Work and Pensions or the Health and Safety Executive, or private prosecutors such as the RSPCA or the BBC in its capacity as the TV licensing authority. Private individuals are also entitled to bring a private prosecution, this happens most commonly where an individual is an alleged victim of common assault and the authorities have declined to prosecute. Private prosecutors can either represent themselves, or they may instruct a solicitor or barrister to represent them. The CPS retains a power to take over a private prosecution, under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, either to continue or discontinue it. It is, however, CPS policy to exercise this power only if the prosecution should be stopped because it does not meet the requirements of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, or there are important reasons why the prosecution should be pursued by the CPS. = Defence = Defendants are entitled to represent themselves, and usually do so in minor cases such as road traffic offences, when they may not even have to attend. However, defendants may be represented by a solicitor or, less commonly, a barrister. In most magistrates' courts there will be a duty solicitor available to advise and possibly to represent any defendant who does not have his/her own solicitor. Bedford magistrates' court  Proceedings  Proceedings in magistrates' courts are oral and open for public ‚Äì exceptions exist for the protection of victims (e.g. rape cases) and in youth courts. = Bail, remand, summons = When a defendant first appears before a magistrates' court, they will do so in one of three circumstances. They will either appear on bail having been charged with an offence and compelled to attend court under penalty; in response to a summons, which requires attendance but does not, in the first instance, carry any penalty for non-attendance; or in custody, having been refused bail by the police. If the defendant is on bail, s/he must first surrender to the custody of the court. Whichever the circumstance, the first requirement is to identify him/herself to the Court. Once the Court is satisfied as to the identity of the defendant, it must consider the charges. = Summary proceedings = If the charge(s) is a summary offence, the court will generally expect a plea to be taken. If the plea is one of \\"not guilty\\", the Court will fix a date for trial, taking into account the number and availability of the witnesses. In the event of a plea of guilty, the court will hear the facts of the case from the prosecution, and mitigation from the defence then consider sentence. For the most minor offences where the appropriate sentence is a fine or discharge, this will usually follow immediately after a plea of guilty. However, where the offence is more serious and may justify a community-based penalty or imprisonment, the case will usually be adjourned for the probation service to interview the defendant and prepare a pre-sentence report in which a recommendation as to the most appropriate sentence will be made. When the defendant returns to court for sentence, the Bench will consider the report along with any mitigation put forward by the defendant before passing sentence. On each occasion that a defendant appears before the court, the issue of bail must be addressed. Defendants may be released on bail, which is an order of the court compelling a defendant's future attendance, which may have conditions attached to it where such conditions are considered necessary either to ensure the defendant's future attendance, prevent the commission of further offences, or prevent the obstruction of justice. If the Court decides that no conditions exist which could achieve these objectives, the court may remand the defendant in custody until the next hearing. = Either way offences = When an either way offence is to be tried at the Crown Court, magistrates are responsible for committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury), which requires the court to consider whether there is a case to answer based upon statements and exhibits submitted to the court. If the charge is an either way offence, the \\"allocation\\" procedure is carried out. In this procedure, the defendant must indicate what his/her plea to the charge would be. If the defendant indicates a plea of \\"not guilty\\", or declines to indicate a plea, the court hears an outline of the facts from the prosecution and representations from the defendant or his representative, and then determines whether the case is suitable for summary trial or not. The court will decline jurisdiction to try the case if it decides that the sentencing powers of the magistrates' court are inadequate to deal with the case. = Committal and indictment = The grand jury system, which still exists in the United States, has been abolished in England and Wales. Instead magistrates now perform the grand jury's functions of indicting those accused of offences which need to be tried by a jury and sending them to the Crown Court for trial. In the case of offences which are indictable only, no plea is taken and the case is sent forthwith to the Crown Court. When dealing with either way offences, and after the defendant has indicated a plea, it is the role of the bench to decide whether the case is suitable for summary trial or whether to decline jurisdiction and send the case to the Crown Court - what is called the allocation decision. The court must have regard to both its sentencing powers and also any legal, procedural and factual complexity which may make the case unsuitable for summary trial. If the court finds the case suitable for summary trial then the defendant is asked whether he consents to trial or whether he will elect for trial in the Crown Court. If the court decides the case is not suitable for summary trial then it will send the case forthwith to the Crown Court.  Challenges to decisions of magistrates' courts  There are four mechanisms under which a decision of a magistrates' court may be challenged: * reconsideration by the same magistrates' court;Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, . * appeal to the Crown Court;Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, . * appeal to the High Court (Queen's Bench Division) by way of case stated; and * Judicial review in the High Court (Administrative Division).

Junctions on the road were largely grade separated, with pedestrians kept physically separate from vehicular traffic and most junctions allowing vehicles staying on the road to pass over or under those using the junction. It is now widely regarded as one of the classic urban planning blunders of the 20th century. Although seen as a revolutionary improvement when the first section opened in 1960, the 'Concrete Collar', as it became known, was viewed by council planners as an impenetrable barrier for the expansion of the city centre. In particular, it became unpopular with pedestrians, who were required to use subways at the roundabouts, an unpopular route due to fear of crime. According to the Birmingham Big City Plan published in 2011, the Ring Road has restricted open spaces, growth and economic activity. It has also made the city centre more crowded and harder to navigate. Since 1988, the city council has sought to recreate links between the city centre and the neighbouring areas, enlarging the city centre and improving the pedestrian environment across the city, with an emphasis on shifting vehicular movements out to The Ring Road. Controversially, pedestrian crossings are replacing underpasses. The A4400 still exists as the surface level road where the A38 runs in tunnels. History It was first planned by Herbert Manzoni in 1943 and an Act of Parliament permitting construction was passed in 1946. Due to financial controls, the first part of the ring road, Smallbrook Queensway, did not begin construction until 1957 and was completed in 1960. The entire ring road was opened by Elizabeth II in 1971. Norfolk House (1959), by Archibald Hurley Robinson, on Smallbrook Queensway. However, since the 1990s, some of Queensway has been altered in order to reverse the earlier strict separation of road and pedestrian traffic with a view to providing a more attractive environment for pedestrians, deter through traffic, and reducing the severance effects of the Inner Ring Road. A number of the altered junctions are in regeneration areas, such as Masshouse. In early 2008, the St Chads Queensway area near the St. Chad's Cathedral was modified to remove pedestrian underpasses and bring all pedestrian and car traffic back on to the traditional street level.

Sicamous is a resort town about halfway between Calgary and Vancouver and is the eastern gateway to the Apple Country. With http://www.shuswaplakewatch.com/research/resfacts.html of shoreline, it styles itself as the houseboat capital of Canada. It has a population of 3,166. Name origin Sicamous is an adaptation of a Shuswap language word meaning \\"river circling mountains\\". History In the 1800s, Sicamous and area was inhabited by a semi-nomadic Indigenous nation called the Secwepemc or Shuswap. They crossed the Rocky Mountains to hunt buffalo on the plains. In this area they were called the \\"Schickamoos\\". In 1871, a Provincial Map shows Schickamoos Narrows, which in early history was known as a \\"meeting place of Indians\\". In 1864, gold was discovered on the Columbia River. Seymour Arm became a supply centre in the Big Bend Gold Rush. In 1885, permanent settlers arrived after the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, which linked Canada sea to sea. Among the first settlers in Sicamous were the families from Finland. Old Town, or Eagle Pass Landing as it is now known, became an almost instant town in 1871. It was the central supply centre for railway construction. Today it is used primarily for recreational purposes such as sledding, houseboating, hiking, swimming, and biking. Later, in the early 1900s, CPR hill became a residential development. Finlayson's store and a jail were built in 1892, adding a post office in 1904. The first school opened around 1908. In 1949 a bridge was built across the channel, previously having been just a ferry crossing. Several hotels opened. In 1890 the original Sicamous Hotel was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was operated for 8 years when in May 1898 it caught fire and burned down along with the station. In 1900 the hotel was rebuilt. The hotel was Tudor style with 75 rooms and a large elegant dining room. The dances were locally popular and well attended. In 1956 the railway ended service to the hotel and it closed. The hotel was demolished in 1964. Eagle Valley, in Sicamous, became the home of many settlers. They came and farmed the land, putting up with forests, deep snow, and hordes of mosquitoes. The first newspaper in Sicamous was the Eagle Valley News. It was printed for the first time on 22 October 1958; it continues today. On January 29, 1983 the Sicamous and District Recreation Centre had its Grand Opening. The arena was built with much volunteer help and local contractors that contributed supplies. Located in the M. J. Finlayson Centennial Park the Recreation Centre has become a vibrant and essential part of Sicamous. Many civic projects followed including a skateboard park built behind the arena. Unofficially formed in 1885, Sicamous became British Columbia's 148th municipality to be incorporated on Monday, December 4, 1989 when Letters Patent were presented to Mayor-elect Gordon Mackie by Municipal Affairs Minister Lyall Hanson. Mr. Mackie served as Mayor of the District of Sicamous for 10 years. In June 2012, the community experienced major flooding due to heavy rains and an abnormally high amount of snow melt from higher elevations nearby. Over 350 residents were evacuated, and many homes were heavily damaged.

An advantage of a cabrio-coach is that retaining more of the car's original structure means that structural rigidity is higher (or the vehicle weight is lower) than traditional cabriolets.

History  This type of roof was popular in Germany in the 1930s, and was found on cars such as the Mercedes-Benz Ponton, Saab 92, Citro√´n 2CV, Fiat 500, GAZ-M20 Pobeda and the Fuldamobil. It is often called a \\"Webasto\\" since a German company of that name has been the main supplier for both factory built and aftermarket cloth car roofs since that time. A variant in which the original sedan's fixed rear glass window was retained first appeared in the 1930s, and had the advantage that it could be more easily retrofitted to an existing car; it was a factory option (although listed as a separate model) for the Volkswagen Beetle up to 1963. Some more modern cars also feature this roof style, for instance BMW Compact, Volkswagen Polo, Nissan Figaro, Isuzu Amigo, Fiat 500 (2007), Citro√´n C3 Plurial and Suzuki Vitara.

He expounded a theory known as ideal utilitarianism, and he was a major historian of the universities of the Middle Ages., where Rashdall's The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages is referred to as \\"a standard work.\\" Biography Born in Kensington, London, on 24 June 1858, Rashdall was the son of an Anglican priest. He was educated at Harrow and received a scholarship for New College, Oxford. After short tenures at St David's University College and University College, Durham, Rashdall was made a Fellow of first Hertford College, Oxford, then New College, Oxford, and dedicates his main work, The Theory of Good and Evil (1907), to the memory of his teachers T. H. Green and Henry Sidgwick. The dedication is appropriate, for the particular version of utilitarianism put forward by Rashdall owes elements to both Green and Sidgwick. Whereas he holds that the concepts of good and value are logically prior to that of right, he gives right a more than instrumental significance. His idea of good owes more to Green than to the hedonistic utilitarians. \\"The ideal of human life is not the mere juxtaposition of distinct goods, but a whole in which each good is made different by the presence of others.\\" Rashdall has been eclipsed as a moral philosopher by G. E. Moore, who advocated similar views in his earlier work Principia Ethica (1903). Rashdall was also a Berkeleyan, believing in metaphysical idealism. His historical study, The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, was described in the introduction to its recent reprinting as \\"one of the first comparative works on the subject\\" whose \\"scope and breadth has assured its place as a key work in intellectual history.\\" His The Idea of Atonement in Christian Theology surveyed different approaches to the Christian doctrine of atonement, concluding with an influential defence of the \\"subjective\\" theory of the atonement that Rashdall attributed to both Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard. Rashdall argued that the \\"objective\\" view of the atonement associated with Anselm of Canterbury was inadequate, and that the most authentically Christian doctrine was that Christ's life was a demonstration of God's love so profound that Christ was willing to die rather than compromise his character. This in turn inspires believers to emulate his character and his intimacy with the Father. Rashdall received the degree Doctor of Letters (DL) from New College, Oxford, in October 1901. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1904 to 1907, a member of the Christian Social Union from its inception in 1890, and was an influential Anglican modernist theologian of the time, being appointed to a canonry in 1909. He was Dean of Carlisle from 1917 to 1924, and died of cancer in Worthing on 9 February 1924.

Its literature gives a principle of universal and compulsory education, which is identified as one of key principles alongside monotheism and the unity of humanity. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith wrote: :\\"Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.\\" ::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 161. The Bah√° º√≠ teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. The emphasis on education is a means for social and national improvement. Since all Bah√° º√≠s have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity, Bah√° º√≠ education is meant to prepare Bah√° º√≠s to perform such work. Purpose One purpose of universal compulsory education is implied in the Bah√° º√≠ Short Obligatory Prayer which states that the God's primary reason for creating humanity is so that each of us would come to know and love Him. Clearly one purpose of education would be to facilitate this process. But religious education, however critical, should not lead to division and conflict. Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes: :\\"Schools must first train the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.\\" ::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 67. This principle is most commonly applied by Bah√° º√≠s in the form of social-welfare projects and children's classes. The emphasis on education as a means for social and national improvement is shown in the following quote by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son and appointed successor of Bah√° ºu'll√°h: :\\"The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is ignorance. Today the mass of the people are uninformed even as to ordinary affairs, how much less do they grasp the core of the important problems and complex needs of the time.\\" :: ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, The Secret of Divine Civilization, p. 109. Type of education The type of education that is written about in the Bah√° º√≠ writings does not point to one particular type or method of education. =Moral and spiritual education= The Bah√° º√≠ teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. :\\"Training in morals and good conduct is far more important than book learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved even though he be ignorant is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The reason for this is that the child who conducts himself well, even though he be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill- natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light.\\" :: ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Selections from the Writings of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Sec. 110, pp. 135-136. Children, and the requirement to give them a proper education, is particularly emphasized in many of the Bah√° º√≠ writings. Children's classes have become common-place in most Bah√° º√≠ communities, and were named by the Universal House of Justice in 2001 as one of the four core activities that Bah√° º√≠s should focus on. Bah√° º√≠ individuals have created the noted book The Family Virtues Guide, which is dedicated to the spiritual education of children. Its multi-religious content has brought it enough popularity to sell over 100,000 copies and to win the authors an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. =A useful trade or profession= All Bah√° º√≠s have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity. A major goal of Bah√° º√≠ education is therefore to prepare Bah√° º√≠s to perform such work. This is by no means the only goal (as the categories above and below indicate), or even necessarily the overriding one, but Bah√° º√≠s are warned against courses of study which \\"begin and end in words\\": :\\"The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words.\\" ::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Revealed after the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, p. 169. =Literacy= The seventh Ishr√°q of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Ishr√°qat stipulates as follows: :\\"Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing... \\" While there do exist a number of preliterate or non-literate cultures, Bah√° º√≠s assume the spread of literacy to be one of the signs of an \\"ever-advancing civilization.\\" For example, a priesthood is not needed in this era because the ability to read and write is no longer restricted to a professional class, with the masses reduced to auditors of their sacred texts. =Languages= Bah√° º√≠s expect the world's governments to one day cooperate in selecting an international auxiliary language to be used in global communication. After this is done, that language, along with one's mother tongue will be taught in schools all over the world. :\\"It is incumbent upon all nations... to convene a gathering and through joint consultation choose one language from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world.\\" ::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 165. Although Bah√° ºu'll√°h rued the necessity of spending many years learning multiple languages, when only one could be selected, various authoritative writings do assume foreign languages to be included among the \\"useful subjects\\" which Bah√° º√≠s will probably study. =Other subjects= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith has not yet endeavored to describe an ideal school curriculum, though its writings assume the usefulness of a wide variety of subjects. :\\"You have asked him [Shoghi Effendi] for detailed information concerning the Bah√° º√≠ educational programme: there is as yet no such thing as a Bah√° º√≠ curriculum, and there are no Bah√° º√≠ publications exclusively devoted to this subject, since the teachings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° do not present a definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should guide future Bah√° º√≠ educationalists in their efforts to formulate an adequate teaching curriculum which would be in full harmony with the spirit of the Bah√° º√≠ Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of the modern age. :\\"These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in various college and university programmes. But the task of formulating a system of education which would be officially recognized by the Cause, and enforced as such throughout the Bah√° º√≠ world is one which the present-day generation of believers cannot obviously undertake, and which has to be gradually accomplished by Bah√° º√≠ scholars and educationalists of the future.\\" ::From a letter dated 7 June 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer. Bah√° º√≠ writings variously allude to mathematics, science, technology, commerce, industry, the liberal arts, and religion as suitable subjects for inclusion in an educational curriculum. Pedagogical issues In education theory, in addition to what is taught, it is also important to note how education is taught. In addition to the traditional mode of education, other forms of education exist such as alternative schools, unschooling, homeschooling, Montessori, and Waldorf education. The Bah√° º√≠ requirements for education do not necessarily reject any of these possibilities. =Responsibility= The father is attributed with the responsibility for every child's education and should he fail to execute his responsibility to educate his children he can be compelled and even lose his rights as father. Mothers are acknowledged as the \\"first educators\\" of humanity, and their responsibility is equally confirmed. Beyond this, responsibility also falls to the community as a whole, as embodied in its Bah√° º√≠ institutions: :\\"Among the sacred obligations devolving upon the Spiritual Assemblies is the promotion of learning, the establishing of schools and creation of the necessary academic equipment and facilities for every boy and girl.\\" ::From a letter dated 8 June 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia. In the unfortunate event that parents and/or their communities cannot educate all their children, Bah√° º√≠ law stipulates that girls are to be given priority over boys. =Environmental factors=  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote about school uniforms, cleanliness and courtesy: :\\"As to the organization of the schools: If possible the children should all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is varied. It is preferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if, however, this is not possible, there is no harm done. The more cleanly the pupils are, the better; they should be immaculate. The school must be located in a place where the air is delicate and pure. The children must be carefully trained to be most courteous and well-behaved. They must be constantly encouraged and made eager to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that from their earliest years they will be taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm of purpose in all things. Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly advance unto their goals, so that in every situation they will be found resolute and firm.\\" :: ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Bah√°, p. 135. Bah√° º√≠ education in practice Among the four core activities that Bah√° º√≠s are currently urged to focus on, supporting children's classes and engaging in a sequence of courses known as study circles has become part of the community life of Bah√° º√≠s around the world. =Ruhi sequence of courses= The most common sequence is called Ruhi (meaning: of the spirit), which was originally developed in Colombia and currently consists of 7 courses, with the themes from the Bah√° º√≠ writings of prayer, education, history, and more. The following sequence of courses is: * Book 1: Reflections on the Life of the Spirit * Book 2: Arising to Serve * Book 3: Children's Classes, Grade 1 * Book 4: The Twin Manifestations * Book 5: Children's Classes, Grade 2 * Book 6: Teaching the Cause * Book 7: Walking Together on a Path of Service Book 8 and 9 are in development and are slated for release into the community gradually, the topics to be covered are the Covenant and the Family, respectively. =Core curriculum= The United States has developed a set of curriculum for children's classes known as the core curriculum. =Fundamental verities= Another sequence of courses uses for education of the Bah√° º√≠ teachings is called Fundamental Verities. This sequence was developed in the United States, and is not as common as the more widely used Ruhi sequence. =Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship= The Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship is an institution alluded to in the writings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. In its entirety, it represents a temple for worship, hospital, university, hospice, and other humanitarian and educational structures. It will serve as the city center for future Bah√° º√≠ societies. =Social and economic development= Some of the more mature and able Bah√° º√≠ communities around the world have taken on the task of Social and Economic Development (SED) projects. These can vary from place to place depending on the needs of different areas. Some examples include programs for the free education of migrant workers, the employment of the homeless, or the support of displaced refugees. Individuals have also worked to reform educational practices in society, such as Dr. Dwight W. Allen, a Bah√° º√≠, who co-authored American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge with William H. Cosby, Jr in 2000; and the work of Dr. Daniel Jordan in the ANISA Educational Model.A Summary Statement on the ANISA Model (with a dozen PhD theses on the model to date.) The Bah√° º√≠s of the world have set up more than 300 academic \\"Bah√° º√≠ schools\\" around the world. Praise for teachers The Bah√° º√≠ writings give a high praise for teachers, and, in the case that no personal will has been written, provide that some of a person's inheritance goes to their teachers. :\\"Having attained the stage of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the edification of its peoples. They are, in truth, cup-bearers of the life-giving water of knowledge and guides unto the ideal way. They direct the peoples of the world to the straight path and acquaint them with that which is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation. The straight path is the one which guideth man to the dayspring of perception and to the dawning-place of true understanding and leadeth him to that which will redound to glory, honour and greatness. ::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 34.

Agathon Jean Fran√ßois Fain (January 11, 1778September 16, 1837) was a French historian. He was born in Paris, France. Having gained admittance to the offices of the Directory, he became head of a d√©partement. Under the French Consulate he entered the office of the secretary of state, in the department of the archives. In 1806 he was appointed secretary and archivist to the cabinet particulier of the emperor, whom he attended on his campaigns and journeys. He was created a baron of the empire in 1809, and, on the fall of Napoleon, was first secretary of the cabinet and confidential secretary. Compelled by the second Restoration to retire into private life, he devoted his leisure to writing the history of his times, an occupation for which his previous employments well fitted him. He published successively ' (1823; new edition with illustrations, 1906); ' (Paris 1823); ' (1824); ' (1827); and ' (1828), all of which are remarkable for accuracy and wide range of knowledge, and are a very valuable source for the history of Napoleon. Of still greater importance for the history of Napoleon are Fain's ', which were published posthumously in 1908; they relate more particularly to the last five years of the empire, and give a detailed picture of the emperor at work on his correspondence among his confidential secretaries. The first English edition, Napoleon: How He Did It - The Memoirs of Baron Fain, First Secretary of the Emperor's Cabinet, was published in 1998. Immediately after the overthrow of Charles X, King Louis Philippe appointed Fain first secretary of his cabinet (August 1830). Fain was a member of the council of state and deputy from Montargis from 1834 until his death, which occurred in Paris on the 16 September 1837.

He was born in Tripoli, Lebanon (formerly in Ottoman Syria). He studied at Rome, where he lectured on Arabic, Syriac, Aramaic, philosophy and theology. In 1748 he went to Spain and was employed in the royal library at Madrid. He was successively appointed a member of the Royal Academy of History, interpreter of oriental languages to the king, and joint-librarian at the Escorial. In 1763 he became principal librarian, a post which he appears to have held till his death in 1791. Casiri published a work entitled Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis (2 vols., Madrid, 1760-1770). It is a catalogue of more than 1800 Arabic manuscripts, which he found in the library of the Escorial; it also contains a number of quotations from Arabic works on history. The manuscripts are classified according to subjects. The second volume gives an account of a large collection of geographical and historical manuscripts, which contain valuable information regarding the wars between the Moors and the Christians in Spain.

Originally named Llandaff, the station had been renamed Llandaff for Whitchurch by 1910, and on 12 May 1980 it was again renamed Llandaf.

Rayburn is named after former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn. It was completed in 1965 and at 2.375 million square feet (220,644 m¬≤) is the largest congressional office building and the newest House office building (the only newer congressional office building is the Hart Senate Office Building, completed in 1982). History Rayburn was completed in early 1965 and is home to the offices of 169 Representatives. Earlier efforts to provide space for the House of Representatives had included the construction of the Cannon House Office Building and the Longworth House Office Building. In March 1955, House Speaker Sam Rayburn introduced an amendment for a third House office building, although no site had been identified, no architectural study had been done, and no plans prepared. The area west of the Longworth Building on squares 635 and 636 was chosen, with the main entrance on Independence Avenue and garage and pedestrian entrances on South Capitol Street, C Street, and First Street Southwest. The cornerstone was laid in May 1962, and full occupancy began in February 1965. Architecture A statue of Rayburn near the ground level courtyard The Architect of the Capitol, J. George Stewart, with the approval of the House Office Building Commission, selected the firm of Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson of Philadelphia to design a stripped-down classical building in architectural harmony with other Capitol Hill structures. However, while the interior design of the other House Office Buildings retains decor one would expect to see in House Office Buildings (with cherry wood paneling, brass railings, and marble floors), the Rayburn building possesses design style parallel to that of the 1960s, with chrome push bars, clocks, and elevators, and space-age fluorescent lighting fixtures. The Capitol Subway System, an underground transportation system, connects the building to the Capitol. Pedestrian tunnels also connect the Rayburn building to the Capitol and to the Longworth House Office Building. This system allows the Rayburn building to be connected to most of the Congressional office buildings on Capitol Hill via tunnel (the Ford House Office Building is freestanding and attached to no other structures by tunnel). For construction of the Rayburn House Office Building, the Congressional bill appropriated $2 million plus \\"such additional sums as may be necessary.\\" Such additional sums eventually exceeded $99 million.https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188219.pdf Congressional leaders inserted a gymnasium into the building plans, a fact that was not publicly known at the time of construction. The gym is below the sub-basement level, in a level of the underground parking garage, and according to The Hill, a newspaper focused on Capitol Hill, \\"features dozens of cardio machines outfitted with TV screens, an array of Cybex weightlifting machines and free weights.\\" Also in the third floor basement is a shooting range run by the U.S. Capitol Police and a basketball court. FBI raid On May 20, 2006 FBI agents raided the Rayburn Building office of Democratic Congressman William J. Jefferson in connection to an ongoing bribery investigation, marking the first time the FBI had raided the office of a sitting congressman. The raid led to members of both parties questioning the constitutionality of the action, and a subsequent hearing by the House Judiciary Committee. The legality of the raid was challenged in court, where a federal appeals court ruled that the FBI had violated the Speech or Debate clause of the United States Constitution by allowing the executive branch to review materials that were part of the legislative process. 2006 shooting reports On May 26, 2006, at 10:30 am local time, there were reports of the sounds of gunfire in the garage of the building. The Capitol complex was sealed off, and staff in the building were told to stay in their offices after the building was put into lockdown by the United States Capitol Police. Some parts of the lockdown were removed, though other areas remained sealed. Congressman Jim Saxton was reportedly the source of the false alarm, after he mistook construction sounds in the garage for gunfire.

He acquired the title of Senapati, meaning commander, as a consequence of his leadership during the Mulshi satyagraha. In 1977, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to commemorate him. Early life and education Senapati Bapat was born in a Marathi Chitpawan family on 12 November 1880 in Parner. His family was originally from Ratnagiri. He was educated at Deccan College and then travelled to Britain on a government scholarship in order to study engineering. As a revolutionary Statue of Pandurang Mahadev Bapat at Nagpur During his stay in Britain, he was associated with India House, spending a majority of his time learning bomb-making skills instead of pursuing his official studies. He became associated at this time with the Savarkar brothers, Vinayak and Ganesh. Bapat, who had considered blowing up the Houses of Parliament in London, took his skills back to India and passed them on to others. While in hiding after the Alipore bombing of 1908, Bapat travelled the country and discovered that the majority of the Indian population did not realize that their country was under foreign rule. At this point, his focus shifted from overthrowing the British government to educating the population. In 1912, he was arrested in connection with the bombing and was sentenced to be imprisoned. He was free by 1915, and was a \\"seasoned revolutionary\\", according to Richard Cashman. He had joined the staff of Mahratta and was one of several influential figures from the Poona area who were aligned with Bal Gangadhar Tilak's attempts to establish local organisations supporting the cause of Indian independence. Shift to Gandhian Philosophy  He re-aligned himself with Gandhi's vision of swaraj. In late 1920, following the death of Tilak and despite having been a fervent supporter of the Tilak's vision. This was a considerable shift, given his firebrand nature and willingness to use violence, but although he took the Gandhian oath of non-violence he remained willing to use force when he thought it necessary. From 1921, Bapat led the three-year farmers' protest (satyagraha) against the construction of the Mulshi Dam by the Tata company. Ghanshyam Shah considers this to be \\"the first recorded organised struggled against [forced] displacement\\" caused by an irrigation project. The company had initially dug test trenches on land without obtaining permission and the farmers, who were mostly tenants, objected in fear of losing their lands. The dam was eventually constructed and thus the protest ultimately failed. Compensation for lands submersed by the dam's construction was eventually arranged but was given to the landlords rather than to the tenants. Although satyagrahas are intended to be non-violent, Bapat was jailed for vandalism of the construction project: rather than be captured for this, he turned himself in. His third jail sentence was for speaking at a public gathering held by Subhas Chandra Bose. Legacy Major public roads in Pune and Mumbai have been named in his honour, and he featured in issue 303 of the Amar Chitra Katha comic book series in 1984. In 1977, the Government of India issued a postage stamp to commemorate him. On 15 August 1947 ‚Äî Indian Independence Day ‚Äî Bapat was given the honour of raising the Indian national flag over the city of Poona for the first time.

The Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel (also called Mont Cenis Tunnel) is a rail tunnel of length in the European Alps, carrying the Turin‚ÄìModane railway through Mont Cenis to an end-on connection with the Culoz‚ÄìModane railway and linking Bardonecchia in Italy to Modane in France. Its mean altitude is 1,123 m and it passes beneath the Pointe du Fr√©jus (2,932 m) and the Col du Fr√©jus (2,542 m). The Fr√©jus tunnel remains an important link in the connection between Rome and Paris, via Turin and Chamb√©ry. Following the development of car and truck transportation, the Fr√©jus Road Tunnel was built along the same path from 1974 to 1980. A future high-speed rail tunnel to improve transit capacity between France and Italy, called the Mont d'Ambin Base Tunnel, is being planned as part of the Turin‚ÄìLyon high-speed railway project. Construction The Tunnel entrance from the Italian side (Bardonecchia) The initial gallery was 12.8 kilometres long, twice as much as the previously longest tunnel. Drilling started in August 1857 from Bardonecchia and in December 1857 from Modane. At construction start, both ends were in Piedmont- Sardinia, but this changed with the transfer of Savoy to France in 1860 (Treaty of Turin). On 26 December 1870, French and Italian workers shook hands as the two teams met halfway: the galleries were aligned to about 40 cm horizontally and 60 cm vertically. The tunnel opened for traffic on 17 September 1871, thus making it the oldest of the large tunnels through the Alps. The gallery was extended to its present length in 1881 with a new reinforced entrance in more stable ground on the French side. The construction, directed by Germain Sommeiller, was scheduled to take 25 years, but was completed in only 14 years thanks to technical innovations such as pneumatic drilling machines and electrical ignition of explosive charges. In the final construction years, the use of recently invented dynamite further accelerated the tunnel's completion. The next two Alpine tunnels were built with similar techniques: The Gotthard Tunnel opened in 1882 and the Simplon Tunnel in 1906. The tunnel was enlarged in 2010 to allow transport of container trucks on piggy-back wagons, as part of the Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine. From 1868 to 1871, the Mont Cenis Pass Railway worked as a temporary link over the Mont Cenis Pass. It was closed soon after the Fr√©jus Railway opened. Fortifications Once Savoy became part of France, the Fr√©jus Tunnel became a possible invasion route from Italy to France, avoiding the difficulties of the Mont Cenis pass. Accordingly, an extraordinary amount of fortification was placed around Modane. The Fort du Replaton and the Fort du Sapey were built in the late 19th century on the heights across the valley of the Arc. In the 1930s the Maginot Line fortifications Ouvrage Saint-Gobain, Ouvrage Saint-Antoine and additional fortifications at Le Sappey were built. A blockhouse along the rail line to the east of the modern tunnel entrance has become a tourist attraction. The maison pench√©e (\\"leaning house\\") was built in 1939 to guard the tunnel entrance over an ammunition magazine connected to the tunnel by a gallery. In 1944 the retreating Germans exploded two rail wagons inside the tunnel entrance, causing the magazine to explode and blasting the blockhouse off its foundations, landing on a tilt. The original entry on the French side Monumental entry The original monumental entry on the French side of the tunnel at Modane is now a minor tourist attraction, having been bypassed in 1881 in favor of a new entrance somewhat to the east in more stable ground. A steam locomotive has been placed in the old entrance, which is now located along a roadside.

The revolver is easily recognisable by the zig-zag grooves on the cylinder. History Semi-automatic pistols were just beginning to appear when Colonel Fosbery (1832‚Äì1907) devised a revolver that cocked the hammer and rotated the cylinder by sliding the action, cylinder and barrel assembly back on the frame. The prototype was a modified Colt Single Action Army revolver. Fosbery patented his invention 16 August 1895 and further improvements were patented in June and October 1896. Fosbery took his design to P. Webley & Son of Birmingham. P. Webley & Son, which merged with W.C. Scott & Sons and Richard Ellis & Son in 1897 to form the Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Co., was the primary manufacturer of service pistols for the British Army as well as producing firearms for civilian use. Webley further developed the design and the Webley‚ÄìFosbery Automatic Revolver was introduced at the matches at Bisley of July 1900. The revolver was initially made in .455 calibre for the British service cartridge, and later in .38 ACP. While the .455 version had a standard 6-round cylinder, the .38 high velocity (.38 Colt ACP) version had eight chambers and could be loaded by a circular full-moon clip. The .38 version had a shorter cylinder, and thus shorter recoil stroke. Some were made with the short frame in .455 calibre. A variety of modifications led to the production of 6 different models, Marks I through VI. In civilian use, the Webley‚ÄìFosbery was popular with target-shooters. Because the trigger mechanism did not rotate the cylinder, shots were smooth and consistent, permitting rapid and accurate shooting. Walter Winans, a famous contemporary target shooter, preferred the Webley‚ÄìFosbery, and in 1902 he used it to place six shots in a two-inch bull's-eye at 12 paces in seven seconds. Using a Prideaux speedloader he was able to fire twelve shots into a three-inch bull's-eye in approximately 15 seconds. The Webley‚ÄìFosbery was available in several standard configurations with barrel lengths of 7.5 inches, 6 in, and 4 in, and was also made to order. They could also be ordered with Metford (polygonal) rifling. The pistol could also be purchased with a single-shot .22 adapter for competitive target shooting; the cylinder was removed and it was inserted into the barrel. =Wartime usage= Though Webley viewed this weapon as an ideal sidearm for cavalry troops, the Webley‚ÄìFosbery was never adopted as an official government sidearm. At over 11 inches long and weighing some 44 ounces (1239 grammes) unloaded, the Webley‚ÄìFosbery was a heavy and unwieldy sidearm even by the standards of the day. Several models of Webley‚ÄìFosbery revolvers were produced, and the type saw limited action in the Boer Wars as well as World War I, where some privately purchased examples were carried by British officers in the .455 service chambering.World Guns, Modern Firearms: Handguns - Webley-Fosbery automatic revolver, Retrieved 31-03-2011 Reports from the field suggested that the Webley‚ÄìFosbery, with its precisely machined recoil surfaces, was more susceptible to jamming in wartime conditions of mud and rain than comparable sidearms of the period. It has been commonly alleged that the Webley‚ÄìFosbery required a tight hold in order for the cylinder to properly cycle and cock the weapon. Another disadvantage was manual recocking. Unlike the simple technique used for ordinary revolvers, the Webley‚ÄìFosbery requires pulling the entire action-cylinder-barrel assembly back across the frame, a two-handed operation. Production ceased in 1924, with a total production of less than 5,000. However, many revolvers remained unsold, and the model was carried in Webley's catalogues as late as 1939. =Cultural significance= In the Dashiell Hammett novel The Maltese Falcon and the 1941 Warner Bros film, Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, is shot and killed with a Webley‚ÄìFosbery Automatic Revolver. The revolver is shown in the film being fired when Archer is shot. Soon after, the unique cylinder is clearly visible when an investigating detective shows the revolver to Sam Spade. Sam Spade then identifies the gun as a \\"Webley‚ÄìFosbery\\". However, Bogart says it's a \\"45 caliber, 8 shot,\\" which is not correct because it would have to be a .38 caliber to be 8 shots. The 45 caliber was only 6 shots. In the original book, Sam Spade refers to it as a \\"Thirty-eight, eight shot.\\", so the script writer changed it, wrongly, from the original (believing Hammett had made a mistake, and it must be a .45 automatic, like those carried by Elisha Cook's character in the movie.) In the 1972 short story Ali's Smile by William S Burroughs, the officer who shoots Ali in the Malayan market place uses a Webley .455 automatic revolver, firing six shots. The gun is described as having been \\"sold as the fastest handgun ever made\\". In Zardoz (1974), Sean Connery's character, Zed, uses a Webley‚ÄìFosbery revolver throughout the film. In the 2016 video game Battlefield 1, one of the weapons available for use is the Webley-Fosbery revolver, called the Auto Revolver. It also appears in the 2015 video game Verdun. In the 2017 Anime Princess Principal, the main character, Ange, uses a Webley-Fosbery. It is also used at one point by Daisuke Jigen in the Lupin III 2019 TV special Prison of the Past. Operation The Webley‚ÄìFosbery is a recoil-operated revolver. It has three functional sections: the barrel and cylinder section, the lock and hammer action, and the frame which houses the trigger, recoil spring, grip, and safety. The process of opening, emptying, and loading the Webley‚ÄìFosbery is identical to all other contemporary Webley revolvers. A pivoting lever on the side of the upper receiver is pressed to release the cylinder-barrel section, which tilts up and forward (\\"breaks\\") on a bottom-front pivot, simultaneously ejecting the contents of the cylinder chambers. Once loaded the section is tilted back to lock closed. Once loaded the Webley‚ÄìFosbery is cocked by pressing the entire action-cylinder-barrel assembly as far back as it will go, using the free hand. An internal spring then brings the assembly to ready position. When the action-cylinder-barrel assembly moves back, either by hand-cocking or recoil, a pivoting lever connected to the frame cocks the hammer while a stud on the frame rides in the zig-zag grooves on the outer cylinder, revolving the next chamber part-way to ready position. When the internal spring brings the assembly forward the stud revolves the cylinder completely, and the chamber lines up with the barrel. Neither pulling the trigger nor manually cocking the hammer alone rotates the gun's cylinder; the entire assembly must be cocked to ensure that a chamber is properly lined up with the barrel. The Webley‚ÄìFosbery is intended to be carried at full cock, ready to fire. The revolver therefore has the unusual feature of a safety catch, which is found on the left side of the frame at the top of the grip. When disengaged the safety lies horizontally along the frame; it is set by pressing it down, which cams the upper assembly slightly backwards, disconnecting the hammer from the sear. It can only be set when the pistol is cocked. In early models, one-directional cylinder rotation was ensured by using a spring-loaded operating stud which rode cylinder grooves of varying depths. This design was found to be needlessly complex and in the later models a fixed stud rode grooves of a uniform depth, with overshoot grooves set at the angle of the zig-zag to prevent the stud from permitting the cylinder to turn backwards. Additional improvements included removing the cylinder retaining latch from the side of the action. The latch was replaced with a spring-loaded stud in the cylinder's top strap. The final version of the Webley‚ÄìFosbery was released in 1914. It had a shorter cylinder than on earlier models and the trigger spring and recoil lever were strengthened.

Retrieved on 2009-01-30.Venkatramani, Chitra and Tzi-cker Chiueh (1993). \\"Survey of Near- Line Storage Technologies: Devices and Systems\\". Experimental Computer Systems Laboratory. Nearline storage dates back to the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System (MSS) tape library, which was announced in 1974.  Overview  The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: * Online storage is immediately available for I/O. * Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention. * Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to become online. For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.  Robotic nearline storage  A large tape library, with tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front, and a robotic arm moving in the back. Visible height of the library is about 180 cm. The nearline storage system knows on which volume (cartridge) the data resides, and usually asks a robot to retrieve it from this physical location (usually: a tape library or optical jukebox) and put it into a tape drive or optical disc drive to enable access by bringing the data it contains online. This process is not instant, but it only requires a few seconds. Wednesday, 12 June 2019 Nearline tape and optical storage has the advantage of relatively longer lifespans compared to spinning hard drives, simply due to the storage media being idle and usually stored in protected dust-free enclosures when not in use. In a robotic tape loading system, the tape drive used for accessing data experiences the most wear and may need occasional replacement, but the tapes themselves can last for years to decades. If there are sealable access doors between the access mechanism and the media, it is possible for the idle media storage enclosure to survive fire, floods, lightning strikes, and other disasters.  Hard disk drive nearline storage  MAID (massive array of idle drives) systems archive data in an array of hard disk drives, with the most drives in a MAID usually stopped. The MAID system spins up each drive on demand when necessary to read (or in some cases to write) data on that drive. For a given amount of storage capacity, MAID systems have higher densities and lower power and cooling requirements than \\"hot\\" storage systems that keep all the disks spinning at full speed at all times. Some hard drive and storage systems vendors and suppliers use the term in reference to low-rotational speed hard drives that are built to be more reliable than generic desktop and laptop computer hard drives. They are intended to be operational continuously for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, possibly for several years. Nearline hard drives may be used in personal or small business network-attached storage (NAS) systems, or as non-critical moderate-performance data storage on servers, where greater durability is required for the drive to operate continuously. By comparison, standard hard drives are assumed to only be in operation for a few hours each day, and are not spinning when the computer is either turned off or in sleep mode. Standard hard drives may also use data caching methods that can improve single-drive performance, but would interfere with the operation of multi-drive RAID storage systems, potentially causing data loss or corruption. Specifically the term nearline hard drive is being used to refer to high-capacity Serial ATA drives that work with Serial Attached SCSI storage devices. Presumably this usage is by analogy to the high-capacity and low-access speed tape systems.Seagate Technology Paper TP-543 (2005), . Retrieved on 2012-08-28.

He was a court painter to the governors of the Southern Netherlands and worked in the principal cities of Flanders where he helped spread the Rubens style.Gaspar de Crayer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Hans Vlieghe. \\"Crayer, Gaspar de.\\" Grove Art Online.

He is believed to have studied under Raphael Coxie, the court painter of the governors of the Spanish Netherlands Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia.Matthias Depoorter, Gaspar de Crayer at barokinvlaanderen He became a master in the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1607. He was a dean of the Guild from 1611 to 1616 and was a member of the Brussels city council in 1626‚Äì1627. He remained in Brussels until 1664. Philip IV with court dwarf Gaspar de Crayer's early works include portraits of the kings of Spain and the Spanish governors and officials who were stationed in the Spanish Netherlands as well as members of the Brussels city council. For example, the Equestrian portrait of Don Diego Messia Felipe de Guzm√°n (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) was painted by de Crayer in 1627‚Äì1628. In addition, from the beginning of his career de Crayer received orders for altarpieces to decorate several churches and monasteries around Brussels. Not until 1635 did Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, brother of King Philip IV of Spain and governor of the Spanish Netherlands after the death of his aunt Isabella Clara Eugenia in 1633, make him his first court painter. He later worked as a court painter for the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria who became governor in 1647.P√©rez Preciado, J. J., \\"Crayer, Gaspar de\\" at the Museo del Prado Lamentation of Christ He operated a large workshop which produced portraits of members of the leading classes in Brussels as well as a large number of altarpieces for churches in Flanders and abroad including Germany and Spain. He also received in 1647 a commission from Dutch architect Jacob van Campen to assist in the decoration of Huis ten Bosch, the palace of stadtholder Frederick Henry in The Hague. De Crayer also completed commissions for Spanish patrons, the largest of which was a commission for at least 17 images of saints, possibly destined for the Monastery of St Francis in Burgos. Another important foreign patron was the German Catholic ruler Maximilian Willibald of Waldburg-Wolfegg, for whom de Crayer executed several large altarpieces for the churches in the Palatinate between 1658 and 1666. Even while he gained a high social position in Brussels, de Crayer did not lose contact with his hometown Antwerp. He was in particular a friend and business associate of the art dealer Matthijs Musson (c. 1600‚Äì78), who was also his patron and arranged commissions for him. He married Catharina Janssens on 17 February 1613. He worked regularly in Ghent where he produced altarpieces and also played a leading role in the coordination of the monumental decorations for the Joyous Entry of the Cardinal-Infante in Ghent (1635). In 1664 he finally moved to this city where he spent the last five years of his life. In spite of his age, he received numerous important orders for altarpieces. He had previously established a reputation in Ghent: before 1620 he had regularly completed commissions for various religious and secular institutions of the city. The fame of Gaspar de Crayer is demonstrated by the great role that he was given in the execution of the monumental decorations for the Joyous Entry into Ghent of Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Austria in 1635. Among the numerous paintings made in Ghent stand out the Martyrdom of St. Blas and the works that are in the Saint Bavo's Cathedral. In his large workshop de Crayer trained between 1610 and 1661 a large number of pupils, including presumably Jan van Cleve (III), Anselm van Hulle and Fran√ßois Monnaville. Gaspar de Crayer died on 27 January 1669 in Ghent. Work Saint Benedict receiving Totila, King of the Ostrogoths Gaspar de Crayer mainly painted portraits of the elite and Counter Reformation altarpieces for local and foreign churches. His early work is in the trend of the 16th century tradition of Antwerp artists such as Marten de Vos and Hendrik de Clerck. Typical for this style is the unnatural perspective and the crowding of long wooden figures in the foreground. From 1618 he came under the influence of Rubens. The level of borrowing of motifs from Rubens suggests that he had some form of contract with the workshop of Rubens since some models he could only have seen there. The influence is shown in a more monumental rendering of figures in more balanced compositions. Until 1630, de Crayer followed the style of Rubens' Classicist period. The work Mocking of Job (1619, Mus√©e des Augustins, Toulouse) is an example of this style. Portrait of a Lady (de Crayer) From then onwards, his work was more influenced by Anthony van Dyck, whose emotionally charged interpretation of religious subjects appealed to his sensibility. His work became more dynamic in conception. He also was influenced by van Dyck's portrait series for the 'Iconography' (Icones Principum Virorum), a collection of portraits of leading personalities of van Dyck's time. Between 1638 and 1648 de Crayer's compositions displayed a lighter tonality and his figures become softer and more sentimental in appearance. This may have been under the influence of the later work of Rubens. His work also showed a trace of the Venetian 16th- century masters, in particular the art of Titian and Paolo Veronese. De Crayer, however, never visited Italy and he mainly knew the work through the prints of Agostino Carracci. In the 1650s and 1660s, de Crayer's art became more emotionally loaded and more dramatic through the deployment of a relatively large number of figures at various planes within the picture space. In the last period, a lot of work produced by his workshop surfaced and his rich and warm palette became increasingly dull.

The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months. It took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and J√©r√¥me Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Ad√©lie Land. March of the Penguins was released in France on 26 January 2005 by Buena Vista International and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on 24 June 2005. The documentary won the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. On 1 June 2010, a home video release in France included the movie in the Disneynature collection. The documentary had a 2007 follow-up movie, Arctic Tale, which only took in at the box office $1.8 million worldwide. A direct sequel titled March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step (aka March of the Penguins 2: The Call) was released in France in 2017 by Disneynature. It was released in the United States exclusively on Hulu on 23 March 2018. Subject matter The emperor penguins use a particular spot as their breeding ground because it is on ice that is solid year round with no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony that exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the breeding ground is only a few hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the breeding ground is over away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance. The penguins practice serial monogamy within each breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation of the parents is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to the feet of the waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. She has not eaten in two months and by the time she leaves the hatching area, she will have lost a third of her body weight. For an additional two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching , and their only source of water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal to feed them, and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick and return to the sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, they have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels.This bird is unidentified in the documentary itself, but the Region 2 DVD identifies it.Antarctic Skua The mother penguins come back and feed their young, while the male penguins go all the way back to sea (70 miles) to feed themselves. This gives the mothers time to feed their young ones and bond with them. Unfortunately, a fierce storm arrives and some of the chicks perish. The death of a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents to return to the sea to feed for the rest of the breeding season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. When the other parent returns, it can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground. The ingenious fight against starvation is a recurring theme throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment in the form of a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's throat to feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require. The parents must then tend to the chick for an additional four months, shuttling back and forth to the sea to provide food for their young. As spring progresses, the trip gets progressively easier as the ice melts and the distance to the sea decreases, until finally the parents can leave the chicks to fend for themselves. Production The DVD version includes a 54-minute film entitled Of Penguins and Men made by the film crew Laurent Chalet and J√©r√¥me Mason about the filming of March of the Penguins. Director and film crew spent more than 13 months at the Dumont d'Urville Station, where the Institut polaire fran√ßais Paul-√âmile Victor is based. Although the penguins' meeting place, one of four in Antarctica, was known to be near, the day on which it occurs is not known, so they had to be ready every day. Fortunately, the gathering that year was huge ‚Äì more than 1,200 penguins, compared with the norm of a few hundred. For cameras to operate at ‚àí40¬∞, they had to use film and to load all the film for the day, as it was impossible to reload outside. Because of the isolation from any film studios, remembering each shot was necessary to ensure continuity and to make sure that all the necessary sequences were finished.AATON Super 16 marches with the penguins . Lemac.com.au.March of the Penguins: interview with camera operators. Celebritywonder.com. (accessed in 2012) The main challenge of making the documentary was the weather with temperatures between ‚àí50 and ‚àí60¬∞C (‚àí58 and ‚àí76¬∞F). At dawn, the film crew would spend half an hour putting on six layers of clothes, and on some days they could not spend more than three hours outside. They worked in winds with gusts up to 125 miles per hour, \\"which in some ways is worse than the cold temperatures\\" according to director Jaquet. Release=International versions= The style of the documentary differs considerably between the original French version and some of the international versions. The original French-language release features a first-person narrative as if the story is being told by the penguins themselves. The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born, their narration is handled by child actor Jules Sitruk. This style is mimicked in some of the international versions. For example, in the Hungarian version, actors √Åkos K≈ëszegi, Anna Kubik, and G√°bor Morvai provide the voices of the penguins, and the German version as seen in German movie theaters (and in the televised broadcast in April 2007 on channel ProSieben) uses the voices of Andrea Loewig, Thorsten Michaelis, and Adrian Kilian for the \\"dubbed dialog\\" of the penguins. This style of narration is also used in the Danish and Cantonese DVD versions. The French release was handled by Buena Vista International France, a division of Walt Disney Studios. Disney also attempted to get US distribution rights to the film, but their bid ultimately failed; the English-language distribution rights were later acquired at the Sundance documentary festival in January 2005 by Adam Leipzig of National Geographic Films, who had forged a distribution partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures via their Warner Independent Pictures label. In contrast to the French version, their English release has a third- person narrative by a single voice, actor Morgan Freeman. Similarly, the Austrian channel ORF 1 used for their broadcast in April 2007, the alternate version available on the German \\"Special Edition\\" DVD which uses a documentary narration voiceover spoken by the German actor Sky Du Mont. Other releases' narrators include the Dutch version, narrated by Belgian comedian Urbanus; the Indian version, narrated in Hindi and English by Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan, is titled Penguins: A Love Story; the Polish version, narrated by Polish actor Marek Kondrat; and the Swedish version, narrated by Swedish actor G√∂sta Ekman. The Filipino version is narrated by actress Sharon Cuneta and translated by Chris Martinez and Eugene Evasco; it is entitled Penguin, Penguin, Paano Ka Ginawa? (English: Penguin, Penguin, How Were You Made?) with the English title as the subtitle. The Filipino title is similar to that of a Philippine novel and film, Bata, Bata, Paano Ka Ginawa? (English: Child, Child, How Were You Made?) Another difference between the various international versions involves the music. The original version uses an original experimental soundtrack by electronic music composer √âmilie Simon, whereas the English-language version replaces it with an instrumental score by Alex Wurman. The Hindi version happens to use the music from the French version. =Reception= The first screening of the documentary was at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States on 21 January 2005. It was released in France the next week, on 26 January, where it earned a 4-star rating from AlloCin√©, and was beaten at the box office only by The Aviator during its opening week. The original French version was released in the Canadian province of Qu√©bec. Subsequently, Warner Bros and National Geographic's English-language version was released in the rest of North America on 24 June 2005, drawing huge praise from most critics who found it both informative and charming. It has received a 94% \\"fresh\\" rating with the consensus \\"Only the hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc\\" on the website Rotten Tomatoes, which collects film reviews. The movie-going public apparently agreed with that assessment, as the documentary distinguished itself as one of the most successful documentaries of the season on a per-theatre basis: it became the second most successful documentary released in North America, after Fahrenheit 9/11, grossing over $77 million in the United States and Canada (in nominal dollars, from 1982 to the present.) It grossed over $127 million worldwide. It is the only movie from Warner Independent to be rated G by the MPAA. = Home media = The documentary was released on DVD in France by Buena Vista Home Entertainment France on 26 July 2005. It was later reissued on DVD on June 1, 2010 as a Disneynature product.https://www.amazon.fr/Marche-lEmpereur-Luc-Jacquet/dp/B003UERL0U and in the United States by Warner Home Video on 29 November 2005. It was never released on VHS by Warner Home Video, due to A Very Long Engagement being the last VHS by Warner Independent. It however spawned a VHS in French locations, such as French Canadian regions. The DVD extras address some of the criticisms the documentary had attracted, most notably by reframing the documentary as a scientific study and adding facts to what would otherwise have been a family film. This Region 2 release featured no English audio tracks or subtitles; likewise the US DVD does not contain the French version at all. An extra on the DVD issue was the controversial 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon Frigid Hare, in which Bugs visits the South Pole and meets a young penguin fleeing an Inuk hunter. The cartoon is not frequently seen because of its stereotypical depiction of the Inuk hunter, but it was included here uncut and uncensored. This is substituted in the American release with 8 Ball Bunny, likewise uncut and uncensored. =Video Games= In November 2006, the documentary was adapted into a video game by DSI Games for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance platforms. It features Lemmings-like gameplay. =Parodies= In 2007, a direct-to-DVD parody written and directed by Bob Saget called Farce of the Penguins was released. It is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and features other stars providing voice-overs for the penguins. Although the film uses footage from actual nature documentaries about penguins, the parody was not allowed to include footage from March of the Penguins itself. Political and social interpretations The documentary attracted some political and social commentary in which the penguins were viewed anthropomorphically as having similarities with, and even lessons for, human society. Michael Medved praised the documentary for promoting conservative family values by showing the value of stable parenthood. Medved's comments provoked responses by others, including Andrew Sullivan, who pointed out that the penguins are not in fact monogamous for more than one year, in reality practicing serial monogamy. Matt Walker of New Scientist pointed out that many emperor penguin \\"adoptions\\" of chicks are in fact kidnappings, as well as behaviours observed in other penguin species, such as ill treatment of weak chicks, prostitution, and ostracism of rare albino penguins. \\"For instance, while it is true that emperor penguins often adopt each other's chicks, they do not always do so in a way the moralisers would approve of.\\"(Gale Cengage Learning, subscription or library card required) retrieved on 8 September 2008 Sullivan and Walker both conclude that trying to use animal behavior as an example for human behavior is a mistake. The director, Luc Jacquet, has condemned such comparisons between penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune to comment on the documentary's use as \\"a metaphor for family values ‚Äì the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial\\", Jaquet responded: \\"I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans.\\" Some of the controversy over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC \\"have been harassing me for days over March of the Penguins ... about what, I'm not sure. I think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that. As politely as I could I told her, 'Lady, they're just birds.'\\"Lowry, Rich. Oh no, the BBC 18 September 2005. Another controversy involves those who feel that the emperor penguin's behavior can be viewed as an indication of intelligent design, and those who consider it to be an example of evolution by natural selection in action. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London, is quoted as saying, \\"Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they don't understand, it must be God; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution. It appeals to ignorance, which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment.\\" Author Susan Jacoby claims in her 2008 book, The Age of American Unreason (page 26), that the distributors of the movie deliberately avoided using the word \\"evolution\\" in order to avoid backlash from the American religious right, and writes, \\"As it happens, the emperor penguin is literally a textbook example, cited in college-level biology courses, of evolution by means of natural selection and random mutation. ... The financial wisdom of avoiding any mention of evolution was borne out at the box office ...\\"  Sequel  March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step () was released by Disneynature in France on 15 February 2017, with narration by Lambert Wilson. The film was alternatively titled March of The Penguins 2: The Call. Skipping a theatrical release in the US, the film was released as a Hulu exclusive on 23 March 2018, with Morgan Freeman reprising his role as narrator. It was later released on DVD in the UK by Lionsgate Films on 5 November. The sequel did fairly well, scoring 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews.

With Ice Cube, the film stars Bernie Mac, Monica Calhoun, Jamie Foxx, John Amos, A. J. Johnson, Alex Thomas, Charlie Murphy, Terrence Howard, Faizon Love and LisaRaye in her first starring role. Plot The story is presented as a memory of Diana ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù Armstrong (LisaRaye) sparked by her arrival at the scene of the raunchy, dysfunctional Players Club. She explains that she used to work at the club, beginning working there after getting pregnant with her son and getting into a heated argument with her father about wanting to go to a local historically black college (HBCU), prompting her to move out of her parents' home. Initially, Diana ends up working at a shoe store. There she meets Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson) and Tricks (Adele Givens), who work for Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac) at The Players Club. They convince Diana she would make better money stripping, saying, \\"Use what you got to get what you want.\\" Dollar Bill gives Diana a job and the name Diamond. Her job initially goes well. However, four years later her younger cousin Ebony Armstrong (Monica Calhoun) comes to live with her after leaving Florida. After listening to Dollar's rendition of \\"The Strippin' Game\\", she starts working at the club. Ebony is soon out of control - drinking excessively, staying out all night and influenced more and more by Ronnie and Tricks, who encourage Ebony to do more out-of-club parties for groups of men. Diamond tries to warn Ebony to stay away from Ronnie and Tricks and to quit doing house parties, but Ebony rebels against being told what to do and ignores Diamond's advice. After a heated confrontation with Ebony, Diamond has a flashback to a time when she was at a private party with Ronnie and Tricks. Diamond is passed out on the bed drunk, and the men at the party offer to pay Ronnie to perform cunnilingus on Diamond. Ronnie accepts the offer and proceeds to assault Diamond. The flashback encourages Diamond to continue to try to protect Ebony. Clyde (Alex Thomas) and Reggie (Ice Cube) - two watchmen who work for a drug lord named St. Louis - offer Ebony money to come off and have sex with them, but Diamond intervenes. Meanwhile, Dollar Bill gets confronted by a man who works for St. Louis, a drug lord and loan shark to whom Dollar Bill owes $60,000. He warns Dollar Bill if he doesn't make a payment of $10,000 to St. Louis, he will hunt him down. That same night, St. Louis comes to his club to collect. Lil' Man, the doorman of the club, tells St. Louis that Dollar Bill is not at the club; St. Louis and his men leave. The next day as Dollar Bill tries to leave the club, St. Louis' men Brooklyn (Charlie Murphy) and K.C. (Terrence Howard) confront him. They beat him unconscious and throw him into the trunk of his car. Luckily for him, they are stopped by Freeman (John Amos) and Peters (Faizon Love), two crooked cops. Dollar Bill is found in the trunk and is arrested on warrants; he is later bailed out and returns to the club. The following night rapper Luther \\"Luke\\" Campbell comes to the strip club, Reggie and Clyde discuss him. When Dollar Bill is notified that Luke is at his club, he alerts the strippers via a money alarm, believing he will make a fortune. All of the strippers in the club come rushing down where Luke and his crew are sitting, while Diamond chooses to stay pleasuring Miron. Shortly afterwards Diamond's professor comes in the club and notices her dancing. Embarrassed and ashamed, Diamond runs away downstairs to the locker room. Ronnie then comes in and attempts to sexually assault Diamond again but Diamond fights off her advances. Back upstairs, Clyde attempts to meet Luke, but Luke's bodyguard (Michael Clarke Duncan) informs Clyde that Luke is trying to relax and not meet with fans. Clyde insults the bodyguard, causing him to hit Clyde in the back of his head as he starts to walk away. The bodyguard, Luke and the others in the V.I.P. section all laugh. In retaliation, Reggie grabs a chair, smashes it over the bodyguards head and beats down the bodyguard and belligerently fights against Luke and his friends, only for him to be gang-beaten and thrown into a glass window. The dazed Reggie opens fire wildly while the patrons flee before being knocked out by the bouncer X.L. (Tiny Lister). Clyde then gets up and begins throwing punches himself at the entourage. Back downstairs, a panicked Tricks comes busting in yelling about the shooting upstairs stopping Ronnie from assaulting Diamond. Further tension develops between Ebony and Diamond when Diamond returns home later that night after fleeing her obsessive customer Miron, who admitted to stalking her and then tried to force entry to her apartment, only to find Ebony in bed with her now ex-boyfriend Lance (after he breaks up with Diamond earlier). Diamond loses it and lunges at Ebony but Lance restrains her. Ebony frantically flees to the bathroom and locks the door and Diamond chases Lance out with her gun, shooting at him several times. Diamond then threatens and taunts Ebony. When Diamond feigns leaving, she punches Ebony when she opens the door and throws her out of the apartment. Diamond begins to grow sick and tired of the drama with Ebony and the club. Days later, Diamond reconciles with her professor; he tells her he understands and promises to help her start her career after she graduates. Diamond then begins dating Blue (Jamie Foxx), a DJ at the Player's Club. Meanwhile, Ebony is offered a gig to dance at Ronnie's brother Junior's (Samuel Monroe Jr.) bachelor party, under the pretense from Ronnie that other girls from the club will be dancing there as well (In actuality, Ronnie lied to use her as a way out of stripping for her brother's friends at the party so Ebony can strip for them instead). When Ebony realizes that she will be the only woman in a hotel room full of horny men, she desperately tries calling Diamond (who is out on a date with Blue) to come and pick her up, but Diamond refuses, still being mad at Ebony for sleeping with Lance. Meanwhile, at Junior's party, Reggie and Clyde, both feeling insulted by Diamond and Ebony from a previous encounter (she aggressively told them she wasn't interested anymore when she first arrived to the party), tell Junior that Ebony will have sex with him, claiming that they \\"ran a train\\" on her. Excited, Junior bursts in on Ebony while she is changing. Ebony resists, prompting Junior to brutally beat and rape her, leaving his friends to listen to it in full disgust and disbelief. Soon, Reggie, Clyde and the other guests leave, wanting no further involvement with Junior. When Ronnie discovers Ebony unconscious, she and Junior flee the hotel room as she scolds him. Later, Diamond has a change of heart and she and Blue decide to check up on Ebony at the hotel, only to discover her bloodied and unconscious body on the bed. This proves to be the final straw for Diamond. Furious, Diamond grabs her gun and goes to the Players Club, where Ronnie and Tricks are hiding out. After scaring the other strippers away by firing a warning shot, Diamond gives the gun to Blue to cover her while she gets into a brutal fistfight with Ronnie, leaving Ronnie badly beaten. Diamond punches Tricks and this prompts Dollar Bill to firing her from the club. Diamond says final insults to Dollar and alongside with Tricks, Dollar and the others check on a beaten and bruised Ronnie and nurse her facial injuries, while Diamond and Blue leave. Ronnie and Tricks are arrested by the police on charges of the rape of Ebony. Later that night, Diamond's timing proves to be perfect when St. Louis, comes to collect. He personally shoots up the club (though he does give warning to the innocent customers and employees beforehand, allowing them to leave). As he desperately tries to escape, Dollar is captured by Reggie, Clyde, and St. Louis' associate, whom Dollar Bill met earlier. Later, one of St. Louis' men Brooklyn destroy the club with a LAW rocket. Ebony, still sporting the bruises from her rape, now has a job working at the shoe store. Having been berated by two strippers who work at a new club, called Club Sugar Daddy's, with the same slogan that influenced her to strip, she firmly stands her ground. In the end, Diamond narrates that Ebony moved back to Tallahassee, FL to be with her mother. Blue is a top D.J. at a radio station, and he and Diamond are moving further in their relationship. Ronnie and Tricks got jobs at Club Sugar Daddy's after their release from jail. Junior is now serving time for Ebony's rape and he never got married. Reggie and Clyde were last seen at the \\"Freaknik\\" in Atlanta. St. Louis is still \\"running the South\\" along with his hired guns, Brooklyn and K.C. Peters and Freeman are still harassing people all day. Little Man is managing a different strip club in Chicago. Dollar Bill was never heard from again (It can be safely presumed that he was murdered by St. Louis' men for his debts as he was last seen being stuffed into the trunk of their car). Diamond becomes a successful reporter, having put the past behind her to move on to a new life with her son and boyfriend.

As professor of logic and regent of the schools, Facciolati became the leading academic of Padua university during a period of forty-five years. He published improved editions of several philological works, such as the Thesaurus Ciceronianus of Nizolius, and in 1719 he brought out a revised edition of the Lexicon Septem Linguarum, a Latin dictionary in seven languages, called the Calepinus, from the name of its author, the monk Ambrogio Calepino. The latter work, in which he was assisted by his pupil Egidio Forcellini, he completed in four years, 1715 to 1719. It was written in seven languages, and suggested to the editor the idea of his opus magnum, the Totius Latinitatis Lexicon, which was ultimately published at Cardinal Priole's expense, 4 vols. fol., Padua, 1771 (revised ed. by de Vit, 1858-1887). In the compilation of this work the chief burden seems to have been borne by Facciolati's pupil Forcellini, to whom, however, the lexicographer allows a very scanty measure of justice. Perhaps the best testimony to the learning and industry of the compiler is the well-known observation that the whole body of Latinity, if it were to perish, might be restored from this lexicon. Facciolati's mastery of Latin style, as displayed in his epistles, has been very much admired for its purity and grace. In or about 1739 Facciolati undertook the continuation of Nicol√≤ Comneno Papadopoli, who wrote a history of the University of Padua, carrying it on to his own day. Parts claimed by Papadopoli concerning Nicolaus Copernicus were later exposed as fraudulent by Carlo Malagola and Leopold Prowe. Facciolati was known over all Europe as one of the most enlightened and zealous teachers of the time; and among the many flattering invitations which he received, but always declined, was one from the king of Portugal, to accept the directorship of a college at Lisbon for the young nobility. He died in 1769. His history of the university was published in 1757, under the name Fasti Gymnasii Patavini. In 1808 a volume containing nine of his Epistles never before published was issued at Padua.

He previously played for the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates. A closer out of St. John's University, Hansen was drafted in and quickly made his major league debut, but has since spent most of his career in minor league baseball. At , Hansen reportedly can reach with his fastball and mixes in a hard slider. College career Hansen's collegiate career began at St. John's University in , where he pitched for the St. John's Red Storm. Hansen selected St. John's over Columbia University, Yale University, and Hofstra University. While he struggled during his freshman campaign in 2003, Hansen began to establish himself as a closer during his sophomore season in . In 2004, Hansen played collegiate summer baseball for the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). A league all- star, he posted 10 saves and 41 strikeouts in 22.1 innings pitched without allowing an earned run. In 2018, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Hansen posted a 3-2 record with 14 saves in his junior season of 2005, registering 85 strikeouts in 64 innings pitched, a 1.68 ERA, and was named a first-team All-American by Baseball America. Pro career=Boston Red Sox= With the 26th pick in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, the Boston Red Sox selected Hansen and signed him to a four-year deal valued at $4 million. The Red Sox added him to the 40-man roster, assigning Hansen to a conditioning stint in Fort Myers before sending him to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. Hansen joined the Boston Red Sox as a late season call-up, making his major league debut on September 19 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Hansen struck out the first man he faced, pitching a perfect inning with two strikeouts, and would make three more appearances before the end of the season. After starting the season in Portland and Pawtucket, Hansen was recalled on June 6 by the Red Sox. On June 26, Hansen earned his first major league win in an extra-inning game against the Philadelphia Phillies. On August 20, Hansen entered a tie game against the New York Yankees in the 10th inning only to allow a game-winning home run to Jason Giambi and a two-run home run to Jorge Posada. Hansen would end the season with a 6.63 ERA. During spring training for the season, manager Terry Francona suggested that the team may have rushed Hansen to the majors too quickly. In 2007 at Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, he went 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA but did not get a promotion to the eventual World Series Champion Red Sox. Hansen also played in the developmental Arizona Fall League to get extra work in after missing some of the season with forearm tenderness. During the off-season, Hansen underwent surgery in the hopes of correcting the sleep apnea condition that may have affected his stamina and pitching performance. Hansen reported to Red Sox spring training in and initial reports suggested that the team was impressed with his performance. On July 31, 2008, Hansen was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Brandon Moss in a three-team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On August 27, 2008, the Pirates optioned Hansen to AAA (Indianapolis Indians). This move was made after Hansen allowed four earned runs without recording an out against the Chicago Cubs the previous night. Hansen was recalled to the Pirates on September 2. In 2009, Hansen was diagnosed with brachial plexus neuropathy, a rare condition causing pain, weakness, and numbness in the arms, shoulders, and upper back.Kovacevic, Dejan. \\"Pirates Notebook: Hansen's recovery uncertain\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, August 5, 2009. Recovery is usually complete, but can take as long as five years. Hansen was able to pitch in a limited number of minor league games in 2010, but was not at full effectiveness, and the Pirates released him in early 2011. =New York Mets= Hansen signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 24, 2012.

The serial number dates it to 1954/1955 Forty Plus model British Seagull with recoil starter The British Seagull¬Æ was a British manufacturer of two-stroke outboard engines in Poole, Dorset from the early 1930s until the mid-1990s. Although their \\"Classic\\" engines were for decades an exemplar of rugged simplicity and reliability, the company eventually failed when customer tastes changed and as tighter emissions regulations took effect. Production of complete engines stopped in 1996, and another company bought the rights to the brand in 1999. Spare parts continue to be produced for existing engines. History British Seagull outboards were first sold under the name Marston Seagull. They were developed at John Marston Ltd's \\"Sunbeamland\\" factory in Wolverhampton by development engineers John Way-Hope and Bill Pinninger. This pair later bought the manufacturing rights and marketed outboards as Bristol Seagull, later moving to Poole and settling for the name British Seagull. There are several different British Seagull outboard motor models, usually with a single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Originally known as \\"The Best Outboard in the World\\", then changed to \\"The Best Outboard Motor for the World\\". Some of the engines had the Villiers patented flywheel magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburettor. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1, or 25:1 depending on age, fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carburettor via a fuel line. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter was an option. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller were two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and thousands have lasted for years, even in harsh marine environments many in developing countries too. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft. Classic Boat Review Models An early engine of the company was the Model 102, developed from the Marston models of the 1930s. The Model 102 engines were fairly large and featured an integral engine cylinder block and head, with a water-injected exhaust. Some Model 102 outboards had a propeller, gaining the moniker of \\"The Barge Pusher\\". The model range for which Seagull is most famous is the \\"Classic\\" range. These \\"square block models\\" comprised the 64 cc Featherweight (aka Forty Minus) and Forty Plus, and the 102 cc Century and Century Plus. The Forty Minus and Plus used identical power units, but the Plus had a larger gearbox and propeller. The Century and Century Plus used even larger gearboxes and propellers. Classic model engines were produced from the late 1950s until the mid-1990s, and many examples are still in everyday use. The long life span is down to the high quality metals and the use of high-tensile bolts and studs. In the early 1980s the factory produced a new series of British Seagull outboards, the QB series. The power units were developed by Queen's University, Belfast (hence QB) whose Mechanical Engineering Department specialised in modernising two-stroke design.QUB/Lotus/Jaguar 2-stroke research QUB 2-stroke development Painted black and sometimes known as the Irish Seagull, they featured quieter, more efficient engines, with a water- cooled exhaust and modified cylinder porting. In the late 1980s British Seagull introduced two further models to their range, the Model 170 and the Model 125. Fitted with a cowling to enclose the engine, they featured upgraded carburettors and cylinder blocks. Both new models suffered from poorly designed crankshaft bushings, resulting in warranty claims against the company. Until that time the \\"Best Outboard Motor for the World\\" (as the marketing slogan ran) had an envious reputation for reliability, but these new models were never popular and they dented the company's image. Towards the end of production a new model called the \\"5R\\" was introduced. The design of this engine was quite different from earlier models, using a conventional gearbox from a Yamaha 4HP outboard attached via an adaptor plate to a QB engine. These models were painted blue, the very last examples (known as \\"gold tops\\") having propellers and recoil starters that were gold-painted. Fuel/oil mix Models manufactured from 1931 to 1945 had a recommended petrol-to-oil mix of either 8:1 or 10:1. From 1942 models specified a 10:1 mix which was specified up to 1979. After that date a 25:1 mix was specified, which was again changed for the introduction of the models 125 and 170, but these engines with the 50:1 mix soon failed, and British Seagull again specified 25:1. This relatively high percentage of oil was necessary due to the way the crankshaft bushings worked. Early engines used short bushings, and later ones used longer bushings, hence the changes in oil requirement. The longer bushings were, in fact, used from 1967 onwards, and the engines from 1967 to 1979 can be used on the 25:1 mix by making carburettor adjustments.

The daughter of a Unitarian minister, she founded a ragged school and reformatories, bringing previously unavailable educational opportunities to poor children and young offenders in Bristol. She published articles and books on her work and her lobbying was instrumental in the passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became known as one of the foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the anti-slavery movement; she also visited India, visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education, establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions. In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform. Carpenter publicly supported women's suffrage in her later years and also campaigned for female access to higher education. She is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol and has a memorial in the North transept of Bristol Cathedral. Early life Carpenter was born in 1807, in Exeter, the first child of Lant Carpenter, a Unitarian minister in Exeter, and Anna (or Hannah) Penn. In 1817 the family moved to Bristol, where her father took charge of the Lewin's Mead Unitarian meeting house. He established a boarding school at Great George Street, Brandon Hill, which was run by his wife and daughters, where Mary studied the sciences, mathematics, Greek and Latin. She taught in the school, had spells as a governess in the Isle of Wight and Hertfordshire and, in 1827, returned to Bristol to become head teacher at what had by now become Mrs Carpenter's Boarding School for Young Ladies. In 1833 she met Ram Mohan Roy, a founder of the Brahmo Samaj movement which reformed social Hinduism, and was influenced by his philosophy during his short stay with Miss Castle and Miss Kiddel at Beech House in Stapleton before Roy died of meningitis in September of that year. Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry- at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts. He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform, partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol. A small boy in rags ran across their path and Tuckerman remarked, \\"That child should be followed to his home and seen after.\\" He had established a Farm School in Massachusetts, which became the model for later reformatories. Carpenter's later writings are based upon ideas she developed from her correspondence with Tuckerman. Social work and anti-slavery In 1835 she helped organise a \\"Working and Visiting Society\\", in the slums around Lewin's Mead, of which she remained secretary for nearly twenty years. This group was inspired by Tuckerman's work in Boston. The purposes of such societies were to visit the poor and raise funds from the emerging middle classes to alleviate poverty and improve education. After her father's death in 1840, Carpenter worked with her sisters in her mother's boarding school in Whiteladies Road, Clifton. In 1843, her interest in the anti-slavery movement was aroused by a visit from Boston philanthropist Samuel May. In 1846 she attended a meeting which was addressed by prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in 1838. She contributed to fund-raising efforts in the abolitionist cause and maintained an interest in this for the next twenty years. Her brothers William, Philip and Russell and her sister Anna were also active in this campaign. In 1851 the return of a fugitive slave from Boston back to the southern states caused her to say of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that the United States had \\"committed an atrocious act ... against humanity, against itself, against God.\\" This event caused her to concentrate on her educational work. A bill had been introduced into Parliament \\"to make provision for the better education of children in manufacturing districts\\", but it failed to pass due to nonconformist opposition as it was seen to give pre-eminence to the position of the Church of England. As a result of the failure of the bill, ragged schools sprang up in many English towns, providing education, food and clothing to the poor, and prompting Carpenter to start such a school herself in Lewin's Mead, Bristol. A night school for adults soon followed. In 1848 the closure of the Carpenters' private school gave her more time for educational and charity work. She published a memoir of Joseph Tuckerman and a series of articles on ragged schools which were published in The Inquirer, an English Unitarian newspaper, and later published in book form. Reformatories The Red Lodge, Bristol, where Mary Carpenter established a reformatory school in 1854. This was followed in 1851 by the publication of Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders. She sketched out three classes of schools as urgently needed; good free day schools (for the children in the general population), feeding industrial schools (for children in need) and reformatory schools (for young offenders). This book drew public attention to her work, and she began to communicate with leading educational and reformist thinkers and reformers. Carpenter was consulted by those drafting educational bills, and she was invited to give evidence before House of Commons committees and in 1852 she published Juvenile Delinquents, their Condition and Treatment, which contributed to the passing of the Juvenile Offenders Act in 1854. In 1852 she put her ideas into practice, establishing a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood in the premises of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley. Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to separate the sexes and set up a girls' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854, initially funded by Lady Byron. =Red Lodge Reformatory= When Lady Byron died in 1860, Mary Carpenter was given a legacy to outright purchase the Red Lodge, including a cottage to be used for training the girls in domestic service.Saywell, R J, Mary Carpenter of Bristol, The University of Bristol, 1964 (2001 reprint) Mary Carpenter's detailed diaries (Ref. 12693/1-2) (online catalogue) present the earliest days at the Red Lodge transforming it from deserted house into functional school, including the discovery of a human foot in an outhouse. Carpenter's diaries also reveal the use of ‚Äòthe cells‚Äô located in the cellar of the Red Lodge for disciplining ‚Äúviolent, refractory and noisy girls‚Äù. Other punishments included caning and having their hair cut very short. The famous anti-vivisectionist, Frances Power Cobbe worked at the Red Lodge and lived with Mary Carpenter from 1858‚Äì9, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school. Her strong religious beliefs drove her reforms. \\"Love must be the ruling sentiment of all who attempt to influence and guide these children\\", she wrote in Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders. Now that the principle of reformatory schools was established, Carpenter agitated for free day schools, arguing the ragged schools were entitled to financial aid from the government. At the Oxford meeting of the British Association (1860) she read a paper on this subject, and, mainly owing to her instigation, a conference on ragged schools in relation to government grants for education was held at Birmingham in 1861. In the same year, Carpenter was invited to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Education of Destitute Children. Amongst other evidence she criticised Catholic priests who warned young children of Irish immigrants from attending her ragged school. She condemned the \\"low Anglo Irish\\" as combining \\"the vices of the English in a large commercial town with their ... natural character in a very undesirable way.\\" She further said, \\"I can only say that the children told us that the priests had in one case flogged a child for coming to our school, and had used very strong influence to prevent them from coming, and that I have myself been absolutely insulted in the street by Catholic children ... who feel erroneously that they were showing their zeal for their own religion by insulting Protestants.\\" India In 1866 Carpenter visited India, which had been an ambition of hers since her meeting with Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1833. She visited Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, finding that for the most part girls were not educated past the age of twelve years, mainly due to a lack of educated female teachers. During her visit Carpenter met Keshab Chandra Sen, the leader of Brahmo Samaj. Sen asked her to form an organisation in Britain to improve communication between British and Indian reformers, which she did in 1870, establishing the National Indian Association.Aditya Sarkar, Trouble at the Mill: Factory Law and the Emergence of Labour Question in Late Nineteenth-Century Bombay (2017). She visited many schools, hospitals and gaols and encouraged both Indian and British colonial administrators to improve and fund these. She was particularly concerned that the lack of good female education led to a shortage of women teachers, nurses and prison attendants.Carpenter, Mary. Six Months in India. London, Longmans, Green and Co, 1868, 141-165 The Mary Carpenter Hall at the Brahmo Girls school in Calcutta was erected as a memorial to this work. She also participated in the inauguration of the Bengal Social Science Association,Carpenter, Mary. Six Months in India. London, Longmans, Green and Co, 1868, 33-34 and addressed a paper to the governor- general on proposals for female education, reformatory schools and improving the conditions of gaols. She returned to India in 1868 and achieved funding to set up a Normal School to educate female Indian teachers. In 1875 she made a final visit and was able to see many of her schemes in operation. She also presented proposals to for Indian prison reform to the Secretary of the Indian Government. Europe and America At the International Penal and Prison Congress in 1872 Carpenter read a paper on The Principles and Results of the English Reformatory and Certified Industrial Schools. She read forty papers at conferences of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science between the years of 1857 and 1746, gave many public lectures and was known as one of the most prominent speakers on social reform in an era when few women ever addressed public meetings. Carpenter's work now began to attract attention in Europe and further afield. Not all of such attention was favourable, Pope Pius IX condemned her books and her work in 1864. Princess Alice of Hesse, who had become interested in social reform, invited her, along with Catherine Winkworth, to Darmstadt to help organise a Congress of Women Workers in 1872. This meeting resolved to work towards a \\"better preparation for domestic life\\" and \\"to pay greater attention to the mental development of an interest in the practical problems of life.\\" At the conclusion of the meeting Carpenter proposed the establishment of an International Union for the Industrial Education of Women. She went on to Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland to study Louis Guillaume's prison system, and in 1873 to America, where she met abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. She visited prisons and in 1874 wrote to the New York Prison Association to express her concern about \\"the dreadful state of the Prisons\\". Later life Blue plaque on the Red Lodge, Bristol.Carpenter supported the movement for the higher education of women, and had always supported the feminist cause but for most of her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But she did in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage. She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.Chaudhuri, N, Western Women and Imperialism: Complicity and Resistance, Indiana University Press, 1992 Carpenter never married, but she did adopt a five-year-old girl, Rosanna in 1858. She died, in her sleep, at the Red Lodge in June 1877 and was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery. Her funeral cort√®ge was half a mile long. A public meeting in October 1877 raised ¬£2,700 to be spent on her reform schools and a memorial in Bristol Cathedral. Legacy The reformatory school in Kingswood was active until 1984 and the Red Lodge Girls' Reformatory closed in 1918. Carpenter's campaigns for juvenile penal reform had a major influence on the development of a more enlightened regime for dealing with young offenders. Her writings, political activism and public addresses had a major influence on correctional education in Britain, Europe, India and America and helped bring about major reforms in the 19th and 20th century. However, many of the causes of youth crime apparently remain unaddressed in the early 21st century and failures in contemporary youth jails have been criticised by official bodies.

It is north of and is situated between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is DHM. It is managed by London North Eastern Railway. Despite its small physical profile, the station is a major stop on the East Coast Main Line and is served frequently by London North Eastern Railway, CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern trains to a variety of destinations across the country. Durham is a through station with two platforms and is located on a hill to the north of the city centre. To the south of the station, the railway line is elevated on a viaduct. After a renovation in 2006‚Äì2008, the ticket hall is now located in the original stone station building.  History  The city of Durham has been served by four stations, only one of which survives today: *Shincliffe (called Shincliffe Town from 1861): located in nearby Shincliffe, this station was built in 1839 and was served by the Durham and Sunderland Railway, using rope haulage until 1856. It closed when Elvet station opened in the city centre. A second station, Shincliffe, on the Leamside to Ferryhill line, was opened in 1844. That closed to passengers in 1941. *Durham (Gilesgate): opened in 1844, and within the city boundaries, it was served by a branch from Belmont on the Leamside Line, then the main line from London to Newcastle. Passenger services finished in 1857 with the opening of the current station on the branch from Leamside to Bishop Auckland but it continued in use as a goods shed until final closure in 1966. Today it has been redeveloped as a Travelodge hotel, while the serving track was used in the realignment of the A690 Gilesgate bypass road. *Durham: In 1857, a station on the current location and viaducts over North Road and the River Browney immediately to the south were built by the North Eastern Railway, on their Leamside to Bishop Auckland line to . The station was redeveloped in 1871, when the North Eastern Railway developed a new line from Tursdale through Relly Mill Junction to Durham, and onwards from Newton Hall Junction through Chester-le-Street to Newcastle Central via the Team Valley.Cobb, Michael H. The Railways of Great Britain: A Historical Atlas This became the main line, the current East Coast Main Line on 15 January 1872.Tomlinson, W.W. (1967, reprint of 1914 edition). North Eastern Railway, Its Rise and Development. Newton Abbot: David and Charles. *Durham (Elvet): in 1893, the Durham- Sunderland branch was diverted from Shincliffe Town to a new station at Elvet, within the city boundary. It closed to regular passenger services in 1931 and fully closed in 1953. On grouping in 1923, the stations came under the control of the London and North Eastern Railway. Passenger services to Bishop Auckland and Sunderland via Penshaw were withdrawn by British Railways under the Beeching cuts, on 4 May 1964. The East Coast Main Line through Durham was electrified in 1991. =Station Masters= *Edmund Page ca. 1873 - 1882 *Joseph Pattison 1900 - 1907 *William Curley 1907 - 1917 (afterwards station master at Sunderland) *William Parker 1917 - 1922 (afterwards station master at Harrogate) *J.C.

Simpson 1926 - 1946 Current facilities Today, the station is owned by Network Rail and managed by London North Eastern Railway. It was refurbished between 2006 and 2008 by the operator Great North Eastern Railway and later National Express East Coast, which included a new passenger lounge, toilets, travel centre, glazed waiting area, lifts and shops. The entrance and ticket hall were moved from the \\"temporary\\" 1960s building into the original stone building following renovation and repairs. The works were completed in early 2008 and the newly renovated station won \\"Best Medium Station\\" and \\"Overall Station of the Year\\" at the 2008 National Rail Awards. Ticket barriers were installed in 2009. After winning the intercity east coast rail franchise, former operator Virgin Trains East Coast opened an information office on platform 2, added new bench and perch seating and installed Wi-Fi. In 2017, all ticket barriers were removed as part of Virgin Trains East Coast's franchise commitment. A Brompton Bicycle hire scheme is planned to open in 2018 - however since the demise of Virgin Trains East Coast the management of the station has since passed on to London North Eastern Railway.

The film stars Mark Harmon, Blair Brown, Jonathan Silverman, Harold Ramis, William McNamara, and Jodie Foster (in an extended cameo appearance). The movie focuses on a failed baseball player, Billy Wyatt (Harmon), who discovers that his childhood sweetheart, Katie Chandler (Foster), has committed suicide. Billy must confront the past via reminiscence and nostalgia, while also dealing with grief, as he embarks on a journey to fulfill one of Katie's last wishes: that he spread her ashes. Stealing Home was released theatrically on August 26, 1988 by Warner Bros. Upon release the film was a critical and commercial failure, although David Foster's musical score garnered universal praise. Over the years, however, it has garnered a cult film status with television re-runs and DVD releases with audiences praising its pace, nostalgic themes and soundtrack. Plot In the 1980s, Billy Wyatt is a thirty-something washed up baseball player who lives out of a hotel with a cocktail waitress. One afternoon he receives a phone call from his mother to tell him that his close childhood friend Katie Chandler has committed suicide. Flashbacks to the 1960s explain Billy and Katie's relationship. Katie was a slightly older neighborhood girl who babysat Billy for The Wyatt family who were best friends with the Chandler family (Katie's parents). Katie tries to mentor young Billy, giving him advice on girls and dating. As Billy ages he begins to develop feelings for Katie, and Katie in turn develops feeling for him. Just after Billy graduated high school, his father dies in a car accident. Two months later Katie, Billy, Ginny, and Alan Appleby go back to their summer home \\"Seasmoke\\" as they do every year and decide to spend the summer there, the first summer without Billy's dad. This begins a summer of humor, coming of age, and loss of innocence. As summer approaches its end, Billy feels Katie is encouraging his mother to live more freely too soon. Billy has a shouting match with Katie. The next day at sunrise, Billy goes to Katie for forgiveness, but what ensues is a deeply suppressed love for each other. This last weekend of the summer defines their true feelings and makes a memory they never forget. They encourage the others to return home while they spend the rest of the weekend together at Seasmoke. Their passion and love that weekend defines their special relationship in life, and in death. As the weekend draws to a close Katie asks that Billy pursue his passion for baseball, and to retrieve the baseball necklace pendant from the girl to whom he lost his virginity just months before. Walking slowly away, she turns and says \\"I love you Billy boy\\". The older Billy remembers that was the last time he saw her. In the present, Katie's father Hank visits the Wyatt family to share the bad news. He recounts how he drove to Seasmoke to check on an upset Katie after her second divorce, and found her body lying in her bed. \\"She looked like a little girl sleeping.\\" Katie's wishes are for Billy to take possession of her cremated ashes, confident that Billy would be the only person to know what to do with them. Billy reunites with his childhood friend Alan Appleby and the two engage in a night of reminiscing and carousing while driving around in Katie's car with Katie's ashes, trying to figure out what to do with her ashes. Suddenly, Billy recalls Katie telling him her fantasy that she could jump off the pier and fly free with the birds. The next morning, Billy goes to the pier, runs down the plank and tosses her ashes just the way she described her fantasy. As he watches the ashes and birds fly freely, Billy realizes this was Katie's plan for him all along. She was speaking to him! The pennant retrieval was for a reason, the trip back home was for a reason, playing baseball with Appleby was for a reason, and all this was done with Katie's ashes in his arms! This directed him towards new sense of possibility in his own life, Billy reunites with a former girlfriend and joins a minor league baseball team; taking pride in grooming the field each morning before a game. The film ends with Billy, his girlfriend, and Appleby celebrating after a game.

SoundtrackReception The film received negative reviews around the time of its release. In her review for the New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"The era is simply established as a dreamily idyllic past, thanks to sand dunes at twilight, waves that crash in the distance, shiny red convertibles without seat belts and a musical score that may make you want to weep, for all the wrong reasons\\". In his one-star review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"I detested Stealing Home so much, from beginning to end, that I left the screening wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 20% based on reviews from 10 critics. When asked about the film in 2006, Mark Harmon said, \\"That was about a bunch of actors loving a script, going there and burning it on both ends for five weeks just to get it done. That was a fun one to make. I hear a lot about that role. People really found that movie on video.\\" =Summer of '42= Ever since the release of Summer of '42, Warner Bros. has attempted to buy back the rights to the film, which they sold to author Herman Raucher in lieu of paying him for the script, under the belief that the film would not be financially successful. Stealing Home was greenlit shortly after Raucher denied their latest attempt to purchase the rights, leading to Summer star Jennifer O'Neill's assertion that Stealing Home was \\"stolen\\" from Summer. Regardless, she said that she enjoyed the film and called it a \\"lovely film.\\" Jennifer O'Neill in 2002 tv-now.com Retrieved August 11, 2006 Rita Kempley, in her review for the Washington Post, also saw similarities with Summer, describing the film as a \\"pale comedy-drama by mediocrities Steven Kampmann and Will Aldis. Admittedly a pastiche of their memories, the movie bespeaks the dust of '60s yearbooks and greeting card sentiment. Of course, that stuff can be touching (Summer of '42) or quirky (Gregory's Girl), but here only allergy sufferers will leave with soggy Kleenex.\\" See also * List of American films of 1988 * List of fictional suicides ReferencesExternal links  Category:1988 films Category:1988 romantic drama films Category:1980s sports drama films Category:American baseball films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films set in Philadelphia Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:Suicide in film Category:Films directed by Steven Kampmann Category:Films scored by David Foster Category:Films with screenplays by Steven Kampmann Category:1988 drama films ","title":"Stealing Home"},{"id":"2305789","text":"H. waimeae subsp. hannerae flower Hibiscus waimeae (white Kauai rosemallow, , or ) is a species of flowering plant in the okra family, Malvaceae, that is endemic to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.

John Clifford CH (16 October 1836 in Sawley, Derbyshire ‚Äì 20 November 1923 in London) was a British Nonconformist minister and politician, who became famous as the advocate of passive resistance to the Education Act of 1902 Biography Clifford was son of a warp-machinist. As a boy, he worked in a lace factory, where he attracted the notice of the leaders of the Baptist community, who sent him to the academy at Leicester and the Baptist college at Nottingham to be educated for the ministry. In 1858, he was called to the Praed Street chapel, Paddington (London), and while officiating there he attended University College and pursued his education by working at the British Museum. He matriculated at the University of London (1859), and took its Bachelor of Arts degree (1861), Bachelor of Science (1862), Master of Arts (1864), and Bachelor of Laws (1866), and in 1883 he was given the honorary degree of DD by Bates College, United States, being known thereafter as Dr Clifford. This degree, from a small American college, afterwards led to sarcastic allusions, but Clifford had not courted it. Clifford's achievements at the University of London provided evidence of his intellectual equipment. At the Praed Street chapel, he gradually obtained a large following, and in 1877 the Westbourne Park chapel was opened for him. As a preacher, writer, propagandist and ardent Liberal politician, he became a power in the Nonconformist body. He was president of the London Baptist Association in 1879, of the Baptist Union in 1888 and 1899, and of the National Council of Evangelical Churches in 1898. He was instrumental in ensuring that the Baptist Union endorsed the liberal side in the Downgrade controversy, and in arranging the censure of Charles Spurgeon. In 1899, he became a prominent campaigner against the Boer War. He was on the South Africa Conciliation Committee executive and he was president of the Stop the War Committee. As well as being a critic of the British treatment of the Boers he was a critic of the Union of South Africa's negotiated terms because of the un-equal treatment of the majority black population in the country. His chief prominence in politics, however, dates from 1903 onwards in consequence of his advocacy of passive resistance to the Education Act of 1902. He threw himself into this movement with militant ardour, his own goods being distrained upon, with those of numerous other Nonconformists, rather than that any contribution should be made by them in taxation for the purpose of an Education Act, which they believed to be calculated to support denominational religious teaching in the schools. The passive resistance movement, with Clifford as its chief leader, had a large share in the defeat of the Unionist government in January 1906, and his efforts were then directed to getting a new act passed which should be nondenominational in character. The rejection of Augustine Birrell's bill in 1906 by the House of Lords was accordingly accompanied by denunciations of that body from Clifford and his followers. However, year by year went by, with nothing but failure on the part of the Liberal ministry to arrive at any solution of the education problem. Failure was now due not to the House of Lords but the inherent difficulties of the subject, as it became increasingly clear to the public generally that the easy denunciations of the act of 1902, which had played so large a part in the elections of 1906, were not so simple to carry into practice. A compromise, in which the denominationalists would have their say, was the result. Meanwhile, passive resistance lost its interest though Clifford and his followers continued to protest against their treatment. Clifford was appointed Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1921 New Year Honours. Influence The Mahatma Gandhi quoted Dr Clifford as one of the early models of passive resistanceSource: Gandhi: Satyagraha in South Africa, Nayajivan, Ahmedabad, 1928, pp. 109-15., quoted in Gandhi explains Satyagraha, article on the South Africa Online History site , consulted 10 September 2014 before developing Satyagraha as a more complete concept than just passive resistance.

OULC is the largest and oldest university Labour club in the country and has a particular reputation as an active campaigning force. The club caters for any students who are interested in the ideals of the labour movement whether members of the Labour Party or entirely new to politics. Stewart Wood, special adviser to consecutive Labour Party leaders Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, said that 'OULC is held up as an exemplar of what needs to be done.' During his visit to Oxford in July 2009 the Prime Minister Gordon Brown was reported as having praised OULC's 'brilliant contribution to progressive politics in the University, the city and the country.' The club was instrumental in returning Andrew Smith to Parliament for Oxford East at the 2010 General Election with a 4.1% swing to Labour, the largest in England outside London. Throughout the year it hosts a range of speaker, social, discussion, and campaigning events, as well as producing a termly magazine called Look Left. Signature events include the annual Barbara Castle Memorial Lecture and John Smith Memorial Dinner. In 2016, some officers of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned citing allegations of anti- Semitism in the club. This resulted in the national Labour party officially investigating the club for anti-Semitism. In March 2018, the OULC released a statement calling for ‚Äògreater action to root out antisemitism‚Äô from the national Labour Party. History=David Lewis and the early 1930s= When David Lewis came to Oxford, the Labour Club was a tame organisation adhering to Christian activism, or the not-quite-so-scrappy-socialist theories of people such as R. H. Tawney and his book The Acquisitive Society. David's modified Jewish Labour Bundist interpretation of Marxism, that Cameron Smith labels \\"Parliamentary Marxism,\\" ignited the renewed interest in the club after the disappointment with Ramsay MacDonald's second Labour government. The Oxford newspaper The Isis noted Lewis' leadership ability at this early stage in his career in their 7 February 1934 issue: \\"The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable. If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are, then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable.\\" In February 1934, British fascist William Joyce, (Lord Haw Haw), visited Oxford. Lewis and future Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation leader Ted Jolliffe, organised a noisy protest against the fascist, by simply planting Labour Club members in the dance hall that Joyce was speaking in, and causing a commotion, as groups of two and three left making much noise on the creaking wooden floors. The speech was foiled. Afterwards, the Blackshirts contingent had a street battle in Oxford with members of the Labour Club and the townsfolk. Lewis prevented the communists from really making inroads at Oxford during his time there. He increased the Labour Club's membership by three-quarters, from 484 members in December 1932 to over 850 members by the time he left, while the October club never rose above 300 members. Ted Jolliffe stated \\"there was a difference between his speeches at the [Oxford] Union and his speeches at the Labour Club. His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious.... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there.\\" In 1935, the Soviet controlled Comintern's Seventh Congress, called for a united left response to fascism, called the popular front. The communist October Club used this call, for a popular front, as a pretext to have a union between themselves and the Labour Club. Under Lewis' leadership, the club was able to easily defeat a motion by the October Club, as only 20 OULC members voted for the union. When Lewis returned to Canada in the summer of 1935, there really wasn't anyone to replace him, to keep the communists at bay as The Isis noted: \\"The Labour may have rejected fusion [with the October Club] but the matter is not yet settled. An interesting thing is the dearth of what are technically known as 'promising people' in the ranks of the Labour Club. For years the Labour Club has been turning out a Geoffrey Wilson, a Frank Hardie, a John Cripps, a David Lewis, each year: but this [coming] year there seems to be no figures as outstanding as these.\\" =Communist takeover= Since there was not a strong Labour leader to take over from Lewis after he graduated and left in the summer of 1935, the Labour Club amended its constitution to remove impediments to fusion with the communist October Club in December 1935. Shortly thereafter the two clubs joined together forming a \\"popular front\\". The club's membership peaked before the war at between 1000 and 1200 members depending on whose numbers were used, which was approximately a fifth of all of Oxford's 5023 students. Of the club's total membership, the Communists made up approximately less than 200 members. =Antisemitism inquiry= The national Labour Party appointed Janet Royall, to head an inquiry into allegations of antisemitism within the Club made in February 2016. The then-current Co-Chair and another officer resigned from the Club, alleging they were disturbed by the discrimination and antisemitism they alleged was inherent in the Club. The report - which was not published in full but was leaked to the media in August 2016 - concluded that antisemitic incidents had occurred and some Jewish members felt uncomfortable attending the Club, but that the extent of the problem was hard to verify.The Jewish Chronicle. ‚ÄúShami Chakrabarti Is yet to Comment on Release of Royall Report into Labour Antisemitism.‚Äù Accessed July 29, 2020. https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/shami-chakrabarti-is-yet-to-comment- on-release-of-royall-report-into-labour-antisemitism-1.61744. =2016 European Union Referendum= After successfully campaigning for the re-election of Andrew Smith as Member of Parliament for Oxford East, with an increased majority, in the 2015 General Election, and increasing the number of Labour councillors on Oxford City Council in the 2016 local elections, OULC campaigned hard during the European Union referendum. At the Michaelmas term 2015 General Meeting, OULC voted overwhelmingly to endorse UK membership of the European Union and to actively campaign in favour of the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the coming referendum campaign. This involved campaign stalls, door knocking and rallies. OULC did however host Graham Stringer MP who gave the Labour case for 'Brexit', during an address in Wadham college in Trinity term. This was in the same term that OULC hosted Chuka Umunna MP, Anneliese Dodds MEP, Andrew Smith MP and Alan Johnson MP, the leader of the Labour IN campaign, for signature 'remain' campaign events throughout Oxford. Constitution and organisation OULC is run by an elected Executive Committee, as established under the OULC Constitution. The Constitution can be changed by a two-thirds majority at any OULC General Meeting, Termly General Meeting (TGM), or Extraordinary General Meeting; at which its members can also pass policy in the form of motions (such as submissions to the Labour Party's Policy Review), hear reports from the executive and elect (at the TGM) the new Executive. Under the most recent version of the OULC Constitution (as of Trinity Term 2016), the head of the Executive is the two Co-Chairs. One Co-Chair position must at all times be held by someone who 'self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine'[13], and two other positions on the Executive at every TGM, must be reserved for those who self-identify partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine. The positions so reserved rotate around the Executive. If no one who self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine stands for such a position, the incoming Co-Chairs must produce a report to be made public, detailing what they will do to enhance the position of those who so self-identify within the Club. This also applies if the only two people standing for Co-Chair are men. At the General Meeting in Trinity Term 2016, the Club also re-established its long-forgotten alumni network. Upon receiving permission from Lord Attlee, the grandson of Clement Attlee, the former Labour Prime Minister, the alumni network was named 'The Attlee Association', in the former Prime Minister's honour. Events OULC has hosted a range of speakers from the Labour movement, including a number of high-profile politicians. In Trinity term 2009, OULC hosted the then current Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. He commented \\"I recently met with the OULC members and was impressed. [They] can help Labour be at the cutting edge.\\" OULC holds regular informal meetings to discuss policy. This provides its members with an opportunity to engage in serious political debate. An October 2008 review of party political events by the Cherwell commented that OULC is 'an active political party as opposed to a social gathering. Their meetings are informal, and last year they were visited by a number of prominent left wing politicians.' OULC also runs campaigns. The club plays a role in the efforts to keep Oxford East Labour and contributed significantly to the election effort in July 2009 where Labour gained four seats on the county council, the most successful Labour result in the county. In its report on the election victory, the Cherwell cited the club's then co-chair, Jacob Turner, as saying that he felt the result was a consequence of \\"a very great effort from the local party including Labour Club members. We've been going out, meeting people, and asking them not to vote for us, but just how our councillors can help them. We've built up a relationship with residents which is ultimately expressed in voting.\\" In the run up to the 2010 General Election the club regularly turned out 20 campaigners every Sunday. This made a huge contribution to Oxford East's position of having the highest voter contact rate of anywhere in the country (more than Wales, Scotland and the North-East put together). In 2012, the club was instrumental in Labour winning its first Student Ward in the city in over two decades. When possible the club sends members to other towns to campaign, including Reading, Slough, Southampton and even Edinburgh. OULC holds a number of social events including a fresher's dinner in Michaelmas Term and a barbecue or picnic in Trinity term. OULC also hosts an annual dinner, the John Smith Memorial Dinner, in the fifth week of Hilary term. The dinner commemorates the contribution and life of John Smith, the former Labour party leader, who died suddenly in 1994. Recent speakers at this event have included Neil Kinnock and Margaret Beckett. Involvement in Labour politics=Labour Students= OULC is affiliated with Labour Students, and former OULC members have held a number of positions there. In February 2011, OULC disaffiliated from Labour Students for a one-year period as a protest over the way the organisation was run. In February 2012, OULC voted by 20 to 4 to rejoin Labour Students citing the progress made by the leadership of the organisation in improving accountability and democracy. =Other= OULC also has links with other socialist organisations, trade unions, and Labour Party groups, including the Oxford District, Reading and Slough Labour Parties.  Broader political involvement =Oxford University Student Union= Since the establishment of the Oxford University Student Union (OUSU) in the early 1970s, OULC has maintained a presence. There have been many Labour presidents, starting with John Grogan in the early 1980s, and OULC candidates have in recent years been successful in the 1999 (Anneliese Dodds), 2000 (Kirsty McNeill), 2004 (Emma Norris), 2005 (Alan Strickland) and 2006 (Martin McCluskey) elections. Whilst the Club no longer runs official candidates, OUSU's executive committee and delegate body has also had a Labour presence. =National Union of Students= Stephen Twigg was National President of the National Union of Students and an OULC member in the early 1990s. =Local government= Six current or former members of OULC currently sit on Oxford City Council, and one is a County Councillor in Oxfordshire. As of the 2016 Oxford City Council Elections, Dan Iley-Wiliamson, OULC Membership and Alumni Officer at the time, was elected as a councillor for the Holywell ward, serving most city centre University colleges. =Parliament= At the 2005 General Election, five recent former OULC members stood for election as Labour candidates. In parliament former OULC members include John Grogan, Ed Balls (although also a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association whilst at Oxford), Ed and David Miliband, and in the European Parliament, Richard Corbett and Mary Honeyball. =Notable former members of the executive committee= *Rushanara Ali, MP and associate director of the Young Foundation *Tony Benn, former MP, former cabinet minister *Bridget Phillipson, MP *Barbara Castle, former MP, former cabinet minister and former leader of the Labour MEPs *Richard Corbett, MEP, Leader of the Labour MEPs (EPLP) *Richard Crossman, former MP, former cabinet minister, diarist *Tony Crosland, former MP, former cabinet minister *Michael Foot, former MP and former Leader of the Labour Party *Anthony Howard, journalist *Billy Hughes, former MP and principal of Ruskin College *Chris Huhne, MP and former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change *Roy Jenkins, former MP, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, President of the European Commission, co-founder of Social Democratic Party *Oliver Kamm, writer and journalist *David Lewis, former Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada *Peter Mandelson, former MP, former cabinet minister, former EU commissioner, spin doctor *David Marquand, former MP, academic, President of the society in 1957 *David Miliband, MP, former cabinet minister *Ed Miliband, MP, former cabinet minister and former Labour party leader *Austin Mitchell, MP *Iris Murdoch, writer *Rupert Murdoch, media tycoon *Sir Julian Priestley, former Secretary General of the European Parliament *Bill Rodgers, MP, former cabinet minister, *Andrew Smith, MP, former cabinet minister *Howard K.

Along with the TCR, the CD8 co-receptor plays a role in T cell signaling and aiding with cytotoxic T cell antigen interactions. Like the TCR, CD8 binds to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, but is specific for the MHC class I protein. There are two isoforms of the protein, alpha and beta, each encoded by a different gene. In humans, both genes are located on chromosome 2 in position 2p12. Tissue distribution The CD8 co-receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells, but can also be found on natural killer cells, cortical thymocytes, and dendritic cells. The CD8 molecule is a marker for cytotoxic T cell population. It is expressed in T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and hypo- pigmented mycosis fungoides. Structure To function, CD8 forms a dimer, consisting of a pair of CD8 chains. The most common form of CD8 is composed of a CD8-Œ± and CD8-Œ≤ chain, both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily with an immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain connected to the membrane by a thin stalk, and an intracellular tail. Less-common homodimers of the CD8-Œ± chain are also expressed on some cells. The molecular weight of each CD8 chain is about 34 kDa. The structure of the CD8 molecule was determined by Leahy, D.J., Axel, R., and Hendrickson, W.A. by X-ray Diffraction at a 2.6A resolution.; The structure was determined to have an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich folding and 114 amino acid residues. 2% of the protein is wound into Œ±-helices and 46% into Œ≤-sheets, with the remaining 52% of the molecules remaining in the loop portions. Schematic representation of the heterodimeric CD8 co-receptor Function The extracellular IgV-like domain of CD8-Œ± interacts with the Œ±3 portion of the Class I MHC molecule. This affinity keeps the T cell receptor of the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation. Cytotoxic T cells with CD8 surface protein are called CD8+ T cells. The main recognition site is a flexible loop at the Œ±3 domain of an MHC molecule. This was discovered by doing mutational analyses. The flexible Œ±3 domain is located between residues 223 and 229 in the genome. In addition to aiding with cytotoxic T cell antigen interactions the CD8 co-receptor also plays a role in T cell signaling. The cytoplasmic tails of the CD8 co-receptor interact with Lck (lymphocyte- specific protein tyrosine kinase). Once the T cell receptor binds its specific antigen Lck phosphorylates the cytoplasmic CD3 and Œ∂-chains of the TCR complex which initiates a cascade of phosphorylation eventually leading to activation of transcription factors like NFAT, NF-Œ∫B, and AP-1 which affect the expression of certain genes.

Although its habitat is being fragmented, it is a common bird with a very wide range so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy and systematics The Siberian jay shares its genus Perisoreus with the Sichuan jay of China and the North American Canada jay. However, the Siberian jay differs from the other two species in group living behaviours. Unlike the other two species, where group individuals unrelated to breeding parents may help to provision the youngJing Y, Fang Y, Strickland D, Lu N, Sun Y-H. 2009.

Genetic diversity in the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus in fragmented old-growth forests of Fennoscandia. Ecography 23: 669-677. With the arrival of coniferous forests in Scandinavia just after the last ice age, the Siberian jay probably expanded its range from east to west in response to the new suitable habitat emerged from climate warming. Description The Siberian jay is the smallest of the western Palearctic corvids, weighing and measuring about in length.Hogstad O. 2016. Hunting strategies by Siberian jays Perisoreus infaustus on wintering small rodents. Ornis Norvegica 39: 25-28. The adult plumage is greyish brown, with a dark brown head, paler forehead and buff breast. The rump is yellowish and the chin and throat are grey. There is also rufous streaking on the outer feathers, and the bill and legs are black.Coombes F. 1978. The Crows, a Study of the Corvids of Europe. BT Batsford Limited Their overall colouration is fairly inconspicuous to visually conceal them from predators within their forest habitat.Blomgren A. 1971. Studies of less familiar birds, 162: Siberian jay. British Birds 64: 25-28. The plumage is also very soft and fluffy for insulation against extreme cold in winter. There is one moult per year, which lasts from mid-June to mid-September. An individual can live for up to 20 years,Lillandt B-G, Bensch S, von Schantz T. 2003. Family structure in the Siberian jay as revealed by microsatellite analysis. The Condor 105: 505-514. although the average lifespan has been reported as 7.1 years.Birdlife International. 2016. Perisoreus infaustus. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. e.T22705775A87356809. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-3.RLTS.T22705775A87356809.en Newly hatched young are almost bare and are closely covered by the female. Juveniles look similar to adults, but have paler heads. Siberian jays appear to be specially adapted in flight to navigating dense forest, whilst they are rather cumbersome flyers in open terrain; which may explain their vulnerability to raptor predators outside forests.Fabritius H. 2010. Effective population size and the viability of the Siberian jay population of Suupohja, Finland. Master‚Äôs thesis, University of Helsinki. The Siberian jay is mostly silent but can utter a loud scream which resembles that of a buzzard (Buteo spp.). The song, which is given by both sexes; mainly in the breeding season and heard only from a short distance, comprises many different sounds. These range from soft and harsh notes, whistling, creaking, trilling and mimicked song of other birds. Habitat and distribution The Siberian jay is resident in the northern boreal forests of spruce, pine, cedar and larch stretching from Scandinavia to northern Russia and Siberia. It has an extensive range estimated at and is native to Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and China. It is vagrant in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. Although the species is largely sedentary, some individuals in the east of the range may move southwards in winter.Madge S. 2009. Siberian Jay (Perisoreus infaustus). In: del Hoyo J, Elliot A, Sargatal J. Christie DA, de Jauna E.(eds). Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. This jay favours dense, mature forest habitat with closed canopy within lowlands and foothills. Spruce forest is the preferred foraging and nesting habitat because the denser foliage of spruce than other local conifers offers greater concealment from predators.Edenius L, Meyer C. 2002. Activity budgets and microhabitat use in the Siberian Jay Perisoreus infaustus in managed and unmanaged forest. Ornis Fennica 79: 26-33. Indeed, breeding success has been linked to higher foliage density; where eggs and nestlings are less likely to attract attention of predators. Additionally, the benefit of increased predator evasion through more hiding space would probably outweigh the cost of making predators more difficult to see by the jays within the dense foliage.Nystrand M. 2006. Influence of age, kinship, and large-scale habitat quality on local foraging choices of Siberian jays. Behavioural Ecology 17: 503-509. The Siberian jay is notably selective in its choice of territory, with a typical territory comprising old dense spruce swamp with ample vegetation cover. Territories also tend to be structurally diverse, comprising variably aged scrub, groves and flood meadows; so that active territories may be regarded as an indicator of high ecological diversity within the forest. Ecology=Feeding= The Siberian Jay is omnivorous and feeds mainly on berries, seeds, insects and spiders.Virkkala R. 1988. Foraging niches of foliage-gleaning birds in the northernmost taiga in Finland. Ornis Fennica 65: 104-113. Flocks will also feed on large carcasses killed by mammalian predators such as wolves and wolverines. Other occasional food items include eggs of small birds, tit nestlings, snails, slugs, small mammals and lizards. In autumn and winter, berries (especially bilberries and cowberries) are typically collected and stored behind loose bark or in hanging beard lichen and between forked twigs. Siberian jays distribute many different hidden food caches over a large area and are therefore known as scatter hoarders.Ekman J, Brodin A, Bylin A, Sklepkovych B. 1996. Selfish long-term benefits of hoarding in the Siberian jay. Behavioural Ecology 7: 140-144. However, unlike in other corvids, this hidden food stash is not purposefully shared with siblings to increase inclusive fitness but is consumed by the hoarder or a pilferer for selfish use. These food caches are critical to this species‚Äô winter survival since foraging time is greatly restricted by the few hours of daylight. To securely store food, Siberian jays have developed special saliva glands which they use to form sticky food clumps which they then adhere to beard moss or holes in tree bark; where they are readily accessible throughout the winter. Because of their reliance on food stores during winter, they are territorial birds with reserves scattered around the territory, especially near to the nest. When foraging, Siberian jays often stay within closed forest to avoid visual detection by predators, although they may occasionally forage for insects in wet tussocky open areas. They forage in flocks comprising 3-5 individuals within their large territory. Especially in winter, Siberian jays will also venture into increasingly open areas to take and store small rodents for food when the latter are abundant. The young are fed a high proportion of insect larvae, which is collected by the male and stored in his oesophagus, until he returns to the nest to regurgitate it to feed to the young. In the first week of brooding, the male provides the female and young with all their food, and the female takes an increasing share of the work thereafter. =Breeding= Siberian Jays are strictly monogamous and an established pair will stay together and hold the same territory for life. Mate guarding in both sexes has been observed in this species, whereby males and females become increasingly aggressive toward same- sex conspecificsRuth L. 2016. Mate-guarding in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus). Biology Independent Research Project, Karlstads Universitet. (Ruth, 2016). This may prevent extra-pair mating opportunities for the partner and thereby preserve inclusive fitness for both pair members. The size of the territory is , which is slightly enlarged in autumn and winter. Although territories are firmly established, the jays can move to a neighbouring site if this is a better quality habitat where breeding success will be higher.Ekman J, Eggers S, Griesser M, Tegelstr”ßm H. 2001. Queueing for preferred territories: delayed dispersal of Siberian jays. Journal of Animal Ecology 70:317-324. Widowed individuals have been observed to establish new pair bonds. The nest is situated in a pine or spruce tree above ground within dense foliage to minimise detection by nest predators.Eggers S, Griesser M, Nystrand M, Ekman J. 2006. Predation risk induces changes in nest-site selection and clutch size in the Siberian jay. Proc. R. Soc. B 273: 701-706. The nest comprises a loose cup of dry twigs broken off trees by the jays and is thickly lined with beard lichen moss, down feathers, cobwebs, reindeer fur and wasp nest fragments; which is necessary insulation against the extreme winter cold. Nest material is hoarded in winter long before building takes place. Nest building then begins in late March and lasts about three weeks. Both partners collect nest material; but only the female builds the nest. The eggs are pale green, blue or grey and spotted with grey and brown. Average egg dimensions are .Harrison C. 1975. A Field Guide to the Nests, Eggs and Nestlings of British and European Birds. London They are laid 31 March ‚Äì 22 April, with a variable clutch size of 1-5 (and incubation period of about 19 days (Coombes, 1978, Eggers, 2006). The eggs are incubated entirely by the female, whilst the male provides all the food for the brooding female and the chicks.Eggers S. 2002. Behaviour and life-history responses to chick provisioning under the risk of nest predation. PhD dissertation, Uppsala University. The Siberian jay is single brooded and does not relay in a breeding season even after nest failure, but will wait until next year. A new nest is also built for every breeding attempt. The young fledge in mid-May to early June and leave the nest around this time, 18‚Äì24 days after the first chick has hatched; although they usually hide within tree branches on the territory until able to fly. Parents continue to feed them for about three weeks after fledging and all remain in a family group throughout summer, autumn and winter. Most mature young disperse from the natal territory in their first summer 4‚Äì8 weeks after fledging to join new groups which are usually more than four territories away from the natal territory.Griesser M, Nystrand M, Eggers S, Ekman J. 2008. Social constraints limit dispersal and settlement decisions in a grouplivingbird species. Behavioral Ecology 19: 317‚Äì324. These early dispersers are generally subordinates which have been out-competed and displaced by one or a few socially dominant offspring that are retained. If offspring have not yet dispersed by the time they are eight weeks old, they usually remain in the natal territory at least through the first winter. The retained, socially dominant offspring which remain on the natal territory may wait for up to five years before dispersing when a breeding opportunity arises. Retained offspring can also claim their natal territory, but only if both parents disappear within a short time, which is rare. Offspring may inherit and breed at a new territory to which they disperse. However, if there are no vacant territories to occupy, juveniles can join a different family group to gain feeding advantages and may attempt to establish own territory at an age of 2‚Äì3 years. =Other behaviours= The species has a complex and unusual social structure. Siberian jays live in small flocks of 2-7 individuals, with the dominant breeding pair at the centre of the group;Griesser M. 2003. Nepotistic vigilance behaviour in Siberian jay parents. Behavioural Ecology 14: 246-250.Griesser M, Halvarsson P, Drobniak SM, Vila C. 2015. Fine-scale kin recognition in the absence of social familiarity in the Siberian jay a monogamous bird species. Molecular ecology 24.22: 5726-5738. alongside retained multigenerational offspring and unrelated immigrants. Within a group, there is a dominance hierarchy; whereby males are dominant over females and breeders are dominant over non-breeders; with some male non-breeders being dominant over female breeders.Ekman J, Sklepkovych B. 1994. Conflict of interest between the sexes in Siberian jay winter flocks. Animal Behaviour 48: 485-487. Flock composition varies, with some comprising only family members, families associated with nonrelated immigrants, and others containing only nonrelated individuals. Immigrated unrelated individuals can be tolerated within the territory outside nesting areas. At least one offspring usually remains with the parents after successful reproduction and regularly accompanies the pair for at least a year before dispersing; although some retained offspring delay dispersal for up to five years. These are the dominant offspring, which out-compete and expel their subordinate siblings. The dispersed subordinate individuals (which disperse in their first summer) settle as non-breeding immigrants in other existing flocksGriesser M, Halvarson P, Sahlman T, Ekman J. 2014. What are the strengths and limitations of direct and indirect assessment of dispersal? Insight from a long-term field study in a group-living species. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 68.3: 485-497. and tend to disperse much further than their dominant siblings, which more often move straight into a breeding position in a new territory. Unusually for a group living species of Corvidae, group members do not help the parents raise younger siblings in future cohorts (there is no cooperative breeding) and so offspring retention is not explained by cooperative breeding. Groups also unusually stay together outside the breeding season. Retention of some offspring in the natal territory after fledging is probably explained by nepotism which parents show toward them.Ekman J, Griesser M. 2002. Why offspring delay dispersal: experimental evidence for a role of parental tolerance. Proceedings for the Royal Society of London B 269: 1709-1713. Parents provide retained offspring with reliable access to resources and antipredator protection, thereby imparting to them a survival advantage (in turn with an inclusive fitness advantage to the parents). Although delayed dispersal of offspring may be explained by ‚Äúqueueing‚Äù for available high-quality territories for the offspring to occupy, the influence of nepotism has been shown experimentally. In removal experiments in which a father alpha male in a group was replaced with a new male unrelated to the offspring, the offspring were more likely to disperse prematurely; probably because the new male did not impart the same nepotistic advantages to the now unrelated young. Although retained offspring may incur an initial cost of postponing breeding, this may be offset by enhanced breeding success later in life as a result of resource advantages gained from nepotistic parents; and late dispersers have been found to have higher lifetime reproductive success than early dispersers.Ekman J, Bylin A, Tegelstrom H. 1999. Increased lifetime reproductive success for Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus males with delayed dispersal. Proc. R. Soc. Lond B 266: 911-915 Siberian jays also display nepotistic alarming calling and these calls may function as a warning to conspecifics of an approaching predator.Griesser M. 2013. Do warning calls boost survival of signal recipients? Evidence from a field experiment in a group-living bird species. Frontiers in Zoology 10: 49 Warning calls have been shown experimentally to decrease reaction time in response in an approaching predator and improve survival within non-breeding individuals. However, females seem more able than males to differentiate between kin and non-kin(Griesser and Ekman, 2004). Alongside direct warning to family group members, nepotistic alarm calling by a breeding female may also function to divert predator attention away from her offspring.Griesser M, Ekman J. 2004. Nepotistic alarm calling in the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus. Animal Behaviour 67: 933-939 Siberian jays are aggressive to non- related intruders on their territory. Two different aggressive responses from territory holders within feeding grounds have been observed:(1) the intruder is approached and forced away (2) or is chased in flight; although the latter behaviour is more costly to the aggressor. Although breeders show considerably more aggression toward immigrants than retained offspring, aggressive responses appear to be modified by social dominance within groups. For example, females have been found to receive notably more aggression than males because males show more resistance owing to their higher social dominance, therefore leading to higher energy cost by the aggressor. Siberian jays also appear to recognise their own young through associative learning as opposed to genetic cues, as shown by experiments in which Siberian jays did not differentiate between own and fostered offspring. Threats Birds of prey, especially hawks such the goshawk and sparrowhawk, are the main predators of Siberian jays. Most Siberian jay predators detect prey visually, so that ample forest cover together with the jays‚Äô cryptic colouration and secretive nesting help render the jays inconspicuous to predators.Eggers S, Griesser M, Andersson T, Ekman J. 2005. Nest predation and habitat change interact to influence Siberian jay numbers. OIKOS 111: 150-158. Predators of this species‚Äô eggs and young include squirrels, ravens, hooded crows, magpies and Eurasian jays. As an antipredator measure, the nest is built in the dense foliage to minimize predator attention. Females also appear to lay smaller clutches under higher predation pressure, and this may minimise predator attention to the nest through fewer necessary nest visits by the parent. Further, in higher cover nests, chicks are fed by the parent more evenly than in exposed nests more detectable by predators; so that chicks raised in well-concealed nests are expected to have better growth. The European range of the population is threatened by habitat degradation through forestry, road building, settlements and agriculture.Hagemeijer, EJM, Blair MJ. 1997. The EBCC Atlas of European breeding Birds: their Distribution and Abundance. T. and A. D. Poyser, London. Modern European forestry practices in particular may be decreasing breeding habitat quality for the Siberian jay primarily through reduced foliage cover. This may occur through forest thinning, whereby lower-quality trees are regularly removed from forest stands. Excessive clearcutting has been linked with increased territory abandonment by Siberian jays and in turn strong decreases in the species‚Äô breeding success in affected areas.Griesser M, Nystrand M, Eggers S, Ekman J. 2007. Impact of forestry practices on fitness correlates and population productivity in an open-nesting bird species. Conservation Biology 21: 767-774. Another practice which may threaten the Siberian jay has been the large-scale removal of stands of native spruce to be replaced with pine, potentially leading to loss of sufficient visual cover of nesting activity from predators with removal of spruce. In Finland, spruce has also been declining faster than other forest types and loss and fragmentation of spruce forests through forestry has been linked with population declines here.Muukonen P, Angervuori A, Virtanen T, Kuparinen A. 2012. Loss and fragmentation of Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) habitats. Boreal Environment Research 17: 59-71. Anthropogenic habitat loss may be interacting with natural threats from predators. The Siberian jay population has declined more than can be explained by anthropogenic forest clearance alone,Helle P, Jarvinen O. 1986. Population trends of North Finnish land birds in relation to their habitat selection and changes in forest structure. OIKOS 46: 107-115 which may be attributable to increased nest exposure to avian predators and other human activities favouring these predatory species. Human activity may also lead to increases in nest predators such as Eurasian jays through activities such as supplemental feeding and refuse dumpling, in turn compounding the predation pressure on Siberian jays through increased exposure. Finally, destruction by felling of winter food storages in trees near territories during winter may also destroy winter food caches. Alongside increased predator attention, the open land exposed as a result of forest habitat fragmentation also presents an apparently large dispersal barrier which the jays find difficult to cross given their apparent cumbersomeness at traversing open land. Siberian jays are also apparently unable to evolve fast enough to adapt to these anthropogenic habitat and predator population changes. Because this species is markedly sedentary, there appear to several genetically isolated subpopulations. Given this jay's high site fidelity, gene flow between subpopulations may have been low even before onset of modern forestry practices which have created the strong dispersal barriers. In culture and relationship with humans Siberian jays are reported to be fearless in human company, and with repeated provision of food by humans in the same place may become tame enough to take food from the hand. This was especially the case formerly when forestry workers regularly left patches of food scraps in the forest for the jays to take; with the same being true around campfires. The Siberian jay has now gained flagship status as a conservation concern both because of threats from modern forestry and because active territories are considered a sign of high-quality biodiverse forest. Status The Siberian jay is evaluated as Least Concern by the IUCN because of the species‚Äô exceptionally large range. Although the world population is decreasing, the magnitude of this decrease is not considered sufficiently large to render the species Vulnerable. The world population is very large and estimated at 4295000-7600000 mature individuals. Population declines have been reported to be strongest in the southernmost part of the range.

Statue of Abraham de Fabert in Metz, France At the age of fourteen, Abraham de Fabert entered the Gardes Fran√ßaises, and in 1618 received a commission in the Piedmont regiment, becoming major in 1627. He distinguished himself repeatedly in the constant wars of the period, notably in La Rochelle and at the Siege of Exilles in 1630. His bravery and engineering skill were again displayed in the sieges of Avesnes and Maubeuge in 1637, and in 1642 Louis XIII made him governor of the recently acquired fortress of Sedan. In 1651 he became lieutenant-general, and in 1654 at the Siege of Stenay he introduced new methods of siegecraft which anticipated in a measure the great improvements of Vauban. In 1658 Fabert was made a marshal of France, being the first commoner to attain that rank. He died in 1662 from a pneumonia at Sedan, where he was governor.

The main span is long, and the bridge is long, with an air draught above mean high water level of . It also has a separate footpath and cycleway which connects with Avonmouth station. Construction The bridge was built with three lanes each way, with full hard shoulders. In 2002‚Äì04, it was widened to four lanes each way, with the result that the hard shoulders are no longer of full width. The bridge was built to allow tall ships underneath. This gave the bridge steep gradients that cause heavy vehicles to slow down, resulting in congestion during rush hour and the summer tourist season: traffic can back up both on the bridge and on the approaches. The construction contract was let to Fairfield-Mabey and commenced in 1969; Fairfield-Mabey placed a sub-contract with Tarmac Civil Engineering for the foundations, piers and deck concreting works. Surface The approach and initial climb up the bridge have a smooth asphalt surface; however, on the top of the bridge the surface was uneven and bumpy when it was built. In September 2006, it was announced that the entire bridge would be resurfaced, only five years after the last resurfacing. This was completed in November 2009 by the construction firm Stirling Lloyd. However, the surfacing was carried out by Stirling Lloyd's partners Aeschlimann AG from Switzerland using its own workforce and also importing all the plant used. A new type of asphalt called Gussasphalt was used on the bridge deck, The project was managed by Stirling Lloyd's Darren Holmes. In addition to having a smooth, skid-resistant finish, it requires no compaction and can be applied in very thin layers ( Each layer only 25 mm thick), thus reducing the weight added to the bridge. It is also flexible and as a result should last longer than the previous resurfacing.

He was one of the most influential Anglican theologians of the 19th century, helping reconcile the church to some aspects of biblical criticism and scientific discovery, while remaining Catholic in his interpretation of the faith and sacraments. Also known for his social action, Gore became an Anglican bishop and founded the monastic Community of the Resurrection as well as co-founded the Christian Social Union. He was the chaplain to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. Early life and career Charles Gore was born on 22 January 1853 into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family as the third son of Hon. Charles Alexander Gore (1811-1897), grandson of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran,Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 1999, vol. 1, p. 111 and Lady Augusta Lavinia Priscilla, a daughter of John William Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough. His brother Spencer was the first winner of the Wimbledon Championships. Gore was raised in a low-church Anglican family and was confirmed by the church at the age of eight years. He was attracted to the high-church sacramental tradition and ritualism of Anglo-Catholicism at a young age, later writing \\"I have since my childhood been what I may call a Catholic by mental constitution\\". Around the age of nine years, he read Grace Kennedy's anti-Catholic novel Father Clement. The book served as his introduction to the high-church tradition and, instead of having his Protestantism reinforced as the author had intended, he found himself entranced by the Catholic tradition. He would later write of it: In his evidence given before the Ecclesiastical Discipline Commission in 1905 he said: In his adolescence, he began attending churches \\"that offered a richer sacramental ceremonial.\\" Gore's parents sent him to Harrow School, London, in 1866, where he excelled academically. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1871, where he supported the trade-union movement. He graduated from Oxford in 1875 with a first-class degree in literae humaniores. In 1875, Gore was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and he lectured there from 1876 to 1880. Gore was ordained to the Anglican diaconate in December 1876 and to the priesthood in December 1878. From 1880 to 1883, he served as vice- principal of Cuddesdon Theological College. He received Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from various universities, including University of Athens, University of Birmingham, University of Oxford, Durham University, and University of Edinburgh. Theologian at Pusey House When, in 1884, Pusey House was founded at Oxford, in part as a memorial to Edward Bouverie Pusey, and as a home for Pusey's library, Gore was appointed as principal, a position he held until 1893. As Principal of Pusey House, he exercised wide influence over undergraduates and the younger clergy and it was largely under this influence that the Oxford Movement underwent a change which to surviving Tractarians seemed to involve a break with its basic principles. Puseyism had been in the highest degree conservative, basing itself on authority and tradition and repudiating compromise with the modern critical and liberalising spirit. Gore, starting from the same basis of faith and authority, found from experience in dealing with the doubts and difficulties of the younger generation that this uncompromising attitude was untenable and set himself the task of reconciling the principle of authority in religion with that of scientific authority, by attempting to define the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence. To him the divine authority of the Catholic Church was an axiom. In 1889, he published two works, the larger of which, The Church and the Ministry, is a learned vindication of the principle of apostolic succession in the episcopate against the Presbyterians and other Reformed church bodies, while the second, Roman Catholic Claims, is a defence, in more popular form, of Anglicanism and Anglican ordinations and sacraments against the criticisms of Roman Catholic authorities. So far Gore's published views had been in consonance with those of the older Tractarians, but in 1890 a stir was created by the publication, under his editorship, of Lux Mundi, a series of essays by different writers attempting to bring the Christian creed into a harmonious relation to the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historic, critical, and to modern problems of politics and ethics. Gore himself contributed an essay on \\"The Holy Spirit and Inspiration\\" and, from the tenth edition, one of Gore's sermons, \\"On the Christian Doctrine of Sin\\", was included as an appendix. The book, which ran through twelve editions in little over a year, met with a mixed reception. Traditional clerics, both Evangelicals and Tractarians, were alarmed by views on the incarnate nature of Christ which seemed to them to impugn his divinity and, by concessions to the higher criticism in the matter of the inspiration of scripture, appeared to them to convert the \\"impregnable rock\\" (as Gladstone had called it) into a foundation of sand. Sceptics, however, were not impressed by a system of defence which seemed to draw an artificial line beyond which criticism was not to advance. The book nonetheless produced a profound effect far beyond the borders of the Anglican churches and it is largely due to its influence, and to that of the school it represents, that the Anglican high church movement developed on Modernist rather than Tractarian lines from then on. Bampton Lectures, Radley parish, and Westminster Abbey In 1891 Gore was chosen to deliver the Bampton Lectures, and he took for his subject the \\"Incarnation of Christ\\". In these published lectures, Gore developed the theology of Lux Mundi, attempting to explain how Christ, though incarnate God, could err (for example, in his citations from the Old Testament). The orthodox explanation had been based on the religious principle of accommodation. This, however, had not solved the difficulty that if Christ on earth was not subject to human limitations, especially of knowledge, he was not as other men, not subject to their trials and temptations. Gore addressed this through revisiting the Kenotic Theory of the Incarnation. Theologians had attempted to explain what Paul the Apostle meant when he wrote of Christ (Philippians 2:7) that he emptied himself (kenosis) and took upon him the form of a servant. According to Gore this means that Christ on his incarnation, although sinless, became subject to all human limitations and stripped himself of all attributes of Godhead, including omniscience, the divine nature being hidden under the human. The Bampton Lectures led to a tense situation, which Gore relieved in 1893 by resigning his principalship of Pusey House and accepting the position of vicar of Radley parish near Oxford. In 1894 Gore became a canon of Westminster Abbey. Here he gained commanding influence as a preacher and in 1898 was appointed one of the court chaplains. In July 1901 he was appointed a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Edward VII, though he resigned as such on elevation as bishop in January 1902. Community of the Resurrection In 1892, while Principal of Pusey House, Gore founded a clerical fraternity, known as the Society of the Resurrection. The society became a religious community and he became its first superior, only resigning when appointed as Bishop of Worcester in 1902. Its members were Anglican priests bound by the obligation of celibacy, living under a common Benedictine rule and with a common purse. Their work was pastoral, evangelistic, literary and educational. The community followed Gore to Radley in 1893, most of them remaining there when he moved to London in 1894. In 1898 the House of the Resurrection in Mirfield, near Huddersfield, became the centre of the community. The Community later also admitted lay brothers, and its monastic character became more central, moving closer to the Benedictine tradition. Although the community followed a liturgical day familiar to Roman Catholic monks, Gore and the other founders wanted it to engage in social action. Five of the six founding members belonged to the Christian Social Union, hence the decision to settle in the industrial north, between Wakefield and Huddersfield. In 1903 a college for training candidates for the Anglican priesthood, the College of the Resurrection, was established in Mirfield and, in the same year, a branch house for missionary work was set up in Johannesburg in South Africa. Bishop in Worcester, Birmingham, and Oxford In November 1901 Gore was nominated to succeed J. J. S. Perowne as Bishop of Worcester. The appointment caused some controversy, due to his teachings and relationship to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury (he was a cousin of Lord Salisbury's daughter-in-law). The Church Association and the Liverpool Laymen's League were among societies lodging formal protests before his confirmation. After subsequent legal hearings, Gore was consecrated as Bishop at Lambeth Palace on 23 February 1902, and enthroned at Worcester Cathedral two days later on 25 February. Gore in 1902 He received the degree Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford in December 1901, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1902. In 1905 Gore was installed as the first Bishop of Birmingham, a new see, which he had helped to create by dividing his see of Worcester. The second parish church of Birmingham, St Philip, became the cathedral. While adhering to his views on the divine institution of episcopacy as essential to the Christian Church, Gore from the first cultivated friendly relations with the ministers of other Christian denominations and advocated co-operation with them in all matters when agreement was possible. In social questions Gore became a leader of the group of high Anglicans known loosely as Christian socialists. In 1889 at Pusey House Gore had helped found the Christian Social Union. He worked actively against the sweating system, pleaded for European intervention in Macedonia, and was a keen supporter of the Licensing Bill. In 1911 he succeeded Francis Paget as Bishop of Oxford and Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. He took legal possession of the See by the confirmation of his election on 17 October 1911 at St Mary-le-Bow by Alfred Cripps, Vicar-General of the Province of Canterbury. On 28 September 1917 Gore licensed 21 women as lay readers called the \\"Diocesan Band of Women Messengers\\". These were possibly the first female lay readers in the Church of England. The last one, Bessie Bangay, died in 1987 aged 98. Retirement in London Gore resigned in 1919 and retired to London, where he lived at 6 Margaret Street as a tenant of the parochial authorities of All Saints, Margaret Street. There he remained for several years, celebrating regularly in the church and in the sisters' chapel close by, and taking his usual keen interest in the affairs of the church and parish. At the same time Gore attached himself to Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, and was licensed to the Rector of St George's, Hanover Square, in whose parish that chapel stands, thus becoming for the first time in his life a licensed curate. Gore was a bundle of contradictions, an Anglo- Catholic in the Church of England whose questioning of the Old Testament produced in the 1890s a crisis for many believers. In the judgment of his biographer, Gore was a loner who thought he had a vocation to community life. He chose to be buried at Mirfield, in the church of the Community of the Resurrection, though he had never managed to be more than a visitor there. In 1929‚Äì1930, he delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures on the topic \\"The Philosophy of the Good Life\\" at the University of St Andrews. Death and legacy Gore died on 17 January 1932 in Kensington, London. He left instructions for his body to be cremated, a practice seen by some at the time as unacceptable for a Christian. Nearly three decades earlier, in a letter read at the 1903 opening ceremony of the Birmingham Crematorium, Gore had written: Gore's wishes provoked the Anglo-Catholic leader and politician Lord Halifax to exclaim, belatedly, \\"I could shake the life out of him with my own hands.\\" The ashes were taken to Mirfield in Yorkshire for burial. His cope and mitre remain at the Grosvenor Chapel.

He was a noted philanthropist, who donated over ¬£100 million in his lifetime.  Early life  Botnar was born in Chernivtsi, which was then called Czernowitz and belonged to Austria-Hungary. During his childhood, in 1918, Austria-Hungary dissolved and his hometown, renamed CernƒÉu≈£i, became part of Romania. Under its present name it is now part of Ukraine. He spent 1932‚Äì1936 in prison. Afterwards, he moved to France, where he joined the French Resistance and fought against the Nazis in World War II. He returned to Romania in 1946 and remained there until 1960. In 1966, he fled Communist Eastern Europe and ended up in Worthing in England. It was in Worthing that he founded the new company Datsun UK (now Nissan UK) in 1970.  Datsun and Nissan UK  Botnar had originally run the UK import business for the German manufacturer NSU, however this business was dissolved when NSU was taken over by Volkswagen in 1969 (ultimately becoming Audi), and Botnar was looking for a new venture. He successfully became the UK franchisee and importer for Nissan, and its Datsun range of cars. Under Botnar's leadership, Datsun had become one of the biggest car imports in Britain, outselling not only its arch Japanese rival Toyota but eventually became the most popular foreign brand in the UK. At its peak, Botnar owned more than 200 Nissan dealerships throughout the country and was considered one of Britain's wealthiest men.  Philanthropy  Octav's only child, Camelia Botnar, was killed in a car crash near Stonehenge in 1972 at the age of 20. Her death led to a wave of philanthropy that saw Botnar donate millions to charity throughout his later life. One of his larger donations was ¬£13 million to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. He also established the Camelia Botnar Foundation in his daughter's memory. The foundation, located in West Sussex, is still active today, providing residential training and work experience, helping young people to learn a skilled trade, embark on a useful career path and successfully make their own way in life.  Tax Controversy  In June 1991, the Inland Revenue raided Nissan UK's headquarters, as well as Mr Botnar's home and the homes of other company officials. The tax authority accused Botnar of evading more than ¬£200 million in taxes. Botnar left for Switzerland and lived for the rest of his life there in Villars-sur-Ollon. The Nissan UK and AFG businesses subsequently foundered, after Nissan took its UK distribution and import activities completely in-house in 1991. Although Botnar maintained his innocence up until his final hours, he had agreed to pay ¬£59 million to settle the case. Following settling, he opened a suit against the Inland Revenue for damages and malicious prosecution. At the time he said: \\"The damages I am seeking are only token, but I want to clear my name. I want my day in court.\\"  Death  Botnar spent his last years as a tax exile in Switzerland fighting the Inland Revenue. He died on 11 July 1998 at the age of 84 after suffering from stomach cancer. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery, Paris. Tory party chairman Lord Parkinson once described Botnar as truly one of our greatest philanthropists.

Kelly was obviously well known to rebel and loyalist alike during the short duration of the Wexford Rebellion but almost nothing is known of him outside this time. He was one of the leaders of the rebel victory at the Battle of Three Rocks which led to the capture of Wexford town but was later seriously wounded while leading a rebel column at the Battle of New Ross. Robert Gogan describes how Kelly was under orders from the Wexford commander Bagenal Harvey to attack the British outposts around New Ross but on no account to attack the town itself. The rebels outnumbered the British forces and so Harvey sent a messenger to give them an opportunity to surrender. The messenger was shot while carrying a white flag. This angered the rebels who began the attack without receiving the official order from Harvey. Kelly's column of 800 men attacked and broke through Ross's \\"Three Bullet Gate\\" and proceeded into the town itself. After initial success, they were eventually beaten back by British troops and Kelly was wounded in the leg. He was moved to Wexford to recuperate but after the fall of Wexford on 21 June was dragged from his bed, tried and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 25 June 1798 along with seven other rebel leaders on Wexford bridge, after which his body was decapitated, the trunk thrown into the River Slaney and the head kicked through the streets before being set on display on a spike. Ballad His exploits are commemorated in the famous Irish ballad Kelly the Boy From Killane written by Patrick Joseph McCall (1861‚Äì1919). Liam Gaul describes how McCall wrote the song to commemorate the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion, although it was not published in book form until it appeared in McCall's Irish Fireside Songs in 1911. Gaul says the origin of the melody used in the song is uncertain. There is no known reference to it before it was used in Kelly the Boy From Killane and so it is likely that McCall, who was a talented musician, wrote the tune himself. Don Partridge recorded a solo acoustic version of the song in 1964, and would later regularly play the song during street busking, before and after his hit records in the late 1960s. =Lyrics= What's the news, what's the news oh my bold Shelmalier With your long barrelled guns from the sea Say what wind from the south brings a messenger here With the hymn of the dawn for the free Goodly news, goodly news do I bring youth of Forth Goodly news shall you hear Bargy man For the boys march at dawn from the south to the north Led by Kelly the boy from Killane Tell me who is that giant with the gold curling hair He who rides at the head of your band Seven feet is his height with some inches to spare And he looks like a king in command Ah my boys that's the pride of the bold Shelmaliers 'Mongst greatest of heroes a man Fling your beavers aloft and give three ringing cheers For John Kelly the boy from Killane Enniscorthy's in flames and old Wexford is won And tomorrow the Barrow we will cross On a hill o'er the town we have planted a gun That will batter the gateway to Ross All the Forth men and Bargy men will march o'er the heath With brave Harvey to lead in the van But the foremost of all in that grim gap of death Will be Kelly the boy from Killane But the gold sun of freedom grew darkened at Ross And it set by the Slaney's red waves And poor Wexford stripped naked, hung high on a cross With her heart pierced by traitors and knaves Glory-o, glory-o to her brave sons who died For the cause of long down trodden man Glory-o to Mount Leinster's own darling and pride Dauntless Kelly the boy from Killane See also * Wexford Rebellion of 1798 * Bagenal Harvey, John Henry Colclough, Cornelius Grogan, Matthew Keogh, Philip Roche ‚Äì Rebel leaders hanged on Wexford bridge, 25/28 June 1798 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Year of birth missing Category:1798 deaths Category:People from County Wexford Category:United Irishmen Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Great Britain Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Ireland by hanging Category:Executed Irish people Category:Ballads of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 ","title":"John Kelly of Killanne"},{"id":"2305916","text":"Sri Vedanta Desikan (Swami Desika, Swami Vedanta Desika, Thoopul Nigamaantha Desikan) (1268‚Äì1369) was a Sri Vaishnava guru/philosopher and one of the most brilliant stalwarts of Sri Vaishnavism in the post-Ramanuja period. He was a poet, devotee, philosopher, logician and master-teacher (desikan). He was the disciple of Kidambi Appullar, also known as Aathreya Ramanujachariar, who himself was of a master-disciple lineage that began with Ramanuja. Swami Vedanta Desika is considered to be avatar (incarnation) of the divine bell of Venkateswara of Tirumalai by the Vadakalai sect of Sri Vaishnavite. Vedanta Desika belongs to Vishwamitra gotra. On the occasion of 750th anniversary of Vedanta Desika, Indian postal department unveiled a stamp to commemorate the great philosopher's life and highly valued works. The stamp was unveiled by Sri Venkaiah Naidu Vice President of India in May 2019.  Early life  Desika was born in the year 1268 CE, to a pious couple named Ananta Suri and Totaramba, who named him ‚ÄòVenkatanatha‚Äô. When he was five, his maternal uncle, Kidambi Appullar took him to attend a spiritual discourse of Nadadhoor Ammal, a revered Sri Vaishnava scholar of that time. As soon as Ammal saw the divine radiance of the child, he stopped his discourse, and hugged Venkatanatha affectionately. When Ammal told the audience that he had forgotten where he had stopped his discourse, it was Venkatanatha who reminded him immediately, to the astonishment of the assembled scholars. Deeply impressed, Ammal blessed him and predicted that Venkatanatha would become the main torch-bearer for Sri Vaishnavism. When Desika turned seven, Kidambi Appullar accepted Venkatanaatha as his disciple, and taught him arts, sciences and scriptures. By the age of 20, Desika became famous for his mastery over poetry, logic, linguistics, science, Vedanta, debate, and allied arts. Even though Desika was multi- faceted and famous, he lived a humble and simple life with the support of his wife, Thirumangai. He undertook a vow called uchhavritti, whereby he depended wholly on the Supreme Lord for his household needs by accepting grains and vegetables donated by disciples voluntarily, without actively seeking it. Desika stayed in several cities and towns through his life such as Thiruvaheendrapuram, Kanchipuram, Srirangam, Sathyagala and Melkote. He also travelled widely all over India on foot.  Literary works  At each place, he composed many different works in languages such as Tamil, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Manipravala (a mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil) that revealed his ingenuity, creativity, logic, linguistic expertise, devotional fervour and erudite scholarship. He composed over a hundred works in the following genre: ‚Ä¢ 28 devotional poems in Sanskrit such as Hayagriva-stotram, Kamasika-ashthakam and Gopala-vimshati ‚Ä¢ 24 devotional poems and treatises in Tamil such as Gitartha- sangraham and Charama-sloka-churkku ‚Ä¢ 11 philosophical treatises such as Shata-dushani, Mimamsa-paduka and Tattva-Mukta-kalapam ‚Ä¢ 10 commentaries on the works of previous acharyas such as Stotra-Ratna-bhashya, Chatus-shloki- bhashya and Tatparya-Chandrika ‚Ä¢ 5 Narrative poems such as his magnum opus, the Paduka-sahasram, and the epic poem called Yadavabhyudaya which rivals the decorative poetry of Mahakavi Kalidasa's works, and the Hamsa-sandesha ‚Ä¢ 32 esoteric texts revealing the hidden meanings of prappati-marga such as Srimad Rahasya-traya-saram, Paramapada-sopanam, Amrita-ranjani and Amrita-svadhini ‚Ä¢ 1 drama named Sankalpa-suryodayam ‚Ä¢ 13 works on arts and sciences such as Bhugola-nirnayam and Silpartha-saram ‚Ä¢ 4 works that codified religious rites and practices such as Sri-Vaishnava-dinasari and Bhagavad-aradhana-vidhi Appaya Dikshitar, the great medieval scholar appreciated Desika by composing a verse in Sanskrit: evam vichintyas sarvatra bhavaah santi pade padhe kavi tarkika simhasya kavyeshu laliteshvapi'' \\"Even in the simple and soft compositions of this lion of poetry and lion of logic, there is poetic excellence evident at every step he took, and indeed in every word he wrote.‚Äù Desika composed his poems in various poetic metres. Vedic literature is written in the form of hymns set rhythmically to different metres, called ‚Äòchandas‚Äô. Each metre is governed by the number of syllables specific to it. Poets are expected to conform to these norms in their compositions. Swami Desikan has employed 22 metres in the 862 verses he composed on presiding deities of various temples in India. The following are some of the compositions of Vedanta Desika that provide a glimpse of his mastery over poetry, logic, grammar and philosophy: Hayagriva Stotram: a hymn on Lord Hayagriva, the Lord of Learning, who bestows real knowledge to the reciter, banishing the darkness of ignorance from within him. Abheethistavam: a prayer to Lord Ranganatha for relief from different types of fear, ultimately seeking and being bestowed refuge at the lotus feet of the Lord Achyutha Satakam: hundred verses in praise of the Lord of Lords Devanatha, in which Desika expresses his passionate love in the form of a bride Bhagavat Dhyana Sopanam: twelve stanzas that describe the steps for meditating upon the Lord of Srirangam, Ranganathaswami Dasavatara Stotram: describes the ten important incarnations of the Lord to protect the world and uphold the principles of dharma or righteousness Daya Satakam: hundred verses eulogizing the mercy or daya of the Lord of Tirumala. The work is divided into 10 decads, each portraying different qualities of the personified mother, Dayadevi. It commences with the short anushtab metre. Each successive decad employs a more complex metre, till it culminates in decorative poetry that is a sheer delight to hear. Garuda Dandakam: A complex stotram composed in the Dandakam meter style, and has 108 aksharas in every Paadam. It is believed that Desikan composed it when a snake charmer challenged him to summon the mighty Garuda. Sri Stuti: a prayer to ‚ÄòSridevi‚Äô the Goddess of Fortune that is said to have been composed when a bachelor was sent to Desika, seeking financial help for his marriage. Since Desika himself lived a life of voluntary poverty, he took him to the temple of the Goddess and sang Sri Stuti. This culminated in a shower of gold coins, solving the financial problems of the young bachelor. Sudarshanasthaka: eight verses set in the rare ‚Äòdhritichhandas; metre praising the holy discuss-weapon of Lord Vishnu, wielded by the Lord to protect the virtuous. Kamasikasthaka: is a prayer of eight verses to Lord Narasimha who assumed a man-lion form to slay the demon Hiranyakashpu, and protect His devotee, Prahlada. ''' Nyasa sutras: are texts composed by Desika which extract the essence of the sharanagati doctrine of self-surrender. These are the Nyasa Dasakam, Nyasa Vimsathi and Nyasa Tilakam. Vairagya panchakam: five verses that describe the importance of renunciation or vairagya. The word ‚Äòdhana‚Äô or wealth, occurs eleven times, each with a different contextual meaning. Hamsa-sandesha: is a lyric poem of 110 verses, reminiscent of Kalidasa's Meghadhuta. It describes Lord Rama sending a message via a swan to his wife Sita, who was abducted by the demon king Ravana. Yadavabhyudaya: is an epic poem of 24 cantos describing the destiny of the Yadava Kings, the dynasty in which Lord Krishna appeared. It is on par with the Kalidasa's work called Raghuvamsa, which describes the dynasty of the Raghu kings, in which Lord Rama appeared. Paduka Sahasram: composed of a thousand and eight verses spread over 32 divisions called paddhatis, on the holy sandals of the Lord Ranganatha. Desika was challenged by another scholar to compose 1000 verses in a night, and he completed this work in three hours. Verses in one section form pictorial patterns with the arrangements of the letters used. Tamil works: Swami Desikan's Works in Tamil are numerous, out of which two need special mention: Paramathabhangam, where he describes and refutes 15 schools of philosophy, and Aharaniyamam where he describes the correct types food to be consumed by a Vaishnava. = Summary of literary works = Sanskrit Stotras  # Abheeti Sthavam # Achyuta Sathakam # Ashtabuja Ashtakam # Bhagavad Dhyaana Sopaanam # Bhoo Sthuthi # Dasaavataara Stotram # Dayaa Sathakam # Dehaleesa Sthuthi # Devanaayaka Panchaasath # Garuda Dhandakam # Garuda Panchaasath # Godhaa Sthuthi # Gopaala Vimsathi # Hayagriva Stotram # Kaamaasika Ashtakam # Nyaasa Dasakam # Nyaasa Tilakam # Nyaasa Vimsathi # Paramaartha Sthuthi # Raghu Veera Gadhyam (aka) Mahaveera Vaibhavam # Saranaagathi Deepikai # Shodasa Aayudha Stotram # Sree Sthuthi # Sudharsana Ashtakam # Vairaaghya Panchakam # Varadaraaja Panchaasath # Vegaa Sethu Stotram # Yathiraaja Sapthadhi  Kavya Granthas  # Subjashithaanivi # Yaadhavaabhyudhayam # Paduka Sahasram # Hamsa Sandhesam # Samasya Sahasri (Luptham-Lost)  Tamil Prabandams  # Amrita Ranjani # Adhikaara Sangraham # Amritaaswaadhini # Parama Padha Sopaanam # Para Matha Bhangam # Mei Vratha Maanmiyam # Adaikkalap Pathu # Artha Panchakam # Sri Vaishnava Dhinasari # Tiruchchinna Maalai # Panniru Naamam # Tiru Mantira Churukku # Dvaya Churukku # Charma Sloka Churukku # Gitaartha Sangraham # MumManik Kovai # Navaratna (aka Navamani) Maalai # Prabhandha Saaram # Aahaara Niyamam # Pandhu (Luptham-Lost) # Kazhal (Luptham-lost) # Ammaanai (Luptam-Lost) # Oosal (luptham-Lost) # Yesal (Luptham-Lost)  Drama  # SANKALPA SURYODHAYAM  Rahasya Granthas (Esoteric Works)  # Sat Sampradaaya Pari Suddhi # Tattva Padhavi # Rahasya Padhavi # Tattva Navaneetham # Rahasya Navaneetham # Tattva Maatrukai # Rahasya Maatrukai # Tattva Sandhesam # Rahasya Sandhesam # Rahasya Sandhesa Vivaranam # Tattva Ratnaavali # Tattva Ratnaavali Prathipaadhya Sangraham # Rahasya Ratnaavali # Rahasya Ratnaavali Hridhayam # Tattva Thraya Sulakam # Rahasya Thraya Sulakam # ABHAYA PRADHAANA SAARAM # Rahasya Sikhaamani # ANJALI VAIBHAVAM # PRADHAANA SATHAKAM # UPAKAARA SANGRAHAM # Saara Sangraham # Muni Vaahana Bhogam # Madhura Kavi Hridhayam (Luptham- Lost) # PARAMA PADA SOPAANAM # PARA MATHA BHANGAM # HASTHIGIRI MAHAATHMYAM # RAHASYA THRAYA SAARAM # Saara Saaram # Virodha Parihaaram # Nigama Parimalam (Lutham-Lost) 3 # Thiru Mudi Adaivu (Luptham- Lost)  Vedanta Granthas  Group 1: # Tattva Mukthaa Kalaapam # Adhikarana Saaraavali # SATHA DHUSHANI (aka) Satha Doshaani) # Nyaaya Parisuddhi # Seswara Mimaamsa # Mimaamsa Paaduka Group 2: # Nikshepa Raksha # Sat Charitha Raksha- containing (i) Sudharsana Paancha Janya Vidhi, (ii) Oordhva Pundra Dhaarana Vidhi, (iii) Bhagavan Nivedhitha Upayoga Vidhi # Rahasya Rakshaa Group 3: # DRAMIDOPANISHAD TAATPARYA RATNAAVALI ( A commentary on Nammalwar's Tiruvoimozhi) # Dramidopanishad Saara ( A shorter version of above)  Vyakyana Granthas  # Sarvaartha Siddhi # Tattva Teekha # Chatus Slokee Bhashya # Stotra Ratna Bashya # Gitaartha Sangraha Raksha # Taatparya Chandrika # Isaavaasyopanishad # Vedaartha Sangraha (Luptam-Lost) # Rahasya Raksha (aka) Gadhya Thraya Bashya) # Adhikarana Darpanam  Anushtana Granthas  # Bhagavad Aaraadhana Vidhi # Yagnopaveetha Prathishta # Hari Dina Tilakam # Vaishnava Dinasari  Miscellaneous Granthas  # Bhoogola Nirnayam # Silpaartha Saaram # Stheya Virodham # Chakaara Samarthanam # Vaadhi Thraya Khandanam # Vaisvadeva Kaarika # Guru Paramparaa Saaram # Dathi Panchakam # Yamaka Ratnaakaram # Daasa Deepikaa Nigantu # Vedaartha Sangraha Vyaakhyaanam # Saara Dheepam # Tattva Sikhaamani (Luptham-Lost)  Titles and recognition  Desika on a 2019 stamp of India Sri Vaishnava books record how Goddess Lakshmi, known as Ranganayaki in the holy town of Sri Rangam, personally conferred on him the title of ‚ÄòSarva-tantra-svatantra‚Äô or master of all arts and crafts. It is also believed that Lord Rangantha who is the presiding Deity of Sri Rangam, awarded the title of ‚ÄòVedanta Desika‚Äô, meaning: the supreme teacher of the conclusion of all knowledge. This was done because the Lord was immensely pleased when Desika debated with differing scholars and established the supremacy of the path of loving surrender or prapatti-marga. He received other titles such as ‚ÄòKavitarkika-kesari‚Äô and ‚ÄòKavitarkika- simham‚Äô, the lion amongst poets; and ‚ÄòRamanuja-daya-patram‚Äô, the recipient of Ramanuja's causeless mercy, given in a laudatory verse composed by the famous Brahma Tantra Svatantra Swami.  Anecdotes from Desika's life  Several anecdotes and stories of Desika's life illustrate various aspects of his character: his unflinching faith in prapatti-marga as revealed by Srimad Ramanuja, his scholarly sophistication, his mastery over scores of arts and sciences, his immeasurable humility, and his unparalleled spirit of detachment and renunciation. Swami Desika chanted the Garuda Mantra given to him by his Guru, Appullar, at a place called Thiruvaheendrapuram. Sri Vaishnavas believe that Garuda appeared before Desika and awarded him a sacred mantra in praise of Lord Hayagriva, who is the abode of all knowledge. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Hayagriva appeared before Desika and blessed him with the nectar flowing from his mouth. It is believed that the Supreme Lord resided on the tip of Desika's tongue, and all his writings and works are therefore specially blessed by the Lord. In the year 1327, Srirangam city was invaded by Malik Kafur, the General of Allauddin Khilji, who wanted to loot the temple and destroy its Deities. Desika hid the main Deity of the temple behind a newly built wall and placed a duplicate Deity in the front. The smaller festival Deity was smuggled out by Pillai Lokachariar and his men, and carried to Tirupati, where it was worshipped secretly for many years. Back in Sri Rangam, Desika wanted to protect rare manuscripts like the Sruti-prakasha, a commentary on the Sri Bhashya of Ramanuja. Desika and the sons of the author of Shrutiprakasha hid amongst the dead-bodies of thousands of Sri Vaishnavas killed by the marauding invaders. They escaped with the rare manuscripts to Karnataka. Twelve years later, General Gopanna of the Vijaya Nagara empire, defeated the invaders and restored the city of Sri Rangam to its previous glory. Swami Desikan came back to Sri Rangam, and established the rituals and ceremonies for worship in the temple, which are still in vogue today. In particular, he established the chanting of the Tamil compositions called the divya-prabandhams, and installed Deities of the twelve Alwar saints for worship in the temple. A few admirers of Desika, feeling sympathy for Desika's voluntary poverty and abstinence, decided to mix gold coins along with the rice that went to his house as alms. Desika handed the alms to his wife, who promptly showed him the coins. Desika informed her that they were worms that had got mixed with the rice, and separated them using a blade of grass, and threw them out without touching them. A few envious scholars wanted to insult Desika. They strung a few shoes just outside his door. When Desika came out of his house the next day, the shoes hit his head. The watching scholars felt that Desika would become angry at being insulted. Instead, Desika exclaimed in great joy, ‚ÄúOh, what good fortune do I have that the sandals of the great devotees of the Lord have blessed me by touching my head?‚Äù Incidents from Desika's life teach us how he followed what he preached: and was totally surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord in a mood of utmost humility and detachment.  Desika's expertise in sciences, technology and the arts  Vedanta Desika is known as Sarva-tantra-svatantra or a master of science, philosophy, arts and crafts. His knowledge in these fields were frequently put to test by those who could not comprehend how a single mind could be so competent in so many diverse fields of knowledge. A few episodes from Desika's life will illustrate this. = Masonry = A mason challenged Vedanta Desika to construct a well by using bricks with uneven dimensions. The Shilpa Sastra, an ancient treatise on arts and crafts from India says that bricks which are uniform in size, have square corners, have a specific size, and are red in colour are the best for construction. Even though the bricks given to him did not fulfil these requirements, Desika used his extraordinary acumen to arrange these bricks in a unique sequence and plastered them to form the circular periphery of the well, which can still be seen in Tiruvahindrapuram. = Sculpture = Once a sculptor asked Swami Desikan to make an image out of panchaloha (a mixture of five metals ‚Äì copper, tin, lead, silver and zinc) on a condition that the image had to exactly fit on the base provided by him. Swami Desikan not only sculpted an immaculate image but also pointed out the defects in the base structure provided by the professional sculptor. = Food science = The Vedic scriptures categorize food into three ‚Äì sattva, rajasa and tamasa. The sattva food promotes serene mind and long life whereas the rajasa and tamasa foods promote anxiety and laziness respectively. Taking cues from the Vedic scriptures, Vedanta Desika has provided a detailed catalogue of food which should be consumed to maintain a healthy mind and a disease-free life. = Behavioral science = Vedanta Desika wrote an allegorical drama called Sankalpa Surodayam which beautifully portrays the different aspects of human character and their interplay which can lead a man towards a higher goal ‚Äì Salvation (moksha), or to a lower goal ‚Äì the infinite loop of birth and death. Here ‚Äòsankalpa‚Äô is the divine will of the compassionate God to protect humans by granting them salvation and ‚Äòsuryodaya‚Äô is the sunrise that dispels the inner darkness of man. The main character in this play is Man with two forces acting on him: (i) divine and (ii) demoniac. The divine forces aspire to attain salvation whereas the demoniac pull him into the unending cycle of birth and death. Vedanta Desika, the mighty genius in poetry and drama, personifies these forces into kings and queens who in turn seem to be assisted by their own armies (the human qualities that drive these forces). Desika, with his subtle wit and deep insight, portrays how these characters debate between the good and the evil propensities as he goes on to establish the divine destiny of Man through them. = Mathematics = It was in early 18th century that the great mathematician, Leonhard Euler investigated the Knight's tour problem where the knight had to tour the entire chess board without any repetition. But, who would have imagined that this was not just solved by Vedanta Desika, but was woven with intricate poetry and philosophy back in 13th century. In the 30th chapter of his composition, the Paduka Sahasram, Vedanta Desika had used several types of poetic imagery. Chaturanga Turanga Bandham was one such imagery through which the knight's tour problem had already been solved elegantly, 500 years before Euler. Desika showed his knowledge of the arts and sciences through other works Silpartha-saram, a guide on sculpting, and Bhugola-nirnayam ‚Äì a research text on the formation of the earth.  Salutation  In Sri Vaishnavism, a Thanian is a laudatory dedication in verse composed about an acharya by another acharya who is the subject's pupil and someone whom the subject greatly admired. The Thanian of Desika is: > rAmAnuja-dayA-pAtraM j~nAna-vairAgya-bhUShaNaM  > shrImad-venkaTa-nAthAryaM vande vedAntadeshikaM  This Thanian was composed by brahmatantraswatantra jeeyar of Parakala Mutt on the day of star of Hastham, the star of Varadharaja Perumal of Kanchipuram in the Tamil month of Avani. It is recited before starting Divya Prabandham ‚Äî the works of Alwars ‚Äì by Vadakalayars. It translates as \\"I salute the great Venkata Natha also called Vedanta Acharya and Lion among poets and logicians and who was well adorned by both Knowledge and discretion and who well deserved the grace of Athreya Ramanujar who also had the same name.\\"  Vazhi Thirunamam  Vazhi Thirunamam is a set of salutary verses chanted in temples to mark the closure of the day's Divya Prabandha chanting. They are intended to ensure that these temples and the practices as established by the acharyas and desikans will be followed for ever. Vazhi Thirunamam is a set of \\"Salutary Verses\\" that will be chanted in the Temples at the end, marking the closure of the day's Divya Prabandha Chanting. The Salutary Verses are sung in the Temples to ensure that these temples and the practices as established by the Aacharyas and Sri Ramanuja would be followed for ever. Swamy Desikan's Vazhi Thirunamam is being chanted in most of the Vadakalai Divya Desam all over India. The Vazhi thirunamam with the English Transliteration is as following: \\"Vanja Para Samayam Mattra Vandhon Vazhiye Mannu Pughaz Bhoothooran Manamuhappon Vazhiye Kanja Thirumangai Ughakka Vandhon Vazhiye Kaliyanurai Kudi Konda Karuththudayon Vazhiye Senjol Tamil Maraigal Thelindhu Uraippon Vazhiye Thirumalai Mal Thirumaniyay Sirakka Vandhon Vazhiye Thanja Parakadhiyay Thantharulvon Vazhiye Than Tamil Thoopul Thiruvenkadavan Vazhiye!!!

The goal within a bank or company in controlling credit is to improve revenues and profit by facilitating sales and reducing financial risks. A credit manager is a person employed by an organization to manage the credit department and make decisions concerning credit limits, acceptable levels of risk, terms of payment and enforcement actions with their customers. This function is often combined with Accounts Receivable and Collections into one department of a company. The role of credit manager is variable in its scope and Credit managers are responsible for: *Controlling bad debt exposure and expenses, through the direct management of credit terms on the company's ledgers. *Maintaining strong cash flows through efficient collections. The efficiency of cash flow is measured using various methods, most common of which is Days Sales Outstanding (DSO). *Ensuring an adequate Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is kept by the company. *Monitoring the Accounts Receivable portfolio for trends and warning signs. *Hiring and firing of credit analysts, accounts receivable and collections personnel. *Enforcing the \\"stop list\\" of supply of goods and services to customers. *Removing bad debts from the ledger (Bad Debt Write-Offs). *Setting credit limits. *Setting credit terms beyond those within credit analysts' authority. *Setting credit rating criteria. *Setting and ensuring compliance with a corporate credit policy. *Pursuing legal remedies for non-payers. *Obtaining security interests where necessary. Common examples of this could be PPSA's, letters of credit or personal guarantees. *Initiating legal or other recovery actions against customers who are delinquent. Credit managers tend to fall into one of three groups due to the differing specialty legal and jurisdictional knowledge required: # Commercial Credit Manager # Consumer Credit Managers # Construction Credit Managers  Professional Organizations = Australia = Credit managers in Australia obtain memberships from the Australian Institute of Credit Management (AICM). Qualifications and continuing education can also be obtained from here. = Canada = Credit professionals in Canada can obtain the official designation, Certified Credit Professional - CCP (formerly known as the Fellow Credit Institute ‚Äî FCI), from the Credit Institute of Canada. This designation is slowly becoming a requirement of most corporations when choosing which individual to hire to manage their credit department. = France = Credit professionals in France can obtain memberships, continuing education and certification through the French Association of Credit Managers, called Association fran√ßaise des Credit Managers AFDCC. = United Kingdom = Credit managers operating within the United Kingdom can obtain accreditation from the Chartered Institute of Credit Management, called the Chartered Institute of Credit Management from 1 January 2015 after it was granted a Royal Charter. = United States = Credit managers in the United States can obtain memberships, continuing education and certification through the National Association of Credit Management. Certification levels include Credit Business Associate, Certified Credit and Risk Analyst, Credit Business Fellow, Certified Credit Executive, Certified International Credit Professional and International Certified Credit Executive.  Construction Credit Management  Construction Credit Management is considered an area of specialty as it encompasses some specific skill sets: 1) Strong knowledge of security and lien law within your province, state or territory, 2) The ability to understand how money moves through the construction pyramid, 3) People skills that go beyond traditional credit management in that the credit manager may be required to deal with Managerial and non-managerial staff of both the white and blue collar variety, 4) A basic knowledge of construction and the willingness to make site visits if needed.

It is home to many rare varieties of migratory birds from different parts of the world. Geography The Pathiramanal Island is 28.505 ha. It is about 1.5 km from Muhamma boat jetty and about 13 km from Alapuzha. From the jetty close by Baker Bungalow the distance to the island is about 5 km and from Kumarakom 4 km towards northwest. *Maximum length: 550m (SW to NE) *Maximum width: 450m (SE to NW) *Perimeter: 1800 m *Estimated Area: 19.6 ha *Distance to the nearest main land: 810m History An info board at Pathiramanal island The island (also known as Anantha Padmanabhan Thoppu) was purchased by Chevalier ACM Anthraper, from M/s Bheemji Devji Trust of Cochin and was under the private ownership of Thaimattathil Family until the late seventies. When Land Reforms Acts were enforced in the State in 1979, the island came under government ownership. The island was returned to the government as a surplus land that crossed the land ceiling. It was later transferred to the Tourism Department and the idea of leasing it out to private enterprises was under consideration. The island at present is uninhabited. Till late seventies of the 20th century 14 worker families resided in the island, who were later rehabilitated on the mainland in the Muhamma panchayath.

Electric trucks have been around in niche application areas for over a hundred years, but more recently the advent of lithium ion batteries has enabled the range of electric trucks to increase to several hundred miles, making them of much wider applicability. Electric trucks are becoming an alternative to traditional trucks, while creating no local pollution. Due to the high efficiency of electric power trains, running costs are expected to be lower. Their simplicity is also supposed to make maintenance costs much lower. According to the United States Department of Energy, the cost per kWh capacity of battery packs for trucks fell from $500 in 2013 to $200 in 2019. However, electric trucks are usually heavier than diesel trucks, the energy density of lithium ion batteries is far less, so very long range trucking requires recharging en route, causing delays, or the swapping of tractor units.  Types = General trucks = A few electric general lorries prototypes or produced by small manufacturers, and often converted Diesel units, have been built until the 2000s. Trials with different companies in real-world conditions, for several months or more, have been conducted, for example with Renault, E Force and Emoss heavy-duty lorries in the 2010s. Renault launched its small electric Maxity in 2010 and Mitsubishi Fuso its slightly larger eCanter in 2017. From 2018, other major manufacturers including MAN, Mercedes- Benz and DAF began deliveries of prototypes or pre-production heavy-duty units to companies for real-world testing. In 2019, the first series production of heavy-duty lorries is expected to begin with notably Renault, Volvo and MAN. The Futuricum Logistics 18E, ordered by DPD for their operations in Switzerland, uses a 680-kWh battery and has a range of \\"up to\\" .https://www.electrive.com/2020/06/14/dpd-switzerland-gets-electric-truck- with-680-kwh-battery/ =Pickup trucks= JAC Shuailing i3-T330 is a series production electric pickup with a 67.2 kWh battery (JAC Shuailing T8, its conventional-engine counterpart, used as illustration) In the late 1990s, Chevrolet produced a small series of an electric S-10 pickup truck. In early 2009, Phoenix Motorcars introduced a test fleet of their all-electric SUT (Sports Utility Truck) to Maui. Miles Electric Vehicles imported the Chinese- designed ZX40ST electric small pick-up in the United States in the late 2010s. A Canadian company named Ecotuned offers an all-electric conversion of the Ford F-150; these vehicles are used by the electricity provider Hydro Quebec and Montreal Airport. Ford itself intends to manufacture an electric variant of the F-150; construction of a factory for this purpose, next to the existing one in Dearborn, has already started.https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/ford- construction-new-factory-electric-f-150-pickup-truck Models in production include: * JAC Shuailing i3-T330 * Dongfeng Rich 6 EV Announced models include: * Tesla Cybertruck * Ford F-150 electric * Rivian R1T * Lordstown Endurance Additionally, a lot of Neighborhood Electric Vehicles are, or were, available as light pickup trucks. =Semi-trailer and tractor trucks= As of 2020, electric semi-trucks are in limited commercial use in California at Anheuser-Busch, GSC Logistics, Golden State Express (all using the BYD 8TT semi-tractor), Penske, and NFI (both using the Freightliner eCascadia semi- tractor). These trucks are not limited to operation within seaports or drayage operations; their range (in the case of the BYD 8TT, 124 miles at full load and 167 miles at half load) allows use on regional routes. GSC Logistics demostrated this by hauling cargo from the Port of Oakland, over the Altamont Pass, to Tracy, CA and back. After returning, the truck still had 40% of its battery remaining.https://gsclogistics.com/byd-electric Volvo, DAF, MAN, Freightliner plan to begin series production of electric articulated lorries between 2019 and 2020. Tesla plans to join in 2021 with the Tesla Semi. Such vehicles are already manufactured, and sold in both the US and China, by BYD Auto (the BYD 8TT). History The Port of Los Angeles and South Coast Air Quality Management District have demonstrated a short-range heavy-duty all-electric truck capable of hauling a fully loaded cargo container. The current design is capable of pulling a cargo container at speeds up to and has a range of between . It uses , compared to for the hostler semi tractors it replaces. Economics of fuel is equivalent to =33.7kwh, according to the US Department of Energy. This electric truck uses 2 kilowatt-hours per mile which is the equivalent of using only 10 kwh per every . The diesel truck that it replaces uses the equivalent of 33.7kwh per . Thus the diesel truck is using 3.37 times the amount of energy that the electric truck is using. Thus the only variables that are stopping commercial use of electric trucks are original vehicle cost and the driving range, owing to the high battery pack cost and low specific energy. As mass production happens the cost might eventually be comparable to diesel vehicles and with improvement in batteries the limited range of the electric truck might be a non issue. =Electric tractors= Electric tractors have been built since the 1990s.Steve Heckeroth's tractors BYD does make electric tractors. =Milk float= Smith's Elizabethan milk float A common example of the battery electric trucks is the milk float. Since it makes many stops in delivering milk it is more practical to use an electric vehicle than a combustion truck, which would be idling much of the time; it also reduces noise in residential areas. For most of the 20th century, the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats. =Garbage truck= With a similar driving pattern of a delivery vehicle like the milk float above, garbage trucks are excellent candidates for electric drive. Most of their time is spent stopping, starting or idling. These activities are where internal combustion engines are their least efficient. These and other factors such as ease of driver training resulted in Birmingham City Council opting to use electric dustcarts to start replacing its horse driven carts in 1918. Its use of electric vehicles continued through a number of models including Electricar DV4s until 1971. Electric Dustcarts were also operated by Sheffield and Glasgow. In preparation for the 2008 Olympic Games, 3,000 of the internal combustion engine garbage trucks in Beijing were replaced with lithium ion polymer battery pack electric drive trucks. The batteries were procured for about $3,300 each. In France, some all-electric garbage trucks produced by Power Vehicle Innovation have been operating since 2011 in the city of Courbevoie, the first local authorities in France to acquired them. In 2014, North America became home to its own electric garbage truck. Called the ERV (electric refuse vehicle) it hit the road in Chicago in September 2014. It was the first of an up to $13.4 million purchase order for up to 20 trucks. The PO was won in a competitive bid by Motiv Power Systems in 2012. The majority of the money used to purchase the first truck came from a DoE grant secured by then-Senator Barack Obama. The City of Chicago runs the Motiv ERV on different residential refuse and recycling routes of up to 60 miles, saving 2,688 gallons a year. The 1st all- electric refuse truck in the United States built for the City of Chicago Chicago specified that this ERV must meet the demanding requirements placed on all of its garbage trucks. This included 60 mile range, a payload capacity of nine tons and 1000 pounds per cubic yard of compaction. These specifications make the ERV capable of use anywhere in Chicago. To supply enough electricity to move the truck and power the hydraulics all day, the ERV is equipped with 200 kilowatt-hours of energy, in ten battery packs. Full charge time is 8 hours using the Motiv Universal Fast Charger. Wrightspeed provides electric powertrain for garbage trucks and other medium-duty trucks. In Europe, as of 2020, electric garbage trucks have been ordered by Genevahttps://www.futuricum.com/elektrisches-muellfahrzeug-fuer-genfs- strassen/, Baselhttps://www.elektroauto-news.net/2020/futuricum-elektrische- muellfahrzeuge-basel, Frankfurthttps://www.elektroauto- news.net/2019/frankfurt-muellabfuhr-collect-26-e-schweiz-rein-elektrisch, Duisburghttps://rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duisburg/duisburg-erster-e- muellwagen-in-der-stadt-unterwegs_aid-53580473 and other cities.https://www.toponline.ch/news/winterthur/detail/news/ein-elektrischer- muellwagen-fuer-die-strassen-winterthurs-00137905/ Traditional garbage trucks have extremely high fuel consumption, higher than American 18 wheelers achieve on most routes. Using an electric drive instead of a diesel engine dramatically lowers energy consumption; yet it is still on the order of 1,900 Wh/km or 3,060 Wh/mi. Thanks to a 340-kWh battery, such a truck can still achieve a range of over 177 km (110 miles) before it needs recharging. =Off- road and mining truck= Some attempts to produce such lorries have been made, for example the one by PapaBravo. Electric mining trucks have the benefit of not polluting underground. In case of high-altitude mines, the downhill trip with ore recharges the batteries due to regenerative braking.  Models = BYD = In China, BYD sold 7,969 all-electric/PHEV/hydrogen commercial vehicles in 2018, and 3,836 of them in 2019. These figures exclude buses.http://autonews.gasgoo.com/china_news/70016790.html The manufacturer sells light-, medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks.

Renault Trucks The Renault Maxity is available with an electric powertrain (Diesel tow truck version pictured). Renault Trucks, part of Volvo, began selling an electric version of its Maxity small lorry in 2010. Renault Trucks was the first to build heavy-duty lorries, with three prototypes of electric Renault Midlum and a later Renault D tested in real conditions by different customers (Carrefour, Nestl√©, Guerlain) for a few years between 2012 and 2016. A prototype D lorry has been delivered to Delanchy in November 2017. After these years of testing, Renault will commercialise its D and D Wide lorries in 2019. They will be built in France alongside their Volvo counterparts.  Volvo  Volvo will launch their first mass-produced electric FE and FL lorries in early 2019. They will be built in France alongside their Renault counterparts. For the North American market, an electric VNR articulated lorry will be unveiled in 2019 and enter production in 2020. = Daimler AG = Tokyo motor show 2017  Mitsubishi Fuso  Mitsubishi Fuso began deliveries of the eCanter in 2017.  Mercedes-Benz  Mercedes-Benz began delivering eActros units to 10 customers in September 2018 for a two-year real-world test. Customers include Dachser, Edeka, Hermes, Kraftverkehr Nagel, Ludwig Meyer, Pfenning Logistics, TBS Rhein-Neckar and Rigterink of Deutschland, and Camion Transport and Migros of Switzerland.  Freightliner  Freightliner began delivering e-M2 lorries to Penske in December 2018, and will commercialise its larger e-Cascadia in 2019. A total of 50 electric lorries should be on the road by the end of 2019, including 20 units delivered to Penske and NFI. The Portland factory will be renovated to start electric lorry production in 2021. = Paccar = DAF  DAF delivered its first CF articulated lorry to Jumbo for testing in December 2018. It uses a VDL powertrain. The logistics company Tinie Manders Transport got a unit in February 2019 and Contargo in Germany two units in May.  Peterbilt  Peterbilt has unveiled in Spring 2018 a partnership with Meritor and TransPower, who will supply all-electric drivetrain systems for two Peterbilt vehicle platforms. They will produce twelve Class 8 579EV day cab tractors and three 520EV dustbin lorries that will be tested for about a year. In January 2019, Peterbilt unveiled its medium-duty 220EV also made in partnership with Meritor and TransPower. Six units should be delivered to its major customer in 2019.

After the war he worked as a United States Merchant Marine radio officer, sailing on freighters, tankers, and passenger ships, and later for several years on munitions ships bound for duty in the wars in Korea and Vietnam. He came ashore for good and married the former Bernardine Martin. For a while, he entertained himself as an explorer of caves, a walker in the desert, and a writer on arctic survival for the Air Force. He then chose a more formal profession, becoming vice president of Springhouse Corporation, a publisher of books and magazines. Writing Mu√±oz was a specialist in eighteenth-century literature, a member of the Gunroom, a novelist, a science fiction writer, and especially a poet. He attended Columbia University and wrote his masters thesis on English poet Edward Young in 1953. Stowaway, his mainstream sea novel, was published in 1957. His science fiction short stories appeared in the 1950s and 1960s under the pseudonym T. P. Caravan. One (\\"Random Sample,\\" 1953) was recently reprinted in the anthology Worst Contact (Baen Books, 2016).

It is served by the 2 train at all times. This station is geographically the northernmost station in the entire New York City Subway system, and the only station to be served exclusively by the 2 train.  History  North end The station officially opened on December 13, 1920, as East 241st Street, when the final portion of the line was opened. The line had been extended one stop north from East 238th Street. This portion of the line had its opening delayed, owing to construction on the line between the two stations for the construction of the 239th Street Yard. Additional time was required to modify the structure to avoid a grade crossing at the entrance to the yard. The station was renovated from July to December 2005 at a cost of $17.25 million. The station, as part of the renovation, got a new high-quality public address system, new platform edge and ADA tactile warning strips, major structural repairs, new canopies over the stairs and platforms, repaired walls, renewed floors, and a redesign of the area around the station booth. In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program. Station layout At this station, there are two tracks, one center island platform and two disused side platforms here. The two tracks end at bumper blocks at the north end of the platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform. Now all passengers use the island platform. The middle of the platform features a backlit track departure sign labeled Tracks 3 and 2, indicating which train leaves first. There are also crew quarters at platform level. To the south of the station, the tracks make a connection to the 239th Street Yard before splitting into three tracks. The 2006 artwork featured at the station is Permanent Residents and Visitors by Alfredo Ceibal, which focuses on birds living in and visiting the city. The artwork is made of faceted glass in the platform windscreens. =Exits= The exit is at the north end. Fare control is past the bumper blocks, from where there is one stair to the southwest corner of 241st Street and White Plains Road, and two stairs to the southeast corner. =Names= This terminal station has gone by a number of different names. Becker Avenue was an earlier name for the station at the time of its construction, and it officially opened as East 241st Street on December 13, 1920. By 1984, it was renamed 241st Street on entrances and platform signs. The station was initially signed on the New York City Subway map as 241st Street‚ÄìWakefield. It has been signed on the map under its current name since 1998.

Dedicated on May 15, 1962, it stands on the site of the old cathedral which had been destroyed in a fire. The cathedral is located on Farmington Avenue just outside downtown Hartford across from the Aetna building. In 1979 the cathedral was included as a contributing property in the Asylum Avenue District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Pope Gregory XVI established the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island as the Diocese of Hartford in 1843. Because Providence, Rhode Island had a larger Catholic population, Bishop William Tyler chose to reside there instead of Hartford. His two successors did likewise. Bishop Francis McFarland petitioned to have the diocese divided. After the Diocese of Providence was established in 1872, McFarland moved to Hartford where he bought the old Morgan estate for $75,000 for a cathedral, bishop's residence, and a motherhouse for the Sisters of Mercy. The convent was built first and the chapel was used as a pro-cathedral. Brooklyn, New York architect Patrick Keely was hired to design the cathedral. Bishop Thomas Galberry, O.S.A., McFarland's successor, laid the cornerstone on April 29, 1877. The basement was dedicated for church use the following year. After Bishop Lawrence McMahon liquidated the diocese's debt he was able to complete the original St. Joseph's Cathedral, which was consecrated on May 8, 1892. The Gothic Revival structure was cruciform in shape and its exterior was clad in Portland rough brownstone. Two towers that rose flanked the main facade. The interior featured an inlaid ceiling with wood from every country in the world, a rotunda with $100,000 worth of gold leaf, a bishop‚Äôs throne that was carved oak, a marble high altar, and 72 stained glass windows. It was decorated with paintings and statues. Soil conditions necessitated renovations in 1938-1939 to stabilize the building. A fire destroyed the cathedral on December 31, 1956. Its cause was never determined. Structural engineers determined that the building could not be salvaged and the site was cleared. The New York City architectural firm of Eggers & Higgins was chosen to design the present cathedral. On September 8, 1958, Archbishop Henry O'Brien presided over the formal groundbreaking. During construction, Sunday Masses were held in the auditorium of the Aetna Life Insurance Company building across the street and daily Masses were held in the school auditorium. Auxiliary Bishop John Hackett blessed the lower church on Christmas Eve 1960, and Archbishop O'Brien celebrated the first Mass later that night. Hackett laid the cornerstone for the cathedral on October 3, 1961, while the archbishop consecrated the bells for the carillon in 1961 and blessed the cross for the tower in 1962. Bishop Hackett consecrated the completed cathedral on May 15, 1962. It was built for about $10 million. An addition that includes a new entrance off Asylum Avenue, an elevator, and restrooms was completed in 2016. Two years later the exterior was cleaned and repaired as the limestone was starting to deteriorate. Other projects that are planned as a part of the ‚ÄúForward With Faith‚Äù capital campaign include repairing the front plaza; creation of Cathedral Square that includes a pedestrian mall, park, and public gardens; and renovating the lower level of the cathedral into educational and community meeting facilities, a dining area, and a mausoleum. Architecture The cathedral was designed using an International style interpretation of the Gothic style, and maintained the verticality of the old cathedral. The structure is composed of reinforced concrete covered with smooth light gray coursed limestone. A large frieze over the main entrance features the church's patron, Saint Joseph. The tall bronze doors weigh five and a half tons and are covered with biblical scenes. The cathedral rises to a height of . The blocks of stone used in the tall spire contrasts with the smooth stone of the walls. The \\"blocks are cut in a pattern of voids that causes a constant play of light and shadow.\\" The bell chamber contains 12 bells cast in the Netherlands by Petit & Fritsen. They range in weight from up to . The interior of the cathedral is noted for its large expanse of spectacular stained glass windows crafted in Paris. They are reminiscent of those found in Paris' Sainte-Chapelle. Each panel is roughly and they are thick.

It is an old commercial town, with an ancient history, famous for its printing and book binding industry. It is the chief centre of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Christians in the Kerala state. In the past, the town was called Kunnankulangara and references can be seen many British Archives about a neat and prosperous town which was predominantly Christian. Over the years Kunnamkulam has become a meeting point for all religions. History The history of Kunnamkulam turns back to the Paleolithic age. Kakkad cave and Chowannur cave support this fact. It is said that this place was part of 'Mahodaya Pattanam' and was known as 'Kunnamkulangare'. Traditionally it is believed that a cross was installed by Thomas the Apostle, at Chattukulangara (a part of Arthat in Kunnamkulam). During the invasion of Tippu Sultan in 1789, the Christians from Chattakulangara migrated to Kunnamkulam town after the invitation from Thalapilli Rajas. The Thalapilli Rajas provided residences and places of workship. Most of the oldest and wealthiest Christian families are to be found in Kunnamkulam. Kollannoor, Panakkal, Paramel, Pulikottil, Thengungal, Cheeran, Moolapath, Tholath and Kakkassery were prominent among them. The ascendancy competition between these wealthy families, its contexture to literary activities opened new dimensions in the development of printing. Panakkal Chakku, Cheru, Thengungal Ittoop, Varu and Koothur Paramel Iyyu Uttoop were arbitrators of some of these families. It is said that the Christian families were settled earlier at Chattukulangare shifted to Kunnamkulam after the invasion of Tippu in 1789. They were invited by the Thalappilli Rajas, provided residences and places of worship. They resided on both sides of the street. This may have helped to avoid threat from Tippu against Thalappilli Rajas. Those settled on both sides of the street started trade and business, began a new era of transaction.

Established in 1976, it was tasked with rescuing the ailing Welsh economy by encouraging business development and investment in Wales, clearing derelict land and encouraging growth of local businesses. In April 2006 its functions were transferred into the Welsh Government. History The WDA was established under the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975 under the then Secretary of State for Wales John Morris MP for Aberavon. The WDA had four objectives: # furthering the economic development of Wales # promoting industrial efficiency and international competitiveness # creating and safeguarding employment # improving the environment having regard to existing amenity. The organisation worked to secure entrepreneurial growth in Wales by increasing the number of startup businesses and by persuading multinational companies to relocate or open subsidiary facilities in Wales. Finance Wales is a public limited company set up by the WDA and still providing funding to Welsh businesses. Employing several hundred workers, the WDA was argued to be one of Wales's most important institutions with a network of offices worldwide and their headquarters in the former Bank of Wales building in Cardiff. In its 30-year history the WDA reports claim credit for helping to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and securing billions of pounds in investment. It even enjoyed the praise of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who claimed it was doing a marvelous job. The WDA had an annual budget of approximately ¬£70 million per year. =Success= After some governance issues were brought to light in the early 1990s (see \\"Controversy\\" below), the Government appointed David Rowe-Beddoe (later Lord Rowe-Beddoe) as Chairman in 1993. Rowe-Beddoe appointed an inquiry led by Sir John Caines in late 1993, which led to new executives being appointed. The changes included new Legal Director and new Agency Secretary in 1994 who attended Public Accounts Committees and worked with the National Audit Office and the Welsh Office under Sir Michael Scholar CB in 1994‚Äì96, creating an agency which conformed with the Nolan Principles and was the first UK QUANGO to have a Code of Practice. The Agency reported to John Redwood, David Hunt and William Hague as Secretaries of State for Wales under the Thatcher and Major governments. The Agency regained its spot as a lead inward investment and job creation agency in the late 1990s in the UK. It was credited with having brought in, secured and safeguarded investment with major companies such as Ford, Bosch, Panasonic, Sony, Hoover, TRW, Anglesey Aluminium, Toyota, British Airways, TRW and General Electric. It gained prominence in bringing in financial services companies such as Legal & General and Lloyds Bank into Wales and later on key back office call centres came into Wales. With South Glamorgan County Council, the WDA helped establish Admiral Insurance plc, which is now a FTSE 100 Company. The WDA contributed to the building of the Millennium Stadium and the walk way for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and the Millennium Centre. It assisted in the establishment of the National Botanic Garden for Wales and the Llanelli Coastal Path. It removed contaminated land and reclaimed and removed coal tips in South Wales through the world leader in the field, Gwyn Griffiths OBE. Success included partnerships with newly created 22 local authorities in the mid 1990s on urban regeneration and Town Improvement Grants. It worked in the EU with an Office in Brussels namely the Wales European Centre ensuring it gained European funding with the Welsh Office. It led the successful bid with Sir Terry Matthews for the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor Resort, which was being built at the time near Newport. It also established Finance Wales plc. Other public bodies, including the Development Board for Rural Wales, the Land Authority for Wales, Technical Enterprise Councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, were merged into WDA by the Government of Wales Act 1998. =Merger= The WDA ceased to exist on 1 April 2006, when it and two other ASPBs - the Wales Tourist Board and ELWa - were merged into the Welsh Government. The current Welsh Government Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Infrastructure and Skills is Ken Skates AM, although Ieuan W Jones was the Minister for the Economy and Transport at the time of the merger. The Swansea AM Andrew Davies made the decision to abolish the WDA in conjunction with the First Minister of Wales Rhodri Morgan. Controversy In the early 1990s the WDA attracted controversy when its chairman, Gwyn Jones, a businessman, was appointed by the then Welsh Secretary, Peter Walker after meeting him at a Conservative Party fundraising lunch. He later resigned from the post ahead of a 1992 Commons Public Accounts Committee report that condemned the agency for: * giving out illegal redundancy payments totalling ¬£1.4m between 1989 and 1992; * paying ¬£228,000 to ensure non-disclosure from former executive, Mike Price, whom it sacked following internal conflict in 1991; * allowing free private motoring for board members between 1984 and 1992; * allowing chairman, Dr Gwyn Jones, to obtain a ¬£16,895 WDA rural development grant for one purpose, but when he used it for another without informing the Agency as required, he was not asked to pay it back when a WDA inspector detected the change; * flying directors on Concorde; and * using public money to investigate a management buyout that would have privatised the agency. A sum of ¬£308,000 was discovered in the 1988-1989 accounts to pay for a feasibility study to this end. The Commons Public Accounts committee became concerned when the Auditor General, Sir John Bourn, discovered many irregularities during his annual examination of the Agency's accounts. Criticism also followed the appointments of Neil Carignan and Neil Smith by Gwyn Jones. Carignan's employment was terminated over his poor performance, but he was allowed to take ¬£53,000 of office equipment with him. Smith was hired as a marketing director, but the WDA failed to check his CV, which was fraudulent, and that he was a discharged bankrupt. Smith was later investigated by police over his hiring of models for claimed promotional work, and he was later convicted of theft and deception and went to prison. The WDA was abolished in difficult circumstances in a statement at the National Assembly which took Assembly Members by surprise. The Agency had appointed Graham Hawker as CEO who was in the middle of a reorganisation at the time reversing the regional offices created in 1995 to centralised offices without consultation with the Minister. Hawker resigned in controversial circumstances after the abolition announcement without informing the Minister Andrew Davies AM and the Chair Sir Roger Jones at an Economic Development Committee of the Assembly chaired by Alun Cairns then AM now an MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, this was unprecedented. Hawker was the CEO of Welsh Water PLC prior to his controversial appointment as the WDA CEO . Welsh Water PLC had to be rescued by the new Dwr Cymru mutual led by Lord Byrnes. Welsh Affairs Committee scrutiny In February 2012, a report of the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee argued that the abolition of the Welsh Development Agency had reduced Welsh visibility in the global marketplace. The committee claimed that, five years on, the WDA remained one of the most recognisable Welsh brands and argued that the establishment of a successor trade promotion agency should be a priority for the Welsh Government. The report also argued for greater engagement by the Welsh Government with parliament on the issue. The Committee's report received a mixed response in the Senedd. Conservative AMs tabled a motion endorsing a statement by Professor Brian Morgan that \\"the closure of the WDA and the abolition of the 'WDA brand' will probably go down in history as the worst policy decision made in Wales in living memory\\". In response, Business Minister Edwina Hart accused those holding such views as \\"wanting to revisit the past\\". A highly critical report of Inward Investment attraction was also published by Cardiff Business School in 2012. The report \\"Selling Wales\\"http://business.cardiff.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Selling%20Wales%20FDI.pdf was an assessment of the agencies involved and argued that the lack of a consistent brand was one of the most significant problems.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 8, 1995. In the episode, Bart scornfully dismisses the concept of the soul, and to show he is serious in his skepticism he agrees to sell his soul to Milhouse. However, after several strange events make him think he really has lost his soul, he desperately tries to regain it. \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" was written by Greg Daniels, who was inspired by an experience from his youth where he had purchased a bully's soul. Director Wesley Archer and his team of animators visited Chili's for examples to use in Moe's family restaurant. The episode includes cultural references to the song \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\", by Iron Butterfly, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and a parody of the book Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret., by Judy Blume. Writers from the fields of religion, philosophy, popular culture, and psychology cited the episode in books discussing The Simpsons and the show's approach to the nature of the soul. The episode was positively received by the media, and is regarded as one of the series' best. The creative team of The Simpsons puts the episode among the top five best episodes of the series, and series creator Matt Groening cited \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" as one of his favorite episodes. It has been used by secondary schools in religious education courses as a teaching tool. Plot As punishment for changing the church's opening hymn to \\"In the Garden of Eden\\" by I. Ron Butterfly, Reverend Lovejoy makes Bart clean the organ pipes; Milhouse is forced to help for snitching on Bart. After proclaiming there is no such thing as a soul, Bart agrees to sell his to Milhouse for $5 on a piece of paper which reads \\"Bart Simpson's soul\\". Lisa warns Bart that he will regret selling his soul, but he dismisses her fears. Bart experiences several unusual phenomena, such as automatic doors refusing to open for him and no longer finding any humor in Itchy and Scratchy. He begins to fear that he really has lost his soul and tries to get it back from Milhouse, who refuses to return it for less than $50. After having a nightmare and being taunted by Lisa, Bart again desperately tries to persuade Milhouse to return his soul. Milhouse informs Bart that he traded the paper to Comic Book Guy at the Android's Dungeon. The next morning, Comic Book Guy tells Bart that he sold the piece of paper but refuses to reveal its new owner. Saddened, Bart walks home in the rain and prays to God for his soul in his bedroom. When a piece of paper with the words \\"Bart Simpson's soul\\" floats down from above, Bart discovers that Lisa bought his soul to return it to him. While she explains philosophers' views on the human soul, Bart eats the piece of paper, overjoyed at getting his soul back. In the subplot, Moe tries to expand his customer base by turning his bar into a family theme restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him, and he soon snaps at a little girl. The horrified customers abandon the restaurant, forcing Moe's to revert to a run-down tavern. Production \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" was the second episode to have Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein as executive producers. Oakley and Weinstein wanted to start the season with episodes that had an emotional bias in an effort to center the Simpson family. The episode was written by Greg Daniels, who originally had an idea for a plot that dealt with racism in Springfield. The writers did not think The Simpsons was the right forum for it, so Daniels suggested the idea of selling someone's soul, which originated in his childhood. In high school, Daniels encouraged a bully to sell him his soul for 50 cents, and then convinced classmates to frighten the bully into buying his soul back for an inflated price. Daniels repeated this ploy, but stopped when he realized that the only other person in history who has profited off others' souls was Satan, and that \\"scared\\" him. In the opening scene of the episode, the congregation of the First Church of Springfield are tricked into singing \\"In a Gadda Da Vida\\" by Iron Butterfly. Daniels had originally intended for the song to be \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" by British rock band Genesis, but the producers were unable to obtain the rights for it to be featured in the episode. The episode was directed by Wesley Archer. Archer and his team of animators went to the restaurant chain Chili's to get inspiration for the background designs of Moe's family restaurant. He said it was \\"quite a task\\" to transform Moe's Tavern into a family-oriented establishment. Archer added that he was not \\"quite happy\\" with the result, and that they could have designed it \\"a little better\\". Weinstein recalled that there was contention between the animators about the way Moe looked in the episode. Moe's original design includes a missing tooth, but Weinstein and Oakley felt that it did not \\"look right\\" because Moe was such a prominent character in the episode. Archer showed the original design of Moe from the first season to the show runners, and said: \\"Here, look. He's got a missing tooth!\\", but the scenes that had Moe with a missing tooth in them were still reanimated. Archer was disappointed with the dream sequence in which Bart sees his friends playing with their souls. Archer said that he had forgotten to tell the animators to make the souls transparent, so they were painted blue instead. George Meyer pitched the joke restaurant title \\"The Texas Cheesecake Depository.\\" Themes Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in Leaving Springfield that \\"a good deal of enjoyment\\" is to be had from the episode, due to \\"the exposure of the hypocrisy behind 'the finance of salvation' and the ambivalent operations of the commercial world\\". Don Cupitt, a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, believes that when Lisa lectures Bart about the soul, she \\"shows a degree of theological sophistication which is simply not tolerated in Britain.\\" Paul Bloom and David Pizarro wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that although Lisa does show \\"healthy religious skepticism\\" she still believes in an eternal soul. However, Lisa tells Bart at the end of the episode, \\"some philosophers believe that no one is born with a soul, you have to earn one through suffering\\". Bloom and Pizarro acknowledge: \\"Indeed, some philosophers and theologians say that without belief in a soul, one cannot make sense of the social concepts on which we rely, such as personal responsibility and freedom of the will.\\" M. Keith Booker cites the episode in Drawn to Television, while discussing The Simpsons treatment of religion. Booker cites a scene from the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul ‚Äì and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money; Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that \\"life suddenly feels empty and incomplete\\" without a soul, which suggests \\"either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction\\". Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F. Parvin discuss the episode in their book The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study, and use examples from it to stimulate discussion among youth about the nature of the soul. Pinsky and Parvin note Bart's statement to Milhouse from the beginning of the episode: \\"Soul ‚Äî come on, Milhouse, there's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson\\", and then suggest questions to ask students, including whether they know individuals that agree with Bart, and their views on the existence of a soul. In Planet Simpson, Chris Turner quotes Bart's revelation to Lisa that he sold his soul to Milhouse for five dollars and used the money to buy sponges shaped like dinosaurs. After Lisa criticizes Bart for selling his soul, Bart responds: \\"Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.\\" Turner comments: \\"Here Bart is the epitome of the world-weary hipster, using the degraded language of modern marketing to sell off the most sacred parts of himself because he knows that some cheap sponge is more real, hence more valuable, than even the loftiest of abstract principles.\\" Cultural references On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, writer Greg Daniels cited Martin Scorsese's 1985 film After Hours as an influence on Bart's night-time trek to retrieve his soul from Milhouse, only to experience a series of unusual encounters. Reverend Lovejoy leads his congregation in a hymnal version of the song \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\", by Iron Butterfly, titled \\"In the Garden of Eden\\", by \\"I. Ron Butterfly\\". During an argument between Lisa and Bart, while discussing the relationship between laughter and the soul, Lisa quotes Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and Bart responds \\"I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.\\" Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in Leaving Springfield: \\"While Bart may be familiar with the canon of Chilean poetry, the joke takes its force in part from the probability that The Simpsons' viewers are not.\\" Bart begins a prayer to God with \\"Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson\\". This is an allusion to the book Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret., by Judy Blume. The chalkboard gag is a reference to the advertising slogan of the lean mean grilling machine by George Foreman. The title of the Itchy and Scratchy Show episode ‚ÄúSkinless in Seattle‚Äù is a reference to the film Sleepless in Seattle. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" finished 43rd in the ratings for the week of October 2‚Äì8, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week after The X-Files, Melrose Place, and Beverly Hills, 90210. In July 2007, an article in the San Mateo County Times notes that \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" is seen as one of \\"the most popular episodes in 'Simpsons' history\\". Noel Holston of the Star Tribune highlighted the episode in the paper's \\"Critic's choice\\" section. The Intelligencer Journal described \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" as \\"a particularly good episode\\" of The Simpsons. The Lansing State Journal highlighted the episode in the season seven DVD release, along with the conclusion of \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" and \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\". The Sunday Herald Sun called it one of the \\"show's most memorable episodes\\", as did The Courier Mail. The Aberdeen Press & Journal described the episode as \\"one of the darkest episodes of the Simpsons\\". (archived at AccessMyLibrary.com) In their section on the episode in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment: \\"Undoubtedly the most disturbing episode of the series, with Bart's nightmare of losing his soul ‚Äî illustrated by a macabre playground where all the souls of his playmates are visible, and his is tagging along with Milhouse ‚Äî more frightening than funny. ... An illustration of just how far the series could go by this point.\\" In April 2003, the episode was listed by The Simpsons creative team as among the top five best episodes of the series, including \\"Last Exit to Springfield\\", \\"Cape Feare\\", \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\", and \\"Homer at the Bat\\". (archived at Questia Online Library) (archived at Questia Online Library) In a 2005 interview The Simpsons creator Matt Groening commented \\"I don't have a single favorite. There's a bunch I really like\\", but cited \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" and \\"Homer's Enemy\\" as among episodes he loves. Bart's voice actress Nancy Cartwright stated \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" is one of her top three episodes together with \\"Lisa's Substitute\\" and \\"Bart the Mother\\".

The summit elevation is 1,291 metres (4,236 feet) AMSL. It is the second highest point in the western massif of the Cairngorms, linked by a bealach at about 1125 m above sea level to Braeriach. The mountain towers above the western side pass of the Lairig Ghru. Cairn Toul is often climbed in conjunction with other peaks. From the south, it may be combined with The Devil's Point, which lies about 2.5 kilometres south-southeast. Alternatively, it may be climbed from the north, including Braeriach and Sgor an Lochain Uaine. Both routes are long days by Scottish standards: around 15 km (plus return) regardless of whether one starts from Coire Cas above Speyside, or Linn of Dee to the south. The mountain may also be climbed from the west, starting from Achlean in Glen Feshie. This provides for a slighter shorter route (around 27 km for the round trip), though the walker must negotiate a large expanse of undulating boggy plateau in order to reach the Breariach-Cairn Toul massif. There is a bothy, Corrour, at the point below Cairn Toul in the defile of the Lairig Ghru.

Scenic Beauty The Pampa river flows through the village to merge into the famed Vembanad Lake. Its natural scenic beauty is legendary and has been used by many filmmakers. Relatively untouched by modernity, Kavalam is a green haven. Interspersed with the kayals (canals) and lakes, this belly of Kerala is serene. The lakes and kayals are filled with flocks of ducks, and in summer the rice paddies of Kuttanad turn golden. With a longtime history behind it, Kavalam is part of Kerala's cultural folklore. History A decade back, this sleepy village was accessible only by the lake boats provided by the government of Kerala. As in many other remote parts of Kerala, this non- accessibility gave Kavalam a laidback atmosphere. The place is now accessible from Alleppey, Kottayam and Changanacherry by road.

The purpose of its creation was to present a puzzle that uses no numbers or letters and yet retains depth and aesthetics. Rules Masyu is played on a rectangular grid of squares, some of which contain circles; each circle is either \\"white\\" (empty) or \\"black\\" (filled). The goal is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that properly passes through all circled cells. The loop must \\"enter\\" each cell it passes through from the center of one of its four sides and \\"exit\\" from a different side; all turns are therefore 90 degrees.. The two varieties of circle have differing requirements for how the loop must pass through them: *White circles must be traveled straight through, but the loop must turn in the previous and/or next cell in its path. *Black circles must be turned upon, but the loop must travel straight through the next and previous cells in its path.  Variants  *There are additionally or solely gray circles. The solver has to find out which of these gray circles are white and which are black. *The diagram is a Toroid; i.e. the left and the right edge of the diagram as well as the top and the bottom edge of the diagram are glued together. *The diagram is divided into regions; the loop must turn in every region at least once. *The diagram is played on a hexagonal grid, with grey circles indicating 60-degree turns where the loop turns both before and after the turn, and black circles indicating 120-degree turns where the loop goes straight on the cells before and after the turn. History The early version of Masyu first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #84 under the title of Shinju no Kubikazari (ÁúüÁè†„ÅÆÈ¶ñÈ£æ„Çä, meaning \\"pearl necklace\\"). That puzzle contains only white circles. Black circles were introduced in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #90, and the puzzle was renamed Shiroshinju Kuroshinju (ÁôΩÁúüÁè†ÈªíÁúüÁè†, meaning \\"white pearls and black pearls\\"). This improvement deepened the puzzle and made it gain popularity. Masyu, which is originally a misreading by Nikoli's president of kanji ÁúüÁè† (shinju), and apparently became an inside joke at the Nikoli office, was adopted in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #103 to replace the old lengthy name. Solution methods Understanding the nuances of the circles and how they interact with each other is the key to solving a Masyu puzzle. Generally speaking, it is easiest to start along the outside border of the grid and work inwards. Here are some basic scenarios where portions of the loop can be determined: *Any segment travelling from a black circle must travel two cells in that direction without intersecting another part of the loop or the outer border; each black cell must have two such segments at a right angle. The logical combination of those two statements is that if a segment from a black cell cannot be drawn in some orthogonal direction, a segment in the opposite direction must be drawn. For example, if one cannot legally travel up two cells from a black circle, then the loop must travel down from that black circle for two cells. This has two common results: **Any black circle along the outer border or one cell from the outer border must have a segment leading away from the border (and those sufficiently near a corner must lead from both walls, defining the loop's path through the circle); **Orthogonally adjacent black circles must have segments travelling away from each other. **Black circles that are orthogonally next to the end of the loop that does not travel towards it must have the loop heading away from the other loop segment. *White circles along the outer border obviously need the loop to travel through them parallel to the border; if two white circles along a border are adjacent or are one cell apart, then the loop will need to turn away from the border just beyond the circles. *If three or more white circles are orthogonally contiguous and collinear, then the loop will need to pass through each of those circles perpendicular to the line of circles. *If two white circles are orthogonally contiguous and a cell on either end has a loop segment entering parallel to the line of the circles, then the loop will need to pass through each of those circles perpendicular to their line. (Otherwise, the line through them would connect to the adjacent segment and one of the white cells would not be next to a turn in the loop.) *A black circle with two white circles diagonally adjacent on the same side must have the loop heading away from that side. If not, and it went between the white circles instead, then the white circles would be parallel to that section of the loop, and make it impossible to complete the black circle. **Black circles with three white circles diagonally adjacent can be fully completed by this rule. *If the diagram is cut virtually into two pieces, the loop must cross the cutting line an even number of times. This is due to the Jordan Curve Theorem. As in other loop-construction puzzles, \\"short circuits\\" also need to be avoided: as the solution must consist of a single loop, any segment that would close a loop is forbidden unless it immediately yields the solution to the entire puzzle. Like many other combinatory and logic puzzles, Masyu can be very difficult to solve; solving Masyu on arbitrarily large grids is an NP-complete problem.Erich Friedman. \\"Pearl Puzzles are NP-Complete\\". In preparation. 2002. . However, published instances of puzzles have generally been constructed in such a way that they can be solved in a reasonable amount of time.

She was the 30th Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, serving under Governor Ed Rendell from 2003 to 2008, when she died in office. Prior to that, she served as the 32nd Pennsylvania State Treasurer from 1989 to 1997. Background Catherine Baker was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, the daughter of Nick Baker, a successful man who later served as mayor of McKees Rocks and Teresa May (one of eleven children). She was one of nine children, one of five girls and four boys. While a graduate at Duquesne University in 1952, she met and married Charles A. Knoll, a restaurateur and hotel owner 17 years her senior, who became the Postmaster of the Stowe, Kennedy, and McKees Rocks area. Charles Knoll and Catherine had three sons and one daughter. Their names are Charles A. Knoll Jr., Mina Baker Knoll, Albert Baker Knoll, and Kim Eric Knoll. Knoll began her political career as a campaign worker for local and statewide Democratic candidates, first for her father, Nick, and later for Governor Milton Shapp. When Shapp was elected governor in 1970, he awarded Knoll a job with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. State Treasurer In 1976, she ran for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer but lost to Robert E. Casey, who was unrelated to, but often confused with Bob Casey who went on to become Governor of Pennsylvania. She ran again in 1984 but lost a close primary in which her opponent, Auditor General Al Benedict, originally conceded on election night but later withdrew his concession. In 1988, one year after her husband's death, she ran a third time and was elected state treasurer of Pennsylvania. She streamlined and modernized the treasurer's office during her eight-year tenure and started the Pennsylvania TAP program (Tuition Account Program), built the PA Treasury Investment Center, and started a partnership with PA Home Builders, PA Community Banks, to build PA Affordable Housing in 67 counties of Pennsylvania) according to the population of each county. In 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Knoll and her staff after four state consultants reaped improper fees from a prison bond issue. Knoll claimed that the official paperwork had been altered after she signed off on the plan. Knoll was never charged with a crime but the well-publicized inquiry hurt her politically. However, the four state consultants were found guilty and served prison time. Catherine Baker Knoll ran for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1994, having surprised Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel, by first withdrawing from the race and then hinting that she would consider running if the Democratic State Committee did not endorse anyone for the race. The State Committee voted to endorse no candidate and Knoll re-entered the race only to finish third in a seven-way primary. In 1996, Knoll, who was term limited, endorsed her daughter Mina Baker Knoll as her successor. Mina Knoll's opponent, Republican Barbara Hafer questioned her residency status because she had lived in New York City and the Knoll campaign attacked Hafer's leadership as auditor general. The race, which Hafer won, opened a rift between the two women that culminated in 2000 when Knoll herself ran against Hafer for treasurer. The race featuring arguably the two highest-profile women in Pennsylvania politics, was noted for its bitterness between the two; Hafer cited a fraud scandal investigation by the SEC into Knoll's office while she was treasurer, and Knoll attacked Hafer for questionable expenses paid by the state.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat;=19960229&id;=xBoiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=lqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1331,6281620&hl;=enhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/knoll-attacks-hafer-using-2-million-for-psas---calls-it-an-illegal- campaign-contribution-and-an-abuse-of-the-public-trust-73749517.html In the end, Hafer won the election by less than 100,000 votes. Lieutenant governor Knoll with Governor Rendell Knoll attends Pittsburgh's St. Patrick's Day Parade with Hillary Clinton In 2002, Knoll sought the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. She faced nine candidates in the primary, including state Senators Allen Kukovich, John Lawless, Thaddeus Kirkland, and Jack Wagner, the latter of which was endorsed by the state party. Maintaining her base of support among women and senior citizens, Knoll won the primary with 25% of the vote, winning 54 of the state's 67 counties. She was paired with Democratic nominee for governor Ed Rendell, who also defeated the establishment favorite in his primary (Bob Casey Jr.). Her campaign was memorable for her traveling from small town to small town (logging over 40,000 miles on her car), and her meeting thousands of voters, by visiting church basements, PTA meetings, fashion shows and construction sites.Catherine Baker Knoll is making history as first female lieutenant governor The Rendell/ Knoll ticket won the general election 53% to 44% over Republicans Mike Fisher and his running mate Jane Earll. Knoll was sworn in as Pennsylvania's first-ever woman Lieutenant Governor on January 21, 2003. Knoll's old rival Barbara Hafer, after failing to secure the Republican nomination for governor, actually endorsed Rendell and later switched to the Democratic party.Hafer to cross party lines and endorse Rendell This led to speculation that she was maneuvering to challenge Knoll for the lieutenant governor spot in the 2006 primary. Hafer, however, stated that she and Knoll had buried the hatchet long ago,Hafer heads to private life: After 16 years in Harrisburg, she's starting her own firm and did not enter the race. Congressman Joe Hoeffel announced that he would challenge Knoll in the primary, but dropped out of the race a day later, after Ed Rendell reiterated his support for Knoll as his running-mate.Hoeffel relents on lieutenant governor race, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 3/9/06 This left only token opposition against Knoll, and she won the Democratic nomination by a large margin. She and Governor Rendell defeated Republican challengers Lynn Swann and Jim Matthews to win reelection. Knoll endorsed and campaigned with Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the 2008 Pennsylvania Democratic primary for president.http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics- nation/2008/03/16/Revelers-greet-Clinton-with-warm-Pittsburgh- reception/stories/200803160186 Along with several other prominent Pennsylvania Democrats, Knoll's endorsement was seen as a key to Clinton's win.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/us/politics/22text- clinton.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 As lieutenant governor, she presided over every Pennsylvania Senate session.

She was treated in Hershey, Pennsylvania at Penn State Hershey Medical Center and attempted a return to her duties in September 2008 but fatigue forced her to return home. In October 2008, she entered Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland for treatment of a viral infection. On November 12, 2008, Knoll died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.

The village's main economic base is fishing. Gardenstown is served by Gardenstown New Church. The hamlet of Dubford is to the south, and a footpath along the shore to the east leads to the village of Crovie. History There is evidence of Neolithic or Bronze Age peoples having settled in the vicinity of Gardenstown; notably at Longman Hill and Cairn Lee. Nearby are the remains of the Church of St John the Evangelist which was built in 1513, and celebrates the defeat of the Danes at this site in 1004 in the 'Battle of the Bloody Pits'. Gardenstown was founded in 1720 by Alexander Garden as a fishing village. A church was built in 1875, and the parish of Gardenstown was separated from Gamrie on 16 March 1885. In 1953, heavy flooding washed away two houses in the village. In May 2007, a TV series titled The Baron was filmed in and around the village. The series featured three celebrities -- Malcolm McLaren, Mike Reid and Suzanne Shaw -- competing to be elected \\"Baron of Troup\\". During the filming, McLaren was thrown out of the village for unruly behaviour, leaving Reid and Shaw to contest the final election, which was won by Reid. Between 2008 and 2010, an ethnographic study of the social, religious and economic life of the village was conducted by anthropologist Joseph Webster. This was published by Palgrave in 2013 as a book entitled The Anthropology of Protestantism: Faith and Crisis among Scottish Fishermen. In January and February 2008, the village again made headlines when Aberdeenshire Council refused funding to restore the road which runs along the seafront and is a key part of the village's sea defences. The refusal was based upon the status of the road as a private road, thus not the responsibility of the council. This has been seen as controversial since the road runs along the top of the seawall, and the council is responsible for the wall. Residents expressed grave concern that their houses might be washed away and appealed. Landmarks and local economy Gamrie Parish Church The village's main economic base is fishing. A permanent meteorological station is situated at Gardenstown. The village is served by Gardenstown New Church and has a pub, an osteopathy clinic and a whale and dolphin rescue centre.

It is similar to FastCGI but is designed to be easier to parse. Unlike CGI, it permits a long-running service process to continue serving requests, thus avoiding delays in responding to requests due to setup overhead (such as connecting to a database). SCGI is a protocol which defines communication between a webserver and an application server. This is in contrast to CGI, which is an earlier application (gateway) interface designed to let the application programmer avoid the complexity of sockets and long-running service processes when poor scalability and high overhead are acceptable. The SCGI protocol leverages the fact that the client has already parsed and validated the HTTP request, and canonically communicates the request to the SCGI server while letting the application programmer avoid parsing ambiguities and protocol edge cases. This avoids the complicated header-parsing and header-combining rules from RFC2616, saving significant complexity in the SCGI server process.  History  Neil Schemenauer published the original SCGI protocol specification dated October 2001. He developed the first implementations of SCGI and initially published them in April 2002.  Specification  The client connects to a SCGI server over a reliable stream protocol allowing transmission of 8-bit bytes. The client begins by sending a request. When the SCGI server sees the end of the request it sends back a response and closes the connection. The format of the response is not specifically specified by this protocol, although CGI-equivalent HTTP responses are generally used. = Request format = A SCGI request is the concatenation of netstring-encoded headers and a body. A SCGI response is a normal HTTP response. Each header consists of a name-value pair, where both the name and the value are null-terminated strings (C strings). The value can be an empty string, in which case the terminating null still remains. Neither name nor value can contain any embedded null bytes. These considerations are standard for C strings, but are often confusing for programmers used to other standards for string-handling. All provided headers are concatenated to form a single byte sequence, then netstring-encoded. The raw body, if any, is then appended. Duplicate names are not allowed in the request headers; RFC2616-compliant header combining must already have taken place. The first request header must have the name \\"CONTENT_LENGTH\\" and a value that is the length of the body in decimal. The \\"CONTENT_LENGTH\\" request header must always be present, even if its value is \\"0\\". There must also always be a request header with the name \\"SCGI\\" and a value of \\"1\\".

Publication history The first Rocket Racer appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #172 (Sept 1977) as a super- villain. He returned in issues #182 and #183 in a battle against the Big Wheel. His origin was finally revealed in Spectacular Spider-Man #104. Rocket Racer appeared as a supporting character in Avengers Academy in issue #21 (Jan 2012) and issue #26 (April 2012). Fictional character biography=Robert Farrell= Robert Farrell, born in Brooklyn, New York, was the eldest of seven children. He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother Emma Johnson Farrell became ill. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he couldn't earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the Rocket Racer. He developed a super-powered skateboard which is propelled at great speed by small rockets and cybernetically controlled by a crude walkman-like device. He wore a weapon-equipped costume, including rocket-powered gloves which give him the ability to hit an opponent with a \\"rocket-powered-punch.\\" Early in his career as a burglar, Rocket Racer encounters Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #172 Rocket Racer hires Tinkerer to redesign his skateboard after his first defeat by Spider-Man. At one point he is hired by Jackson Weele to steal evidence that might incriminate him. Robert uses the evidence to blackmail Jackson. Weele wishes to commit suicide but Robert stops him. Even then, though, he mocks Weele, calling him Big Weele. This is enough for Jackson to hire the villain the Tinkerer to create a literal 'Big Wheel', to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assists and Jackson seemingly falls to his death in the Hudson River.Amazing Spider-Man #182-183 Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the Bounty Hunter.Spectacular Spider-Man #104 Repeated defeats at the hands of Spider-Man and several brushes with the law, including a short jail sentence, convince Robert to reform. He goes through a high school equivalency course and his extremely high marks gain him a scholarship to Empire State University. This doesn't go well as his first few days are full with combating the efforts of a hate-group on campus. Though assisted by Spider-Man and sometimes, by other students who oppose the racism, Robert still struggles with his own rage during the entire ordeal.Web of Spider-Man #56-57 Later, Robert attempted to prove Spider-Man innocent of a crime; and first encountered Silver Sable and The Outlaws.Web of Spider-Man #50 He joined forces with Spider-Man to stop the white supremacist, Skinhead. He was hired as a freelance operative for Silver Sable International to prevent two youths from stealing the victims' weapons at the Bar with No Name, the site of the Scourge massacre.Spectacular Spider- Man Annual #10 He was again hired by Sable to stop the Speed Demon.Marvel Tales #242 He joined Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the Avengers and the Space Phantom,Spectacular Spider-Man #169-170 He was again hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.Excalibur #36 He was hired by Sable to stop a runaway subway maintenance robot.Marvel Tales #250 Rocket Racer finally formally joined the Outlaws, to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.Amazing Spider-Man Annual #25; Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #11; Web of Spider-Man Annual #7 Rocket Racer briefly joined Tombstone's prison squad along with Big Ben and Hypno-Hustler where they provided Tombstone some protection at the time when he went under a heart bypass.Spider-Man's Tangled Web #16 Robert is identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book Avengers: The Initiative #1. As a registered hero, he reported to Camp Hammond for training. Despite this, he needed money to support his comatose mother and prevent repossession of their house, so he was seen working for MODOK. He appeared to have been tempted back into crime, and reduced to a state of stuttering nervousness by the situation.Super-Villain Team-Up/MODOK's 11 #1 (September 2007) He turned out to have been working for S.H.I.E.L.D. all along, with a deal that they will give him the money he needs in return for the HypernovaSuper-Villain Team-Up/MODOK's 11 #4 (December 2007) \\\\- he failed in this and it's unknown yet what's happened with his mother.Super-Villain Team- Up/MODOK's 11 #5 (January 2008) Rocket Racer is part of the new class of students when the Avengers Academy moves to the former headquarters of the West Coast Avengers.Avengers Academy #21 (Nov. 2011) Rocket Racer later leaves the Avengers Academy alongside Machine Teen to join child genius Jeremy Briggs.Avengers Academy #26 =Henry Sleeman= Another Rocket Racer first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man (vol.2) #13 (January 2000). Henry SleemanOfficial Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #9 was hired by an unnamed employer to befriend Robert Farrell and steal his Rocket Racer gear. He did so, taking the name \\"Troy\\" and posing as Farrell's friend for months. When Farrell finally showed him where he kept the gear, 'Troy' tied him up and stole it, pursuing Spider-Man with the intention of fighting him, only to be defeated when restaurateur Harry Sloane opened a door at just the right time for 'Troy' to run into the door and knock himself unconscious.Amazing Spider- Man (vol. 2) #13 (January 2000) Powers and abilities Robert Farrell has a gifted intellect, but no superhuman powers. He wears gauntlets furnished with explosive mini-rockets, and utilizes a cybernetically-controlled, rocket- powered magnetic skateboard, which he designed and was later redesigned by the Tinkerer. Other versions Outside of mainstream Marvel continuity, Rocket Racer has appeared as a super-villain in Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane.Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane #4 (May 2006) In another series Rocket Racer is a socially withdrawn patsy of the supervillain called 'The Tinkerer', and his rocket gear is simply used to showcase the man's technological genius to potential clients.Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man #21 (January, 2007) In other media=Television= * The Robert Farrell version of Rocket Racer appeared in a self-titled episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series, voiced by Billy Atmore. This iteration is depicted as a teenager living in a crime-ridden neighborhood who is in constant trouble with the police and lives with a single mother whose store is constantly harassed by criminals demanding protection money. Despite this, Robert works at the Science Center and studies under Peter Parker to develop his skill in gyro mechanisms. Using these and stolen technology from Jackson Weele, Robert created a cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered, magnetic skateboard to help his mother as Rocket Racer. After being framed for a crime he did not commit however, he was pursued by Spider-Man before they were both attacked by Weele. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer joined forces to defeat Weele and ensure the criminal was arrested before Robert vowed to use his scientific skills to help his mother instead.

Life Born on 8 June 1832 in Wanstead, Essex, Bright was educated at Merchant Taylors' School.A. C. Lynch, ‚ÄòBright, Sir Charles Tilston (1832‚Äì1888)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 7 Feb 2011. At fifteen he became a clerk for the Electric Telegraph Company and as his talent for electrical engineering became evident, he was appointed engineer to the Magnetic Telegraph Company in 1852. In that role he supervised the laying of lines in the British Isles, including in 1853 the first cable between Scotland and Ireland, from Portpatrick to Donaghadee, when he was just 21. This work, and the successful laying of other submarine cables, suggested to others that it might be possible to lay a cable across the Atlantic from Ireland to North America. Joining with Cyrus West Field and John Watkins Brett, who controlled the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, Bright helped organise the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1856 to develop a transatlantic cable, with himself as engineer-in-chief; Wildman Whitehouse soon joined them as chief electrician. Samuel Canning supported the effort on board HMS Agamemnon. After two failed attempts in August 1857 and three more in June 1858, Bright successfully accomplished what to many had seemed an impossible feat, completing the first Atlantic cable from Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, to Valentia Island, Ireland, on 5 August 1858. Bright was knighted in Dublin just a few days later. Though widely hailed as the wonder of the age, the 1858 cable failed after only about a month of fitful service, a victim of hasty manufacture and the excessive signalling voltages used by Whitehouse. Sir Charles Bright emerged from the debacle with his reputation largely intact and went on to supervise the laying of successful cables in the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, and the Caribbean. He also served as a consultant on renewed efforts to span the Atlantic, which in 1866 resulted not only in the completion of the first lasting transatlantic cable, but in the recovery and completion of a cable that had snapped during laying in 1865. Bright formed a partnership with Josiah Latimer Clark in 1861 and together they introduced numerous improvements in the manufacture, testing, and operation of submarine cables. They were strong advocates of establishing a unified system of electrical units, and a number of the proposals they made in a paper presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1861 were later taken up by the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards and formed the foundations of the system of ohms, amps, and volts still in use today. In 1865 he was awarded a Telford Medal for a paper on the possibilities of submarine cable telegraphy from England to China and Australia. In 1870, Bright was contracted to be the engineer for the Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Company, which was planning to lay a submarine cable between Panama and Peru. However, this engagement ended in controversy when the Company discovered that, at the same time as Bright was acting as engineer for the Company, he had also agreed to be the sub-contractor for the Telegraph Works Company, which the Panama (etc.) Company had engaged to carry out the work of laying the cable the cable. This ended in a court case between the Panama (etc.) Company and Telegraph Works Company, which was heard in the Divisional Court on the 27th of April 1875, and which gave judgment for the Panama (etc.) Company on the basis that Bright's dual engagement had given rise to an improper conflict of interest that was tantamount to fraud.Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Company v India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Company (1874-75) L.R. 10 Ch. App. 515 That case is now a leading judicial authority in English law on third party liability for procuring a breach of duty by an agent. From 1865 to 1868 Bright was Liberal MP for Greenwich and in 1887 he was elected president of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers). Bright died on 3 May 1888, at Abbey Wood, near London. His son Charles Bright was also a noted cable engineer and historian of the subject. Bright's funeral took place at Chiswick Churchyard with a subsequent service at St Cuthbert's, Earls Court. The numerous attendees included Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Robert Jardine, Frederic John Goldsmid and David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons. Sir Charles Bright (son) Spy in Vanity Fair, 1908. Charles Tilston Bright's son, also Charles Bright (1863-1937), followed in his father's footsteps. In addition to cable engineering he was a pioneer in the use of radio as a communication device on both ships and planes. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1895. He was knighted in 1919.

It was he who inspired the popular uprising that put an end to the Time of Troubles. Hermogenes was glorified by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1913. Patriarch Hermogenes refusing to bless the Poles painting by Pavel Chistyakov (1860). At the Holy Synod of 1589, which established the patriarchy in Moscow, Hermogenes was appointed Metropolitan of the newly conquered city of Kazan. During the following two decades, he gained renown for a number of Muslim Volga Tatars converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1606, Hermogenes was summoned by False Dmitry I to take part in the Senate recently instituted in Moscow. There he learnt about the tsar's design to marry a Roman Catholic woman, Marina Mniszech, and firmly declared against such an alliance. At that he was exiled from the capital, only to return with great honours several months later, when the false tsar had been deposed, and Patriarch Ignatius followed suit. Millennium Monument in Novgorod Patriarch of Moscow The new tsar, Vasily IV, helped Hermogenes to become Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus': Metropolitan Hermogenes was elected to the primatial See, and on 3 July 1606 he was installed as Patriarch by the assembly of the holy hierarchs at Moscow's Dormition cathedral. Metropolitan Isidore handed the Patriarch the staff of the holy hierarch Peter, and the Tsar gave as a gift to the new Patriarch a panagia, embellished with precious stones, a white klobuk and staff. In the ancient manner, Patriarch Hermogenes made his entrance riding upon a donkey. During Vasily's reign, Hermogenes generally supported the tsar's efforts to pacify the country and anathemized Ivan Bolotnikov and his army. =Time of Troubles= When Vasily was dethroned and the Poles took hold of the Moscow Kremlin, Hermogenes staunchly opposed their plans to put Wladyslaw IV on the Russian throne, unless he converted to Orthodoxy. Despite knife threats from some of the boyars, he refused to sign any petitions to the Polish king, thus preventing Wladyslaw from coronation.Maureen Perrie. Pretenders and Popular Monarchism in Early Modern Russia. Cambridge University Press, 1995. . Page 210. Robert Auty, Dimitri Obolensky. Companion to Russian Studies. Cambridge University Press, 1981. . Page 108. In December 1610 Hermogenes distributed letters to various Russian towns, urging the populace to rise against the Poles. When the volunteer army under Prokopy Lyapunov finally approached Moscow, he defied the Polish exhortations to anathemize the army. Despite being threatened with death penalty, he cursed the Roman Catholics and showed support for Lyapunov. After that, he was arrested and thrown into the Chudov Monastery. There he heard about the new volunteer army, mustered by Kuzma Minin and commanded by Prince Pozharsky, and blessed them both. Thereupon the patriarch was beaten and starved to death.Reverend R Thornton. Lives of Eminent Russian Prelates. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. .

Death and legacy The body of Hermogenes was buried in the Chudov monastery, but in 1654 was transferred to the Moscow Dormition cathedral. The purported relics of Patriarch Germogen were accidentally found in one of the crypts of the Chudov Monastery during the 1913 repair works. In connection with the Romanov Dynasty Tercentenary, celebrated that same year, he was canonized as a hieromartyr and transferred to the nearby Dormition Cathedral.

She was the second wife of Louis the Pious, Carolingian emperor and king of the Franks, which brought her the titles of queen and empress. Marriage to Louis marked the beginning of her rise as an influential figure in the Carolingian court. She had two children with Louis, a daughter Gisela and a son, Charles the Bald. The birth of her son led to a major dispute over the imperial succession, and tensions between her and Charles' half-brothers from Louis' first marriage. She would eventually fall from grace when Charles' wife, the new empress Ermentrude of Orl√©ans, rose to power. She was buried in 843 in Tours. Early life=Date and place of birth= No surviving sources provide a record of Judith‚Äôs exact date and year of birth. Judith was probably born around 797Koch, Armin. Kaiserin Judith: Eine Politische Biographie. Husum: Matthiesen, 2005. Print. Most girls in the Carolingian world were married in adolescence, with twelve years as the minimum age, though her marriage to the 41 year old King Louis occurred in 819, when she was around 22 years old. =Kin group/ancestry= Judith was the daughter of the noble Saxon Heilwig and Count Welf I, and belonged to the ancestor of the kin-group known to historians as the Welfs. Though the Welf clan was noble, they were not part of the '\\"Imperial Aristocracy'\\" (Reichsaristokratie) that dominated high office throughout the Carolingian empire. The Welf clan's leaders, having lost influence in their home region of Alemannia (present-day southwestern Germany and northern Switzerland) eventually rose to power though cementing familial ties with the Carolingian Imperial Aristocracy in the 770s. Nonetheless, they remained a part of the upper aristocracy (Hochadel) of their region, given the numerous appearances of the noble titles of ducal (duke) and comital (counts) in primary sources. This noble status made Judith a suitable marriage prospect for the imperial family, and the Welf clan as a whole saw its prestige and power increase after Judith‚Äôs marriage to the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious in 819. Marriage and queenship=Courtship by Louis= After the death on 3 October 818 of Louis' first wife Queen Ermengard, mother of his sons Louis the German, Peppin and Lothar, Louis was urged by his counselors to remarry.Stafford, Pauline. Queens, Concubines and Dowagers: The King's Wife in the Early Middle Ages. London, Leicester UP, 1998. Print. Shortly after Christmas in 819 he married Judith in Aachen (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany).Rogers, Barbara, Bernhard W. Scholz, and Nithardus. Carolingian Chronicles, Royal Frankish Annals Nithard's Histories. Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan, 1972. Print. Like many of the royal marriages of the time Judith was selected, prior to the marriage through a bridal show. It is at the bride show that, at the age of forty one, Louis chose the young, twenty two year old Judith \\"after inspecting noble maidens who were brought to his court from all districts\\".Wemple, Suzanne Fonay. Women in Frankish Society: Marriage and the Cloister, 500 to 900. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1981. Print. In Frankish society, only women of the nobility were eligible to compete; this specific trait is highlighted in the Regesta Imperii, where Judith is referred to as stemming from a noble lineage (Edlen Geschlecht). Contemporary witnesses such as Ermoldus Nigellus, Walahfrid Strabo, and Louis' biographer Thegan attributed Judith's selection to her extraordinary beauty, intelligence, and musical ability. It is just as likely, however, that Louis was attracted to the geographical and political advantages offered by Judith's family. While scholars differ as to whether the Welfs were of Frankish or Alemannian descent, it is clear that they controlled significant territories to the east of the Rhine, and were predominant political actors in both Bavaria and Alemannia. This fact would have made them desirable allies for Louis, since any military campaign in the empire's eastern frontiers would require the emperor to travel through this region. By marrying Judith, in other words, the emperor would effectively gain friends and allies, an important military and political stronghold, and the support of the nobility in that region. =Marriage= Location of Aachen in Germany Judith married Louis in 819 in Aachen. It was not uncommon that brides were given some form of dowry upon marrying into royalty. Judith's marriage was no exception to this practice and she received, according to sources, the monastery San Salvatore, which was located in Brescia (in the region of Lombardy in northern Italy). The monastery of San Salvatore and all the assets that fall under its jurisdiction, would fall under the protection with the protection of the King. Although, according to modern sources, the dowry was indicative that the marriage was in fact a \\"Vollehe\\" (full marriage), it did not mean that the dowry was static, insofar as it would remain solely within the possession of the Queen in perpetuity; rather it could be taken from her depending on the political climate, as would later be the case in Judith's life, after her fall from power and influence. =Coronation= In later Carolingian societies the act of coronation was closely tied with the marriage. It was only upon the completion of the marriage that queenhood and thus legitimacy was bestowed. When Louis married his first wife Ermengard in 794, she was crowned and called \\"Augusta\\", a title that harkens back to the Roman \\"Augustus\\". This bestowed on Ermengard the title of empress as it would Judith when she married Louis and was \\"crowned as empress and acclaimed Augusta by all\\". =Role in the Palace= Historical sources show a gap in information available on Judith in the four years between her marriage in 819 and the birth of Charles in 823. The most likely cause of this gap is that Judith would only rise to historical prominence when she became involved in her son's, Charles The Bald, life as an advocate for his career as successor to the throne. However, various sources like the Capitulare de villis and the De ordine palatii of Hincmar of Reims can be drawn upon to provide information on roles and responsibilities that Judith would have most likely played in court. Specifically, the Capitulare de villis and the De ordine palatii define the role and consequently the realm of influence of the empress to that of the court. If these documents are indicative of the empress's role in the court and palace in general, then it may be reasonably inferred what roles Judith would have acted in. Sources tell us that Judith's and the steward of the court's (K√§mmerer) duties included, among others: caring that she, her servants and the King himself, particularly his jewelry, looked presentable and of appropriate appearance, overseeing the transfer of the yearly tribute (Abgabe der Vasallen) and ensuring that the emperor was free to focus on ruling the kingdom, without distraction of minor details like the court's appearance. It is not to be inferred from this brief sketch, however, that her role was in any sense superfluous and relegated to the realm of aesthetics. She had a working relationship with the K√§mmerer of the court, (the top administrator for the incomes, goods and running of the household), which means that she was in an influential position when it came to the functioning and the running of the court. It is not unlikely that, in order to complete these tasks, Judith would have had her own court personnel. This was not an uncommon phenomenon, it having existed according to sources since the time of the Merovingians. Having her own administration was not only instrumentally important in ensuring a smooth running of the court and the daily affairs of the palace, but also a political necessity. The King and Queen were technically seen as a single entity, as is the case in the Capitulare de villis. Her command was therefore no less significant or important than that of the King. However, in time of separation, be it war, sickness or pregnancy, this single ruling couple/entity would be divided. Consequently, when Louis endeavoured on his campaign in 824 against the Bretons or a similar campaign in the same region in 830, Judith would not only have to take care of the running of the courtly society, but also step in as a representative of the King. In this capacity she would come to be involved in the politics of the realm. But she also had other avenues to influence the politics of the realm and the court. It is not unreasonable to consider that she had some influence acting as a counsel woman for her husband. Judith's very position and proximity to the emperor as his wife meant she was in immediate proximity to him and consequently had the ability and opportunity to influence the decisions of her husband. Judith‚Äôs role and prominence in court would see a dramatic rise after the birth of her son, as she sought to establish a political and courtly base for Charles, against the threat that Lothar posed for his succession. Family Tree of Charlemagne =Children= Judith had two children with Louis. Her first child was a daughter named Gisela, born in 820. Gisela would eventually be married off by Judith to Eberhard of Friuli, a significant supporter of Lothar. Gisela was the mother of Berengar I. After having spent most of her second pregnancy in Frankfurt, she had another child named Charles, who was born on 13 June 823. More commonly known as \\"Charles the Bald\\", he would eventually become emperor, following in the footsteps of his father Louis. The birth of Charles had a significant effect on Judith's life, because Charles was the only male heir of Louis' second marriage. His birth put the Ordinatio Imperii and its designations for successor under question. The ordinatio imperii outlined that only a full heir could rule, but since there were several viable candidates that met the requirements, (mainly Lothar, Peppin and Louis the German from the marriage to Ermengard and Charles from the marriage to Judith) an eventual strain on rightful succession was inevitable. Consequently, it became of the utmost importance for Judith to secure the throne for her son and protect him from the attacks and threats that his paternal brothers posed. Lothar, being the most prominent and the oldest of Ermengard children, presented the greatest threat to Judith and Charles. Yet, realizing this, Judith selected Lothar as Charles' godfather. This strategic move meant Charles would have a political tie in the eventual disputes succession that would inevitably follow Louis' death. Carolingian empire 828 Carolingian territorial divisions, 843 The Civil War=Imperial succession and partition: Charles's role= On 9 April 817 a timber roof collapsed on Louis and his men in Aachen. The event shocked Louis and led the emperor to reconsider the distribution of his power and succession for his heirs. The ordinatio Imperii was a reconfiguration and re-imagining of in the division of Charlemagne‚Äôs inheritance, which he had always envisioned but never fully implemented. The ordinatio imperii stated that Louis oldest son Lothar would become co-emperor upon the death of Charlemagne, and would receive the whole of Frankia. It also stated that Lothar's younger brothers, Pippin, aged 19, and Louis the German, aged 10, would inherit Aquitaine and Bavaria respectively (the regna). A major sticking point that concerned Lothar was Louis‚Äô nineteen-year-old nephew Bernard of Italy getting in the way of his eventual rise to power. Bernard had been ruling Italy since 810. Yet, the ordinatio imperii did not specify Bernard as the immediate successor and continued ruler of Italy. Consequently, Bernard, alarmed by the fact that his future inheritance was at stake, rose up against Louis. The rebellion was swiftly quelled by Louis‚Äô forces. Bernard was blinded and would eventually die on 17 April 818Nelson, Janet L. Charles the Bald. London: Longman, 1992. Print. The birth of Charles as well as Lothar‚Äôs marriage in 821 meant that two imperial households were now vying for control. The strain over how to interpret the ordinatio imperii coupled with the fact that Judith would most likely outlive her husband, meant that it became imperative for Judith to establish a political base of her own, not only for her own safety and the continuation of her queenship, but also for the safety of her son. In a letter written by Agobard of Lyons to Louis, Agobard articulates the way in which Louis strove to establish an orderly settlement between his four sons. Here we see that Ermengarde's son Lothar is granted more power than Louis' other sons, jeopardising the future of both Judith and Charles: =Judith as advocate for Charles= Most information on Judith surrounds the activities for her son and her attempts to ensure his succession to the throne. Their political futures depended on each other; if Judith were widowed, her future as an empress could potentially be threatened by stepsons that no longer had familial or political concerns for her wellbeing.Elizabeth Ward: Caesar's Wife. The Career of the Empress Judith 819‚Äì829. In: Peter Goodman, Roger Collins. Print. Outlined in a letter to Pope Nicholas I Judith, upon Charles‚Äôs birth, sent a ring to Ebbo, the archbishop of Rheims, asking him to pray for the health of Charles, but also promising that if he ever sent the ring back to her in times of trouble she would help him. Politically this move is significant given that Ebbo was one of the most powerful people in the land and a \\"milkbrother\\" and friend of Louis. This marks a distinct effort on the part of Judith to bolster her influence and secure the political future of her son. Charles The Bald, French painting, 19th century, unknown painter The poem by a court poet Ermoldus Nigellus, Poem in Honor of Louis, provides insight into Judith‚Äôs influence over her son Charles. The scene describes Judith and Charles interacting while Louis goes on a hunt: Not only does this highlight Judith‚Äôs role as an influential force in Charles‚Äô life, but it also establishes an ambitious young Charles as a son that follows in the footsteps of his father Louis. Other poetry by Ermoldus from 826 describes Judith following her son in procession, flanked on either side by the magnates Hugh, count of Tours, and Lothar's father-in-law, and Matfrid, count of Orleans. Given that both magnates had extremely close ties with Lothar, this suggests Judith was already attempting to cultivate Lothar's sympathies and place herself and her son in a politically favourable position, . The three sons of Louis the Pious revolted against their father in order to control the ordering of the Carolingian succession. It was Judith's dominance and control of the court, thereby being able to dictate who saw Louis and influence him, that was the focus of their revolt. In order to seize control of the king and consequently the Carolingian succession they had to replace the current court, controlled by Judith, with their own. Judith was accused of having an incestuous relationship with Louis the Pious‚Äôs godson, Bernard of Septimania (who was the lynchpin of her court). This led to her capture and exile to Italy at the nunnery of Saint Radegund in 830. After the crisis she returned to Aachen and continued her effort to see that Charles would take control. Given Judith's role in court and her rise in power, especially in the waning year of Louis's life, the political ties that Judith had built in court became the political ties of Charles. These included, amongst others, Walahfrid, Lupus of Ferri√®res, the palace clerics Prudentius, Wenilo and Berno, and the seneschal Adalard. Several marriages in 839 sought to solidify a future for Charles and an entente with Lothar. The first was the marriage of Gisele, the daughter of Louis and Judith, to Eberhard, the duke of Friuli, who was a leading supporter of Lothar. A second such marriage was that between Judith‚Äôs brother Conrad with Adelaide, Lothar's sister in law. Judith also collaborated with the magnates that worked on the will of Louis in order to promote Charles. Fearing that Louis would die before the matter was settled, Judith advised that Louis take to his aid one of his three sons (Pippin, Lothar or Louis) in order to unite Charles and one of the brothers in mutual interest should a revolt happen after Louis's death. After Louis's death Judith helped and assisted Charles in his campaigns against Lothar. She sent troops to assist Charles in his endeavour to secure Aquitaine and the majority of Francia in order to reduce the number of competitors. She also exercised influence over him. When archbishop George was taken prisoner after a battle in which 40,000 men fell on the side of Lothar and Pippin, Judith counselled Charles to be merciful towards the archbishop, which Andreas Agnellus of Ravenna recalled as For my part I‚Äôll let you go‚Äîas my mother tells me to. =Scandals: Contemporary criticisms of Judith's role and behavior= However, the rise of Judith‚Äôs power, influence and activity in the court sparked resentment towards her. Agobard of Lyons, a supporter of Lothar, wrote two tracts Two Books in Favor of the Sons and against Judith the Wife of Louis in 833. These tracts were meant as propaganda against Judith from the court of Lothar in order to undermine her court and influence. The tracts themselves attack her character, claiming her to be of a cunning and underhanded nature and of corrupting her husband. These attacks were predominantly anti-feminist in nature. When Louis still did not sever marital ties with Judith, Agobard claimed that Judith‚Äôs extramarital affairs were carried out \\"first secretly and later impudently\\". Paschasius Radbertus accused Judith by associating her with the engagement in debauchery and witchcraft. of filling the palace with \\"soothsayers... seers and mutes as well as dream interpreters and those who consult entrail, indeed all those skilled in malign craft\\". Judith of Bavaria Characterized as a Jezebel and a Justina, Judith was accused by one of her enemies, Paschasius Radbertus, of engaging in debauchery and witchcraft with her purported lover, Count Bernard of Septimania, Louis' chamberlain and trusted adviser. This portrayal and image stands in contrast to poems about Judith. The poems depict her as \\"a second biblical Judith, a Mary sister of Aaron in her musical abilities, a Saphho, a prophetess, cultivated, chaste, intelligent, pious, strong in spirit, and sweet in conversation\\". However, Judith also garnered devotion and respect. Hrabanus Maurus wrote a dedicatory letter to Judith, exalting her \\"praiseworthy intellect\\"Hrabanus Maurus (856), Dedicatory letter to the Expositio in librum Judith (in Migne, Patrologia latina, vol. 109; transl. Sean Gilsdorf. and for her \\"good works\\". The letter commends her in the turbulent times amidst battles, wishing that she may see victory amidst the struggles she is facing. It also implores her \\"to follow through with a good deed once you have begun it\\" and \\"to improve yourself at all times\\". Most strikingly the letter wishes Judith to look to the biblical Queen Esther, the wife of Xerxes I as inspiration and as a role model =Disgrace and exile= Judith was left alone in 830 in Aachen, as Louis decided to undertake a campaign into Brittany. The campaign itself, however, was greatly opposed, because of its difficulties. Some of the magnates attempted to alter the attitudes of the people and turn them against Louis. The plot was to dispose Louis the Pious, \\"to destroy their stepmother and kill Bernard\\". Prior to Easter Week in 830 (17‚Äì24 April) Pippin, with Lothar's consent, and with a large proportion of the people \\"took away from the Emperor his royal power, and also his wife\\". Judith was veiled (\\"the female equivalent of tonsuring rival claimants to the throne\\" and sent to the convent of St Radegund at Poitiers in the same year. At an assembly held on 1 October at Nijmegen, between the Emperor, the Saxons and East Franks, it was adjudged, by \\"all the bishops, abbots, counts and other Franks\\" that Judith, even though she was taken unjustly, should be brought back and made to either stand trial for any crime she may have committed to \\"undergo the judgment of the Franks\\". In 831, around 1 February Judith stood trial at the assembly arranged by the Lord Emperor. At the assembly she \\"declared her willingness to purge herself on all the charges levelled against her\\". No one was found in the general assembly who wanted to charge her for any crime. She purged herself, by the customs of the Franks, of all the things that she had been accused of. Later life=Louis' restoration to the throne and Judith's return= In 833 Louis heard news of his sons, Pippin, Lothar and Louis the German, allying in order to orchestrate a revolt against him. Louis failed to prevent the revolt and was overthrown, resulting in Lothar seizing power. For Judith the coup resulted in her exile in Italy at the civitas of Tortona. Louis spent the next year in Aachen as a captive of Lothar. Pippin and Louis the German, however, condemned the treatment of their father by Lothar and in 834 summoned armies from Aquitaine, Bavarians, Austrasians, Saxons, Alemans and the Franks to rise up against Lothar. Hearing of the vast armies approaching him Lothar fled, leaving his father behind. Louis thus regained control and offered to forgive Lothar for his actions. Lothar, however, scorned the offer. It was during this turbulent political to-and-fro that followers of Louis the Pious who were in Italy, Bishop Ratold, Count Boniface and Pippin among them, heard of a plot to kill Judith. With their help Judith escaped and returned to Aachen in the same year. =Death of Louis and Judith's career as widow= Louis died in 840 at his palace in Ingelheim, leaving Judith a widow. She, however, continued to support her son Charles in his military campaigns and endeavours, gathering troops from Aquentine in 841. In April of that same year Charles received his crown and all of his royal attire, which contemporaries of the time herald as a divine act. Most likely, however, Judith was well aware of Charles's location and had sent the royal artifacts to meet up with her son. =Death= Charles married Ermentrude in 842 and fathered a daughter, Judith of Flanders, in 844, named after his mother. This marriage, however, proved futile for Judith's career, power and influence. With the introduction of a new queen Judith became of ex officio importance, resulting in her forced retirement as well as withdrawal of the lands and wealth under her control. Her health began to fail in 842, and she died on 19 April 843 in Tours, outliving her husband by three years, after more than a year of ill health, including coughing and dizziness. It is believed that she was around 46 years of age when she died, her husband had been closer to 62. She was buried at the Basilica of Saint Martin, Tours.

Brehons were part of the system of Early Irish law, which was also simply called \\"Brehon law\\". Brehons were judges, close in importance to the chiefs. History Ireland's indigenous system of law dates from the Iron Age. Known as Brehon law, it developed from customs which had been passed on orally from one generation to the next. Brehon law was administered by brehons. They were similar to judges, though their role was closer to that of arbitrators. Their task was to preserve and interpret the law.\\"Brehon Law\\", An tSeirbhis Churteanna In the history of the Kingdom of Dublin, the Gaelic Irish recaptured the city from the Norse Vikings after the Battle of Tara. Dublin was officially founded in 988 when the Norse King Gl√∫niairn first recognised M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill as the High King of Ireland, he also agreed to pay taxes and accept Brehon law. The city celebrated its millennium in 1988 to mark 1000 years from its founding. Even though this event was seen as the first recorded establishment of the city, evidence exists of other settlements on the River Liffey prior to this event, one being Viking known as Dyflin and the other Gaelic Irish known as √Åtha Cliath (Ford of Hurdles).988 The Norse King Gl√∫niairn recognises Mael Sechnaill Mac Domhnaill as the High King of Ireland, and agrees to pay taxes and accept Brehon law, Stair na hEireann A Megalithic site exists in Rathfarnham, County Dublin, known as Brehon's Chair or Druid's Table. It is believed to be the seat of judgement for the Archdruid in prehistoric times. The brehons of ancient Ireland were wise individuals who memorised and applied the laws to settle disputes among members of an extended family. Some brehons were attached to clans, and were allotted a portion of land for their support. Others lived independently by their profession. They were recognised as a professional class apart from druids and bards, and became, by custom, to a large extent hereditary.Ginnell, Laurence. \\"the Brehons\\", The Brehon Laws: a Legal Handbook, 1844 The term ‚Äòbard‚Äô is associated with a Brehon family of poets, called Mac an Bh√°ird (Son of the Bard). They were one of the descendants of the ancient tribes of Soghain in the Kingdom of U√≠ Maine.The Bards of Ireland, Owen Connellan, Aughty In ancient Ireland, Brehons, as part of the leading members of society, would take part in an event which took place every three years on Samhain known as Feis Teamhrach (Festival of Tara) in the House of the Banquets (Teach Moidhchuarta) at the Hill of Tara. The assembly was also originally referred to as an Aonach in prehistoric times. It was a national event with the purpose of resolving any regional disputes regarding title to rank, property and privilege. They would be settled by the lawmakers, the Brehons, and all annals and records would be carefully noted and entered by the Ard Ollams in the official records. The event was founded in a very early period and lasted until 560 AD when the last assembly was held by King Dermot, son of Fergus.Feis of Tara, Library IrelandThe Great Assembly of Tara, The Wild Geese The preparatory course of study extended over some twenty years. The Brehon laws were originally composed in poetic verse to aid memorisation. Brehons were liable for damages if their rulings were incorrect, illegal or unjust. When one brehon had adjudicated on a matter submitted to him, there could be no appeal to another brehon of the same rank; but there might be an appeal to a higher court, provided the appellant gave security. The ranking of a brithem was based on his skill, and on whether he knew all three components of law: traditional law, poetry, and (added later) canon law. In Prechristian Medieval Ireland prior to the earliest written manuscript. Law was practised by hereditary judges known as bards or fili, who passed on information orally down the generations, they held the positions of Ollam to a provincial High king or r√≠.The bards, library Ireland In pre-Norman times, it was the King who passed judgement, when necessary, following recitation of applicable law and advice from the Brehon. While originating in oral legal history, it is a common belief that Brehon law enacted the first piece of copyright legislation in relation to written text in world legal history. It involved a bitter dispute around 561 AD between Saint Colmcille and Saint Finian over the authorship of a manuscript called \\"St Jerome‚Äôs Psalter\\". Despite the enactment of the law by the king, a bloody conflict still took place known as Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne, which resulted in many deaths.Brehon Law and the Establishment of Copyrights, Stair na heireannThe Battle-of-the- book, The Wild Geese One of the main responsibilities of a Brehon was to record the genealogies of the people. One of the most notable Brehons associated with recording genealogies was the Clan Mac Fhirbhisigh. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh produced Leabhar na nGenealach, also the abridgment version Cuimre na nGenealach and Great Book of Lecan. The genealogist would also be referred to in old Irish as a Seanchaidhe. The basic family unit under brehon law in ancient Ireland was defined as Derbfine, or ‚ÄòTrue Kin‚Äô in EnglishGenealogy and Brehon Law, Tripod Another Brehon family noted for recording genealogies were the √ì Cl√©irigh, such as M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, the author of the Annals of the Four Masters. In 2000 controversial Irish Lawyer Vincent Salafia founded the Brehon Law Project, to promote the academic study of Brehon Law. The courses were formed to aid the funding of the translation of early Irish Law manuscripts and to make the study of Ancient Irish Law available for academic scholarship.Development frenzy is at the cost of everything else, Sylvia Thompson, The Irish Times, 2006Brehon Law Project Symposium, UCC, 2002Law, Literature and Legend, The definitional problem of Brehon Law, Vincent Salafia, Tuathal Tripod Several dozen families were recognised as hereditary brehon clans. Aisling poetry Within the bardic tradition, a poetic genre developed during the 17th century known as the Aisling, it was a political form of poetry based on a vision or a dream, the poems invariably involved the visitation of a lady like figure sometimes carrying a message or prophecy and symbolically representing Ireland. The first fully developed Aisling was produced by Aodhag√°n √ì Rathaille who was related to the Brehons who served as Ollamhs to the Mac C√°rthaigh M√≥r family. Aodhag√°n √ì Rathaille attended one of the last bardic schools in Killarney before all these ancient Gaelic bardic institutions where suppressed towards the end of the 17th century, the Aisling replaced the D√°n D√≠reach, an older style of poetry that came to an end with destruction of Gaelic society. He is said to have been a bridge between the old world in which he was educated and the new one in which the professional poet had no place. He wrote in the new metres but preserved the attitudes of a previous age.Williams, J.E. Caerwyn & N√≠ Mhuir√≠osa, M√°ir√≠n. Traidisi√∫n Liteartha na nGael.

Aisling an √ìigfhir first appeared in Edward Bunting's collection, The Ancient Music of Ireland.Aisling Irish Literature, The Editors of Encyclopaedia BritanniciaA Companion to Poetic Genre, Bernard O‚ÄôDonoghue, edited by Erik Martiny, Published:Wiley- Blackwell An Brad√°n Feasa (Salmon of Knowledge) The salmon fish has a significant importance in Irish mythology and folklore. The Salmon of Knowledge features in stories in Lebor Gabala Erenn and the Annals of the Four Masters. One story states that Fionn Mac Cumhaill, a great warrior, received great knowledge or ‚Äúfios‚Äù by devouring the flesh of a salmon. According to the legend the salmon had eaten from a hazel tree that surrounded the Well of Segais. By this act the salmon gained all the world's knowledge. The first person to eat its flesh, in turn, would gain this knowledge.Liberary Ireland The salmon is also connected mythologically to the Celtic Otherworld and the tales of the Sidhe. Symbolically it can exist in two worlds, one being the freshwater rivers and also in the otherworld being in the saltwater of the sea. There is a story mentioned in the Annal of the four Masters about Tuan mac Cairill, who is said to have lived during the age of the Pathol√≥nians. He had the supernatural ability to shape-shift into different forms of creature, the final form being a salmon, just before being eaten by the wife of a chieftain called Cairill, who later gave birth to him as human once again. He lived for several thousand years in numerous different reincarnations as animals and seen through their eyes the coming of the different ages and invaders throughout Irish history, right up to the dawning of the Christian age. He was known as the ‚Äòseer‚Äô or the storehouse of knowledge of Irish history. Fintan mac B√≥chra also transformed into a salmon in a place now known as Fintan's Grave near Lough Derg, he arrived with the first settlers in Ireland, the Cessairians.Oxford Reference, John Carey, ‚ÄòSc√©l Tuain meic Chairill‚Äô, √âriu, 35 (1984), 92‚Äì111 The Brehon Laws and 1925 Case of the Erne Fisherman The revival of the Brehon laws proved crucial in the twentieth century in the case of Kildoney fishermen caught poaching salmon between the Assaroe Falls and River Erne tidal estuary. It was one of the longest running and complex cases in the country's history. Fishing rights on the river estuary were under the ownership of the Erne Fishing Company, originally owned by a landowner, and this had been the case for three centuries since the introduction of the common law legal system. Natives or locals of Ballyshannon were legally restricted from benefiting or fishing in the river tidal estuary which was teeming with salmon. One of the most notable previous owners of the Erne Fishing Company was a landowner called William Conolly, he was also known for building the cursed Hellfire club on top of already existing ancient sacred cairn on Montpelier hill. In 1925 six local fishermen from Kildoney were arrested poaching in broad daylight. Many believe it was deliberate provocation in order to legally challenge or contest legitimacy of the legal status quo at that time. They were caught by an Erne Fishing company patrol boat, the subsequent court case proved to be the longest in the countries history and ultimately the courts examined interpretations of the Brehon laws, which proved to be key in deciding the final verdict.The Erne Fishery Case 1927 Ask about Ireland It considered the legal rights of individuals to fish not just in terms of the then existing common law system but also from Magna Carta before it and then even further back to Ancient Gaelic laws. Two of the leading scholarly authorities in Brehon law at that time, Eoin MacNeill and D.A. Binchy were called on to give evidence on behalf the Kildoney Fishermen. Eoin MacNeill and Binchy produced extracts from the Senchas Mar as evidence in trial. In Ancient Ireland everyone had equal rights to fish within the boundaries of any individual Tuatha or Petty State, ‚Äòa√© √°ite‚Äô or ‚Äòthe salmon of the place‚Äô, under the old system there was no evidence of individuals or groups having sole ownership to the exclusion of all others. At the trial MacNeill and Binchy also supported their case with the ancient tract ‚ÄòDo Fastad Cirt ocus Dligid‚Äô or ‚ÄòOf the Confirmation of Right and Law‚Äô.The Irish invented Chess, Brian Nugent, Corstown, Oldcastle, Co Meath, 2009-11 It was the first court case to be decided on interpretation of the Brehon laws in over three centuries.The day the Kildoney men took on the might of the Crown, William Alingham‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe winding banks of the Erne‚Äô, Courtesy of the Donegal Democrat, This particular case was seen as a significant landmark in the Sovereignty of the modern Irish state. The owner of Erne Fishery Company, called Robert Lyon Moore attempted to appeal the decision of the Irish courts to the Privy council in London. The government at the time promptly passed legislation that abolished any right to appeal on any decisions made in courts in Ireland to the Privy council in London, which was deemed outside the jurisdiction of the state. A Fianna F√°il government brought in the Constitution Act in 1933 just after the completion of the case in July 1933.Law without Loyality ‚Äì The abolition of the Irish Appeal to the Privy Council Thomas Mohr, New Series, Vol. 37 (2002), pp. 187-226 Jstor Craftsmen in Ancient Ireland According to Brehon Law, craftsmen were regarded with great respect in pre-Christian Ireland. Irish mythology mentions Tr√≠ D√©e D√°na (three gods of art) Creidhne, Goibniu and Luchtaine, all part of Tuatha D√© Danann. An artist was afforded the same privileges as the lowest noble. This tradition and respect for people of craft was carried on into the Christian age, which can be seen by the artisanry exhibited and associated with the founding monasteries. The Triads of Ireland mentions three chief artisans of Ireland. Assicus or Tassac was assigned to Saint Patrick, Conleth to Saint Brigid and Daig to Ciar√°n of Saigir. Their skills were so highly regarded that they became saints themselves.Saint Daigh of Iniskeen, August 18, Omnium Sanctorum Hiberniae 2012-2015 One of the most notable of these craftsmen was Saint Assicus, who became the first Bishop of Elphin. He came from druidic family lineage but converted to Christianity, as was the case with many of the earliest Irish Saints, with the advent of Christianity. Artefacts such as Cross of Cong, The Aghadoe Crosier and Shrine of Manchan of Mohill have been associated with a workshop linked to Saint Assicus in Elphin. Many believe Saint Assicus is actually the same person as Saint Tassac. Saint Tassac of Raholp had a similar trade. He was the metalworker who decorated the first- ever Christian church in Ireland, established by Saint Patrick near present- day Downpatrick, called the Church of Raholp in Saul. The church started out as an old barn donated by a local Druid chieftain called Dichu.Protection of Craft and Social Position of Craftsman, A smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland 1906, Library Ireland Law of the Tanistry The ancient law of succession or Tanistry has its origins in Brehon law. It was a Gaelic custom where legally the eldest son (T√°naiste) succeeded his father to exclusion of all collateral claimants. In terms of land inheritance it was a similar system to Gavelkind in ancient Ireland. In the case of failure of the presumptive heir or eldest to the throne, other sons were regarded as ‚Äòrighdhamhua‚Äô which means 'king material' or 'King in the making'.Independent, Irish in legal stew over tanistryTanistry, Library Ireland According to Adomn√°n, life of Columba, it states when selecting a capable king for D√°l Riada, Saint Columba acted in accordance with the Law of the Tanistry when he deselected the then T√°naiste, a feeble prince, Eogan√°n in favour of his younger brother √Åedh√°n, both sons of Gabr√°n mac Domangairt. √Åedh√°n had trained at the institute of Iona. Saint Columba sate him on the ‚Äòstone of fate‚Äô, he solemnly anointed him King of the Scottish Dal Riada, it was said to be the first known example of an ordination in Britain and Ireland.Celtic Scotland, A history of Ancient Alban, Cambridge Library Collection, William Forbes Skene, 1876The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens, Constable and Robinson Ltd, Mike Ashley, 1998Scots Kings‚ÄîIncluding Kings of Dal Riada who Reigned from Ireland, Hugh McGough Brehon Law during the Early/Late Middle Ages Towards the end of the 13th century, elements of native Irish Brehon law through necessity were incorporated into the English common law in the areas of The Pale; it was referred to as March Law. King Edward I of England, had a need at that time to divert much-needed resources from Ireland, to concentrate on conflicts elsewhere. As a result, English settlers, especially outside of the Pale, began to develop Irish customs and manner of dress and become accustomed to the native Brehon law. Its popularity among what were known as the ‚ÄòOld English (Pre-Reformation)‚Äô in Ireland would become a source of concern for future English monarchs and ultimately accumulated in King Edward III later enforcing the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 to counteract its growing popularity among his own subjects in Ireland.Ireland‚Äôs Astonishing System of Ancient Laws, Old Moore‚Äôs Almanac A high-profile example of Old English descent in favour of Ancient Irish law/Custom happened during the period of the reformation, an Archbishop of Armagh and Primate, George Cromer was found to have applied Brehon Law in granting an √âraic of 340 cows to the Earl of Kildare due to his foster brother's death. As a result of George Cromer's act of insubordination he was defrocked by King Henry VIII. Only to be later pardoned during Queen Mary I era.Ancient Laws and Institutes of Ireland, Stephen B.RomanIrish Legal, Irish Legal Heritage:√âraic reparation in Brehon law One of the most noted Hiberno-Norman dynasties in Ireland called the Earls of Ormond also known as the Butlers of Ormond observed English laws but also selectively on certain customs preferred to adhere to the old native Gaelic or Brehon Laws. They were known to have employed numerous Brehon judges from the MacEgan legal family based in Lower Ormond. Gilla na Naemh Mac Aodhag√°in and Sea√°n Buidhe √ì Cl√©irigh served as the two principal scribes for Sir Edmund MacRichard Butler of Polestown.

It relates to a judgement made by Dian Cecht, a physician to the Tuatha de Danann. It offers a detailed account of compensations for wounding depending on the nature of the injury, its severity and what part of the body. Much of the translation work of this old Irish manuscript is attributed to the 20th- century scholar D.A. Binchy, who first published his findings in the Eriu journal. In pre-Christian Ireland legend the first ever hospital was Bhrionbherg (House of Sorrows), set up by Macha Mong Ruadh, a legendary Irish Queen, at Emain Macha (Navan Fort), an ancient ruler of the five Kingdoms of Tara and also the daughter of √Åed R√∫ad. Other hospitals spread to all the other kingdoms; these institutes would later be carried on by monks, as parts of monasteries during the Christian times. Brehon law laid down a medical code of ethics on regulations and management for treatment of the sick and wounded, and also details of patient entitlements, compensations and fees.Mark Fisher Author, Ancient Ireland Medicine, 2017Library Ireland Treatment & Surgery, A small social history of Ancient Ireland, 1906 Bretha Cr√≥lige (Binchy, 1938) was also part of this law tract; it highlights obligations in the event of an injury to person. The cost of maintenance and entitlements to the injured party are carefully laid out in the tract. This particular law tract highlighted the fact that Druids' sick maintenance was exactly the same as a B√≥aire (ordinary freeman), regardless of status. Cain Aigillne Cain Aigillne deals with a system of laws in regards to clientship and livestock farming. Covered in this manuscript is the treatment of cattle and also of domestic animals. The law tract describes a wide variety of domestic pet animals that people kept in pre-Christian Ireland, many would be deemed as unconventional domestic pets to keep nowadays, the list included crows, ravens, cranes, badgers, wolves, foxes and others.Livestock in the Brehon Laws, J.O‚ÄôLoan, 1959, Jstor Early Irish literature and Brehon law depicts a tenderness towards animals was characteristic of Irish people. When cattle were taken on a long journey, they were fed at intermediate stations along the route with food and water. Brehon laws also had penalties for injury or theft offences against domestic animals such as cats, dogs, cattle and horses.Venerable Columba of Iona, Wonderworker, Dimtry Lapa, Orthochristian According to Senchas Mor the third most popular pet in Pre-Christian Ireland after cats and dogs was the crane (Peata Corr). In pagan times, the druids saw cranes as the heavenly transporters of the human soul to isles in the west. Some suggest fires were lit under a migration flight path of the now extinct in Ireland, Gr√∫s at Dun Aonghasa. The fort is associated with the Aengus the foster son of Midir who is said to have owned three mystical magical cranes. Stephen Colton, 25 March 2017, Take on Nature, Corr Sceal takes notions about our ancestors relationship with Cranes, Irish News This pre-Christian custom of adopting unusual native animals as pets was carried on by some of the Irish abbots into the Christian age. Saint Columba was also commonly known as the ‚Äòcrane cleric‚Äô as he kept a pet crane in his home on the Island of Iona, In the book of kells there is a depiction of a bald red patch on a cranes crown. Saint Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise owned a pet Fox (Sionnach), Saint Brendan of Clonfert had a pet Raven (pr√©ch√°n), Saint Brigid adopted and offered sanctuary to a boar, Saint Colman mac Duagh had a pet Rooster that also served as an alarm clock and Saint Colman of Templeshambo owned a flock of sacred ducks, that were so tame they came and went at his call.Animal as Pets in Ancient Ireland, P.W.Joyce, A small social history of Ancient Ireland, 1906, Library IrelandSaint Ciaran of Clonmacnoise, Orthodox Church of AmericaSaint Brigid and the boar, Animals, Global Catholics, Saints, Green Canticle Cai of the Fair Judgement Numerous myths associated with different invaders in Irish mythology exist as to the origins of Brehon Law. In Milesian folklore, The Scholar's Primer describes the first Brehon or lawgiver as being Ca√≠ Ca√≠nbrethach (\\"Fair-Judgement\\"), he fostered and was a mentor to a Son of Mil known as Amorghain Gl√∫ngheal, who later would become Chief Ollamh of Ireland and he also was said to be the 72nd disciple of the school of F√©nius Farsaid. Ca√≠ in legend, first arrived in Ireland in the company of the Mil Espaine on board a ship, during the Milesian conquest of Ireland.The Scholar‚Äôs Primer, Corpus of Electronic Texts, a Project of University College, Cork, 2011Judges and Poets in the Pseudo-Historical Prologue to the Senchas Mar, Roisin McLaughlin, Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies The word C√°in in old Irish translates to \\"law\\" in English. Some of the earliest Brehon or Gaelic legislation was associated with the word such as C√°in Lanamna (Law of Couples) or C√°in Adomn√°in (Law of Innocents), a Christian law passed by the Synod of Birr in the ancient Territory of Eile. Brehon law came under two categories, C√°in and Urradas. C√°in Law broadly applied to entire tribes, regions, all under a High King. Urradas law was at a more local level. The character known as Kay in Medieval Welsh text is said to be based on Ca√≠ Ca√≠nbrethach.The Heroic Tradition of Kay, Peter Noble, University of Reading Cetharslicht Athgabdla The first volume of The Law of Distress (Athgabdla) was published in a Harleian Manuscript in 1865 and the second in 1869. It deals with ancient legal issues of Seizure by distraint of property for the satisfaction of debt, also laws related fosterage, tenure and social connections.Introduction to Senchus Mor, and Athzabail: or Law of distress, as contained in the Harleian Manuscripts, Cheri Birkbeck In the law tract Cetharslicht Athgabdla, it states that three noble tribes passed a judgement at a D√°l-Criche (territorial assembly) and divided Ireland between them. A D√°l was similar to an Aonach, in that it refers to a ritual annual gathering of legislators at a fixed site of ceremonial importance in order, to among other rituals, collectively pass laws. In Connacht the most famous of these sites was in Cruachan near Tulsk, site of the kings of Connacht, it contains a large number of R√°th, Barrows, Mounds and Earthworks. In Old Irish the word ‚ÄòD√°l‚Äô means assembly or conferring, for example in its modern Irish form, ‚ÄòD√°il √âireann‚Äô translates to Assembly of Ireland.Trowel, The Journal of Archchaeological Society, University Dublin, Volume iv, 1993 D√°l was also associated with the old Irish word of Tulach (Hillock), which represented the place where ancient druidic ceremonial gatherings took place, it was usually a burial mound. Some place names derive from the word, such as Tullamore, Tullow or Tullynadal (Tulach na d√°la) in Donegal which translates as 'a mustering place'.Drong and Dal as Synonyms of Oenach, Paul MacCotter Numerous categories or levels of assembly, at which laws were passed existed in ancient Ireland, the highest was the Feis Temrach at Tara (National level), Aonach (National or Regional), D√°l (T√∫ath Sept Nobles), Cuirmtig (T√∫ath members) and finally a Tocomra, where a T√∫ath elected their own Taoiseach and T√°naiste. The main purpose of these gatherings was to promulgate and reaffirm the laws. The Chief Ollamh of Ireland coordinated the Feis at Tara, Ard Ollamh at Regional and Ollamh at a Tuath level.Brehon Laws, Page:EB1911 - Volume 04 The earliest reference in the Senchas M√°r to the reading of the law of Athgabdla at an assembly, took place at the Hill of Uisneach, just before the eve of Bealtaine about a hundred years before the birth of Christ, a uniform law of distraint passed for the whole of Ireland was adopted on the motion of Sen, son of Aig√©. This did not prevent the gatherings at Uisneach from being for ages celebrated for gaiety and amusement.Irish Tribal Assemblies, Laurence Ginnell, The Brehon Law legal handbook, 1894Tailltenn and Uisneach, Laurence Ginnell, The Brehon Law legal handbook, 1894 Maeltine Mor Brethach (The Great Judgement) Its unknown when the first rudiments of Brehon Law were first practised, some suggest as far back as the Iron Age. With it being orally practised, not many documented writings were produced prior to the Christian age. Some information was later passed on and translated or pieced together from the oldest surviving manuscripts by the endeavours of Christian Monks, much of it was in the form of myth and poetry.Eibhlin O‚ÄôNeill, Transceltic One of the earliest mythical references to a judgement of a Brehon was following the second Battle of Moytura. The then king of the Tuatha de Danann, Lugh consulted with Maeltine, his Brehon on the capture of Bres, ex-king and a defector to the Formorians. Lugh agreed to spare Bris's life, if he ensured that Irish cows give milk in abundance, by teaching the people of the Tuatha de Danann agriculture.Translation by Elizabeth A. Grey, Sacred TextsCyclops Lugh, Xavier Seguin, Eden Saga The second Battle of Moytura was not the first ever documented mythical judgement by Brehon, According to Lebor Gab√°la the first- ever recorded case involved a dispute between Parthol√≥n and his adulterous wife, Dealgnaid, a Brehon was said to have adjudicated a settlement between both parties. Morann's Collar In the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, it describes a famous mythical Brehon judge known as Morann Mac M√°in (son of Cairbre Cinnchait), who was the Chief Ollam to High King Feradach Finnfechtnach. Morann would wear a Brehon S√≠n or collar, which was said to contract around his neck when he gave a false judgement and would then only loosen once he made a just one. He is also known in the Ogam Tract for creating one of the three Br√≠atharogam, used to interpret the Ogham alphabet. In Ancient Irish law, the Ogham carved stones on a piece of land represented the underpinning of legal ownership to that land.The ancient rune-like writing system, Catherine Swift, 2015 Morann is also associated with the manuscript Audacht Morainn (The Testament of Morann), a medieval old Irish wisdom literature which gave advice to a prospective or future king. It was produced as a piece of insight for Feradach Finnfechtnach, just before he was made a high king. There are five known compositions of this genre in Old Irish, most notably Tecosca Cormaic or Br√≠athra Flainn F√≠na mac Ossu, although Audacht Morainn is the oldest. It is officially seen by many to be the forerunner to the 9th century Mirrors for princes, which was produced by an Irish Christian monk called Sedulius Scottus.Fergus Kelly lecture, The Traids of Early Irish literature, Proceedings of the British Academy Volume 125, 2003 Lectures, Professor P.J Marshall, CBE, FBAPatrizia de Bernardo Stempel, Caren Esser, and Jonathan Slocum, Old Irish Online, The University of Texas at Austin, Linguistics Research Centre Book of Aicill and F√©nechus Law The first ever attempt at transferring Brehon law into written code or legal text was carried out under the patronage of King Cormac mac Airt. He produced the Book of Achall or Aicill, written between 227 and 266 AD, which relates mainly to criminal law. Cormac is said to have retired to the mound of Aicill, in what is now called Skreen near Tara and started working on the book.Cormac Mac Art, Bard Mythologies Another later significant document was Senchas M√°r or F√©nechus Law (that which relates to the F√©ine), drafted around 438 AD by a select committee of nine, presided over by Saint Patrick. Senchas M√°r is mostly associated with ancient Civil law, selective parts of pre-Christian Irish law that were deemed non-compatible to the teachings of the new Christian age were excluded by the committee from the final written tract. Dubthach maccu Lugair was the judge or Brehon chosen by St Patrick, as part of the committee of three kings, three bishops and three professors of literature, poetry and law, in the creation of Senchas M√°r.250 Brehon Code of Ireland, Duhaime The earliest tracts were produced in the oldest archaic form of Irish dialect known as 'B√©rla F√©ine‚Äô, some also suggest the written text to be an ancient poetic legal dialect of Dubthach.The Brehon Laws, New AdventTransactions of the Gaelic Society of Dublin, John Barlow, 1808 According to Irish myth the \\"Feine\\" were descendants of a legendary figure known as F√©nius Farsaid, who is said to have created the ancient language \\"B√©rla F√©ne\\".The Milesians Irish Nation, Library IrelandFenius Farsaid and the Alphabets, Jstor These early manuscripts proved a difficult challenge for centuries after to translate for future academics and even to later Brehons. Only in the seventeenth century did Irish Gaelic scholars such as Eugene O'Curry and John O'Donovan manage to translate much of these original text, but only due to a life-long study. Berla Fene was one of the five extensions of the Go√≠delc language; it was known as the legal dialect or dark speech of the Fil√≠ and the Brehon. The 7th-century manuscript Auraicept na n-Eces or \\"Scholars Primer\\" describes the mythical origins of the Ollav,Auracept na n-Eces, George Calder, University of Glasgow, 1917 72 named linguistic scholars who had assisted Fenius Farsaid, later asked him to select from all the languages, and develop a tongue that nobody else should have but which might belong to them alone. Fenius created Berla Tobaide and later commanded Gaedheal son of Eathor or Go√≠del mac Eth√©oir to set about arranging and regulate into five dialects and name them all after himself. Berla Fene makes up the corpus of the earliest written manuscripts and proved the most challenging to translate in the Christian Era.Old Irish Online, Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel and Jonathan Slocum, Linguistics Research Center, University of Texas at Austin which A Grammar of the Irish Language, The College of Saint Columba, Hodges and Smiths, John O‚Äô Donovan, 1845Celtic Studies at UCLA, The Poetic Brehon Lawyers, Kathrine Simms The first detailed scientific study of Ancient Irish Law tracts took place in the 20th century. A comprehensive study of difficult Old Irish law texts was carried out by German Celticist Rudolf Thurneysen, English linguist Charles Plummer and Irish Historian Eoin Mac Neill.Property rights of Celtic Irish Law, Joseph R. Peden, University of New York The Bee Laws One of the more unusual tracts in Brehon law was known as the Bee Judgment (Bech Bretha). In the twenty page manuscript it goes into great detail about legal entitlements or ownership of a swarm (faithche), hives, nests or honey found on a piece of land or property, discovered by a finder or property/land owner and also a detailed compensation scheme for victims of bee stings.Social History Ancient Ireland, Library Ireland Honey was considered of great value at a time before the advent of sugar cane. It had many applications such as basting meat while roasting, treating salmon while broiling, also used as an ingredient in lard and drinks. One of the more important Celtic customs was in the production of mead (fermenting of honey with water), in medieval times the alcoholic drink had mystical and religious qualities, a noted example was Lindisfarne Mead, produced by the Celtic Monks on Holy Island. The word ‚Äòmither‚Äô derives from the mether, which is a mead drinking vessel. People are said to get ‚Äòconfused and bothered as a result of too much mead‚Äô.Bee Laws, Moore Group Mead is also associated with the wife of Ailill and Sovereignty Queen, Medb. In Pagan times, Brehon law states that before a new High King can be inaugurated they must first accept an alcoholic drink in form of Mead off the Queen of the Land, and thus become intoxicated by her. Brigh Brigaid Brigh Brigaid, also spelled as Briugaid or Brughaidh, (flourished circa CE 50, Ireland) was a woman who held office as a brehon, or judge, in Ireland in the 1st century CE. Brigh is mentioned in the Senchus M√≥r, a compendium of the ancient laws of Ireland,Technovate and her decisions were cited as precedents for centuries after her death.Joyce Her name is possibly associated to the Celtic Pagan Goddesses, who had a strong connection with the bardic traditions.Brigit Susa Morgan Black, The Order of Bards Ovates & Druids She was known as the ‚Äúgreat brig‚Äù or brigit, an honored brehon women who is said to have healed a fellow judge, Sencha mac Ailella blotched face by correcting his biased judgement against women.The Encyclopedia of Celtic mythology and Folklore, Patricia Monaghan Decline of Brehon Law The gradual decline of Brehon law began during the Norman conquest, it continued to co-existed with an imposed legal system from the 12th century onwards. It was only in the middle seventeenth century efforts were made to completely suppress it out of existence in favour of the colonial common law system, which has remained the official legal system right up to the present day. In the late 17th century it was deemed a serious criminal offence to be found in possession of old Irish law book and often punishable by transportation to penal servitude. It was only in the middle 19th century when two scholarly Church of Ireland Clergymen called James Henthorn Todd and Charles Graves, a professor of Trinty College, he was the Grandfather of another Gaelic Scholar Robert Graves persuaded the British Government to set up a Brehon Law Commission in 1852 in order to save the ancient law text. Native Irish Scholars Eugene O'Curry and John O‚ÄôDonovan were employed by the commission to translate old law manuscripts.Library Ireland, The Translation of the Ancient Irish Laws, UlstermanIrelands Eye, An Introduction to Irelands traditional laws Brehons had a tradition of providing bardic Schools, from pre-Christian times up until middle of the seventeenth century. They provided education in Irish language, literature, history and Brehon law. These scholarly institutions facilitated up to what amounted to university education. They had a history of producing an abundance of Poets and Bard's. The imposition of Penal law, Popery Act combined with the first Cromwellian regime saw the suppression of these native educational institutions. As a result, secret hedge schools began to appear up until the Penal laws ended.Educational History: The Hedge School of Ireland, P.J Dowling, Ragged University See also * Mac Aodhag√°in * Mac Fhirbhisigh * √ì Cian√°in * √ì Cl√©irigh * √ì Cobhthaigh * √ì Domhnall√°in * √ì Duibh d√° Bhoireann * √ì Breaslain * √ì Deoradhain * Sister Fidelma a fictional Brehon, created by novelist Peter Berresford Ellis NotesReferences  External links *Higgins, Noelle. \\"‚ÄúThe Lost Legal System: Pre-Common Law Ireland and Brehon Law‚Äù, School of Law and Government, Dublin City University *The Old Gaelic Order ...as described by Ben McBrady(descendant of Dubthach maccu Lugair) Category:Early Gaelic law Category:Irish women judges Category:Judges Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Brehon"},{"id":"2306270","text":"{ +Belle of Louisville } Belle of Louisville is a steamboat owned and operated by the city of Louisville, Kentucky, and moored at its downtown wharf next to the Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere during its annual operational period. Originally named Idlewild, she was built by James Rees & Sons Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the West Memphis Packet Company in 1914 and was first put into service on the Allegheny River. Constructed with an all-steel superstructure and asphalt main deck, the steamboat is said to hold the all- time record in her class for miles traveled, years in operation, and places visited. Belle of Louisvilles offices are aboard Mayor Andrew Broaddus, also a National Historic Landmark. History Idlewild operated as a passenger ferry between Memphis, Tennessee, and West Memphis, Arkansas. She also hauled cargo such as cotton, lumber, and grain. She then came to Louisville in 1931 and ran trips between the Fontaine Ferry amusement park near downtown Louisville and Rose Island, a resort about upriver from Louisville. Idlewild operated a regular excursion schedule from 1934 through World War II, during which she was outfitted with special equipment to push oil barges along the river. She also served as a floating USO nightclub for troops stationed at military bases along the Mississippi River. In 1947, she was sold to J. Herod Gorsage, and honoring the death-bed wish of Master Ben Winters, long time captain of Idlewild, was renamed Avalon. Over the next few years, Avalon visited ports all along the Mississippi, Missouri, St. Croix, Illinois, Kanawha, Ohio, and Cumberland Rivers. Her many stops included Omaha, Nebraska; Stillwater, Minnesota; Montgomery, West Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. By 1962, Avalon had fallen into disrepair, and might have seen the end of her days, when Jefferson County Judge Marlow Cook bought her at an auction for $34,000 in hopes of restoring the city's connection to the waterfront. The relationship between the city of Louisville and its beloved waterfront had begun to dwindle over the years due to the advancement in automobiles and the building of the elevated I-64 roadway, but the purchase of the steamboat that had a wealth of history with the city was the perfect solution. She came to Louisville and was re-christened Belle of Louisville. The purchase of Belle of Louisville sparked the beginning of multiple attempts to reform the relationship between the city of Louisville and the river on which it was located. Some of these efforts include the creation of the Belvedere, an elevated outdoor space that overlooks the Ohio River, and the nationally recognized Waterfront Park that stretches along a portion of the river. =Restoration= The restoration of the boat was supervised by marine architect Alan L. Bates (now Captain Bates), whose book, Str. Belle of Louisville, (1964) remains a primary source on the history of the boat and the crews who worked on her. Prior to the auction, the hull had been condemned as unfit by the U.S. Coast Guard: concrete patches had added much weight to the oft-damaged hull, as had generations of accumulated modifications to the decks and fittings within her superstructure. These were stripped and repaired in dry dock or removed by volunteers. What remained was cleaned, surface prepared, supplied with new finish carpentry, and painted in a style consistent with the boat's early 20th-century origins. Captain Clarke \\"Doc\\" Hawley, had worked aboard the boat during her Avalon days. He had salvaged the brass nameplates from the ends of the two massive cylinders in order to prevent them from being sold for scrap, and now he returned them to the boat. Hawley had also, before the auction, at his own cost hired an assistant to drain the boat's water-filled fittings for winter, so that they would not freeze and burst. This meant that the mechanical restoration of the boat was now possible, at far less cost than had extensive refitting of ruined pipe work been necessary. Various of her workings, though not her engine and drive train, had been stripped and sold in separate lots at auction, including the boat's original steam calliope. Volunteers donated materials which could be adapted to use. Some of them, such as brass steam-powered bilge clearing pumps known as siphons, were cannibalized from sunken steamboats whose hulls could still be seen and dived at low water. Some missing components were custom- fabricated by local foundries in a style copied from photos of the boat in her earlier days. The degree of preservation was considerable, and the boat is still piloted with a 19th-century skill set, though now with the assistance of modern communications. Although authentic to its core, the boat has occasionally seen improvements not part of the original restoration. The compressed-air driven calliope which replaced the missing original proved unsatisfying, and was ultimately replaced with the true steam calliope which the boat uses today, audible for many blocks in the surrounding Downtown Louisville area when the boat is readying to depart. The new calliope was built by Morecraft Manufacturing of Peru, Indiana and installed in 1988. The instrument is a reproduction of the Nichol instrument that the boat carried when named Avalon. The ship's bow was also redesigned by Bates in the late 1960s, to make the boat a better contender in the Great Steamboat Race: the original, blunter bow at maximum speeds showed the tendency for waves to break over it. =Career as Belle of Louisville= On April 30, 1963, Belle of Louisville made her first cruise in a race against the steamboat Delta Queen. That race was the beginning of an unparalleled river tradition. To this day, Belle of Louisville and another competing steamboat, previously the Delta Queen, still square off every year on the Wednesday before the Kentucky Derby in the Kentucky Derby Festival event The Great Steamboat Race. Belle of Louisville flying the Jolly Roger during the 2006 Great Steamboat Race Belle of Louisville at the start of the 2004 Great Steamboat Race Thousands of spectators line both sides of the river to watch the race: on the first occasion of the running of the race, attendance exceeded that of the Kentucky Derby the same year. Originally, Kentucky Derby officials were said to be reluctant to accept the steamboat race as part of the Derby celebrations, as in old betting parlance, a \\"boat race\\" refers to a horse race with an outcome influenced by dishonest means. According to Louisville folklore, the race may be rigged, but insiders insist that cheating is impossible, because the race has no rules‚Äîthe only prizes are bragging rights and a pair of gilded deer antlers, which are mounted above the forecastle of the winning boat. Today, Belle of Louisville is recognized as the oldest river steamboat in operation, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. The annual Forecastle Festival is one of many examples of how Belle of Louisville has impacted several events throughout the city of Louisville. Although the music festival takes place in mid-July in Waterfront Park during the day carrying over into the late evening, Belle of Louisville acts as the venue for the after shows and parties that are specifically for Forecastle VIP ticket holders. During these after shows and parties, select performers act as the entertainment as people get to experience the environment of Louisville from the perspective of the river while they ride around on Belle of Louisville. In August 1997, Belle of Louisville was partially sunk at her moorings; a former crew member of the boat was later convicted of sabotage. The proximate cause of the sinking was flooding of the hull via a city water line left connected to a fitting that led into the boat's hull. Due to the swift actions of the steamer's crew and other members of the community, the boat was rescued, repaired, and returned to service. In February 2007, Mark Doty was named as Belle of Louisvilles captain, replacing Kevin Mullen, who left the position in November 2006. Doty's official title is \\"Master of the Fleet\\" or \\"Port Captain\\". On October 17, 2009, Belle of Louisville collided with a dock near Six Mile Island on the Ohio River. Witness statements report that the accident occurred as she was making a turnaround about halfway through a cruise. Tugboats were used to pull her to safety. A Belle of Louisville official was quoted as saying that the wind had caused her to hit the dock. It has been reported that one-third of the paddle wheel's bucket planks were damaged in the collision, and jockey bar (the main steel arm, which goes across the aft end of the paddle wheel) was bent. The crew, however, was able to fix the damage without drydocking. The damaged bucket planks were replaced from stock held in storage. On October 18, 2014, Belle of Louisville turned 100 years old. To celebrate, a 5-day riverboat festival named \\"The Belle's Big Birthday Bash\\" was held in Louisville along parts of Louisville Waterfront Park. Eight other riverboats from across the country joined Belle of Louisville to help celebrate her 100th year on the river. The festival incorporated cruises, fireworks, riverfront concerts, hot air balloon glows, and more. The other riverboats attending the festival included Spirit of Jefferson, Anson Northrup, Belle of Cincinnati, The Colonel, General Jackson, River Queen, Spirit of Peoria, and Celebration Belle. This festival was said to be the largest riverboat gathering that Louisville has seen in over 100 years. A portion of the proceeds from The Belle's Big Birthday Bash went toward her preservation fund. Belle of Louisville in fiction Belle of Louisville appears as a character (powered by an artificial intelligence) in Rudy Rucker's 1988 novel Wetware, which takes place on the Moon and in Louisville in the year 2031.

The music consists of virtuosic treatment of the solo instrument, the mandolin, and the interplay between the soloist and accompaniment of the orchestra. The demands are considered higher than other concerti by Vivaldi, and the work is one of the most famous mandolin pieces. Music from the concerto was featured in the 1979 movie Kramer vs. Kramer and in the 2015 commercial The Gentleman's Wager II by Johnnie Walker. Movements There are three movements: #Allegro #Largo #Allegro The first movement is a rapid, cheerful tune lasting slightly more than three minutes. Throughout the piece, Vivaldi creates sharp and low contrasts between the mandolin and the rest of the orchestra, attracting much attention to several crescendos within the music. The second movement, is slightly less than three minutes long, and in contrast to the rapid and enthusiastic tune of the first movement, is slower and thoughtful in its composition.

Following the success of Spider- Man's original series, The Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel felt the character could support more than one title. This led the company in 1968 to launch a short- lived magazine, the first to bear the Spectacular name. In 1972, Marvel more successfully launched a second Spider-Man ongoing series, Marvel Team-Up, in which he was paired with other Marvel heroes. A third monthly ongoing series, Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, debuted in 1976.  Magazine  The Spectacular Spider-Man was initially a two-issue magazine published by Marvel in 1968, as an experiment in entering the black-and-white comic-magazine market successfully pioneered by Warren Publishing and others. It sold for 35 cents when standard comic books cost 12 cents and Annuals and Giants 25 cents. It represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication aside from the original series' summer Annuals, begun in 1964. The first issue (cover-dated July 1968) featured a painted, color cover by men's adventure-magazine artist Harry Rosenbaum, in acrylic paint on illustration board, over layouts by The Amazing Spider-Man artist John Romita Sr. The 52-page black-and-white Spider- Man story, \\"Lo, This Monster!\\", was by writer Stan Lee, penciler Romita Sr. and inker Jim Mooney. A 10-page origin story, \\"In The Beginning!\\", was by Lee, penciler Larry Lieber and inker Bill Everett. The feature story was reprinted in color, with some small alterations and bridging material by Gerry Conway, in The Amazing Spider-Man #116‚Äì118 (Jan.‚ÄìMarch 1973) as \\"Suddenly...the Smasher!\\", \\"The Deadly Designs of the Disruptor!\\", and \\"Countdown to Chaos!\\" (with additional inking by Tony Mortellaro on the latter two). These versions were themselves reprinted in Marvel Tales #95‚Äì97 (Sept.-Oct. 1978). The second and final issue (Nov. 1968) also sported a painted cover and the interior was in color as well. Lee, Romita and Mooney again collaborated on its single story, \\"The Goblin Lives!\\", featuring the Green Goblin. A next-issue box at the end promoted the planned contents of the unrealized issue #3, \\"The Mystery of the TV Terror\\". A version of the Goblin story, trimmed by 18 pages, was reprinted in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #9 (1973), and portions of the \\"TV Terror\\" costume were reused for the costume of the Prowler. Both issues of the magazine were reprinted in their entirety (albeit reduced to comic size) in the collection Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man #7 (), then again in Marvel Epic Collections: The Amazing Spider-Man #4 in 2019. The first issue was reprinted again in 2002 as The Spectacular Spider Man Facsimile, exactly as it was originally presented. Volume 1 (1976-98) Cover of Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #1 (December 1976). Art by Sal Buscema Titled Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man on its December 1976 debut, and shortened to simply The Spectacular Spider-Man with #134 (Jan. 1988), this was the second Amazing Spider-Man monthly comic-book spin-off series, after Marvel Team-Up, which also featured Spider-Man. The monthly title ran 264 issues (including a #-1 issue) until November 1998. The series was launched by writer/editor Gerry Conway and artist Sal Buscema and Mike Esposito. Conway explained the concept and origin of the series: Buscema drew the title until mid-1978. After Buscema's departure, a succession of artists (including Mike Zeck, Jim Mooney, Ed Hannigan, Marie Severin and Greg LaRocque) penciled the series for approximately five years. Frank Miller, who would later become the artist on Daredevil, first drew the character in Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #27.Saffel \\"Weaving a Broader Web\\", p. 73: \\"Frank Miller was the guest penciler for The Spectacular Spider-Man #27, February 1979, written by Bill Mantlo. [The issue's] splash page was the first time Miller's [rendition of] Daredevil appeared in a Marvel story.\\" Scripting initially alternated between Conway and Archie Goodwin until mid-1977, when Bill Mantlo took over. During this era of Spectacular, the stories focused more on Parker's campus life as an undergraduate student/teacher's assistant at Empire State University and giving more attention to his colleagues than to the more long- running supporting characters in Amazing. Mantlo's first run on the title featured frequent appearances by the White Tiger, Marvel's first superhero of Hispanic descent and the first appearance of the supervillain Carrion. He used the series to wrap up unresolved plot elements from The Champions comic book seriesManning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 101: \\"Bill Mantlo was the regular scribe of both Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man and The Champions...The Champions had recently been cancelled, and Mantlo decided to tie up a few of the title's loose ends in his other comic.\\" and concluded his first run with a crossover with Fantastic Four #218 (May 1980).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 113: \\"In the conclusion to a tale that had begun in the pages of Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #42 (May), writer [Bill] Mantlo and artist John Byrne had the latest incarnation of the Frightful Four face off against their Fantastic Four counterparts. Mantlo was succeeded by Roger Stern, who wrote for the title from #43 (June 1980)Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 114: \\"Writer Roger Stern would begin his long tenure as a Spider-scribe with an impressive run on Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider- Man, beginning with this issue illustrated by Mike Zeck.\\" to #61 (December 1981). When Stern departed to write for The Amazing Spider-Man, Mantlo returned to scripting Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man; Mantlo's second tenure at the title lasted until April 1984. Mantlo's second run introduced the superhero duo Cloak and Dagger, created by Mantlo and Hannigan in Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #64 (March 1982),DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207: \\"Cloak and Dagger's first appearance was written by Bill Mantlo and illustrated by Ed Hannigan. A socially conscious writer, Mantlo used the characters to address the problems of teenage runaways and the dangers of illegal drugs.\\" and included a story arc which took place from issues #73‚Äì79 (Dec. 1982 ‚Äì June 1983), in which Doctor Octopus and the Owl compete for control of the New York underworld, Octopus almost destroys New York with a nuclear device and the Black Cat is critically injured.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 133: \\"Shot and stabbed and at death's door, the Black Cat truly needed her nine lives, but luckily began the long road to recovery thanks to the hard work of local hospital staff.\\" Issue #86 (January 1984) was part of the \\"Assistant Editors Month\\" event and featured a story drawn by Fred Hembeck. Al Milgrom took over scripting as well as art on the title with issue #90 (May 1984) and worked on it through #100 (March 1985).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 147: \\"In the final issue of Al Milgrom's stint as writer on Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, which had begun with issue #90 (May 1984), Milgrom once again served as both author and artist in a tale that wrapped up the Spider-Man/Black Cat romance.\\" Milgrom imbued the book with a more whimsical tone, for example, pitting Spider-Man against The Spot, an enemy who was so ridiculous that he gave Spider-Man fits of laughter. Jim Owsley, then-editor of the Spider-Man books, disapproved of this approach and had Milgrom replaced as writer by newcomer Peter David in 1985. David and artist Rich Buckler, said Owsley, had the series \\"focusing on stories with a serious, 'grown-up' tone and more complex themes\\". The most notable story arc of the David/Buckler era is \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" (#107‚Äì110, Oct. 1985‚ÄìJan. 1986),Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 150: \\"Revered as one of the finest Spider-Man stories ever told, this four-part saga, written by Peter David and penciled by Rich Buckler, was a decidedly dark tale for the usually lighthearted web-slinger.\\" in which Spider-Man's ally, NYC Police Captain Jean DeWolff ‚Äì a supporting character in the Spider-Man comics since 1976 ‚Äì is murdered by the vigilante/serial killer the Sin-Eater. This multi-part story guest-starred Daredevil. The storyline \\"Kraven's Last Hunt\\" by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Mike Zeck and Bob McLeod crossed over into Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #131 and 132.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 231: \\"The six-issue story arc...ran through all the Spider-Man titles for two months.\\" With issue #134 (Jan. 1988), the \\"Peter Parker\\" part of the title was removed and the series became simply The Spectacular Spider-Man. The logo changed from a distinctive design to using the same design as that of The Amazing Spider-Man and the 1968 Spectacular Spider-Man magazine; this logo did not change until issue #218 (Nov. 1994). Sal Buscema returned as the regular artist, staying with the title from early 1988 to late 1996; throughout the series' run, Buscema drew over 100 issues, making him by far the series' most frequent contributor. After his \\"Return of the Sin-Eater\\" arc (#134‚Äì136, Jan.‚ÄìMarch 1988), Peter David was removed as writer. Editor Owsley said editor-in-chief Jim Shooter \\"disliked Peter's work intensely\\".Priest, \\"Ball Game\\" (requires scrolldown). David, in a 2005 interview, believed, \\"I was fired off Spider-Man because it was felt at the upper editorial level that a novice comic-book writer shouldn't be handling the adventures of Marvel's flagship character\\". Former series writer Gerry Conway, who additionally wrote Web of Spider-Man from 1988 to 1990, returned to Spectacular after which he left both books to become a story editor on the TV series Father Dowling Mysteries. Conway stated in 1991 that \\"I understand the character a lot better now than I did when I was nineteen. And one of the nice things about the Marvel characters is that you can keep them fresh by changing them just a bit.\\" His 1988‚Äì1991 run on Spectacular included such story arcs as the \\"Lobo Brothers Gang War\\",DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 238: Created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Sal Buscema, Carlos and Eduardo Lobo possessed the mutant ability to transform into werewolves. and the conflict between Daily Bugle editor Joe Robertson and his former friend, the albino criminal Tombstone. He used his joint duty as Web of Spider-Man writer to tie together storylines in the two separate titles and strengthen the continuity between them. Throughout their run, Conway and Buscema collaborated using the Marvel method, occasionally working out details of the plot over the phone. J. M. DeMatteis became the regular writer in mid-1991, injecting a grim, psychological tone into the series. DeMatteis began his run with the story arc \\"The Child Within\\" (#178‚Äì184, July 1991‚ÄìJan. 1992), featuring the return of the Harry Osborn version of the Green Goblin. As written by DeMatteis, Harry sank further into insanity and gained the same super-strength possessed by his father, battling Spider-Man again in #189 (June 1992), before being killed in #200 (May 1993).Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 263: \\"The 200th issue of The Spectacular Spider- Man, written by J. M. DeMatteis and with art by Sal Buscema, featured the shocking death of Spider-Man's close friend, Harry Osborn.\\" In an undated 2000s interview, DeMatteis said, \\"I really loved the two years on Spectacular Spider-Man that I wrote with Sal Buscema drawing. Talk about underrated! Sal is one of the best storytellers and a wonderful collaborator. I loved that run.\\" During this period Spider-Man editor Danny Fingeroth would hold conferences in New York with all the Spider-Man creative staff, allowing them to brainstorm ideas and discuss future storylines. DeMatteis left the book in mid-1993 to write The Amazing Spider-Man. Steven Grant had a brief run before the book was set adrift with a succession of fill-in issues which ran through late 1994, when former Amazing Spider-Man writer Tom DeFalco took over. By this time, all the Spider-books were affected by the controversial \\"Clone Saga\\" that culminated with Spectacular Spider-Man #226 (July 1995), and Fingeroth convinced DeFalco that the series needed a regular writer to help guide the crossover story. This story revealed (though it was later reversed) that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This tied into a publishing gap after #229 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by The Spectacular Scarlet Spider #1‚Äì2 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1995), featuring the \\"original\\" Peter Parker. The series picked up again with #230 (Jan. 1996). Initially newcomer Todd Dezago wrote the scripts for DeFalco's plots, since DeFalco was already writing two other series and wanted to groom DeZago to be the long-term writer on Spectacular Spider-Man. Todd Dezago then wrote for a year before DeMatteis returned through May 1998. DeMatteis later commented, \\"We did some nice stories, like the one about Flash Thompson's childhood. But, in general, I don't hold that last run ... very dear to my heart.\\" Luke Ross succeeded Sal Buscema as the artist and remained until the series ended, but there was no regular writer for the last half-year with Glenn Greenberg, Roger Stern, John Byrne and Howard Mackie all contributing during this time. The final issue was #263 (Nov. 1998). Volume 2 (2003‚Äì05) Spectacular Spider-Man (vol. 2) titled without the definite article \\"The\\", is a 27-issue monthly series published from September 2003 to June 2005. Each issue was written by Paul JenkinsManning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 316: \\"With Peter Parker: Spider- Man coming to a close in August [2003], writer Paul Jenkins once again took up his seat behind the computer to document Spider-Man's life.\\" (except #23‚Äì26, by Samm Barnes). The book's primary pencillers were Humberto Ramos and Mark Buckingham. The comic included the storyline Spider-Man: Disassembled in which Spider-Man met a new enemy called the Queen who wanted him as her mate. Her kiss caused him to slowly mutate into a giant spider who metamorphosed into human form with enhanced strength and agility, along with organic webbing and a psychic link with insects and arachnids. This comic also included the sequel to \\"Sins Past\\", \\"Sins Remembered\\", in which Peter went to Paris to meet Sarah Stacy and resolved the issues between them. Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures was a title published by Panini Comics in the United Kingdom from November 1995 to September 2005, although the Adventures portion of the title was often dropped from the cover page. It featured a mix of reprinted American material, as well as originally produced British material. Spectacular was aimed at a younger audience than Panini's other Spider-Man reprint title Astonishing Spider-Man and was loosely based on the continuity of the 1990s animated series. Volume 3 (2017) Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man (vol. 3) was published from June 2017 to December 2018. After the first six issues, the series reverted to legacy numbering with issue #297 as part of the line-wide Marvel Legacy relaunch. The series' original creative team had Chip Zdarsky as writer, with Adam Kubert providing the artwork. Notable recurring characters included Teresa Durand, J. Jonah Jameson, Johnny Storm, and original character Rebecca London. Various issues as well as the Annual were illustrated by guest artists; Kubert's final issue as artist was #307, excluding covers. Zdarsky left the series with issue #310. The series ended with issue #313, the final three issues being a tie-in to the Spider-Geddon event written by Sean Ryan.

Diodorus assigns him a rule of thirty-five years, but it appears that his rule of Cius was interrupted during that period. What circumstances led to his expulsion or subjection are unknown; nothing is heard of him until his death in 302 BC. However, it appears that he had submitted to the Macedonian Antigonus, who, to prevent him from joining the league of Cassander and his confederates, arranged for his assassination in Cius. According to Lucian, he was at least eighty-four years of age at the time of his death, which makes it likely that he is the same person as the Mithridates, son of Ariobarzanes, who in his youth circumvented and put to death Datames. King Mithridates I of Pontus was his kinsman, although it is not known whether he was his son. Therefore, it is likely that he was the same Mithradates, son of Ariobarzanes prince of Cius, who is mentioned by Xenophon as having betrayed his father, and the same circumstance is alluded to by Aristotle. During the Satraps' Revolt in the 360s BC, Mithridates tricked Datames into believing in him. But in the end he arranged for Datames' murder in 362 BC. Similarly, Mithridates gave his own father Ariobarzanes of Phrygia over to his Persian overlord, so Ariobarzanes was crucified in 362 BC. Presumably he was not the same Mithridates who accompanied the younger Cyrus in c. 401 BC - there is no proof of this. Neither is he the Mithridates mentioned by Xenophon as satrap of Cappadocia and Lycaonia in the late 5th century BC. Between 362 and 337 BC the family fiefdom of Cius in Mysia was held by Ariobarzanes II (possibly Mithridates' brother).

In 2014, the Enviro400 was succeeded by the updated Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC, and production of the classic Enviro400 ceased in 2018. The Enviro400 is available both as an integral bus and as a standalone bodywork and chassis. The Enviro400 chassis replaced the Dennis Trident 2 (and continued to be badged as the Trident for a time) and was formerly available with East Lancs Myllennium Lolyne and Optare Olympus bodywork; the Enviro400 body replaced the Alexander ALX400 and Plaxton President designs and was sold on Scania N230UD, Volvo B7TL and Volvo B9TL chassis. First generation (2005‚Äì2010) The first production Enviro400, Stagecoach 19000 Spirit of London, new in 2005, photographed in 2014 Although,The first Enviro400 was delivered to Stagecoach London in December 2005 to replace the Alexander ALX400-bodied Dennis Trident 2 that was destroyed in the 7 July 2005 bombings, with the replacement bus being named the \\"Spirit of London\\" as a result, the first Enviro400s ever ordered were by Metroline, another bus company in London. They ordered The first ever batch of the new, striking, slim design buses was placed in December 2005 and later became a fleet of over 500 Buses. The Enviro400 was originally launched as an integral product. Soon after launch, the Enviro400 chassis became available with East Lancs Myllennium Lolyne and Optare Olympus bodywork. As well as an integral bus, the Enviro400 body was available on Scania N-series chassis. The vast majority of N-series Enviro400s built were of the N230UD variant, which sold well with Stagecoach Group. Additionally, two N-series Enviro400s were built on the more powerful N280UD variant of the chassis, both for Express Motors of Porthmadog. As well as the Scania N-series, a single Enviro400 was constructed on Volvo B7TL chassis before this chassis was succeeded by the Volvo B9TL, on which more examples of the Enviro400 were bodied. Second generation (2008‚Äì2018) A second generation Enviro400 operated by First Greater Manchester Alexander Dennis released the second generation Enviro400 at Euro Bus Expo in 2008, with the main external visual differences being the incorporation of a line of white LED daytime running lights underneath the headlights in the main front light clusters, redesigned front bumpers and the relocation of the offside emergency exit door. The facelift coincided with the introduction of a Euro 5 compliant drivetrain for the Enviro400. The Trident moniker on the chassis plates was largely dropped not long afterwards, but the Trident 2 name was retained on Enviro400s built for Hong Kong. The second generation Enviro400 was largely superseded by the Enviro400 MMC in 2016, but in the same year Alexander Dennis developed a low-height Enviro400 with Enviro400 MMC-style front and rear specifically for Hong Kong market. Production of Enviro400 ceased in 2018. Operations Globally, more than 6,000 integral Enviro400s have been sold as of January 2016. =United Kingdom= London operator Metroline was the first company to order the Enviro400, with the first of 28 entering service in January 2006. One dual door demonstrator, named \\"Spirit of London\\", was delivered to Stagecoach London to replace the Dennis Trident destroyed during 7 July 2005 London bombings and a single door demonstrator was delivered to the then Travel West Midlands for evaluation. Both prototypes were exhibited at Coach & Bus Live 2005 in the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, UK and then entered service in January 2006. The Enviro400 had sold well in London with a number of operators, such as Travel London and London General (which received the first Euro IV-engined Enviro400 in May 2006), operating these buses. It is also popular with Stagecoach, which placed its first order of 130 low-height models in February 2006, later followed by another 389 buses with Euro IV/V engine. Arriva also received Enviro400s for its UK operations, Arriva Merseyside relaunched its Wirral - Liverpool 'Cross River' services with a batch of 23 in January 2009. A further batch of 12 was allocated to Bootle depot in September 2009 originally for the cross-Liverpool trunk service 60 linking Bootle with Aigburth. However a much larger order of 128 Enviro400s was placed by Arriva for its Merseyside division from the Autumn of 2014 onwards with significant numbers in service at Bootle, Green Lane, St Helens, Southport and Speke depots. On 13 October 2006, Solent Blue Line received a Volvo B7TL/Enviro400 meeting the Euro III emission standard, with the interior in Wilts & Dorset livery. This remains a one-off as all subsequent Enviro400s on Volvo chassis were built on the B9TL chassis. An Arriva demonstrator was shown at Euro Bus Expo in 2006 to the latter standard. East Yorkshire Motor Services took delivery of five Enviro400-bodied Volvo B9TL in December 2007, which entered service in January 2008. London General also received three Enviro400-bodied Volvo B9TLs in October 2008, which are being evaluated against integral Enviro400s and Wright Eclipse Gemini-bodied Volvo B7TL/B9TLs that are extensively featured in Go-Ahead's London Central/General fleets. Stagecoach announced on 28 February 2007 that it had ordered 25 Enviro400s with Scania N230UD chassis, which were subsequently delivered in early 2008. These were followed by another 56 for delivery in 2009, 100 for 2009/10, 100 for 2010/11, 91 for 2011/12 and 57 for 2012/13. Oxford Bus Company and Wilts & Dorset also received some examples. A hybrid version, the Enviro400H, entered service with a number of operators including Metroline, East Yorkshire Motor Services, National Express West Midlands, Reading Buses, Stagecoach London, Lothian and First Glasgow. In 2008, one Enviro400 was built for the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Paralympic Games as a handover bus. In 2012, Southern Vectis received 20 for school contracts on the Isle of Wight. These were delivered during late December 2012 and early January 2013 and entered service on a wide variety of school services on the island from 7 January 2013. Southern Vectis then proceeded to order another 16 Enviro400s to be used on public routes, mostly route 9, with the first six going to Oxford Bus Company for a few months. Ten of these buses have been delivered and on 3 January 2014, they commenced operating. Between 2014 and 2015 Arriva North West received a total of 128 integral Enviro400s for a number of services on Merseyside - with 28 arriving in 2014 and the remainder being delivered between January and July 2015. Arriva Buses Wales received a total of 29 high specification Enviro400s between June 2014 and March 2015 for deployment on two new Sapphire services between Rhyl and Llandudno and Chester and Connah's Quay respectively. Stagecoach is currently receiving a total of 76 Enviro400s for services with Stagecoach London, Stagecoach North West and Stagecoach South West. =Ireland= Irish state run operator Dublin Bus was the first bus operator to order the Volvo B9TL-based Enviro400, ordering 50 with the first of these entering service on 14 August 2007, later followed by another 50. =Hong Kong= A Kowloon Motor Bus Enviro400 in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. NWFB in Hong Kong. In 2009, Kowloon Motor Bus and Citybus of Hong Kong received two (one for each operator) air-conditioned Enviro400 for evaluation, both of which entered service in February 2010. Citybus introduced one more in July 2010. In November 2010, Alexander Dennis had confirmed an extra order of 38 Enviro400s from Citybus at the press conference of Euro Bus Expo 2010 held in Birmingham, UK; these buses entered service in 2011. A further order of 20 Enviro400s had been placed and these buses started to enter service in 2013. MTR Corporation also ordered nine Enviro400s for MTR Bus service, these buses entering service in 2012. Two more Enviro400s entered service in 2018. Kowloon Motor Bus received a further 50 Enviro400s between 2012 and 2013. New World First Bus ordered 60 low-height Enviro400s, these entered service in 2016 and 2017. New Lantao Bus ordered 14 low-height Enviro400s, which are similar to New World First Bus' batch. They entered service from October 2018 and have served route 3M since January 2019. =North America= Open Loop New York Enviro400 open top bus in New York The Enviro400 was introduced to North America exclusively as an open-top bus for sightseeing purposes. It is not available as a public transport vehicle, unlike the similar Alexander Dennis Enviro500. On 11 November 2010, Alexander Dennis announced it had received an order for 10 Enviro400s from Coach USA subsidiary Twin America, in New York. Specifications=Internal layout= Upper deck of the Enviro400 The Enviro400 features an innovative seating layout that maximises use of seating space on the lower deck by placing two forward-facing moulded seats onto the front nearside wheelarch box with a small luggage shelf on the rear half, and also (on full-height models) a single forward-facing moulded seat on the front off-side wheelarch hub between the driver's partition and the staircase. =Powertrain= The engine is a six-cylinder Cummins driving through a Voith or ZF automatic transmission. The maximum speed is . A hybrid-electric version of the powertrain was also available.

Calendar Man is known for committing crimes that correspond with holidays and significant dates. He often wears costumes to correlate with the date of the designated crime. In his debut, the character was presented as a joke villain, but in later years, writers developed Calendar Man as a dark, disturbed serial killer that toys with Batman. Publication history Calendar Man first appeared in Detective Comics #259 (Sept. 1958) and was created by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff. He returned after twenty years to plague Batman again in Batman #312 (June 1979). Fictional character biography=Criminal career= Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders. He next appears in Batman #312 (June 1979), in which his crimes are based on the days of the week, and his costumes reflect the Norse and Roman gods they were named for, e.g. Saturn. Calendar Man fires an ultrasonic sound weapon at Batman, nearly killing him. While Batman recuperates, Calendar Man commits crimes on Friday and Saturday. He plans to leave Gotham City on a train called the Western Sun Express on Sunday, knowing that the police would be waiting for him to attempt to steal an artifact of the Egyptian God of the Sun, Ra. Batman captures him at the train station before he boards. This issue also marked the first appearance of his most commonly known \\"calendar cape\\" costume. His next appearance in Batman #384-385 (June‚ÄìJuly 1985) and Detective Comics #551 (June 1985), sees the Calendar Man at the onset of the Crisis being used as a pawn of the Monitor in an attempt to find an assassin to eliminate Batman. In this instance, the Calendar Man's theme is holidays, and he attempts to use the young Jason Todd, as Robin, as the Batman's Achilles' heel, with the promise of his demise on the first day of Spring. Ultimately, however, Robin himself captures the villain. His best-known modern appearance is in the miniseries Batman: The Long Halloween, where he is portrayed as a Hannibal Lecter-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for Holiday, a serial killer who uses holidays as his modus operandi. Like Lecter in the novels of Thomas Harris, Calendar Man knows who the killer is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, Batman: Dark Victory, in which he impersonates deceased mobster Carmine Falcone in an effort to drive his children, Alberto and Mario, insane. When Calendar Man (as Carmine) tries to get Alberto to kill himself, however, the younger Falcone detects the ruse; Alberto knows that his father abhorred suicide, and thus figures out that Calendar Man is manipulating him. At the end of the story arc, Falcone's daughter Sofia Falcone Gigante beats him to a pulp as revenge for his role in her father's death. In both stories, Calendar Man is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; he fears that he is being forgotten. Calendar Man teams up with Catman and Killer Moth as part of The Misfits, a group of villains trying to prove themselves in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #7‚Äì9 (1992‚Äì1993). Also, he is among the Arkham Asylum inmates freed by Bane in Batman: Knightfall, but he is easily recaptured by Power Girl shortly after his escape. In Team Titans #14 (Nov 1993) Calendar Man and several other villains whose crimes center around time-based motifs, including Time Commander, fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.Team Titans #14 (Nov 1993) Calendar Man appears in \\"All the Deadly Days\\", a story in 80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition #3 (July 2000), in which he has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition #3 (July 2000) He makes an appearance in the alternate reality story \\"Superman: Arkham\\" (beginning in Superman Vol. 2 #160), which was also written by Jeph Loeb.Superman Vol. 2 #160 Calendar Man appears in the series Harley Quinn, as an inside informant to the title character.

His talents aid him as he pursues his obsession with quirks of the calendar, carefully planning and theming his crimes around holidays, weekdays and the seasons. Calendar Man is also an experienced hand- to-hand combatant, although his main reason for his success is his intelligence. In his latest incarnation, as written by Scott Snyder and Tom King in the pages of the Batman Rebirth special (June 2016), the Calendar Man now ages with the seasonal weather of Gotham City. Every spring he is reborn, with his DNA altered, but retains his memories, and then ages rapidly until winter when he dies, only to be reborn again the next spring by crawling from the husk of his own corpse.

Over the week it took Batman to defeat all of the creatures, Calendar Man had kidnapped a newborn baby. He then gave the exhausted Batman a list of names and told him that those people had been poisoned and had 24 hours to live. He instructed Batman to save them all and then return to him. If Batman failed to save all of the people on the list or brought any of his allies with him when he returned, Calendar Man would execute the baby.Batman: Arkham Knight #30 The listed citizens were saved but before Batman returned as ordered, Scarecrow visited Julian to dissuade him of his attempt to kill Batman.

The episode \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" introduces Jane Cartwright, who is an amalgamation of Jane Doe and Calendar Girl. She is depicted as a shapeshifter who is deluded into thinking her face is disfigured and therefore wears a mask, while in reality she is actually normal looking. In an homage to the end of \\"Mean Seasons\\", Jane's mask is at one point torn away, whereon she tries to hide her face in panic and yells to not look at her. Also, like in Calendar Girl's appearance on The New Batman Adventures, Harvey Bullock is ultimately responsible for unmasking her at the end of the episode, as he convinces her to reveal her actual face in front of him. Animation * A female variation of the character named Calendar Girl appears in The New Batman Adventures episode \\"Mean Seasons\\", voiced by Sela Ward. She wears a mask due to mental scars (physically, she is still perfect) and plans her crimes around the Four Seasons, with a different costume and weapons corresponding to each season. * Calendar Man appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Legends of the Dark-Mite!\\" voiced by Jim Piddock. When Bat-Mite wants to summon a villain for Batman to fight, the Dark Knight tricks him into summoning Calendar Man, then secretly tells the confused villain to play along and pretends to knock him out. Displeased, Bat-Mite uses his reality-warping powers to upgrade the villain into Calendar King and gives him the power to conjure monsters and henchmen themed after various holidays (including Jack O'Lantern monsters, Santa Claus-themed bikers, uber-patriotic Uncle Sams, and Mutant Easter Bunnies). After the henchmen and Calendar King are defeated, Bat-Mite restores him to normal and sends him away. He was later seen in \\"Mayhem of the Music Meister\\" as an inmate of Arkham Asylum. In \\"A Bat Divided\\", Calendar Man is seen hanging out with the bad guys at a bar until Firestorm and three Batmen show up. * Calendar Man appears in the DC Universe series Harley Quinn, voiced by Alan Tudyk. He is married to Debbie Day and is the father of a young boy. In the pilot episode \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", Calendar Man is seen among the inmates who escape Arkham Asylum when Poison Ivy causes a prison riot. He also plays a small role in Ivy's conversations with Harley, during which he remembers how many days Harley spent waiting for the Joker to spring her out of Arkham Asylum. In the episode \\"L.O.D.R.S.V.P.,\\" Calendar Man is seen as a member of the Legion of Doom. =Film= * Calendar Man appears in The Lego Batman Movie.

This version of Calendar Man is somewhat obese, has a slightly shorter right leg (with a brace and platform shoe), and features the calendar tattoos on his head seen in Batman: Dark Victory (although here they more resemble scars). Calendar Man had been occupying the Solomon Wayne Courthouse trapping anyone who entered and killing them on the next holiday. Just before the game begins, Two-Face and his minions capture the courthouse and lock Calendar Man in a cell in the basement. Calendar Man is featured in a similar manner as in Batman: The Long Halloween, talking to Batman through a glass cell. If the player speaks with him on certain holidays (New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, April Fools' Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Independence Day, the Feast Day of Saint Roch, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day), he will relate a story about a crime he committed on that specific day. If the player hears all twelve stories, Calendar Man will have escaped leaving one of Two-Face's minions hanging dead from the ceiling of his cell. If the player sets the date of the gaming console as December 13, 2004 (Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios was founded in December 2004) and visits Calendar Man, he will speak unique dialogue about his origins with Batman, concluding with, \\"I was there at your beginning, and I will be there at your end.\\" If the player visits Calendar Man as Catwoman, he will bring up an incident involving both her and the Falcone family and will imply that Carmine Falcone might be Catwoman's father. ** Calendar Man makes a cameo appearance in Batman: Arkham Origins. During Black Mask's siege on Blackgate Penitentiary on Christmas Eve, he is about to be executed for his crimes. The crime lord lets him go, however, appreciating letting him go on a holiday. It is heavily implied that this directly leads to his murder of Judge Harkness, as recounted on Arkham City. ** Batman: Arkham Knight features another cameo appearance by Calendar Man. When Batman's identity is revealed, Bruce Wayne arrives at Wayne Manor, which explodes shortly after; Calendar Man can be seen in the crowd outside the manor. This alludes to Calendar Man's promise in Arkham City where he says he will be there at Batman's end. It is revealed in a Gotham City Stories that Calendar Man had a plan in place to strike on Halloween, but he had to abort it thanks to Scarecrow. * Calendar Man appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced by Jim Pirri. =Musicals= * Calendar Man was featured in StarKid Productions' production of Holy Musical B@man!, where he showed up at T.G.I.

Being both Lord High Constable and Lord High Steward of Sweden, he was a notable figure in the 17th century Sweden. Magnus Brahe, a son of Per Brahe the Elder and Beata Stenbock and nephew of queen dowager Catherine Stenbock, was born at Tynnels√∂ Palace on 25 September 1564. He was the brother of Erik Brahe (1552‚Äì1614), Gustaf Brahe (1558‚Äì1615), Margareta Brahe (1559‚Äì1638), Sigrid Brahe and Abraham Brahe (1569‚Äì1630). He became a chamberlain of King Sigismund in 1590. Four years later, he left Sigismund and started to support Sigismund's cousin Duke Carl, who was an enemy of Sigismund and challenged the king for the throne. Brahe received various important assignments from Duke Carl, and eventually, in 1602, Brahe became Lord High Constable (Swedish: riksmarsk) and a member of the Swedish Privy Council. Brahe's older brothers had supported Sigismund which led to them losing the Visingsborg County. Having been a trustful supporter of Duke Carl, who became regent of Sweden in 1599 and king 1604, Brahe was declared Count of Visingsborg instead. When King Carl IX died and was succeeded by his son Gustavus Adolphus in 1611, Brahe remained a close confidant of the new king. The same year, he was appointed Lord High Steward (Swedish: riksdrots), becoming arguably the most prominent member of the Privy Council. Brahe married Countess Brita Stensdotter Leijonhufvud (1567‚Äì1611) at Gr√§fsn√§s Palace on 10 November 1594. They were parents of Ebba Brahe (1596‚Äì1674), who was the subject of king Gustav Adolphus' love. The countess died in 1611, and Brahe remarried at Str√∂msholm Palace on 18 October 1618, this time with Baroness Helena Bielke (1592‚Äì1651). In 1614, he was made president of Svea Court of Appeal, when this court was created. Brahe was knighted at the coronation of Gustavus Adolphus in October 1617. He died in Stockholm on 3 March 1633 due to an illness, which possibly was caused by the great grief Brahe felt when king Gustavus Adolphus died four months earlier. He was buried on 12 May the same year in V√§ster√•s Cathedral.

It also includes tours, events and activities related to architecture and culture. Heritage Open Days is England's largest festival of history and culture, bringing together over 2,500 organisations, 5,000 events and 40,000 volunteers. Heritage Open Days 2018 ran from 6-9 and 13-16 September. Heritage Open Days were established in 1994 as England's contribution to European Heritage Days, in which 49 countries now participate. Organised by volunteers (often property owners or managers), Heritage Open Days is one of England's biggest voluntary cultural events, attracting some 800,000 people every year. Until April 2009 the Civic Trust gave central co- ordination and a national voice to the event. Heritage Open Days does not cover all of the United Kingdom but operates only across England, except in London, which stages a separate event, Open House London, usually on the following weekend, the third weekend of September. In Scotland, Doors Open Days are held during September.  Heritage Open Days in 2018  The 2018 festival took place across two weekends in September 2018 for the first time.

John B. Turchin Dead‚Äî Hero of Wars of Two Nations Passes Away\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, June 20, 1901, p5; Although numerous books list the date of death as June 19, the report in the Tribune carried a dateline of June 19 from Anna, Illinois, and reported that the general \\"died last night at the Illinois Southern Hospital\\". better known by his Anglicised name of John Basil Turchin, was a Union army brigadier general in the American Civil War. He led two critical charges that saved the day at Chickamauga and was among the first to lead soldiers up Missionary Ridge. Early life and career Ivan Turchin was born on December 24, 1822 or January 30, 1822 into a Don Cossack in the Russian Empire. He entered the Russian Army in 1843, and graduated from the Imperial Military School in St. Petersburg in 1852. His father was a major in the Imperial Russian Army, which allowed him to gain entry into schools that led to his eventual commission to military service.Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 18.

Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 19. Following his graduation, Turchin acquired a post on the staff of Imperial Guards in St. Petersburg, under the command of Count F.V. Rudiger.Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 21‚Äì22. In May 1856, he married Nadezhda Lvov, the daughter of his commanding officer. Later that year, he and his wife immigrated to the United States, where he eventually settled in Chicago and worked for the Illinois Central Railroad.East, Ernest E. \\"Lincoln's Russian General\\", Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Vol. 52, No. 1, Lincoln Sesquicentennial (Spring, 1959), pp. 106‚Äì122 https://www.jstor.org/stable/40189912 Civil War Turchin joined the Union army at the outbreak of the war in 1861 and became the colonel of the 19th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Having led his regiment in Missouri and Kentucky, he soon found his unit under command of the newly organized Army of the Ohio under major general Don Carlos Buell. General Buell was impressed by Turchin and promoted him to command a brigade in the Army of the Ohio's Third Division, commanded by Brigadier General Ormsby M. Mitchel. Buell advanced southward into Kentucky and Tennessee in early 1862. When Buell headed west to support Grant at Shiloh, he left Mitchel to hold Nashville. Turchin urged Mitchel to move southward. Mitchel did so, but not because of Turchin. He took Huntsville, Alabama as part of a plan with the spy James Andrews to capture Chattanooga by cutting it off from Confederate reinforcements. Mitchel blocked them from the west by capturing Huntsville. Andrews was to block them from the south by burning bridges on the Western and Atlantic line. Unfortunately, Andrews failed as his raid evolved into an episode that became known as the Great Locomotive Chase. Nonetheless, Mitchell continued to occupy the line westward from Chattanooga throughout much of northern Alabama. The occupation of northern Alabama by this division of the Union Army led to attack by combined partisan and Confederate cavalry units. One such attack overran one of Turchin's regiments at Athens, Alabama. Frustration had been building among these Union soldiers for weeks over repeated attacks and Buell's clearly stated conciliatory policy of protecting the rights and property of Southerners. The reported involvement of local citizens in the rout at Athens and the humiliation suffered by the Union soldiers led to the sacking of the town when Turchin brought up reinforcements. According to University of New Mexico School of Law professor, Joshua E. Kastenberg, southern civilians had fired on Turchin's men. General Joseph Keifer, who served as an ad hoc judge advocate, stated \\"Turchin did not believe that war could be successfully waged by an invading army with its officers and soldiers acting as missionaries of mercy.\\" However, what may have been permissible in the Czar's armies, was certainly not in the Union Army. After reoccupying the town on May 2, 1862 Turchin assembled his men and reportedly told them: \\"I shut my eyes for two hours. I see nothing.\\" He did in fact leave the town to reconnoiter defensive positions, during which time his men ransacked the business district. The incident was controversial, and Lost Cause supporters vilified Turchin. The court-martial of Turchin was merited by his own admission. When word reached General Buell, a man much detested by the soldiers, he insisted on court- martialing Turchin. Turchin's court proceedings received national attention and became a focal point for the debate on the conduct of the war, related to the conciliatory policy as Union casualties in the war mounted. However, President Abraham Lincoln promoted Turchin to brigadier general before the court-martial was finished. Turchin received a hero's welcome upon his return to Chicago. Prominent figures called for the removal of Buell and a more aggressive conduct of the war such that it be brought to a swift end. Turchin was given command of a new brigade. He distinguished himself during the battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga, and in the Atlanta Campaign. Turchin's wife, known in the army as Madame Turchin, always stood by him and followed her husband on the field during his campaigns, witnessing the battles (as at Chickamauga and at the battle of Missionary Ridge), and writing the only woman's war diary of the military campaigns.Mcelligott, Mary Ellen. \\"A Monotony Full of Sadness\\": The Diary of Nadine Turchin, May, 1863-April, 1864\\", Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Feb., 1977), pp. 27‚Äì89 https://www.jstor.org/stable/40191347 The song \\"Turchin's got your mule\\" (stemming from the catchphrase \\"Here's your mule\\") was popular during the war, and its chorus is said to have been used by disheartened troopers as a derisive answer to General Braxton Bragg's endearments at Missionary Ridge.in Pollard's \\"The Lost Cause\\", p. 457 : \\"The day was shamefully lost. Gen. Bragg attempted to rally the broken troops; he advanced into the fire, and exclaimed, 'Here is your commander,' and was answered with the derisive shouts of an absurd catch-phrase in the army, 'Here's your mule'.\\" Turchin resigned from service in October 1864 after suffering heatstroke on the campaign. Court-martial On February 25, 1862 Buell issued a general order commanding his soldier \\"to protect the dignity of civilians.\\" As Professor Kastenberg has noted, while Turchin may not have been concerned with the law or war, he certainly was \\"on notice\\" of Buell's order.Joshua E. Kastenberg, Law in War, Law as War: Brigadier General Joseph Holt and the Judge Advocate General‚Äôs Department in the Civil War and Early Reconstruction, 231-233 Turchin, according to Kastenberg, had another problem at his court-martial. He requested Colonel Carter Gazlay to serve as his defense counsel, which was unusual since defense counsel was not a right at the time, and Gazlay faced his own court-martial for theft of Army property. Also, as Kastenberg points out, no less than Brigadier General James Garfield penned to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, \\"I cannot sufficiently give utterance to my horror of the ravages, outrages, that have been committed‚Ä¶ this town was, by Col Turchin, given up to pillage.\\" Turchin was ultimately spared an ignominious end because Buell has removed from command for his incompetence. There were three charges against Turchin. He was first accused of \\"neglect of duty.\\"Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 147. According to the recitations, there were over twenty or so instances in which Turchin supposedly ordered his soldiers to pillage and plunder Athens, Alabama, without any proper restraints to them.Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 147. Such instances included the sexual abuse of a servant [meaning slave] girl and the utter decimation of Bibles and testaments, ruthlessly destroyed and burned to pieces in a shop. Many of the other allegations against him included the plundering of ten stores and nine homes. \\"The rape served as the ultimate example of Turchin's failure\\" to control his own troops.Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 147. Under the second charge, Turchin failed to perform proper behavior expected out of an officer and a gentleman. That mattered to General Buell because under \\"Article 83 conviction meant automatic dismissal from the service and the end of Turchin's military career.\\" A specification added to this charge included a failure to pay the bill at a hotel in which he defrauded the innkeeper. The third charge was a failure to obey orders. It was believed that if Turchin was convicted on thar charge, it would send a clear message to the officers in the Army of the Ohio as a means of instilling discipline and order within the ranks of the army Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court-Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 147‚Äì148. When the court-martial began, Garfield had been under the impression that Turchin allowed the things that took place at Athens in accordance with the Muscovite custom.Bradley, George C. & Richard L. Dahlen, From Conciliation to conquest: The Sack of Athens & the Court- Martial of Colonel John B. Turchin (University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, 2006), page 158. Postbellum career and legacy Turchin returned to Chicago and worked for a time as a patent solicitor and civil engineer. He later was involved in real estate and the settlement of immigrants in southern Illinois. In 1900, he was awarded a pension under a private pension act approved by Congress. He suffered severe dementia, attributed to his heatstroke, and died penniless in an institution in Anna, Illinois, at the age of 79. He is buried next to his wife in the Mound City National Cemetery in southern Illinois.East, Ernest E. \\"Lincoln's Russian General\\", page 119.Leonard, Elizabeth, All the Daring of the Soldier: Women of the Civil War Armies. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1999. , page 141. Turchin has been portrayed by many in the South as a villainous figure for the so-called \\"Rape of Athens,\\" but his actions presaged those that other Union commanders, particularly William Tecumseh Sherman, would adopt in prosecuting total war against the Confederate States.

Career Stoner is probably best known for his book Science Speaks that discusses, among other things, Bible prophecies vis a vis probability estimates and calculations. The work is often cited in the field of Christian apologetics in regard to Bible prophecy. Professor Stoner's book became widely known when it was mentioned by Josh McDowell in his 1972 book Evidence that Demands a Verdict (revised as New Evidence that Demands a Verdict).  American Scientific Affiliation  Peter Stoner was a co-founder of the American Scientific Affiliation, a Christian organization that describes itself as \\"a fellowship of men and women in science and disciplines that relate to science who share a common fidelity to the Word of God and a commitment to integrity in the practice of science.\\" The foreword to Stoner's Science Speaks includes a partial endorsement from this body (covering the book's scientific content and prophecy probability calculations, but not addressing issues of Biblical exegesis or historical accuracy): they considered it \\"...in general, to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented\\" and the probability material presented in regard to prophecy. While the ASA includes members with a diverse range of attitudes towards science (theistic evolutionists, Intelligent Design advocates, Old-Earth creationists and Young-Earth creationists), Stoner himself was apparently an Old-Earth creationist.  Criticism  C. P. Swanson, reviewing Science Speaks in The Quarterly Review of Biology, wrote: \\"...the author has fallen into the commonest error of using only these facts which bolster his hypothesis, and of discarding or controverting those which do not. For example, his discussion of the theory of evolution is not only misleading; it displays an abysmal ignorance of recent evolutionary studies.\\" Various critics have taken issue with Stoner's interpretation of prophecy. Stoner's apologetic work did not receive critical attention until its inclusion in Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict and criticism of these claims tends to be addressed to McDowell rather than Stoner, with Stoner's name mentioned in passing. These criticisms against McDowell, Stoner and others include historical errors, claims regarding after-the-event authorship and/or tampering with Biblical prophecies, and disputed meanings of certain Biblical phrases. Others who disagree with specific claims made by Stoner include fellow Christians and secular historians: for instance, while Stoner says of Ezekiel's prophecy of the permanent destruction of Tyre \\"If Ezekiel had looked at Tyre in his day and had made these seven predictions in human wisdom, these estimates mean that there would have been only one chance in 75,000,000 of their all coming true. They all came true in the minutest detail\\", others claim that \\"the problem is that very little of this actually came to pass! In fact, it badly missed how history actually unfolded\\" and \\"The location of the city of Tyre is not in doubt, for it exists to this day on the same spot and is known as Sur.\\" However, it could still be argued that the boundaries of the ancient mainland city may have fallen within areas of the modern city not rebuilt in the present day.

It has both boarding and day students, and is located in Indian Springs Village, Shelby County, Alabama. History Indian Springs School was founded in 1952, endowed by Birmingham businessman Harvey G. Woodward, an alumnus of MIT. He died in 1930 and, in his will bequeathed the funds and instructions for creating the school. Woodward wanted to make the school available to all classes of students. He stipulated that the school could admit only Christian, white, boys, at a time when racial segregation was statewide in public facilities. He instructed that the school should use a holistic approach to learning (the school's motto is \\"Discere Vivendo\\", or \\"Learning through Living\\"). During its first years, the school was based in a working farm, where students carried out all the work needed, in addition to other studies. This element was soon eliminated. Indian Springs opened in 1952 with ten staff members and sixty students. The first director of the school was Louis \\"Doc\\" Armstrong. He made several changes to Woodward's original plans for the school. He developed a curriculum as a preparatory school and opened admissions to Jewish boys. When the school was founded, most private and public facilities were segregated in Alabama. When white parents were trying to avoid integrated public schools following the US Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), some sent their children to this school as a kind of segregation academy. The restrictions on enrollment were sequentially abolished by 1976, both by actions of the first director and to comply with the Supreme Court ruling and later federal civil rights legislation in 1964.\\"Where There's a Will: The Story of Indian Springs School\\" by Pam Jones, Alabama Heritage Magazine, Number 77, Summer 2005, 26-33. Campus Indian Springs School's campus is on in northern Shelby County, south of downtown Birmingham. Through the 1970s, the school was remote and surrounded by the woodlands of its campus, in addition to Oak Mountain State Park abutting its southern boundary. In the late 1970s, facing increasing debts and possible bankruptcy because of decreased enrollment, the school sold hundreds of acres surrounding the campus. Instruction takes place in seven academic buildings, which house 23 classrooms, a new science center, a concert hall, a theater, two student lounges, a college center, a technology lab, a 19,000-volume library, and special studios for chorus, art, photography, and drama. The athletic facilities include two gymnasiums, with two basketball courts, two volleyball courts, and two weight rooms. The campus has six new tennis courts, a competition soccer field, a baseball field, a softball field, a cross country track, and a practice field/track. A new organic orchard, Fertile Minds, complements the greenhouse in producing food for the students. In 2006, new dorms for both boys and girls were opened. For school year 2019-20, the tuition per year is $24,800 for day students, $45,900 for Alabama resident boarding students, $51,500 for non-Alabama domestic boarding students, and $58,200 for international board students. There are annual bus and meal plan fees that are not included. Tuition fluctuates yearly.

The main advantage over using active stabilization with propellants, gyroscopes or reaction wheels is the low use of power and resources. The idea is to use the Earth's gravitational field and tidal forces to keep the spacecraft aligned in the desired orientation. The gravity of the Earth decreases according to the inverse-square law, and by extending the long axis perpendicular to the orbit, the \\"lower\\" part of the orbiting structure will be more attracted to the Earth. The effect is that the satellite will tend to align its axis of minimum moment of inertia vertically. The first experimental attempt to use the technique on a human spaceflight was performed on September 13, 1966, on the US Gemini 11 mission, by attaching the Gemini spacecraft to its Agena target vehicle by a tether. The attempt was a failure, as insufficient gradient was produced to keep the tether taut. The technique was first successfully used in a near-geosynchronous orbit on the Department of Defense Gravity Experiment (DODGE) satellite in July 1967.Gunter's Space Page: DODGE It was first used for low Earth orbit and tested unsuccessfully for geosynchronous orbit in the Applications Technology Satellites ATS-2, ATS-4 and ATS-5 from 1966 until 1969. The lunar orbiter Explorer 49 launched in 1973 was gravity gradient oriented (Z axis parallel to local vertical). Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) used this method for 3-axis stabilization; yaw about the vertical axis was stabilized.Lesson learned from the Long Duration Exposure Facility. Stuckey. 1993 An example of gravity-gradient stabilization was attempted during NASA's TSS-1 mission in July 1992. The project failed because of tether deployment problems. In 1996 another mission, TSS-1R, was attempted but failed when the tether broke. Just prior to tether separation, the tension on the tether was about 65 N (14.6 lbs).NASA, TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board, Final Report, May 31, 1996 (accessed 7 April 2011) See also *Gravity gradiometry *Space tether *Tidal locking External links *NASA on ATS-2 *Gunter's Space Page on ATS 2, 4 and 5 *A new kind of Earth Sensor using a proof mass on a MEMS created by EPFL students  References  Category:Spacecraft attitude control Category:Spacecraft propulsion Category:Spacecraft components Category:Tidal forces ","title":"Gravity-gradient stabilization"},{"id":"2306420","text":"Œ≤-Hydride elimination is a reaction in which an alkyl group bonded to a metal centre is converted into the corresponding metal-bonded hydride and an alkene. The alkyl must have hydrogens on the Œ≤-carbon. For instance butyl groups can undergo this reaction but methyl groups cannot. The metal complex must have an empty (or vacant) site cis to the alkyl group for this reaction to occur. center The Œ≤-hydride elimination can either be a vital step in a reaction or an unproductive side reaction. The Shell higher olefin process relies on Œ≤-hydride elimination to produce Œ±-olefins which are used to produce detergents. Illustrative of a sometimes undesirable Œ≤-hydride elimination, Œ≤-hydride elimination in Ziegler‚ÄìNatta polymerization results in polymers of decreased molecular weight. In the case of nickel- and palladium-catalyzed couplings of aryl halides with alkyl Grignard reagents, the Œ≤-hydride elimination can lower the yield. The production of branched polymers from ethylene relies on chain walking, a key step of which is Œ≤-hydride elimination. In some cases, Œ≤-hydride elimination is the first in a series of steps. For instance in the synthesis of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 from ruthenium trichloride, triphenylphosphine and 2-methoxyethanol, an intermediate alkoxide complex undergoes a Œ≤-hydride elimination to form the hydride ligand and the pi-bonded aldehyde which then is later converted into the carbonyl (carbon monoxide) ligand. Avoiding Œ≤-hydride elimination Several strategies exist for avoiding Œ≤-hydride elimination. The most common strategy is to employ alkyl ligands that do not have any hydrogen atoms at the Œ≤ position. Common substituents include methyl and neopentyl. Œ≤-Hydride elimination is also inhibited when the reaction would produce a strained alkene. This situation is illustrated by the stability of metal complexes containing norbornyl ligands, where the Œ≤-hydride elimination product would violate Bredt's rule. center Bulky alkyl ligands, such as tert-butyl or trimethylsilyl, may prohibit the hydrogen atom from approaching a coplanar configuration with respect to the metal, and the Œ± and Œ≤ atoms. If the metal center does not have empty coordination sites, for example by the complex already having an 18-electron configuration, Œ≤-hydride elimination is not possible as well. In some cases, the coligands can impose geometries that inhibit Œ≤-hydride elimination. For the above example, the unwanted Œ≤-hydride elimination is prevented by using a diphosphine where the two phosphorus atoms are fixed apart in space. One way of doing this is to use a trans spanning ligand such as Xantphos. As these metal complexes traditionally form square planar geometries, no vacant site cis to the alkyl group can be formed. Hence the Œ≤-hydride elimination is prevented. (See trans-spanning ligand.) References Category:Organometallic chemistry ","title":"Beta-Hydride elimination"},{"id":"2306431","text":"Ronnie G. Barrett (born 1954) is an American firearms manufacturer, the founder of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing of Christiana, Tennessee and the designer of the first .50 caliber rifle Barrett M82 for civilian use.  Life and career  Barrett was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1954, and graduated from Murfreesboro Central High School.Barrett Firearms got its start on the dining-room table, Nashville Business Journal, March 14, 2008 He started his career in 1972 as a professional photographer. In 1982, while he owned a photography studio, he got his initial inspiration to create what would become the Barrett signature product. On January 1, 1982, when Barrett was photographing a river patrol gunboat on the Stones River near Nashville, Tennessee, he created an award-winning picture that made him start thinking about the .50 caliber cartridge because of two Browning machine guns mounted prominently on that boat. Since no commercially available .50 caliber rifle existed at that time, he decided to make a semi-automatic weapon. With no background in manufacturing or engineering, Barrett sketched a cross- sectioned, full-size rifle, adding different components to it. Once he decided on the concept, he approached some machine shops with his drawings. They told him that if his ideas were any good, someone smarter would have already designed it. However, this did not diminish his determination. A few days later, Bob Mitchell, a tool and die maker and machinist in Smyrna, Tennessee, agreed to help. After their regular job responsibilities, the men would start working on Barrett‚Äôs ideas, sometimes laboring together all night in a one-bay garage using a small mill and lathe. Barrett also found support from a sheet metal fabricator who allowed him to visit the owner‚Äôs shop and work directly with one employee, Harry Watson. The resulting gun was the shoulder-fired Barrett rifle, which was created in less than four months. While fine-tuning the first prototype rifle, Barrett began designing a second prototype that featured an improved and sleek exterior and other improvements learned from the first prototype. He made a video of the first prototype being fired, then prepared the second prototype so it would sit on a table. He displayed the latter at a Houston, Texas, gun show where three people gave him deposits to make a rifle for them. With a limited amount of money, Barrett set up a small shop at his residence in a gravel-floored garage. He began by building a batch of 30 rifles, mainly because the two wooden gun racks he made in his father‚Äôs cabinet shop held 15 rifles each. Ronnie Barrett Top 10 Award Using his hand- drawing of the new rifle, he placed an advertisement in Shotgun News and soon sold-out the first batch. Barrett was contacted by the CIA who purchased a number of rifles for the Afghan Mujahideen for use in their war against the Soviet Union. Barrett married former Tennessee State Rep.

The organization includes in its mission the promotion and preservation of the heritage and culture of Norway and other Nordic countries and to provide life insurance and other financial products to its members. The organization is classified as a non-profit 501(c)(8) fraternal beneficiary society. Currently, the Sons of Norway has nearly 400 lodges in the United States, Canada and Norway.

The organization was founded by 18 members on January 16, 1895, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to insure each other when they were unable to secure life insurance on their own.Carl G. O. Hansen, History of Sons of Norway, an American Fraternal Organization of Men and Women of Norwegian Birth or Extraction. Minneapolis, MN: Sons of Norway Supreme Lodge, 1944. Membership was originally open to males of Norwegian descent between the ages of 20 and 50 who were capable of giving proof of being morally upright, in good health, and capable of supporting a family. A second lodge was established in South Minneapolis in 1899 and a third was founded in the northeastern section of the city in 1900.Carl H. Chrislock, Ethnically Challenged: The Upper Midwest Norwegian-American Experience in World War I. Northfield, MN: Norwegian- American Historical Association, 1981; p. 19. The Minneapolis model quickly spread and by the end of 1900 some 12 lodges of the organization had been established in cities and towns with substantial Norwegian-American populations across the American Upper Midwest. From its origins in Minnesota, the organization spread to both coasts. A lodge of the order was established as far away as the then American territory of Alaska. In 1903 a group in Seattle asked the Midwestern group for a charter, however, they did not wish to have compulsory insurance for the members, which was anathema to the parent order. The Seattle group organized as Leif Erikson Lodge No. 1 in spite of the Midwest lodges and with other West Coast lodges set up the Grand Lodge of the Sons of Norway of the Pacific Coast. The two orders quarreled until they held a convention in Superior, Wisconsin in June 1909, merging the next year.Hildegarde M. Strom, \\"A Brief History of Sons of Norway,\\" Sons of Norway, www.sofn.com/ Note that other sources indicate the two groups merged in 1912. See: Schmidt, Fraternal Organizations, p. 322.

Seiler (2012), I√±upiatun Eskimo Dictionary (sometimes spelled qiveut)) is the inner wool of the muskox. In Inuktitut the same word can be used to refer to the down feathers of birds. The muskox has a two-layered coat, and qiviut refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The muskox sheds this layer of wool each spring. Qiviut is plucked from the coat of the muskox during the molt or gathered from objects the animals have brushed against; unlike sheep, the animals are not sheared. Much of the commercially available qiviut comes from Canada, and is obtained from the pelts of muskoxen after hunts. In Alaska, qiviut is obtained from farmed animals or gathered from the wild during the molt. Properties Qiviut is stronger and warmer than sheep's wool,Qiviut.com and softer than cashmere wool. Wild muskoxen have qiviut fibers approximately 18 micrometres in diameter. Females and young animals have slightly finer wool.\\"Fiber characteristics of qiviut and guard hair from wild muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). Rowell et al. 2001, Journal of Animal Science, 79:1670-1674 Unlike sheep's wool, it does not shrink in water at any temperature, but this means that it also is not useful for felting. It is most commonly used for hats and scarves, and is among the softest as well as warmest wools. It is very expensive; a high quality knitted scarf can cost more than $300 U.S.,Scarves at the Oomingmak Cooperative website but will last over 20 years with good care. Production and processing Qiviut sweater worth about $900 Canadian An adult muskox can produce of qiviut a year. Qiviut is produced by the muskox's secondary hair follicles, which are not associated with sebaceous glands, and therefore is a much drier fiber than wool, having only about 7 percent oils. The hair follicle density is very high (approximately ) and qiviut is shed in a tightly synchronized spring molting period. The qiviut will loosen from the animal's skin and pull away slightly, creating a \\"spectacled\\" look around the eyes and becoming visible all over the body at the surface of the pelt. At this stage of the molt, the undercoat is a short but relatively uniform distance from the skin. This lends itself to combing the qiviut from the animal in a single large sheet. If not combed, the qiviut will begin to fall out in clumps or be rubbed off by the animal, and may be plucked off the ground or bushes, but qiviut collected this way is of lower quality and requires more cleaning. At the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station (LARS), a modified bison crush is used to gently but firmly hold the muskoxen in place, and the pelt combed out using a long-toothed comb or hair pick. After the fleece is removed, it is cleaned by hand, removing vegetation and other foreign matter, and then dehaired. Dehairing is the removal of intermediate hairs (greater than in diameter). Dehairing is accomplished by carding as one would cashmere. Mechanical carding can cause breakage and weaken and roughen the qiviut. Because the pelt is combed rather than shaved, very few guard hairs come out with the qiviut using this method. Pelts from hunted animals are shaved, so the dehairing process in this case is more laborious. After dehairing, the qiviut may be cleaned again, if necessary. The raw, cleaned qiviut is spun and then the yarn is washed. Natural qiviut is soft grayish brown in color, but it takes dye well and can be found for sale in myriad colors. Bleaching weakens the fiber, however, so many spinners and knitters recommend using only overdyed natural qiviut, which has darker, more subdued colors.\\"The Muskox: wooly and warm in a northern fiber industry.\\" Deirdre Helfferich. 2007, Agroborealis 39:1 Domestication of the muskox was begun with the Musk Ox Project, headed by John J.

He was the co-founder of two non- denominational evangelical seminaries (Veritas International University and Southern Evangelical Seminary). He held a Ph.D. in philosophy from Loyola University and made scholarly contributions to the subjects of classical Christian apologetics, systematic theology, the history of philosophy, philosophy of religion, Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, Biblical inerrancy, Bible difficulties, ethics, and more. He was the author, coauthor, or editor of over 90 books and hundreds of articles. One of the primary architects of the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, Geisler was well noted within the United States evangelical community for his stalwart defense of Biblical inerrancy. Education Geisler's education included a Th.B. (1964) from William Tyndale College, B.A. in philosophy (1958) and M.A. in theology (1960) from Wheaton College, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Loyola University. He had additional graduate work at Wayne State University, the University of Detroit, and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Biography Norman Leo Geisler was born on July 21, 1932, in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. He attended a nondenominational Evangelical church from age nine but was not converted until the age of eighteen. He immediately began attempting to share his faith with others in various evangelistic endeavors‚Äîdoor-to-door, street meetings, and jail service, rescue missions, and Youth for Christ venues. Some of his conversations forced him to realize that he needed to find better answers to the objections he was hearing. He subsequently earned two bachelor's degrees, two master's degrees, and a Doctorate. Geisler's decades of degree work overlap a professorial career begun at Detroit Bible College (1963‚Äì66) and continued at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (1969‚Äì70) and Trinity College (1970‚Äì71). He was later Chairman of Philosophy of Religion at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (1970‚Äì79) and Professor of Systematic Theology at Dallas Theological Seminary (1979‚Äì88). In 1981, Geisler testified in \\"the Scopes II trial\\" (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education). Duane Gish, a creationist, remarked: \\"Geisler was. . . the lead witness for the creationist side and one of its most brilliant witnesses. His testimony, in my view (I was present during the entire trial), effectively demolished the most important thrust of the case by the ACLU. Unfortunately, in my opinion, no testimony, and no effort by any team of lawyers, no matter how brilliant, could have won the case for the creationist side.\\"Geisler, Norman. Creation & the Courts: Eighty Years of Conflict in the Classroom and the Courtroom. (Crossway Books, 2007) Geisler was formerly a president of the Evangelical Theological Society but left the ETS in 2003, after it did not expel Clark Pinnock, who advocated open theism.. Geisler also founded and was first president of The Evangelical Philosophical Society. Additionally, he was the founder and first president of the International Society of Christian Apologetics. In 1997, Geisler co-authored When Cultists Ask: A Popular Handbook on Cultic Misinterpretation. He contributed to The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism. In 2008, Geisler co-founded the Veritas Evangelical Seminary located in Santa Ana, California. The seminary offers master's degrees in theological studies, apologetics, biblical studies, and Divinity. Geisler served as Chancellor, Distinguished Professor of Apologetics and Theology, and occupant of the Norman L. Geisler Chair of Christian Apologetics. He retired from this post in May 2019. Personal Geisler was married to Barbara Jean, and together they had six children. He died of cerebral thrombosis at a hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina on July 1, 2019, 20 days before his 87th birthday. Geisler's funeral was held at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ravi Zacharias gave the eulogy. Outline of Geisler's apologetic system Geisler is known first and foremost as a classical Christian apologist. Between 1970 and 1990 he participated in dozens of public debates and gained a reputation as a defender of theism, biblical miracles, the resurrection of Jesus, and the reliability of the Bible. The first attempt to publish an outline of his apologetic method showed up in an appendix of his 1990 book When Skeptics Ask. The appendix is titled \\"Reasoning to Christianity from Ground Zero\\" and in it we see a high-level view of the holistic system of classical apologetics he had been developing over the years. The first outline contained fourteen points of argument:Geisler, N. L., & Brooks, R. M. (1990). When skeptics ask (p. 289). Wheaton, IL: Victor Books. # There are self- evident truths (e.g., \\"I exist,\\" \\"Logic applies to reality\\"). # Truth corresponds to reality. # Truth is knowable (all other views are self- defeating). # One can proceed from self-evident truths to the existence of God. ## The argument from Creation (proceeds from \\"I exist\\") ## The argument from morals (proceeds from \\"Values are undeniable\\") ## The argument from design (proceeds from \\"Design implies a designer\\") # God is a necessary Being (argument from being). # My existence is not necessary (evident from the definition of a necessary Being). # Therefore, theism is true (there is a necessary Being beyond the world who has created the contingent things in the world and intervenes in the world [chap. 3]). ## The objection from the problem of evil can be solved. ## The objection to miracles can be solved. # The Bible is a historically reliable document. ## History is an objective study of the past. ## There is great historical, archaeological, and scientific evidence to confirm the reliability of the Bible. (Corollary: The Bible gives a reliable record of the teaching of Jesus Christ.) # Jesus claimed to be both fully human and fully God. # He gave evidence to support this claim. ## The fulfillment of prophecy ## His miraculous and sinless life ## His resurrection # Therefore, Jesus is both fully human and fully God. # Whatever God teaches is true. # Jesus (God) taught that the Old Testament was the inspired Word of God and He promised the New Testament. # Therefore, both the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of God. The overview of his system was later streamlined slightly into a 12-point schema. As of 1999, it could be summarized as follows:Geisler, N. L. \\"Apologetics, Argument of\\", in The Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books. 1999 # Truth about reality is knowable. # Opposites cannot both be true (The Law of Noncontradiction). # It is true the theistic God exists. # If God exists, then miracles are possible. # Miracles performed in connection with a truth claim are acts of God to confirm the truth of God through a messenger of God. # The New Testament is historically reliable. # As witnessed in the New Testament, Jesus claimed to be God. # Jesus' claim to divinity was proven by miracles, especially the Resurrection. # Therefore, Jesus is God. # Because Jesus is God, whatever Jesus affirmed as true, is true. # Jesus affirmed that the Bible is the Word of God. # Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the Word of God and whatever is opposed to any biblical truth is false. These same twelve steps served as the framework for the chapters of the highly popular book I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an AtheistGeisler, N. L., & Turek, F. I Don't have Enough Faith to be an Atheist. Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books. 2004 in 2004 and for Geisler's 2012 e-book Twelve Points that Show Christianity is True. Theology Geisler was a conservative evangelical scholar who wrote a four-volume systematic theology. He defended the full inerrancy of the Bible, being one of the co-founders and framers of the \\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\\" (1978) and editor of the book Inerrancy (Zondervan, 1978). More recently, he co-authored Defending Inerrancy with William Roach (Baker, 2013). He also co-authored (with William Nix) General Introduction to the Bible (Moody Press, 1986) and From God to Us, revised (Moody, 2012). Geisler considered himself a \\"moderate Calvinist\\", as expressed in his book Chosen but Free (Harvest House, 2001) and Systematic Theology, in One Volume (Harvest House, 2012). On the Five Points of Calvinism, he believed: #Total depravity extends to the whole person but does not destroy the image of God in fallen human beings; #Election is unconditional from the standpoint of God's giving it and only one condition for humans receiving it‚Äîfaith; #The atonement is unlimited in its scope‚ÄîChrist died for all mankind‚Äîbut limited in its application to only the elect; #Grace is irresistible on the willing but does not force the unwilling; #All those who are regenerate will, by God's grace, persevere to the end and be saved. Ethics Geisler wrote two significant books on ethics: Christian EthicsChristian Ethics: Contemporary Issues and Options, 2nd Edition. Baker Academic. 1989, 2010. and The Christian Love Ethic. He provided his perspective on ethical options, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, biomedical issues, capital punishment, war, civil disobedience, sexual issues, homosexuality, marriage and divorce, ecology, animal rights, drugs, gambling, pornography, birth control, and more. Of the six major ethical systems (antinomianism, situationalism, generalism, unqualified absolutism, conflicting absolutism, and graded absolutism), Geisler advocated graded absolutism, which is a theory of moral absolutism which affirms that in moral conflicts we are obligated to perform the higher moral duty. Moral absolutism is the ethical view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them. Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but clarifies that a moral absolute, like \\"Do not kill\\", can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like \\"Do not lie\\". Graded absolutism is also called \\"contextual absolutism\\" but is not to be confused with situational ethics. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. That is why graded absolutism is also called the \\"greater good view\\", but is not to be confused with utilitarianismChristian Ethics, Chapter 4 (see also prima facie right). Geisler believed the American Revolution was not justified by the standards of either the Bible or just war theory. However, he was not a pacifist, believing that defensive wars are justified but revolutions are not.

It is also used for diabetic kidney disease, heart failure, and left ventricular enlargement. It is taken by mouth. It may be used alone or in addition to other blood pressure medication. Up to six weeks may be required for the full effects to occur. Common adverse effects include muscle cramps, stuffy nose, cough, high blood potassium and anemia. Severe adverse effects may include angioedema, low blood pressure, and kidney problems. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding. It is in the angiotensin receptor blocker family of medication. It works by blocking angiotensin II. Losartan was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the ninth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 51 million prescriptions. A version combined with hydrochlorothiazide is available and, in 2017, it was the 67th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than eleven million prescriptions. Medical uses Losartan is used for hypertension, including in people with left ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart muscle), and kidney dysfunction among type II diabetics. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. It is a suitable pharmacological agent for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria (>30 mg/24 hours) or proteinuria (>900 mg/24 hours). Although evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (due to both efficacy and cost), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in people under the age of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. One study demonstrated losartan was superior to atenolol in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3‚Äì6 weeks of starting losartan. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects for losartan in adults are upper respiratory infections, dizziness, and back pain. People with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease may experience diarrhea, fatigue, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, elevated potassium, chest pain, or allergic reaction. Losartan should not be taken by people who are diabetic and taking aliskiren. Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, losartan may injure the liver, although this effect appears to be rare. Electrolyte imbalances may occur in people taking losartan with kidney problems. Adverse outcomes do not differ by sex, age or race. =Pregnancy= In October 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning that losartan can cause fetal toxicity, and should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. Using losartan while pregnant could result in fetal injury or death. =Overdose= Overdosing would most likely result in decreased blood pressure, which could manifest as an increased heart rate, dizziness, feeling light headed, or loss of consciousness. Mice studies showed that lethality occurred at about 44 to 170 times the maximum recommended dose after the mice weight were adjusted. = Interactions = Losartan may have adverse interactions with phenobarbital, rifampin, or fluconazole, possibly inhibiting its blood pressure-lowering effects. =Contamination= Between November 2018, and September 2019, the FDA announced multiple recalls of tablets containing losartan by Sandoz, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Camber Pharmaceuticals, Legacy Pharmaceutical Packaging, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Vivimed Life Sciences, and Macleods Pharmaceutical Limited due to detection of one of the possible carcinogens N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-methylnitrosobutyric acid, or N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Mechanism of action left Losartan is a selective, competitive angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, reducing the end organ responses to angiotensin II. Losartan administration results in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac venous return (preload). All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including release of aldosterone, are antagonized in the presence of losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the angiotensin II feedback. Renin is released from the kidneys when there is reduced renal arterial pressure, sympathetic activation, or increased sodium delivery to the distal renal tubule. Renin then acts by converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II; angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and aldosterone release. Aldosterone serves to retain sodium from the distal renal tubule. Sodium retention ultimately results in increased blood pressure. Therefore, the use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists like losartan result in blocking the downstream effect of renin, angiotensin II, and ultimately decreasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists include losartan, valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and telmisartan. They all have the same mechanism of action and potentially inhibit the actions of angiotensin better than ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, because there are other enzymes than ACE that have the capability of producing angiotensin II. Losartan is a uricosuric. As a specific inhibitor of the urate transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), losartan blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more available in the bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because losartan can cause hyperkalemia, individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring by a physician.RxList. The Internet Drug Index. Clinical pharmacology of Cozaar. Retrieved January 6, 2014. Pharmacokinetics Losartan is well absorbed following oral administration and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism to produce the 5-carboxylic acid metabolite, designated as EXP3174. About 14% of an oral dosage is converted to this metabolite, which is long-acting (6 to 8 hr) and a noncompetitive antagonist at the AT1 receptor, contributing to the pharmacological effects of losartan. EXP3174 is 10-40 times more potent in blocking AT1 receptors than losartan. In addition, the binding to the target enzyme is pH-sensitive, and the negatively-charged tetrazole ring, which is similar in size to the negative carboxylic acid derivative, may contribute to the activity of the drug.Binding of losartan Losartan's bioavailability is about 33%. Metabolism is primarily by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Peak plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 occur about one hour and three to four hours, respectively, after an oral dose. Both losartan and EXP3174 are more than 98% bound to plasma proteins. Losartan is excreted in the urine, and in the feces via bile, as unchanged drug and metabolites. About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine, and about 6% is excreted in urine as the active metabolite. The terminal elimination half lives of losartan and EXP3174 are about 1.5 to 2.5 hours and 3 to 9 hours, respectively. Losartan and other angiotensin-receptor antagonists exhibit fetal toxicity and should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Chemistry Losartan is generally marketed as the (basic) potassium salt of the aromatized negatively charged tetrazole, called \\"losartan potassium\\".see negatively charged tetrazole structure  History  *Discovery and development of angiotensin receptor blockers  Dosing  The suggested initial dose of losartan for treatment of hypertension is 50 mg/day, and the usual maintenance dose range is 25‚Äì100 mg/day. There is limited data on what dosage is considered toxic in humans; toxicity would most likely result in decreased blood pressure and an increased heart rate. Research A hypothesis emerged in an opinion commentary published in March 2020, that AT1R blockers such as losartan may work to mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Competing hypotheses are that it will make the symptoms worse. A study of this question was started in March 2020.

The reaction of periodic acid oxidizes the vicinal diols in these sugars, usually breaking up the bond between two adjacent carbons not involved in the glycosidic linkage or ring closure in the ring of the monosaccharide units that are parts of the long polysaccharides, and creating a pair of aldehydes at the two free tips of each broken monosaccharide ring. The oxidation condition has to be sufficiently regulated so as to not oxidize the aldehydes further. These aldehydes then react with the Schiff reagent to give a purple-magenta color. A suitable basic stain is often used as a counterstain. ‚Ä¢ PAS diastase stain (PAS-D) is PAS stain used in combination with diastase, an enzyme that breaks down glycogen. ‚Ä¢ Alcian blue/periodic acid‚ÄìSchiff (AB/PAS or AB-PAS) uses alcian blue before the PAS step.  Uses  Gastric signet ring cell carcinoma histopathology, PAS stain Esophageal candidiasis, PAS stain Liver in glycogen storage disease, PAS stain PAS staining is mainly used for staining structures containing a high proportion of carbohydrate macromolecules (glycogen, glycoprotein, proteoglycans), typically found in e.g. connective tissues, mucus, the glycocalyx, and basal laminae. PAS staining can be used to assist in the diagnosis of several medical conditions: * Glycogen storage disease (versus other storage disorders). * Adenocarcinomas, which often secrete neutral mucins. * Paget disease of the breast. * Alveolar soft part sarcoma.(Ladanyi et al 2002 * Staining macrophages in Whipple's disease. * It can be used to diagnose Œ±1-antitrypsin deficiency if periportal liver hepatocytes stain positive. * Aggregates of PAS-positive lymphocytes are present in epidermis in Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, called Pautrier microabscesses. * Ewing sarcoma * Erythroleukemia, a leukemia of immature red blood cells. These cells stain a bright fuchsia. * Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. * Fungal infection, the cell walls of fungi stain magenta; this only works on living fungi. In contrast, Grocott's methenamine silver stain (GMS) will stain both living and dead fungal organisms. * It is used to identify glycogen in lung biopsy specimens of infants with pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG). * It can be used to highlight super cross-linked lipids inclusions in ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Presence of glycogen can be confirmed on a section of tissue by using diastase to digest the glycogen from a section, then comparing a diastase digested PAS section with a normal PAS section. The diastase negative slide will show a magenta staining where glycogen is present within a section of tissue. The slide that has been treated with diastase will lack any positive PAS staining in those locations on the slide PAS staining is also used for staining cellulose. One example would be looking for implanted medical devices composed of nonoxidized cellulose. If the PAS stain will be performed on tissue, the recommended fixative is 10% neutral-buffered formalin or Bouin solution. For blood smears, the recommended fixative is methanol. Glutaraldehyde is not recommended because free aldehyde groups may be available to react with the Schiff reagent, which may result in false positive staining.

He also wrote and directed two episodes of Logie-award winning crime drama Romper Stomper, and appeared earlier in his career as an actor in Shakespearean theater and several television productions including The Tribe and Being Eve, describing how his acting work \\"funded his early filmmaking\\". Early life Born in Wellington, New Zealand, but moving to Auckland at a young age, Napier Robertson grew up in Devonport and attended Takapuna Grammar School, where he first started acting in Shakespeare productions and musicals. His great-grandfather is actor Alan Napier, his uncle is actor Marshall Napier and his cousin is Marshall's daughter, actress Jessica Napier. He is also related to the author Charles Dickens. Early career He joined a local outdoor Shakespeare Theatre Company in his late teens, which he performed with for a number of years, often at the Pumphouse Theatre Amphitheatre. He has described this time with the company as his favorite period of acting. After this period he was cast in a number of local and international television shows which he acted in for the next few years, both in support and lead roles. He was first cast in Being Eve as Jared Preston, a wayward teenager at the titular Eve's school, then in Shortland Street, and Mercy Peak as Luke Bertram, an arsonist dealing with his mother's death by burning down local buildings until he is caught by the police. In 2002 he was cast for two seasons in UK show The Tribe, a post apocalyptic series about a virus that has wiped out all adults, leaving only young people to fight amongst each other. In 2004 he was cast for one season as a lead actor on US show Power Rangers Dino Thunder, playing Conner McKnight, a soccer player and the Red Ranger. The show was filmed in New Zealand and featured an almost entirely New Zealand cast, including friend and future film producer Tom Hern. Throughout this period he said he was less interested in acting, instead using the money from these shows to fund the short films he was writing and directing in his early twenties and purchase film equipment. Recent work In his mid twenties, Napier Robertson wrote and directed his first feature film, I'm Not Harry Jenson, with friends Tom Hern and Edward Sampson both taking roles as producers in the film. The film premiered at the 2009 New Zealand International Film Festival and was nominated for Best Picture at the 2009 AFTA Awards (New Zealand Film and TV Awards). It was picked up by Rialto Distribution for a New Zealand wide theatrical release from January to March 2010 to strong reviews, but low box office. =The Dark Horse= James Napier Robertson on stage with James Cameron In 2010 he started work on his second feature film, The Dark Horse, based on the life story of Genesis Potini, a MƒÅori chess player who suffered from severe bipolar. Napier Robertson stated he became very close friends with Potini, playing hundreds of games of chess with him while writing the screenplay. Napier Robertson has been an avid chess player since a young age, which he cited as one of the things that inspired him to make The Dark Horse. Cliff Curtis, James Cameron, James Napier Robertson appear at the U.S. premiere of The Dark Horse The Dark Horse premiered as the Opening Night film at the NZIFF Film Festival on 17 July 2014, and was released across New Zealand on 31 July. The film was a New Zealand box office hit, grossing $2 million and receiving unanimously rave reviews. The New Zealand Herald rated it 5 stars, calling it \\"a great, deeply affecting movie\\", with \\"brave, assured and layered directing\\" and praising the \\"towering performance of Cliff Curtis\\". A review on Radio New Zealand declared it to be \\"one of the greatest New Zealand films ever made\\". It premiered internationally at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Variety called it \\"exceptional...the most deserving cinematic export to emerge from New Zealand in years\\". The Hollywood Reporter said it was \\"certain to attract awards attention\\", and Indiewire graded it an 'A', praising it as \\"moving and incredibly humanistic\\". The European Premiere was held at the 2015 Rotterdam International Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best Film. It also won the Best Actor Award for Cliff Curtis at the 2014 Asia Pacific Awards, and six awards at the 2014 New Zealand Film Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. 2014 was dubbed the 'golden year' of New Zealand film. The Dark Horse was released worldwide in 2015, and was released theatrically in the United States in 2016 where it was presented by James Cameron. Personal life Napier Robertson has stated in interviews he has been a vegetarian since the age of four due to his love for animals, and has been a member of Greenpeace for most of his life. Animal advocacy group SAFE named him 'Hottest Vegetarian of 2014' alongside Academy Award winner Anna Paquin as a way of raising awareness for reducing animal cruelty. Napier Robertson is married with two young children a son born in 2016 and a daughter named Sophia who live with him in Auckland.

The inmates originally were German who were to supply labor for building V-2 rocket factories in man-made caves dug out of the Vosges Mountains. The prisoners lived in the cold, damp tunnels as they built them. The camp was expanded by the Nazis with the installation of a gas chamber in April 1943 and crematorium.

Developed from the Lockheed T-33, it was powered by one Allison J33 engine. Design and development Starting in 1949, the U.S. Navy used the Lockheed T-33 for land-based jet aircraft training. The T-33 was a derivative of the Lockheed P-80/F-80 fighter and was first named TO-2, then TV-2 in Navy service. However, the TV-2 was not suitable for operation from aircraft carriers. The persisting need for a carrier-compatible trainer led to a further, more advanced design development of the P-80/T-33 family, which came into being with the Lockheed designation L-245 and USN designation T2V. Lockheed's demonstrator L-245 first flew on 16 December 1953 and production deliveries to the US Navy began in 1956.Swanborough p. 297 Compared to the T-33/TV-2, the T2V was almost totally re-engineered for carrier landings and at-sea operations with a redesigned tail, naval standard avionics, a strengthened undercarriage (with catapult fittings) and lower fuselage (with a retractable arrestor hook), power-operated leading-edge flaps (to increase lift at low speeds) to allow carrier launches and recoveries, and an elevated rear (instructor's) seat for improved instructor vision, among other changes. Unlike other P-80 derivatives, the T2V could withstand the shock of landing on a pitching carrier deck and had a much higher ability to withstand sea water- related aircraft wear from higher humidity and salt exposure. Operational history The only version of the T2V was initially designated T2V-1 when it entered service, but was redesignated T-1A SeaStar under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system,the designation under which it would spend the majority of its career. The T-1A was replaced by the North American T-2 Buckeye but remained in service into the 1970s.

He and his followers were concerned about the environmental and social effects of the operation of the Panguna mine by Bougainville Copper, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. On 17 May 1990, Ona declared the independence of the Republic of Me'ekamui.\\"The Bougainville independence referendum: Assessing the risks and challenges before, during and after the referendum\\" by Jo Woodbury January 2015; Commonwealth of Australia It was not recognised internationally. In May 2004 Ona proclaimed himself \\"King of Me'ekamui.\\"Australian ABC television report While resisting the peace process and 2005 elections, Ona mostly stayed in a safe haven, where his BRA forces controlled territory. He died of malaria in his village. Secessionist leader Ona was at one time employed by Bougainville Copper at the mine, but he became increasingly critical of its operations' adverse effect on the environment and what he claimed was the low level of royalties paid the landowners. Most of the profits left Bougainville Island, but its society was disrupted by thousands of workers from Papua New Guinea, as well as Australians. From the mid-1980s, Ona and others challenged the leadership of the Panguna Landowners Association (PLA), claiming that they were not representing the interests of all the traditional landowners. By early 1988, Ona and his associates, including his cousin Pepetua Serero, had formed the New PLA, supported by both mineworkers and the traditional opponents of the Panguna mine, Damien Dameng's Me'ekamui Pontuku Onoring. The New PLA made a number of demands, including monetary compensation for the impacts of the mine, a 50 per cent share of mine revenue to the landholders, and a transfer of ownership to Bougainville. The PNG Government set up an independent inquiry which dismissed the claims about the environmental impact but was critical of other parts of the mine's operation. In response, Ona established the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA), which conducted numerous acts of sabotage against the mine including the destruction of the mine's power supply. The mine was closed by Bougainville Copper in May 1989. Ona rejected an initial compromise deal by Bougainville Copper and the PNG government. Ona became the acknowledged leader of the BRA after the death of Serero in 1989; Sam Kauona, a former soldier in the army, led military operations. The Papua New Guinea Government sent in the police and then the army under Jerry Singirok to quell the uprising, but they were unable to do so. The island was placed under a State of Emergency under the control of the PNG Police Commissioner. The number of complaints increased about human rights abuses by PNG forces, which initially strengthened support for the BRA. In January 1990, Bougainville Copper announced that they were suspending operations at the mine. The PNG Government announced that they would withdraw troops and for international observers to verify the disarmament of the BRA. The police fled fearing for their lives in the absence of the army, and there was an attempted coup in Port Moresby over the deal. In response to a blockade imposed by the PNG Government later in 1990, Ona said he was the head of the Bougainville Interim Government and declared independence for the island. The island descended into anarchy, as several armed factions and clans struggled for power; the PNG Government supported these militias. The BRA leaders fell out with Joseph Kabui, the Premier of Bougainville, who had previously been a supporter. During Prime Minister Paias Wingti's term, the PNG Government renewed military efforts, and their troops captured Arawa, the provincial capital, in 1993 and recaptured the Panguna mine. Sir Julius Chan, Wingti's successor tried to broker a deal, but neither Ona and the BRA nor Kabui would sign a deal. Frustrated, Chan ordered a full-scale invasion in 1996 but neither Australia nor New Zealand would support it. Chan hired Sandline International mercenaries, but the military threatened to arrest them on their arrival. Chan resigned to forestall a coup. Bougainville ceasefire A ceasefire was arranged later in 1997 between new Prime Minister Bill Skate and Joseph Kabui, with a multi-national Peace Monitoring Group commencing operations on the island. Though Ona and the BRA controlled 90% of the island, http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s400627.htm his break with Kabui meant that the BRA representatives were not involved in the talks. Ona believed that the New Zealand-brokered peace talks were unwarranted outside interference with Bougainville governance, and did not participate. During this period, Australian film maker Wayne Coles Janess made an acclaimed documentary film about the Bougainville Civil War.Bougainville ‚Äì Our Island Our Fight He was nearly assassinated by the PNG government. http://www.hartford- hwp.com/archives/24/157.htmlA Chronology of Bougainville Civil War], Hartford- HWP When he interviewed Ona, the leader declared : :We have already had other forms of autonomy. The provincial government system in 1975 we were promised. Bougainvillians were promised that after 5 years or after a few years, the provincial government will be replaced by the independent nation of Bougainville. So with this in mind, with this past history, we don't trust Papua New Guinea any more.... .... 90% of Bougainvillians are supporting me. And I want to summon Prime Minister of PNG and PNG government, if 90% is not supporting me, let them carry out a referendum and we'll see. Ona was subsequently ignored in the creation of the Autonomous Bougainville Government. At this time Ona agreed with Noah Musingku to establish a funding source for Bougainville that would allow true sovereignty. Papala Chronicles Issue 7 p 10 This system was developed as the U-Vistract system, which sought to use the untapped natural resources of Bougainville to finance reconstruction. Ona remained isolated in the Panguna region, which BRA controlled for the next 16 years. The Bougainville conflict is estimated to have cost between 10,000 and 15,000 lives, mainly due to disease and starvation among the civilian residents. A tribal reconciliation process started in 2000 appears to have been successful. The PNG government promised in 2001 to hold a referendum on independence within the next ten to fifteen years. The referendum was held in 2019, and voters voted overwhelmingly (98.31%) for independence. Ona was never captured and refused to participate in the peace process. His forces still controlled over half of the island. Kingship On 17 May 2004, Ona declared himself \\"King of Bougainville\\" or Mekamui. He was crowned \\"King Francis Dominic Dateransy Domanaa, head of state of the Royal Kingdom of Me'ekamui\\". \\"Me'ekamui\\", meaning \\"holy\\" or \\"Holy Land\\", is an old tribal name for Bougainville. Papala Chronicle Issue 3 pp 7,9. (National, 23 May 2004)] During elections for the Autonomous government in 2005, which he opposed, Ona came out of his safe haven into the public eye for the first time in 16 years. He declared that Bougainville was already independent and capable of running its own affairs. Papala Chronicles Issue 5 p 7 Perhaps as a result of Ona's continued influence in Bougainville, only 3% of the eligible voters participated in the May 2005 elections of the New Zealand-brokered Autonomous Government. :His Royal Highness, told the people that the fact that only 3% of the eligible voters on Bougainville voted in the May Autonomous Government elections means that the remaining 97% support his government, and as such, it is the only government they can turn to, to advance their push for development regardless of various differences. Papala Chronicles Issue 12 p 2 Members of the Lihir Island Mining Area Landowners Association in New Ireland, as well as other mining projects in Fiji and Solomon Islands, contacted Ona for assistance in dealing with foreign mining concerns. Papala Chronicles Issue 9 p 3 Ona died on 24 July 2005 of malaria in his village.

Established in 1823 as the official organ of the Philosophical Radicals, it was published from 1824 to 1914. James Mill was one of the driving forces behind the liberal journal until 1828. History=Early years= In 1823, the paper was founded (and funded) by Jeremy Bentham,I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (CUP 1995), p. 1008. who had long pondered the possibility of establishing a journal for propagating Radical views.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 84. The first edition of the journal (January 1824) featured an article by James Mill (continued in the second by his son John Stuart Mill), which served as a provocative reprobation of a rival, more well-established journal, the Edinburgh Review, castigating it as an organ of the Whig party, and for sharing the latter's propensity for fence-sitting in the aristocratic interest.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 86. The controversy drew in a wide public response, much however critical: the Nuttall Encyclop√¶dia, published in 1907, notes that the Breeches Review became a nickname for the journal on account of the fact that Francis Place, a breeches-maker, was a major shareholder in the enterprise. American critic and activist John Neal also published many articles in these early years while serving as Bentham's personal secretary. The review quickly reached a circulation of three thousand,E Hal√©vy, The Liberal Awakening (London 1961), p. 189. but, despite that, was not able to break even; and when by 1828 the original funding was exhausted it was sold to another proprietor and no longer functioned in the Radical interest.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 109. In 1834 Sir William Molesworth funded a new Radical review, to be edited (informally) by J S Mill, and called the ‚Äò‚ÄôLondon Review‚Äô‚Äô.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 154‚Äì155. Shortly after, Molesworth bought the Westminster Review‚Äô‚Äô and merged the two; and from April 1836 to March 1840 the journal resulting from the merger was published under the title London and Westminster Review. After March 1840 and for the following decade publication continued under the title Westminster Review, but with William Edward Hickson in place of Mill as editor.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 167‚Äì168. Though financial difficulties continued, Mill concluded of the period that ‚Äúit is highly creditable to him [Hickson] that he was able to maintain, in some tolerable degree, the character of the Review as an organ of radicalism and progress‚Äù.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989), p. 168. =Later developments= In 1851 the journal was acquired by John Chapman based at 142 the Strand, London, a publisher who originally had medical training. The then unknown Mary Ann Evans, later better known by her pen name of George Eliot, had brought together his authors, including Francis Newman, W. R. Greg, Harriet Martineau and the young journalist Herbert Spencer who had been working and living cheaply in the offices of The Economist opposite Chapman's house. These authors met during that summer to give their support to this flagship of free thought and reform, joined by others including John Stuart Mill, the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter, Robert Chambers and George J. Holyoake. They were later joined by Thomas Huxley, an ambitious young ship's surgeon determined to become a naturalist. John Oxenford's anonymous 1853 article, \\"Iconoclasm in German Philosophy\\", was translated and published in the Vossische Zeitung. This led to a new interest in Schopenhauer's writings. Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) became assistant editor and produced a four‚Äìpage prospectus setting out their common beliefs in progress, ameliorating ills and rewards for talent, setting out a loosely defined evolutionism as \\"the fundamental principle\\" of what she and Chapman called the \\"Law of Progress\\". The group was divided over the work of Thomas Malthus, with Holyoake opposing it as the principle of the workhouse which blamed the poor for their poverty, while to Greg and Martineau this was a law of nature encouraging responsibility and self-improvement. Chapman asked Herbert Spencer to write about this divisive matter for the first issue, and Spencer's \\"A Theory of Population, deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility\\" actually appeared in the second issue, supporting the painful Malthusian principle as both true and self-correcting. After 1853 John Tyndall joined Huxley in running the science section of the Westminster Review and formed a group of evolutionists who helped pave the way for Charles Darwin's 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species and gave evolutionary ideas backing in the ensuing debate. The term \\"Darwinism\\" was first put in print by Huxley in his review of The Origin, in the April 1860 issue of the Westminster Review, which hailed the book as \\"a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism\\", promoting scientific naturalism over theology and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species. In 1886 the Review published an essay by Eleanor Marx, \\"The Woman Question: From A Socialist Point of View\\"; but after a change of ownership in 1887, when the review converted to a monthly, it ceased to function on the same progressive and intellectual level.I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (CUP 1995), p. 1008. Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review The Foreign Quarterly Review was an independent London-based quarterly that published from July 1827 to July 1846 (volume 37). In October 1846 the Foreign Quarterly Review merged with the Westminster Review. Until January 1847 the journal resulting from the merger was simultaneously published under two different titles: the Foreign Quarterly and Westminster Review and the Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review; after January 1847, the journal was published under the title the Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review. The last issue under the title Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review was published in October 1851 (volume 56, no. 2); after that issue the journal was published under the title Westminster Review and continued thus until it ceased publication in 1914.

After being arrested for stealing more than 23,600 books worth in 1990 (equivalent to about $M in ), he became known as the Book Bandit and was recognized as the most successful book thief in the history of the United States.  Early life  Blumberg lived on a $72,000 annual family trust fund. His compulsion to collect books developed in childhood when he became interested in many of the beautiful, but run-down Victorian homes in St. Paul he walked past on his way to school. Blumberg began removing doorknobs and stained glass windows from the old houses that were slated for destruction as part of a revitalization project in St. Paul. Blumberg amassed hundreds of these items during the course of his collecting years in addition to the books. His initial interest in Victorian architecture brought him into the rare-books stacks at the University of Minnesota. Blumberg initially took items as a way to create a reference collection for his own use.  Arrest and trial  At 2:00 am on March 20, 1990 Stephen Blumberg was arrested for stealing more than 23,600 rare, valuable and assorted other books from 268 or more universities and museums in 45 states, two Canadian provinces, and Washington, D.C. Their value was placed at about US$20 million, but was later changed to $5.3 million, the largest book theft in US history. In 1991, Blumberg was found guilty and sentenced to 71 months in prison with a $200,000 fine. On December 29, 1995, he was released from prison. The collection has been referred to as the \\"Blumberg Collection.\\" The Rare Books and Manuscripts division of the Association of College and Research Libraries as well as library security expert William Andrew Moffett helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation capture and convict Stephen Blumberg and identify the items he had stolen.Stephen Blumberg and His Stolen Books, American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Volume 15, Number 7, November 1991Article on Stephen Blumberg's theft of Harvard University Books, Harvard Magazine Blumberg's arrest came as a result of his friend, Kenneth J. Rhodes, turning him in for a $56,000 bounty he negotiated with the Justice Department. Rhodes and Blumberg had known each other since the mid-1970s. A known criminal, Rhodes accompanied Blumberg on several of his road trip collecting sprees. During Blumberg's 1991 trial, Dr. William S. Logan, director of the Law and Psychiatry Department at the Menninger Clinic and a recognized authority on forensic psychiatry, revealed that Blumberg had undergone psychiatric treatment for schizophrenic delusions and tendencies. He was hospitalized numerous times during his adolescence where twelve psychiatrists diagnosed him variously as schizophrenic, delusional, paranoid, or compulsive. Dr. Logan also revealed that a history of psychiatric illness plagued Blumberg's family. Dr. Logan reported during the trial that Blumberg intended to preserve or rescue the materials he stole from what he believed was destruction. Blumberg believed that the government was plotting to keep the ordinary person from having access to rare books and unique materials, and so sought to liberate and release them in an attempt to thwart the government plot. Blumberg admitted that he saw himself as a custodian of the things he took.Basbanes, Nicholas A. A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books, 2012, 1999 and 1996 editions. Fine Books Press (for the 2012 edition), , He said he would never sell them because he thought that would be dishonest. He envisioned the items would be returned to the rightful owners after his death, or at least to another repository that could care for them. Despite these claims, Blumberg was convicted in 1991 as guilty, without reason of insanity. After serving a 4¬Ω-year sentence, Blumberg was released and resumed his collecting and stealing habits. Upon meeting Blumberg in the FBI's stacks after his arrest, John L. Sharpe III from Duke University's library commented about his brief conversation with Blumberg that, > \\"What I felt...was that we in libraries have to operate on a trust system > every time we bring a book to someone's table. This is what I think is so > sinister about the whole thing. This man chose to debase that, to debase > that commodity that is so essential in gathering information in an open > institution. And I think he betrayed everything that we try to represent in > making information available as freely and as uninhibitedly as possible. And > I think that‚Äôs what really just enraged me, to think that this man took > advantage of that kind of access.\\"(511) In 1997, Blumberg was convicted again of burglary of antiques. He was again arrested in July 2003 for burglary of a house in Keokuk, Iowa. He was subsequently convicted in early-2004. He was again arrested in June 2004 for burglary in Knoxville, Illinois. This violated his probation for the 2004 conviction in Keokuk, Iowa for which he was again arrested.  Collection  Some of the more precious objects Blumberg stole include a first-edition copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin; A Confession of Faith, the first published book in Connecticut in 1710; 25 boxes of rare materials outlining the early history of Oregon including the Webfoot Diary; and the Bishops' Bible, a 16th-century volume. Blumberg claimed he put together 100 incunabula in three years, including the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle bound in ivory calfskin. He also collected the Zamorano 80, a list of rare books established in 1945 by a group of prominent book collectors in a Los Angeles book club named after Don Augustin Zamorano, California's first printer.

1884 in Rio de Janeiro, Empire of Brazil) was a French physician and physiologist. He worked at the Laboratory of Experimental Physiology at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, the first of its kind in Brazil. He was a collaborator of Jo√£o Baptista de Lacerda (1846-1915), a Brazilian physiologist who was the lab's founder. Couty studied in France with Alfred Vulpian (1826‚Äì1887) and Charles- √âdouard Brown-S√©quard (1817‚Äì1894). He came to Brazil to lecture on Industrial Biology at the Escola Polit√©cnica do Rio de Janeiro. Disappointed with its local conditions, he asked to carry out his experimental research at the National Museum, where Lacerda was already active with a research line on snake venom and other toxins. Couty began to study curare, a plant poison, and his first published paper was on its physiological properties, in 1876. Hearing about his work, the Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro II visited the Laboratory and invited him to be its first director, providing also the necessary resources to support the research lines. Couty also did experiments on other toxic plants and animals, the physiological effects of climate, on the pharmacology of mate, coffee, sugar cane alcohol, etc. He also studied brain physiology in monkeys and even adventured himself into sociology, writing in 1881 an important book, one of the earliest sociological analyses published about the country, \\"Slavery in Brazil\\". In this work, Couty proved that Brazil, on the basis of the census of 1872, had a very small organised middle class and that slave owners (only about 500,000 in 12 million total, in a land of 5 million square km) were the \\"real\\" economical and political elite. Hence, his famous boutade, \\"Brazil has no people\\". He died unexpectedly at 30 years of age, after living less than 8 years in Rio, and his brilliant career, which could have been so important to the development of Brazilian physiology, was cut short. Couty's place in the history of biomedical science is preserved in a fresco painting at the entrance of the basic sciences building of the Federal University of S√£o Paulo.

It has been extensively used in reference to a clause in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which specified that all information about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy was to be considered \\"Restricted Data\\" (RD) until it had been officially declassified. In the 1954 revision of the Act, the United States Atomic Energy Commission was given the power to declassify entire categories of information. The \\"born secret\\" policy was created under the assumption that nuclear information could be so important to national security that it would need classification before it could be formally evaluated. The wording of the 1954 act specified as secret: Whether or not it is constitutional to declare entire categories of information preemptively classified has not been definitively tested in the courts. The legality of the 'born secret' doctrine was directly challenged in a freedom of the press case in 1979 (United States v. The Progressive). In that case, a magazine attempted to publish an account of the so-called \\"secret of the hydrogen bomb\\" (the Teller‚ÄìUlam design), which was apparently created without recourse to classified information. Many analysts predicted that the US Supreme Court would, if it heard the case, reject the 'born secret' clause as being an unconstitutional restraint on speech. However, the government dropped the case as moot before it was resolved.

There are also federally recognized Alaska Native tribes. , 574 Indian tribes were legally recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the United States.Federal Acknowledgment of the Pamunkey Indian Tribe Of these, 231 are located in Alaska. Description Flags of Wisconsin tribes in the Wisconsin state capitol In the United States, the Indian tribe is a fundamental unit, and the constitution grants Congress the right to interact with tribes. More specifically, the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28 (1913), warned, \\"it is not... that Congress may bring a community or body of people within range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes\\" (at 46).Sheffield (1998) p56 Federal tribal recognition grants to tribes the right to certain benefits, and is largely controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). While trying to determine which groups were eligible for federal recognition in the 1970s, government officials became acutely aware of the need for consistent procedures. To illustrate, several federally unrecognized tribes encountered obstacles in bringing land claims; United States v. Washington (1974) was a court case that affirmed the fishing treaty rights of Washington tribes; and other tribes demanded that the U.S. government recognize aboriginal titles. All the above culminated in the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which legitimized tribal entities by partially restoring Native American self-determination. Following the decisions made by the Indian Claims Commission, the BIA in 1978 published final rules with procedures that groups had to meet to secure federal tribal acknowledgement. There are seven criteria. Four have proven troublesome for most groups to prove: long-standing historical community, outside identification as Indians, political authority, and descent from a historical tribe. Tribes seeking recognition must submit detailed petitions to the BIA's Office of Federal Acknowledgment. Consequently, the Federal Acknowledgment Process can take years, even decades; delays of 12‚Äì14 years are not uncommon. The Shinnecock Indian Nation formally petitioned for recognition in 1978 and was recognized 32 years later, in 2010. At a Senate Committee on Indian Affairs hearing, witnesses testified that the process was \\"broken, long, expensive, burdensome, intrusive, unfair, arbitrary and capricious, less than transparent, unpredictable, and subject to undue political influence and manipulation.\\"Federal Recognition: Can the BIA's Acknowledgment Process Be Fixed?, Indian Country Today (August 8, 2012).Fixing the Federal Acknowledgment Process (S. Hrg. 111-470), Hearing Before the Committee on Indian Affairs, United States Senate (Nov. 4, 2009). In July 2018 the United States' Federal Register issued an official list of 573 tribes that are Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. The number of tribes increased to 567 in May 2016 with the inclusion of the Pamunkey tribe in Virginia who received their federal recognition in July 2015. The number of tribes increased to 573 with the addition of six tribes in Virginia under the Thomasina E.

The text frequently appears at the top and bottom of the image. Image macros are one of the most common forms of internet memes, and often feature a witty message or catchphrase, although not all image macros are necessarily humorous. LOLcats, which are images of expressive cats coupled with texts, are considered to be the first notable occurrence of image macros. Advice animal image macros, also referred to as stock-character macros, are also highly associated with the image macro template.  Etymology and use  The term \\"image macro\\" originated on the Something Awful forums. The name derived from the fact that the \\"macros\\" were a short bit of text a user could enter that the forum software would automatically parse and expand into the code for a pre-defined image. This, in turn, related to the computer science topic of a macro; \\"a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure\\". Beginning in 2007, lolcats and similar image macros (a form of internet phenomenon) spread beyond the initial communities who created them and became widely popular.  Formats  alt= Another image macro format, used since 2017. It is more popular nowadays. Although they come in many forms, the most common type of image macros consists of: # Text, typically a large text in the Impact font, centered at the top and bottom of the image, using all upper-case letters. White text with a black border is typically used because it is easily readable on almost any background color. Typically, the text at the top is only for introduction and the text at the bottom is the main message. Exaggerated, intentional spelling errors are also used frequently for humorous effect. # An image to be placed behind the text. These are typically drawn from a specific set of images that are understood by many Internet users, such as Bad Luck Brian. However, by using the aforementioned typographic style, any image can take on the context or aesthetic of an image macro. #An image, usually from a music video, television show or a film, sometimes with subtitles on it, with a white background above with black text, typically in the Arial or Helvetica Neue font.  Examples  O RLY owl Bad Luck Brian Cats and other animals in general have been a popular choice for images with humorous captions since the mid 2000s. Some common animal-related image macros include lolcats, every time you masturbate... God kills a kitten, O RLY?, Doge and Grumpy Cat. O RLY is often used on the internet as an abbreviation for the phrase \\"Oh, really?\\" Originally started with a snowy owl photograph (which is the classic O RLY image macro), it spread out over the Web quickly and was followed by other macros that convey a wide range of emotions. Another style of image macro that has amassed its own separate subculture is the \\"lolcat\\", an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect, and its use in this way is known as \\"lolspeak\\". Many times, the image is told from the point of view of the animal. \\"Rage faces\\" from Rage Comics are used to humorously depict an everyday or exaggerated situation or reaction. Although Rage Comics in themselves are not image macros, images of specific rage faces are taken and put into image macro format and used in conjunction to their implied emotion or context. Another popular type of image macro includes a picture of a certain person or figure drawn from various sources in front of a colored background, known as \\"advice animals\\". These \\"characters\\" often share the same image, but different internet users can choose different humorous captions. These characters can include \\"Bad Luck Brian\\", \\"Success Kid\\", and \\"Scumbag Steve\\", among others. Bad Luck Brian image captions are used for unfortunate situations, Success Kid image captions depict an everyday situation involving good luck, and Scumbag Steve captions describe an unfriendly action taken by somebody. Websites such as Know Your Meme document image macros such as Bad Luck Brian that have become popular enough to become internet memes, covering such topics as their original intended meaning, spread and popularity (as measured by Google search interest over time). Another common trend in image macros is using specific scenes from television or movies such as One does not simply walk into Mordor from Lord of the Rings and 'Not Sure If-' from Futurama that uses a screen image of the character Fry looking unsure with his eyes squinted.  Reception  Some image macros have been criticised for creating space for \\"dogwhistling\\", by leaving ambiguous space for interpretations along racist, sexist and other lines. The ambiguity in interpretations is referred to as Poe's Law, where there is difficulty separating satire and sincere communication within image macros.

Officially, it is not a rank but a position and style bestowed on some divisional generals, which is the highest substantive rank, in charge of important commands, such as Chief of Staff of the French Army or Chief of the Defence Staff. It is an OF‚Äì9 NATO rank, equivalent to the Air Force air army general and the Navy admiral. In the army, only a Marshal of France is higher; however, Marshal of France is not a rank, but a dignity in the State, today not bestowed. There is no higher rank in the Gendarmerie.  History  The rank was created on 6 June 1939 by a decree of the President of the French Republic published in the Journal Officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise, following a joint report by the Ministers of War, of the Navy and of the Air. They came to the conclusion that the higher hierarchy was more often in relation with the one of other countries, which frequently had more than two general ranks. By necessity, two positions and styles were created to address this issue, army general and corps general. The decree also provided that the divisional generals already commanding a corps were made corps generals and the ones members of the Superior War Council army generals.  Insignia description  Service dress uniform kepi of an army general. A French army general displays five stars on a shoulder board; the number of stars should not be compared with that of generals from other NATO countries, usually denoted by four stars only. The rank in the National Gendarmerie additionally displays a golden grenade above the stars. No shoulder board are worn on the full dress or service dress uniform; instead, the insignia is worn on the sleeves. After the Second World War the design of the full dress uniform kepi for a general changed, now also displaying the stars. It was already the case for field headgear, with no other ornament than the stars.  Other  The mention of the current usage of \\"a sixth star authorized for the army general in command of the Paris sector\\" is an urban legend. The title of army general in France and elsewhere should not be confused with the rank of general of the army, which is more senior, and corresponds to other countries' marshal or field marshal. The rank of \\"general of the army\\" theoretically corresponds to overall command of an entire national army with several armies in the field, while the title \\"army general\\" only corresponds to the command of an individual army in the field.

Early life Tan was born in a Hoklo peasant family of seven in Jimei of Tong An in Fujian, China. Born into of very limited means, and orphaned young, he had little chance of an education before he made his way to Nanyang in 1916 together with his brothers, at the age of 18. Career In Singapore, Tan worked in one of Tan Kah Kee's factories, and within half a year he was promoted to a responsible position in Tan Kah Kee's Khiam Aik (Qianyi) company. Not long afterward, he left the company to set up a rubber enterprise with the help from his brothers, but the enterprise lost half its capital in a year. Tan then ran it alone and after several years, he built up his Aik Hoe (Yihe) rubber company and became one of the leading rubber industrialists of the region. He expanded his business to all parts of Malaya, Thailand and India and diversified into insurance, paper and cement industries. His career as an industrialist peaked in the 1950s, when his company reaped huge profits from the rising price of rubber. Later life Tan was stripped of his Malayan citizenship in Singapore in 1963 by the Malaysian Federal Government as a suspected communist, and remained stateless since then. Tan died in 1972 in Singapore at the age of 76, leaving behind 11 sons and 3 daughters.  Contributions and Legacy  Tan was an activist, and like other entrepreneurs of his time, he believed in the value of education. As chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the 1950s, he fought for citizenship for Chinese people in Singapore and for the Chinese language to be one of Singapore's official languages. As the long-time president of the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, Tan Lark Sye contributed generously to charitable and educational causes throughout his life. He provided strong support for educational institutions under the auspices of the association, including Kong Hwa School, Tao Nan School, Nan Chiau Girls' High School, and Chongfu School. He also contributed to financing the institutions in Jimei founded by Tan Kah Kee. In 1957 he donated considerable sums to Thailand's Hokkien clan association to build overseas Chinese schools. His contributions to education, however, were not confined to Chinese schools. In 1949, when the University of Malaya was set up, Tan donated S$300,000, and between 1950 and 1960 he contributed to the building of schools of different language mediums. Tan's most outstanding contribution, however, was the initiating of the founding of Nanyang University in 1953. He donated S$5 million to its building fund, as well as of land for its campus on behalf of the Hokkien Huay Kuan. Between 1953 and 1963, he was Chairman of Nanyang University's Executive Committee, and was in charge of various aspects of the university by building, teaching staff, research facilities, library, student welfare and others. Nanyang University was later merged with The University of Singapore in 1980 to form the current National University of Singapore. The establishment of Nanyang University had a lasting influence on Chinese education in the region and beyond. It pioneered the establishment of Chinese Studies departments in Ngee Ann College, the University of Singapore and the University of Malaya. The establishment of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the Southern University College in Johor, Malaysia, were also inspired by the ideals underlying the founding of Nanyang University. In 1974, a Tan Lark Sye scholarship was set up, and in 1998 the Tan Lark Sye professorship in Chinese language and culture was established to honour Tan. Honours Tan Lark Sye Library, New Era University College, Malaysia was named after him.

He stole a Cessna 150 late on September 11, 1994 and crashed the stolen aircraft onto the South Lawn of the White House early on September 12, 1994, attempting to land the plane on the south lawn of the White House; he was killed, and was the sole casualty. Background Corder was born in Perry Point, Maryland, the son of William Eugene Corder, who was an aircraft mechanic, and Dorothy Corder. He dropped out of Aberdeen High School in the eleventh grade and enlisted in the Army in October 1974. Corder was stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Fort Carson, Colorado, where he was trained as a mechanic. He was honorably discharged from military service in July 1975 at the rank of private first class. After his service ended, he worked as a truck driver from 1976 until his employment was terminated in early 1993. On April 15, 1993, Corder was arrested for theft and was arrested again later that year on October 9 for drug dealing. He was sentenced to spend 90 days at a drug rehabilitation center and was released in February 1994. After he was released, he was living with his third wife Lydia at Keyser's Motel in Aberdeen, Maryland. Lydia Corder left Frank three weeks prior to the incident, which is thought to have driven him towards deep depression and suicide. Friends claim he bore no ill will towards President Bill Clinton and probably only wanted the publicity of the stunt, based largely on his sentiments towards Mathias Rust's flight of a Cessna 172 from Finland to Moscow, USSR. The President was not even in the mansion at the time due to renovations, but was instead staying at Blair House. Incident Corder stole the Cessna on the night of September 11 and departed from Aldino Airport in Maryland while severely intoxicated, which is presumed to have led to his later miscalculation. The plane was noticed by radar technicians at National Airport several minutes before he tried to steer it into the wall of the White House. At 1:49 a.m., he hit the South Lawn and died on impact. The crash caused a re- evaluation in security procedures around the White House, as the pilot had entered restricted airspace. Though the White House is rumored to be equipped with surface-to-air missiles, none were fired. The Secret Service has neither confirmed nor dispelled the rumor.

Since its first restaurant opened in 1940, it has been primarily known for ice cream and, later, the \\"Awful Awful\\" milkshake. The company is based in Middletown, Rhode Island.  History  Newport Creamery began with Samuel Rector's Newport, Rhode Island dairy business in 1928. Rector began as a wholesaler and started home delivery in 1932. In 1940, Rector and his son opened their first restaurant in nearby Middletown, where the company is still headquartered. For its first 13 years, the restaurant sold only ice cream, adding other food to the menu in 1953. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was franchised, eventually expanding to 33 restaurants. In the late 1990s, the company ran into financial trouble, losing money, deferring maintenance, and closing 12 of its locations. In 1999 the Rector family sold the chain to Florida businessman, Robert Swain, for $7.6 million. Swain tried to expand the business's geographic coverage into Massachusetts and Connecticut. The expansion was unsuccessful, and was followed by contraction. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2000. In 2001, Jan Companies, a local Burger King franchisee, purchased the company for only $1.55 million. the company has 12 locations. Ten are located in Rhode Island, and two are in southern Massachusetts.  Awful Awful  The chain is known for Awful Awful milkshakes, made from blended syrups and a proprietary ice milk. The drink started at the New Jersey‚Äìbased chain, Bond's, in the 1940s. The name comes from a Bond's customer who called it \\"awful big and awful good\\". In 1948, Bond's licensed it to Newport Creamery and then to Massachusetts-based Friendly's. The terms of the license mandated the two New England businesses not sell it in New Jersey, leading the expanding Friendly's chain to rebrand it as a \\"Fribble\\", and later changing its formula to be more like a traditional milkshake with ice cream instead of ice milk. When Bond's went out of business in the 1970s, Newport Creamery purchased the trademark and continues to serve the original recipe.  Media  Newport Creamery was featured on a 2019 episode of the Cooking Channel's Man v. Food, where host Casey Webb successfully finished three Awful Awful milkshakes in one sitting.

Co., 1914 The Golden Gate branch of the Oakland Library opened in 1918. It was built with funds from a 1914 Carnegie grant. Its design, by Donovan and Dickie, is a good example of early 20th century Georgian Revival Architecture.Carnegie Libraries, Oakland/Golden Gate In the first half of the 20th century, Golden Gate was an entertainment district, with over 50 bars including the original Trader Vic's location at the northeast corner of San Pablo Ave & 65th St where the Mai Tai drink was purportedly invented. In the last half of the 20th century the retail district underwent a period of decline and by 1998 was considered blighted by the city of Oakland.A 1998 photo essay on the neighborhood During the 1950s, the area became majority African American. In 1982, the East Bay Negro Historical Society (EBNHS) was invited into the Golden Gate Branch of the Oakland Public Library, making it the first Oakland city library with a predominantly African American focused collection. The collection was housed in the entire left side of the library where the children's section of the library is now located. The assistance of Mayor Lionel Wilson, Assemblyman Elihu Harris, and others helped the organization establish a solid foundation in their new home. Following the appointment of Dr. Lawrence Crouchett as its executive director in 1988, the organization changed its name to the Northern California Center for Afro- American History & Life (NCCAAHL). In 1994, the City of Oakland and the NCCAAHL merged to create the African American Museum & Library at Oakland (AAMLO). This unique public/private partnership entered a historic juncture with the opening of AAMLO in February 2002. Located at 659 14th Street, AAMLO is now housed in the former Charles S. Greene library, an historic 1902 Carnegie building. The Golden Gate Shopping District was the location of Your Black Muslim Bakery, which made national headlines in August 2007 when the bakery was raided by the Oakland police and shut down. By 2010 the area was undergoing a process of gentrification, including controversially being dubbed \\"NOBE\\" by some realtors.

It was responsible for law enforcement in South West Africa when that territory was administered by South Africa. It was organised and structured both as a paramilitary force and as a civil police force.  History SWAPOL was established following World War I, when the South African government assumed administration of South West Africa under the terms of a League of Nations mandate. Between 1915 and 1919, public security and law enforcement were entrusted to the South African military police. On December 31, 1939, the rule of law returned to South West Africa when SWAPOL was founded as the territory's first civilian law enforcement agency. An investigation department was established in 1920. SWAPOL was disbanded in 1939, and its local units absorbed into the South African Police (SAP). The SAP responsible for the territory from 1939 to 1981. Until 1981 it was a Provincial Police Region of the SAP, headed by a police lieutenant general. A third of all the policemen in the district were SAP transferrals from South Africa, with the remaining two-thirds being personnel recruited locally. The League of Nations mandate was terminated by the United Nations in 1966, with South Africa from then on illegally occupying South West Africa. SWAPOL was re-established in 1981, after the territory had become self- governing. Role in Counterinsurgency The first large scale contact between units of the SWAPOL and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia was in 1968. On July 14, 1968, a Police Patrolling team from Eenhana District Police, led by Sergeant Fourie, W/O Nelumbu, B/Constable Bavingi, Constable Schaefer, Constable Hattingh and B/Constable Kauluma were patrolling the Eenhana-Outapi Highway when their Land Rover jeep came under machine gun fire and grenade attack from a band of guerillas from the bushes. Their jeep tyres having been shot away, Sgt. Fourie and W/O Nelumbu fired back with their side arms (pistols) and a wounded Constable Hattingh brought to bear the lone Sten Gun in the jeep to drive the attack away, in the process rescuing under fire a wounded B/Constable Kauluma, the driver, who had been thrown from the jeep and wounded. Following this attack Police radio patrols in the highway region were strengthened with an additional jeep with 2 Policemen armed with the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle. In 1970 the situation had deteriorated to the extent that all Policemen in the Northern Region were given training in the L1A1 self loading rifle and the Sten Gun, and the SWAPOL Airwing started twice daily helicopter patrols along the Eenhana-Outapi Road Until 1970, the arms sanctioned for SWAPOL units were as following - for Police Stations - 25 Batons, 8 Pistols, 3 Sten Guns, 12 Lee Enfield .303 Rifles, and 1 Bren light machine gun. For District Police Reserve Forces - 150 Batons and Shields, 20 Tear Gas Guns, 30 Pistols, 18 Sten Guns, 10 L1A1 Self Loading Rifles (introduced from December 1969) 36 Lee Enfield .303 Rifles, 20 Shotguns, and 4 Bren light machine guns. For Mobile Patrol/Flying Squad team - 2 Pistols, 1 Sten Gun, 2 L1A1 Self Loading Rifles. Between 1974 and 1977, all Sten Guns and .303 Rifles were phased out and replaced with L1A1 Self Loading Rifles. 4 M2 Browning heavy machine guns, 2 of them mounted on mobile patrol, were also assigned to the District Police Reserve from 1974 onwards, and 1 M2 Browning assigned to each Police Station. From 1978 onwards, 2 105mm Recoilless Rifles were assigned to each Police Circle Reserve. Casspirs were provided at the level of District Reserve from 1982 onwards and at Police Stations from 1984 onwards. Organization Until 1981, the organization of the SWAPOL was as follows: # Police Stations (divided into several Outposts, Beats and Mobile Patrols/Flying Squad) led by a Lieutenant or an Inspector, # District Police/Investigation Centres (controlling around 4 Police Stations and having an Armed Reserve) commanded by a Major, # Police Circles (controlling 3 Districts) led by a Colonel, # Regional Police Commands (controlling 2 to 3 Circles or an entire Bantustan) commanded by a Brigadier, and # four Super- Commands of North, South, Coastal and Koevoet, commanded by Major Generals. # The Cities of Walvis Bay and Windhoek were at the level of Super-Command, # The Air Wing was at the level of a Regional Police Command. The Air Wing maintained a Central Fleet of 20 helicopters and a further fleet of 6 helicopters under each of the Regional Commands. # There were other functional and Staff Directorates led by Brigadiers, such as Criminal Investigation, Forensics, Administration, Intelligence, Training, Communications/Wireless, Economic Offences, Personnel, Traffic, Provisioning, and Establishment  Koevoet  SWAPOL's most controversial unit was its counter-insurgency division, which was known officially as SWAPOL-COIN or Operation K, but more commonly referred to as Koevoet. Koevoet was initially an autonomous unit under the nominal authority of the SAP Security Branch, but became part of SWAPOL in 1985. Koevoet worked closely with SWAPOL's own Security Branch in investigating crimes of a political nature, namely politically motivated murders. The unit was better known for its combat operations against insurgents of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in Ovamboland, which earned it a formidable reputation. Koevoet's hybrid status as a paramilitary police unit made it something of a legal anomaly; for example, it lacked the mandate to hold insurgents as prisoners of war. Insurgents were technically supposed to be apprehended for trial in open courts as common law criminals. Based on this interpretation, the South West African courts ruled that insurgents captured by Koevoet had to be granted legal representation and could not be detained indefinitely. With the South African Border War drawing to a close in mid-1989, Koevoet was greatly reduced in size and most of its personnel were reassigned to other divisions by SWAPOL. Additionally, many of the South African personnel were transferred back to the South African Police or the Homeland Forces. In 1988, SWAPOL consisted of 6,500 uniformed personnel, including the 3000-man Koevoet force and the 300-man Air Wing, of which 4000 were local Blacks, 800 were local Whites, 1000 were South African Whites and 700 were South African Blacks. The local Municipal Constabulary, Homeland Guards and Traffic Police were entirely locals, both Black and White Nevertheless, the unit's continued existence was the subject of much controversy, as both current and former Koevoet operators were accused of political intimidation and human rights abuses. United Nations Security Council Resolution 640 explicitly named Koevoet as being a barrier to the peace process in Namibia and demanded its disbandment. SWAPOL dissolved the unit on October 30, 1989.

Human resources for health are identified as one of the core building blocks of a health system. They include physicians, nursing professionals, pharmacists, midwives, dentists, allied health professions, community health workers, social health workers and other health care providers, as well as health management and support personnel ‚Äì those who may not deliver services directly but are essential to effective health system functioning, including health services managers, medical records and health information technicians, health economists, health supply chain managers, medical secretaries and others. The field of health human resources deals with issues such as planning, development, performance, management, retention, information, and research on human resources for the health care sector. In recent years, raising awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the global health agenda.  Global situation  Nations identified with critical shortages of health care workers The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and support workers worldwide. The shortage is most severe in 57 of the poorest countries, especially in sub- Saharan Africa. The situation was declared on World Health Day 2006 as a \\"health workforce crisis\\" ‚Äì the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, wages, working environment and management. Shortages of skilled for health workers are also reported in many specific care areas. For example, there is an estimated shortage of 1.18 million mental health professionals, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000 nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. Shortages of skilled birth attendants in many developing countries remains an important barrier to improving maternal health outcomes. Many countries, both developed and developing, report maldistribution of skilled health workers leading to shortages in rural and underserved areas. Regular statistical updates on the global health workforce situation are collated in the WHO Global Health Observatory. However, the evidence base remains fragmented and incomplete, largely related to weaknesses in the underlying human resource information systems (HRIS) within countries. In order to learn from best practices in addressing health workforce challenges and strengthening the evidence base, an increasing number of HHR practitioners from around the world are focusing on issues such as HHR advocacy, surveillance and collaborative practice. Some examples of global HRH partnerships include: * Health Workforce Information Reference Group (HIRG) * Global Health Workforce Network  Research  Health workforce research is the investigation of how social, economic, organizational, political and policy factors affect access to health care professionals, and how the organization and composition of the workforce itself can affect health care delivery, quality, equity, and costs. Many government health departments, academic institutions and related agencies have established research programs to identify and quantify the scope and nature of HHR problems leading to health policy in building an innovative and sustainable health services workforce in their jurisdiction. Some examples of HRH information and research dissemination programs include: * Human Resources for Health journal * HRH Knowledge Hub, University of New South Wales, Australia * Center for Health Workforce Studies, University of Albany, New York * Canadian Institute for Health Information: Spending and Health Workforce * Public Health Foundation of India: Human Resources for Health in India * National Human Resources for Health Observatory of Sudan * OECD Human Resources for Health Care Study  Policy and planning  In some countries and jurisdictions, health workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants. In others, there is an explicit policy or strategy adopted by governments and systems to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet health care goals. For one, the International Council of Nurses reports: > The objective of HHRP [health human resources planning] is to provide the > right number of health care workers with the right knowledge, skills, > attitudes, and qualifications, performing the right tasks in the right place > at the right time to achieve the right predetermined health targets. An essential component of planned HRH targets is supply and demand modeling, or the use of appropriate data to link population health needs and/or health care delivery targets with human resources supply, distribution and productivity. The results are intended to be used to generate evidence-based policies to guide workforce sustainability. In resource-limited countries, HRH planning approaches are often driven by the needs of targeted programmes or projects, for example, those responding to the Millennium Development Goals or, more recently, the Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) is an HRH planning and management tool that can be adapted to local circumstances. It provides health managers a systematic way to make staffing decisions in order to better manage their human resources, based on a health worker's workload, with activity (time) standards applied for each workload component at a given health facility. =Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel= The main international policy framework for addressing shortages and maldistribution of health professionals is the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, adopted by the WHO's 63rd World Health Assembly in 2010. The Code was developed in a context of increasing debate on international health worker recruitment, especially in some higher income countries, and its impact on the ability of many developing countries to deliver primary health care services.

The theater underwent restoration and was reopened on November 17, 2007. The Motion Picture Association of America listed the State Theatre as the #1 movie theater in the world. The State Theatre is located on East Front Street in downtown Traverse City and was founded and built by Julius H. Steinberg in 1916 and named the Lyric Theater. It was rebuilt in 1923 after a fire. It showed the first talking movie seen in Northern Michigan in 1929 when it was known as the Lyric Theatre. It was destroyed by fire again in 1948 and was rebuilt in 1949 in an art deco style and renamed the State Theatre. In 1978, the theater was twinned. It closed down in 1996, when the cinemas at the Grand Traverse Mall opened, and mall cinema owners GKC wanted business at those new theaters. GKC (now AMC) placed a deed restriction on subsequent owners of the State to prevent them from showing certain major Hollywood films. The theatre was revitalized before being used during the Traverse City Film Festival which began in July 2005. On November 17, 2007, the community celebrated the grand opening of the theater as a year-round art house.  As Lyric Theatre  On July 4, 1916, Julius Steinberg opened the Lyric Theatre to complement his Grand Opera House immediately west of the property on Front Street. The Lyric opened with the silent film \\"The Iron Strain\\" starring Dustin Farnum. Ticket prices were 15¬¢ for adults and 5¬¢ for children. On January 17, 1923, the Lyric was destroyed in a fire and subsequently reopened on December 20, 1923, with the movie Hearts Aflame based on the story ‚ÄúTimber‚Äù by local author Harold Titus. The Lyric showed silent films and also hosted weddings and other events. In September 1927, Butterfield Theatres took over management of Lyric from the Fitzpatrick-McElroy chain. Con Foster, who worked for Fitzpatrick- McElroy, was retained as local manager for Butterfield, a position he held with only a brief interruption until his death on April 3, 1940. At midnight on March 29, 1929, the Lyric showed ‚ÄúLucky Boy‚Äù starring George Jessel, the first ‚Äútalkie‚Äù film run in Traverse City. At this special showing, a short clip of Herbert Hoover‚Äôs inauguration speech was also screened. The Lyric was the first theater in Northern Michigan to operate Vitaphone-Movietone equipment.  As State Theatre  The Lyric was destroyed by fire once again on January 3, 1948. It was subsequently rebuilt and reopened on June 30, 1949 with a new name, the State Theatre. The first film shown at the State was It Happens Every Spring starring Ray Milland and Jean Peters. Ticket prices were 35¬¢ for adults and 12¬¢ for children. On September 10, 1978, the State Theatre was closed for remodeling ‚Äî the owners split the single theater into a twin with two small screens. The last movie shown in the single auditorium State Theatre was The End with Burt Reynolds. The theater was operated as a twin by GKC for several years before it closed again in 1996. The State Theatre Group and Rotary Charities kept the theater safe from weather and time while plans were made for its future. In 1996, Barry Cole and the State Theatre Group purchased the theater from GKC and announced plans to convert the State into a performing arts complex. Then, in 2003, the State Theatre Group and Interlochen Center for the Arts announced a partnership to renovate the theater. The building was donated by Rotary Charities to the Traverse City Film Festival in May of 2007. Following a complete renovation, the Traverse City Film Festival officially reopened the State Theatre on Saturday, November 17, 2007, showing The Kite Runner.

Life He was the third son of the Polish high duke Henry II the Pious, by his wife Princess Anna, daughter of the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. After the heroic death of his father at the Battle of Legnica on 9 April 1241, Henry III was still a minor and found himself under the care of the mother together with his youngest brothers Konrad and W≈Çadys≈Çaw. In 1242, the unexpected death of his brother Mieszko, placed him in the second place immediately after his oldest brother Boles≈Çaw II the Bald. Since then, he became in the head of the political opposition in the Lower Silesia against the government of Boles≈Çaw II. =Duke of Wroc≈Çaw= Silesian partition of 1248/49, Henry's Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw in orange The first appearance of Henry III as adult was found only in 1247; however, Boles≈Çaw II didn't have any intentions to share the power with him. He only changed his mind after the revolt of his brothers, who even captured him. Henry III was made the co-ruler with his older brother. The cooperation between the brothers was not very good and a year later, under pressure from Henry III, they decided to make a division of the districts Legnica-G≈Çog√≥w-Lubusz and Wroc≈Çaw. Boles≈Çaw, as the older brother, had the opportunity to choose his district; he decided on Legnica, because gold had been discovered in the Kaczawa and Wierzbiak Rivers. Boles≈Çaw II may have hoped that Henry III encountered serious difficulties with Wroc≈Çaw (which he received in the division), so at the end the Duchy would come back to him. These expectations, however, never happened. Henry III was a strong ruler, and almost immediately he could impose his will over the powerful nobility. An additional point of the agreement was the obligation to offer hospitality to the younger brothers, Konrad and W≈Çadys≈Çaw, who were destined to the espiritual career. Henry III's successful attempts to make W≈Çadys≈Çaw entered in the Church had a total contrast with the relations between Boles≈Çaw and Konrad. Between them, were several disputes, in particular after Konrad claimed his own district and refused to become a priest. Open war between Henry III (who supported Konrad) and Boles≈Çaw II was only a matter of time. Boles≈Çaw II, without funds, began to fear the prospect of an armed conflict with his brothers. In order to obtain the necessary resources to conduct the war, he decided to sell half of Lubusz to the Archbishop of Magdeburg. Unfortunately for him, Henry III also began to seek an ally in the rulers of Meissen. Defeated, Boles≈Çaw II was forced to give the district of G≈Çog√≥w to Konrad, who wished to enforce Henry III's intervention over Legnica in 1250. When Konrad decided on Boles≈Çaw II's kidnapping, even to the ruler of Wroc≈Çaw, this was too much. All these treatments are not expected to take effect over the Duke of Wroc≈Çaw, however, as Henry III in his relations with the brothers now sought to avoid open conflicts. Only in 1253, when the authority of Boles≈Çaw II collapsed completely, Henry III helped him to return to his Duchy. =Alliance with Bohemia and war against the Greater Poland dukes= Between the 1250s and 1260s Henry III became the most powerful Piast Duke of Lower Silesia. Consequently, it was not surprising that he was active in international politics. Henry III made alliances with his relatives, the Dukes of Opole and G≈Çog√≥w, and with the Kings of Bohemia, Wenceslaus I and Ottokar II (in the years 1251, 1252, 1259, 1261 Henry III was in the royal court in Prague). The cooperation with the P≈ôemyslids, however, was not having the expected results. After Bohemia decided to interfere in the Babenberg succession of Austria with the support of the English, Henry III decided to reaffirm his alliance with them and repudiated his treaty with the rulers of Greater Poland, Przemys≈Ç I and Boles≈Çaw the Pious and the √Årp√°d dynasty. They decided to punish Henry III, and during 1253‚Äì1254 the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw was besieged and plundered. Attempts to force concessions, either by blackmail (as was the case in 1256, when the sons of Henry II the Pious took the intervention of the papal Curia, but to regain some lost by Boles≈Çaw the Pious) or bribery (the exchange of Da≈Ñkow in 1262, promised by Henry III to Boles≈Çaw the Pious and Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste if they switched to the Bohemian side) did not yield a positive result. =Internal politics and relations with the nobility= In the internal politics, Henry III stood on guard to defend the prerogatives of the Piast dynasty, and the church actively supported him, because Henry III supported Bishop Thomas of Wroc≈Çaw against Boles≈Çaw II in their disputes. This particular policy was not pleasing the Wroc≈Çaw nobility; by 1266 several riots erupted among the nobles and knights, which contributed to the premature death of the Duke. Another manifestation of Henry III's rule was the intensive German colonization of Lower Silesia, which significantly contributed to the growth and prosperity of his Duchy. Many cities were founded during this time, and in Ostr√≥w Tumski in Wroc≈Çaw a huge castle was built. Henry III also generously supported artists in his court. In the 13th century, German was the language of policy. =Revolt of 1266= The dictatorial internal politics of Henry III led to a rebellion of the townspeople. The pretext emerged in the mid-year 1266 when they tried to forced a division of the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw between Henry III and his brother Archbishop W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Salzburg. W≈Çadys≈Çaw was not the head of the revolt and this was total surprise to him. His origins are certainly among the nobility. The Polish historian Jerzy Mularczyk, had two possibles leaders of the revolt: first, the Bishop Thomas of Wroc≈Çaw, who, taking advantage from Henry III's apparent weakness, tried to strengthen the position of the church; but after watching how the Duke concentrated all the power in his hands and stripped the nobility from his privileges, he feared that this also happened with the Church hierarchy, which certainly he did not permit. The second possible leader was to be Boles≈Çaw II the Bald who hoped, in case of the eventual division of the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw and the expected death of W≈Çadys≈Çaw without heirs -because he follow the spiritual career-, recovered at least 1/3 of Wroc≈Çaw (the remaining 2/3 would be retained by Henry III, his other brother Konrad, and their descendants) for him or his successors. The rapprochement between Bishop Thomas and Boles≈Çaw II document was proved by a document, in which the Duke of Legnica called Bishop Thomas as his \\"compater noster\\", an unusual way to refer to somebody who supposed a close bond between them. However, didn't exist direct evidence for this theory. Of the revolt of the mid-year 1266 little is known, but it certainly failed, as the Duchy was not divided. =Death= Henry III wasn't time to celebrate his success, because only a few months later he suddenly died with only thirty-nine years old. Like is common in such situations, soon began the rumours about poisoning. This is reflected, in the Kronika polska written by the cisternian monk Engelbert around 1283‚Äì1285. The source of the unnatural circumstances of his death suggests that some of the Silesian Dukes maybe conspired against him, and this suggestion is not unfounded. This was proved by the last months of Henry III's life, as he spent all this time fighting against the internal opposition of his rule. Certainly there was a large group of people affected by the Duke's punishment after the end of the revolt who decided to eliminate him from the scene. The participation of the two possible leaders of the revolt of mid-1266, Bishop Thomas and Boles≈Çaw II the Bald, and seems unlikely. Their benefits from Henry III's death were small: Wroc≈Çaw passed into the hands of Henry IV, a minor, under the regency of the Archbishop W≈Çadys≈Çaw, which doesn't change the radical politics of his late brother. Henry III's dying request to extend the rule of W≈Çadys≈Çaw's regency was made with the clear purpose to reduce the suspicion of guilt against him. Guilty for his death should therefore be found primarily among those dissatisfied with the rule of knights, or divide Wroc≈Çaw. In addition to the Kronika polska, the mysterious death of Henry III was written even on his tombstone: Anno domini Millesimo, Nonas Decembris obiit veneno inclitus dux Wratislaviensis Henricus tertius, secundus filius secundi Henrici, a Thartaris. From there, this information will be received by the Chronicle of the Silesian Dukes and the Genealogy and life of St. Hedwig to Jan D≈Çugosz. The year of Henry III's death is absolutely certain, as is confirmed by all the documentary and oral sources of that time. However, there are disparities about the exact date. 3 December was confirmed as the best, although there are also sources date: 1 December, 5 December and 29 November. Henry III was buried in the Clare Church in Wroc≈Çaw, which was still under construction. Marriages and issue black crownless eagle of the Silesian Piasts On 2 June 1252, Henry III married firstly with Judith (b. 1222/25 ‚Äì d. 4 December 1257/65?), daughter of Duke Konrad I of Masovia and widow of Mieszko II the Fat, Duke of Opole. They had two children: #Hedwig (b. ca. 1256 ‚Äì d. aft. 14 December 1300), married firstly by 1271/72 to Henry, Lord of Pleissnerland -eldest son of Albert II, Margrave of Meissen-, and secondly in 1283 with Otto I, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben. #Henry IV Probus (b. ca. 1258 ‚Äì d. 24 June 1290). Shortly before his death in 1266, Henry III married secondly with Helena (b. 1247 ‚Äì d. 12 June 1309), daughter of Albert I, Duke of Saxony. They had no children.

Biography Bartlett was born in Providence, Rhode Island on October 23, 1805. In 1819 he was a student at the Lowville Academy in Lowville, New York, which he attended for two years. From 1807 to 1824 he lived in Kingston, Canada. From 1824 to 1836 he lived in Providence where he worked first as a clerk in his uncle's dry goods store (1824-1828), then as a bookkeeper and acting teller at the Bank of North America (1828-1831), and finally as the first cashier of the Globe Bank (1831-1836). In 1831, he was one of the founders of the Providence Athenaeum, and was elected its first treasurer. That year he was also elected to membership in the Rhode Island Historical Society. The following year he was ordering books for the newly founded Providence Franklin Society, an early lyceum. Over the course of his life he became involved with a number of other organizations including the New England Historic Genealogical Society, and being elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1856.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Bartlett moved to New York City in 1836, where he became a partner in the dry goods commission house of Jesup, Swift and Company. In 1840 he and his friend Charles Welford started the bookselling and publishing firm of Bartlett and Welford which was located in the Astor House hotel on the west side of Broadway between Vesey and Barclay streets. The firm, which was known for its large stock of foreign books, issued five catalogs between 1840 and 1848. While in New York, he became friends with a number of leading intellectuals, including the ethnologist and public servant Albert Gallatin. In 1842, he helped Gallatin found the American Ethnological Society. Bartlett later served as the Foreign Corresponding Secretary of the organization. Bartlett is known in the field of lexicography for his Dictionary of Americanisms (1848), a pioneering work that, although supplanted by later dialect studies, is still of value to students of language and remains a valuable contribution to the subject. Later editions were published in 1859, 1860, and 1877. The first edition was translated into Dutch and published in 1854. The third edition of 1860 was translated into German and published in 1866. The work is referenced frequently by the Oxford English Dictionary in which it is given the abbreviation \\"BARTLETT Dict. Amer.\\" Bartlett returned to Providence in 1850. From 1850 to 1853 he was the United States Boundary Commissioner responsible for surveying the boundary between the United States and Mexico. During this time he traveled with Henry Cheever Pratt throughout the Southwest. The autoethnonym of the Seri people of northwestern Mexico, Comcaac (which he wrote as \\"komkak\\"), was first recorded by Bartlett during a short visit to the area in early 1852. The word was included in the list of approximately 180 words that Bartlett archived in the Bureau of American Ethnology (now part of the National Anthropological Archives, housed at the Smithsonian). After being superseded by another commissioner upon the accession of President Franklin Pierce, he published A Personal Narrative of Explorations and Incidents in Texas, New Mexico, California, Sonora and Chihuahua (2 vols, 1854), which contains much valuable scientific and historical material concerning the area. From 1855 to 1872 Bartlett was Secretary of State of Rhode Island, and while serving in this capacity thoroughly re-arranged and classified the state records and prepared various bibliographies and compilations, relating chiefly to the history of the state. In the later years of his life he became the librarian for the John Carter Brown Library and collated an exhaustive catalog of the collection that was published in four volumes. He died in Providence on May 28, 1886. Family John Russell Bartlett was the son of Smith Bartlett and Nancy (Russell) Bartlett. He married Eliza Allen Rhodes of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island on May 15, 1831. They had seven children, including four daughters: Elizabeth Dorrance (1833-1840), Anna Russell (1835-1885), Leila (1846-1850), and Fanny Osgood (1850-1882). The last daughter was named for the poet, Frances Sargent Osgood, a friend of the family. Their three sons were Marine Corps Major Henry Anthony (1838-1901), George Francis (1840-1842), Captain, and later Rear Admiral on the Retired List, John R. Bartlett, USN, who served in the Civil War and Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and who was also a noted oceanographer. Eliza died in 1853.

The community is located primarily in Pleasant Grove Township, Alamance County, North Carolina. The tribe maintains an office in Mebane, where it carries out programs to benefit the roughly 1100 enrolled tribal members. Limited documentation exists linking members of the tribe to the historical Occaneechi and Saponi tribes. After warfare in the Southeast in the 18th century, most of the remaining Saponi tribe members went north in 1740 for protection with the Iroquois. After the American Revolution, they relocated with the Iroquois in Canada, as they had been allies of the British. After the war and migration, the Saponi disappeared from the historical record in the Southeast, in part because of racial discrimination that often included them in records only as free people of color, when the states and federal government had no category in censuses for American Indian. This was especially true in the late 19th and early 20th century, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures across the South and imposed a binary system of racial segregation. Remnant Saponi who stayed in North Carolina were mostly acculturated. The community was traditionally located at the old \\"Little Texas\\" community of Pleasant Grove Township, where the tribe owns of land. In the twentieth century, the tribe worked to revive its cultural traditions. It is developing a tribal center facility. This will include a reconstructed 1700 Occaneechi village, museum, log farm from the 1880s, community meeting space, and classroom areas. Recognition The Occaneechi- Saponi Band is recognized by the state of North Carolina. Although the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs (NCCIA) originally opposed granting recognition, an administrative law judge found that the Occaneechi-Saponi met the established guidelines and recommended that the commission grant tribal recognition to the petitioners. This recommendation became the final decision of the case when the NCCIA failed to issue a final decision within the time limits set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. ¬ß 150B-44 (1991). The NCCIA appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court of North Carolina denied review and dissolved a temporary stay in 2001. (see 354 N.C. 365, 556 S.E.2d 575 (2001). This meant that the recommendation of the administrative judge held.

He began his career as a composer writing theatre music but later devoted himself to working as an organist and composer for the Church of England. He is considered one of the outstanding 18th century English composers of church music and is best remembered today for his seven-part anthem Call to Remembrance, which has long survived in the repertoires of cathedral choirs. Biography Battishill was born in London. Beginning at the age of nine, he sang as a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral initially under the direction of composer Charles King. After his voice broke he studied organ, music composition, and singing under William Savage, almoner and master of the choristers. He became a highly skilled organist and was particularly talented at extempore playing; a skill that soon attracted attention and led to his appointment as William Boyce's deputy at the Chapel Royal.Peter Ward Jones: \\"Jonathan Battishill\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 17 December 2008), (subscription access) During the mid-1750s he began appearing as a tenor soloist in London concerts. One of his earliest engagements was on 16 March 1756 in a concert of Handel's Alexander's Feast at the Great Room, Dean Street, where he was described as 'Mr Batichel'. That same year he became the conductor and harpsichordist at the Covent Garden Theatre. While there he composed incidental songs and choruses for plays and pantomime music for both Covent Garden and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1758 he became a member of the Madrigal Society and in 1761 a member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He was also a of the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club from c1762, but lost his membership twice for not attending meetings. In 1771 his glee Come bind my hair, ye wood nymphs fair won the club's gold medal. In 1764 Battishill was appointed organist of St Clement Eastcheap, which had recently united with the parish at St Martin Orgar. Three years later he became organist at Christ Church, Newgate Street as well and served at both St Clement and Christ Church until his death in 1801. During this time he periodically gave organ concerts and he particularly became known for his performances of Handel's keyboard works. He also would still occasionally perform in concerts as a singer. He possessed an exceptional memory which was displayed in one concert where he played and sang from memory several airs from Samuel Arnold's oratorio The Prodigal Son without the sheet music, and after not hearing the work for more than 20 years. While working at Covent Garden, Battishill met singing actress Elizabeth Davies who had originated the role of Margery in Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. The two became romantically involved and on 19 December 1765 they married. However the marriage was unsuccessful, and Elizabeth had a publicly known affair with actor Anthony Webster, with whom she eventually moved to Ireland in 1776. Elizabeth died in Cork in October 1777. Battishill also had an affair with a woman who called herself Ann Battishill at the time of his death. They apparently lived together from about 1775 until the end of Battishill's life. Although Battishill was involved with another woman, his wife's desertion caused a deep depression from which he never recovered. He declined into alcoholism and his compositional output became minimal for the rest of his life. His alcoholism also resulted in his not being appointed organist of St Paul's on the death of John Jones in 1796. From 1777 on Battishill devoted himself mainly to his book collection.Jonathan Battishill at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online (subscription access) From the time he was a boy he was an avid reader, and throughout his life he had collected some 6000 to 7000 volumes in his personal library. He was mostly interested in theological works and the works of classical authors. In 1801 Battishill was buried in St Paul's near the grave of William Boyce in keeping with his own wishes. Works Most of Battishill's compositions date from the period 1760‚Äì1775, and reflect his diverse employments during this time. He began his career primarily as a composer of theatre music; writing mostly incidental music for plays. He composed the music for one pantomime, The Rites of Hecate, which used a text by poet James Love. It premiered at Drury Lane on 26 December 1763. He also notably co-composed the music to the three-act opera Almena with Michael Arne, the son of Thomas Arne, which premiered in 1764 at Drury Lane. The opera was a theatrical failure, but critics of the day attributed its lack of success to dramatic faults on the part of the librettist Rolt, rather than to problems with the music. He also wrote several songs for London's pleasure gardens, of which Kate of Aberdeen is probably his best known. Upon taking his first organist post in 1764, Battishill composed chiefly church music, glees, catches, madrigals, and part-songs. He was particularly prolific in his output of Anglican chant (used for the psalms and canticles), hymns, and anthems. His anthems are considered his most exemplary work and are admired for employing rich blends in a multi-voiced arrangement. His anthems included O Lord, Look Down from Heaven and Call to Remembrance, the latter of which was sung at his own funeral and is still performed in cathedrals today. Of his glees, I Loved Thee Beautiful and Kind is probably his best known work. His chants also remain in use.

Emergency ‚Äì Ward 10 Girls Annual (1960s) Carrington's first show on BBC Radio 2 called All Time Greats ran from 4 October 1981 to 29 August 2004. It was broadcast for two hours every Sunday from 1pm. Although initially pre-recorded and broadcast from a BBC studio, his first live broadcast from his home in Perthshire was on 31 August 1997, which was the day that Diana, Princess of Wales, died and Carrington agreed that it would be inappropriate to use the pre-recorded show on that day. His second show on the network, called 'The Music Goes Round' ran from 31 August 2004 until his final broadcast on 28 October 2016, and originally aired in an hourly slot on a Tuesday evening, until it was moved to Friday evenings commencing on 9 April 2010. Both shows used a usual weekly theme of music, an occasional special 50s and musical editions. He introduced every show with the greeting \\"Evening all, from home in Perthshire\\" and then always ended his show with \\"Bye just now!\\" and \\"...of course, thank you for having us [the \\"us\\" emphasised] at your place\\" not forgetting a reference to his cat, \\"Golden Paws\\" Sam.

He had suffered cancer and Alzheimer's disease for several years and suffered heart failure for the second time on Christmas Day 2015. He opened his last show with the same song that had opened 'All Time Greats' in 1981, \\"Up, Up and Away\\" by the Johnny Mann Singers, and closed it with Mel Torm√©'s \\"That's All\\". He thanked listeners, without whom, he said \\"the whole thing would have been quite pointless\\". Carrington was praised by BBC Director-General Tony Hall who said: Death Carrington died on 1 February 2017 at the age of 90. His death was announced on BBC Radio 2's 8:00pm news bulletin and it was stated that he had been battling both cancer and Alzheimer's disease for several years.

Kalkaska sand was identified in 1927 and named after Kalkaska County located in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This soil is a multi-layer soil composed of humus, light sand, dark sand, and yellowish sand. It is classified as a spodosol. The distinctive sand layers can range from black to yellowish-brown and are commonly 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m) deep. Kalkaska sand is well- drained and effectively filters water. This makes it a valuable asset in forestry and certain types of agriculture. It is also largely responsible for the remarkable water quality of lakes and rivers located in areas of the state where these soils are abundant. Kalkaska sand is one of more than 500 soils found in Michigan. Unique to the state, Kalkaska Sand covers nearly 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) in 29 Upper and Lower Peninsula counties.

Around a thousand prisoners were held there. Originally these were Italians, but later most of them were moved out and it held German PoWs.

During his 25 years (1947‚Äì1973) on the faculty at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, in Alfred, New York (a division of the State University of New York), he built an international reputation as a potter, sculptor and authority on studio pottery. Background Born and raised in Fort Dodge, Iowa, the son of Daniel J and Margaret Agnes (Brennan) Rhodes, he began his art career by enrolling in summer courses at the Art Institute of Chicago. He attended the University of Chicago for four years (1929‚Äì1933), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in art history. He worked with Iowa painter Grant Wood for two summers (1932 and 1933) at the Stone City Art Colony, and then also studied at the Art Students League of New York (1933‚Äì34), where his teacher was Regionalist painter John Steuart Curry. From 1935 to 1938, Rhodes lived in Fort Dodge, where he worked as a painter and muralist, participated in the Fort Dodge Art Guild, and lectured at the Blanden Art Gallery (now the Blanden Memorial Art Museum). While living in Iowa, he participated actively in the state's art circles, and frequently exhibited at the Iowa State Fair, where he won an unprecedented three consecutive annual sweepstakes awards for oil painting from 1938 to 1940, outdistancing a record held by Grant Wood. After additional study in 1940 at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center (where he began to work with clay), Rhodes entered the graduate program at New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where, in 1942, he became the first person to graduate from that school's Master of Fine Arts program. Murals Rhodes received several mural commissions from the Section of Painting and Sculpture. The first, titled Storm Lake (1937), was created for the post office at Storm Lake, Iowa. Later, when a new post office was built, the mural was relocated to the public library. In the same year, Rhodes and another Iowa painter named Howard C. Johnson were commissioned to create a large mural (110 feet wide by high), planned for installation in the Agricultural Building at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines. Titled Where tillage begins, other arts follow, the project was a commemoration of Iowa agriculture: planting, harvesting, production, and the meat packing industry. Unfortunately, it soon became the subject of a public derision. Opinionated passersby complained about factual inaccuracies in the mural, claimed that the figures of Iowans were too solemn, and objected to what they considered to be a style that was ‚Äútoo modern.‚Äù In 1946, Iowa State Fair Board Secretary Lloyd Cunningham ordered that the mural be taken down and that the dismantled pieces be used as scrap lumber. Apparently, all that now survives of the mural are a few photographs. Another mural, at Marion, Iowa, is titled Communication by Mail (1939). Rhodes painted this mural in the time-honored technique of fresco-secco, directly onto the Post Office's lobby wall. It features the role of the railroad in transporting mail. The Post Office was decommissioned and sold to the city of Marion in 1968. The city used the building as the City Hall until 2005. The building sat empty for a year before being bought by a bank. In June 2008, Anton Rajer a professional fine art conservator from Green Bay, WI will begin work to move the mural to the Marion Heritage Center. The mural is estimated to weigh approximately 2,000‚Äì3,000 pounds, and will be removed from the building in one piece by a team of contractors. Rhodes created a mural, Airmail (1941), for the U.S. Post Office in Piggott, Arkansas. On April 10, 2019, in Piggott, the US Postal Service released a series of postage stamps featuring post office murals, including \\"Airmail.\\" The Postal Service planned to produce 30 million of the stamps. His success in completing these projects led to Rhodes being commissioned for New Deal art projects in other states, including post office murals at Clayton, Missouri (now at the Federal Building in Des Moines), and Glen Ellyn, Illinois; and a cafeteria mural in the main U.S. Navy building in Washington, D.C. Later career In 1939-40, Rhodes taught at the Art Students‚Äô Workshop in Des Moines, and was also a guest lecturer at the Ottumwa Art Center and Iowa State University. In 1940, he married the former Lillyan Estelle Jacobs of Des Moines, a potter, sculptor and figurative painter whom he had met at Stone City. They raised two children, a daughter (Lorna) and a son (Aaron). Lillyan Rhodes died in 1986. After completing his MFA at Alfred University, the Rhodes remained in that area, where he worked as a designer for Glidden Pottery. In 1943, they moved to California, where he worked in San Jose as a researcher in high heat ceramics for the Henry J. Kaiser Corporation. Three years later, they moved to Menlo Park, California, where in 1947 they built a full-scale ceramic studio, and created thrown and cast ware for Gump's, the San Francisco department store. During the same period, Rhodes was briefly on the faculties at Stanford University (1946) and the San Francisco Art Institute (1946‚Äì47). In 1947, they returned to New York State, where Rhodes joined the art department faculty of his alma mater, the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where he taught from 1947 to 1973. While at Alfred University, Rhodes also taught summer sessions in ceramics at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles (1952‚Äì53); Black Mountain College, Asheville, North Carolina; and the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, Deer Isle, Maine (1961). Rhodes later taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz (1977‚Äì80). In the last phase of his life, Rhodes married Mary Beth Coulter. At the start of a two-month tour of college campuses, he was conducting a workshop at Sierra Nevada College when he was stricken by a heart attack and died in Reno, Nevada, in July 1989, aged 78. Awards, honors and collections Rhodes was the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship and lived in Japan from 1962-63. The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (NCECA) awarded him a medal of citation for his contributions to teaching in 1973. His accomplishments were recognized by major retrospectives at the Blanden Memorial Art Museum, Fort Dodge, Iowa (1973), and at Iowa State University, Ames (1986). Rhodes' work is in permanent collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London); National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto (Japan); Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC); Museum of Contemporary Crafts (New York); Des Moines Art Center (Des Moines, Iowa); Blanden Memorial Art Museum (Fort Dodge, Iowa); and Cornell University (Ithaca, New York). In June 2011, a Facebook page, \\"Daniel Rhodes Centennial\\", was established to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth.

Paranormal romance focuses on romantic love and includes elements beyond the range of scientific explanation, blending together themes from the speculative fiction genres of fantasy, science fiction, and horror. Paranormal romance may range from traditional category romances, such as those published by Harlequin Mills & Boon, with a paranormal setting to stories where the main emphasis is on a science fiction or fantasy-based plot with a romantic subplot included. Common hallmarks are romantic relationships between humans and vampires, shapeshifters, ghosts, and other entities of a fantastic or otherworldly nature. Beyond the more prevalent themes involving vampires, shapeshifters, ghosts, or time travel, paranormal romances can also include books featuring characters with psychic abilities, like telekinesis or telepathy. Paranormal romance has its roots in Gothic fiction. Its most recent revival has been spurred by turn of the 21st century technology, e.g. the internet and electronic publishing. Paranormal romances are one of the fastest growing trends in the romance genre. Examples of authors specializing in this genre include Dani Harper, Nalini Singh, Jessica Bird, Kresley Cole, Christine Feehan, Kelley Armstrong, and Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series. According to 2013 statistics by the fantasy publisher Tor Books, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal romance, 57% are women and 43% are men, whereas men outnumber women by about two to one in writing historical, epic or high fantasy. (See full statistics) Definition and subgenres Paranormal romance blends the real with the fantastic or science fictional. The fantastic elements may be woven into an alternate version of our own world in an urban fantasy involving vampires, demons, and/or werewolves, or they may be more \\"normal\\" manifestations of the paranormal--humans with psychic abilities, witches, or ghosts. Time travel, futuristic, and extraterrestrial romances also fall beneath the paranormal umbrella. These novels often blend elements of other subgenres, including suspense and mystery, with their fantastic themes. A few paranormals are set solely in the past and are structured much like any historical romance novel. Others are set in the future, sometimes on different worlds. Still others have a time-travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into the past or the future. Between 2002 and 2004, the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year. A popular title in the genre can sell over 500,000 copies. As in the fantasy subgenre known as urban fantasy, many paranormal romances rely on the blend of contemporary life with the existence of supernatural or magically-empowered beings, human or otherwise; sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst, sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternative worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance. Others develop the alternate reality meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality. The first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, Jayne Ann Krentz's Sweet Starfire, was published in 1986 and was a \\"classic road trip romance\\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. This genre has become much more popular since 2000. Krentz attributes the popularity of this subgenre to the fact that the novels \\"are, at heart, classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds\\". Time- travel romances are a version of the classic \\"fish out of water\\" story. In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time- travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience, and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one in which they have landed. Some writers choose to end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together‚Äîto the displeasure of many readers of the genre. P.E.A.R.L. The P.E.A.R.L. (Paranormal Excellence Award for Romantic Literature) was a reader's choice award, presented annually to the top-voted paranormal romances by the ParaNormal Romance Groups naming the \\"best of year\\" in ten categories related to paranormal romance and romantic science fiction. Authors such as Nora Roberts, Jayne Ann Krentz, Kresley Cole, Linnea Sinclair and Christine Feehan have written under this genre and won P.E.A.R.L.s. It has not been active since 2008.

Over her career, she was also credited as Collin Wilcox-Horne or Collin Wilcox-Paxton. Wilcox may be best known for her role in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), in which she played Mayella Violet Ewell, whose false claim of being raped by a Black man (her father was the rapist) sparks the trial at the center of the film. Early years Wilcox was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and moved with her family to Highlands, North Carolina, as a baby. Her interest in theater was sparked by her parents, Jack H. and Virginia Wilcox, who founded the Highlands Community Theater (now known as the Highlands Playhouse) in 1939. She attended the University of Tennessee, where she studied drama. Career Wilcox made her professional debut in Chicago as part of the improvisational group, The Compass Players, which included Mike Nichols, Elaine May, and Shelley Berman. Playing opposite Richard Basehart, Kevin McCarthy, and William Hansen, Wilcox won the Clarence Derwent Award for her performance in The Day The Money Stopped by Maxwell Anderson and Brendan Gill, which lasted only three nights on Broadway in 1958. She starred in the 1961 play Look, We've Come Through with Burt Reynolds on Broadway. She replaced another actress in the 1963 revival of Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude and then went on to do the 1965 play The Family Way, both on Broadway. A life member of The Actors Studio, Wilcox is perhaps best known for her role in the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird, in which she played Mayella Violet Ewell, who falsely accuses Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of raping her. Following that cinematic acting success, she performed two very memorable roles for television in 1964: The Twilight Zone episode \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You\\" and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode \\"The Jar\\", based on the Ray Bradbury short story. She appeared as Bess Frye in a 1972 episode of Gunsmoke titled \\"Jubilee\\". In 1974, she co-starred with Peter Falk and Robert Conrad in the Columbo episode \\"An Exercise in Fatality\\" as Ruth Stafford. She remained active performing both on television and in films. Her final role was that of Mrs. Kline in the movie A Touch of Fate, which was released in 2003, six years before her death. Civil rights activism She recalled receiving \\"unfriendly looks\\" when she showed up at an NAACP conference in Monterey, California, where an official had to remind participants: \\"Collin is here at this conference because she believes in the cause. She is not the character in the film.\\" This was due to the fact that, in the film To Kill a Mockingbird, she played a white woman who falsely accused Tom Robinson, a black man, of raping her. Death On October 14, 2009, Wilcox died from brain cancer, aged 74, at her home in Highlands, North Carolina. She was cremated and her ashes returned to her family.

Registration pins are used in offset printing and cartography, in order to accurately position the different films or plates for multi-color work. In traditional, hand-drawn animation, the registration pins are often called pegs, and are attached to a peg bar. Also, in traditional, hand-taped printed circuit board artwork, usually at two or four times actual size. Sometimes on a single transparent base, usually mylar, with Layer 1 being on the front and Layer 2 being on the back, in red and green, respectively, for later \\"separation\\" into component parts using a process camera. Motion picture cameras and related applications In motion picture cameras, the pin(s) hold the film immovable during exposure. In certain \\"professional\\" motion picture cameras and \\"step\\" printers, there may be two registration pins: one is called the \\"big pin\\" and it is employed for primary (axial and lateral) registration while the other one is called the \\"little pin\\" and it is employed for secondary (axial) registration. With the \\"big pin\\"/\\"little pin\\" concept, it is not required to employ side pressure or other means to guide the film through the intermittent movement with absolute precision as the \\"big pin\\" is fully fitting in the perforation (the \\"little pin\\" is not fully fitting in width, but is fully fitting in height; this difference accommodates slight changes in the dimensions of the film media due to changes in relative humidity and possibly other factors such as media age). This system is employed primarily in high-end \\"professional\\" cameras in the West. In the East (the former Soviet Union and its former Satellites), a single registration pin, corresponding to the \\"big pin\\", is employed along with side pressure. Additionally, Western \\"professional\\" cameras always employ Bell and Howell (BH) pins whereas Eastern \\"professional\\" cameras generally employ Kodak Standard (KS) pins, which standard was originally recommended by the Western standards organizations, but was soundly rejected by Western studios and camera equipment manufacturers. Western \\"professional\\" cameras provided to the East during World War II's Lend-Lease program were generally converted to KS pins by the receiving country. To further improve upon registration accuracy, the perforations which are utilized for registration are never used for film advancement (i.e., for pull-down). The above description applies to \\"professional\\" applications, which is generally taken to mean film gauges larger than 16mm (i.e., 35mm and 65/70mm). For 16mm, only, a modified strategy is generally employed, at least for \\"step\\" printers which utilize 1R (single- row) perforations. The lower pin, the \\"big pin\\", will be fully fitting in the axial and lateral dimensions but the upper pin, the \\"little pin\\", will be fully fitting in the lateral dimension only, for the same reason that the \\"professional's\\" \\"little pin\\" is fully fitting in the axial dimension only. This, then, also accomplishes absolute precision, but within the context of \\"sub-professional\\" film gauges. For practical reasons, the 1R 16mm \\"little pin\\" is usually spaced two perforations above the 16mm \\"big pin\\". Again for 16mm, only, certain cameras and \\"step\\" printers which utilize 2R (two-row) perforations may employ the same strategy as for \\"professional\\" applications, but 2R is seldom utilized except for certain high-speed photography and almost never for duplication or prints.

It contains several mosques built during the Bengal Sultanate in the 15th-century, of which the Sixty Dome Mosque is the largest. Other mosques include the Singar Mosque, the Nine Dome Mosque, the Tomb of Khan Jahan, the Bibi Begni Mosque and the Ronvijoypur Mosque. The mosques were built during the governorship of Ulugh Khan Jahan, a Turkic military officer appointed as governor in the Sundarbans by Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal. The site was a \\"mint town\\" of the Bengal Sultanate. Bagerhat has one of the largest concentrations of sultanate-era mosques in Bangladesh. The historic city, listed by Forbes as one of the 15 lost cities of the world, has more than 50 structures built in the local Bengal Sultanate variant style of Indo-Islamic architecture. This is sometimes called the 'Khan Jahan Style'. These were uncovered after removing the vegetation that had obscured them from view for many centuries. The site has been recognised by UNESCO in 1983 under criteria (iv), \\"as an outstanding example of an architectural ensemble which illustrates a significant stage in human history\\", of which the Sixty Dome Mosque with actually 60 pillars and 77 domes, is the most well known. The mosques feature terracotta artwork and arabesque. Geography The mosque city is situated in southern Bengal near the vast estuary of the Bengal delta. It is located from the coast of the Bay of Bengal. The city is spread over an area of , on the banks of the moribund branch of the Bhairab River along a stretch (in an east‚Äìwest direction and about width in north‚Äìsouth direction), which was part of the Sundarbans mangrove forests. Today all monuments are set in the unspoilt environment of what is now farmlands, surrounded by palm trees. History Terrocotta arabesque on a corner wall, Sixty Dome Mosque The Bengal Sultanate appointed Ulugh Khan Jahan as its governor in the Sundarbans in southern Bengal during the 15th-century. Ulugh Khan Jahan was a person of Turkic-origin. The title of Ulugh was common to rulers from the Turco-Persian tradition. The Bengal Sultanate attracted many immigrants from the Middle East and Central Asia, who brought with them ideas of Islamic architecture. Sufism was employed by Muslim missionaries to attract the local population. The high concentration of mosques suggests the rapidity with which the local population converted to Islam. According to sultanate taka, it was built in the 15th century and was known by the name of Khalifatabad during the 16th century. Ulugh Khan Jahan administered an area covering parts of present-day Khulna Division and Barisal Division in Bangladesh. Inscriptions in Bagerhat indicate that the mosque was built during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah between 1450 and 1459. Interestingly, Mahmud Shah was also responsible for transferring Bengal's capital from Pandua to Gauda. The reign of Mahmud Shah was marked by significant architectural development. In south Bengal, the mosque city of Bagerhat displays the simplistic 'Khan Jahan Style' of Bengali Islamic architecture. Ulugh Khan Jahan was responsible for establishing a planned township with roads, bridges, and water supply tanks (of which the Ghoradighi and Dargadighi still survive), cisterns, and several mosques and tombs. Ulugh Khan Jahan was a Sufi. In 1895, an extensive survey of the area was conducted by the Archaeological Survey of British India, and restoration was put into effect in 1903‚Äì04 on the Sixty Dome Mosque. In 1907-8 part of the roof and 28 domes were restored. In 1982‚Äì83, UNESCO drew up a master plan for the Bagerhat area and it became a World Heritage Site in 1985. Architecture Corner tower, Nine Dome Mosque The planning of the city is distinctly dominated by Islamic architecture style; in particular, the embellishments are a combination of various styles, including Bengali, Persian and Arab. The city covered 360 mosques (most of them of identical designs), many public buildings, mausoleums, bridges, network of roads and water reservoirs. The material used in building construction was baked bricks, which over the centuries deteriorated under saline conditions of the soil and the atmosphere. The layout, revealed after the recent removal of the vegetative growth around the historic city, indicates that the city developed in two distinct zones; the main zone is the Mosque of Shait Gumbaz and its precincts and the other zone to its east is the one encircling the Mausoleum of Khan Jahan. The two zones are separated by a distance of . The minarets embellish the front corners of the mosques. They stand at double the height of the facade. The towers at the rear corners are also similarly fashioned. The minarets are double storied and round in shape; projecting cornices surround the shafts up to the middle height of the minarets and a window fitted at this mid height provides ventilation and light. A spiral staircase in this minar leads to the top. Artificial tusks of elephants decorate the exterior of the minarets. Mosques The following includes a partial list of mosques, tombs or mausoleums, and other monuments which have been restored from among the large number of ruins in the city. =Sixty Dome Mosque= Minaret of the Sixty Dome Mosque The Sixty Dome Mosque, on the eastern bank of a water tank or pond (the takur dighi), is one of the oldest mosques in the country and is described as a \\"historic mosque representing the Golden Era of Muslim Bengal\\". It is laid is over an area of by . The mosque is unique in that it has 60 pillars that support 77 exquisitely curved \\"low squat domes\\" that have worn away over time; it has seven central domes that are four-sided and built in Bengali style. It was established in 1440 by Khan Jahan Ali. It was used for prayers, as an assembly hall and madrasa (an Islamic school). Seventy seven domes are over the roof and four smaller ones at the four corners are towers (the towers were used to call the faithfuls to attend prayers). The large prayer hall has 11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south which provide ventilation and light to the hall. There are 7 longitudinal aisles and 11 deep bays in the midst of slim columns made of stone. These columns support the curving arches that are overlaid by the domes. The west wall in the interior has eleven mihrabs that are decorated with stonework and terracotta and the flooring is brickwork. The walls and the mihrabs were affected by sulphates. Most of the damage has been rectified. The arches are thick with a slight taper over the hollow and round walls. The mosque also functioned as the court of Khan Jahan Ali. It now attracts a large number of tourists and visitors. The mosque is decorated mostly with terracotta and bricks.:File:Shat Gambuj Mosque (4).jpg =Nine Dome Mosque= Mihrab of the Nine Dome Mosque The Nine Dome Mosque is located to the west of the takur dighi tank and built in the 15th century. It is located near Khan Jahan Ali's tomb. Its western wall conventionally faces west towards Mecca, where the mihrab is inset; terracotta floral scrolls and flower motifs are the decorations seen around the mihrab. Circular towers are provided in the four corners. The walls of the mosque support a large central dome which has eight smaller domes around it. This structure was also affected by sulphates. It has been since substantially restored. Close to this mosque are the Zinda Pir Mosque and mazar (tomb), which are in ruins. =Singar Mosque= The Singar Mosque is across the road from the Sixty Dome Mosque on its southeastern side. It is a square shaped single dome mosque. In what is typical to the Khan Jahan Style, the dome is supported on thick walls and topped with a cambered cornice. The Bigi Begni Mosque and the Chuna Khola Mosque are also single domed but much larger in size. =Ronvijoypur Mosque= The Ronvijoypur Mosque has the largest dome in Bangladesh. It is of width supported by arches and pendentives. The corners have tapering circular turrets while the external cornice has a slight curve. The mosque's interior is plain. However, the main mihrabs have decorations of floral patterns. It is located on the opposite side of the Khan Jahan Tomb on the Khulna-Bagerhat Road. It was built in the Khan Jahan style of architecture. It has been renovated many times in the past during the 1960s and 70s. However, it needs further repair work to prevent dampness inside the tomb, and also to the brickwork on the exterior surfaces. =Chuna Khola Mosque= Mihrab in Chuna Khola Mosque The Chuna Khola Mosque, built in the 15th century, is located in the midst of rice fields in the village of Chuna Khola (named after the limestone extraction that was in vogue here in the past). It has been identified as representing a transition from the Khan Jahan style monuments. It is a square building with thick walls. It has three entrances on the east and one each on the northern and southern sides also. It has three mihrabs with the central mihrab being the largest in size and projecting outwards. It has a hemispherical dome with frontal arches. There are also squinches and half domes. It is distinctly different from the Khan Jahan style mosque in its exterior decorations, particularly the east fa√ßade, which depicts four rectangular panels bordered by foliated scrolls with merlons having plant motifs. It has four turrets with curved cornices. The brick walls, in particular, were damaged due to sulphate effect. It was renovated in the 1980s according to guidelines set by UNESCO. =Tomb of Khan Jahan= The Khan Jahan Mausoleum or tomb is located on the northern bank of a water tank (a pond infested with crocodiles) called thakur dighi in Bengali language. The pond is square in shape and the excavated material from the tank was used to make an embankment over which the Mausoleum has been built. The pond is approached through a flight of broad and steep steps built from the embankment. It has a single domes structure built over a plan of square. The building was made of brick walls over five layers of dressed stone which forms the basement. From recorded sources of 1866, it is also mentioned that the flooring had been inlaid with hexagonal encaustic tiles of different designs and colours (mostly blue, white and yellow). However, in its present condition such type of tiles are seen only on a few steps on the Mausoleum itself. The tomb has black stones have been used in making the tomb and it is made of three steps. Verses from the Koran are inscribed in Arabic and Persian. There are inscriptions on the walls of the crypt which are inferred as providing historical information about Ulugh Khan Jahan's life. After retirement, Khan Jahan spent his retired life here and after his death on 25 October 1459, his tomb was preserved here. It is now pilgrimage site where people pay homage to the man who dedicated his lifetime to building the city and its monuments. The Pir Ali Tomb (of Pir Ali, a close associate of Khan Jahan) is an annexe building to this mausoleum and is of identical layout. A mosque called the Dargha Mosque is attached to the mausoleum. Museum Bagerhat Museum A small museum has been established by the Directorate of Archaeology of Bangladesh, in collaboration with UNESCO, in front of the Shait Gumbaz Mosque, where antiquaries collected from the area of the historical site are displayed providing knowledge on the history of Bagerhat. It has three exhibit galleries of antiquaries related to the \\"Historic Mosque City of Bagerhat\\", which include inscriptions, potteries, terracotta plaques and ornamental bricks. Pictures of important historic buildings of Bangladesh are also part of the exhibits here.

The site is located in Stafford County, Virginia, along the northern bank of the Rappahannock River, across from the city of Fredericksburg. In July 2008, archaeologists announced that they had found remains of the boyhood home, which had suffered a fire during 1740, including artifacts such as pieces of a cream-colored tea set probably belonging to George's mother, Mary Ball Washington. In 2015, the George Washington Foundation began constructing a replica of Washington's boyhood home on the site of the original building. The replica house was completed in 2018 and is open to the public.  History  The farm was named after the Washington family had left the property. Its namesake was a free ferry that crossed the Rappahannock River on Washington land‚Äîthe family did not own or operate it. It is unclear what the farm was called during the Washington occupancy. Sometime in the late 19th century the farm became known as Pine Grove, as well as The Ferry Farm. The farm rose to national prominence during the Washington Birth Bicentennial of 1932‚Äîduring the years surrounding this celebration some authors cited both the names Ferry Farm and Pine Grove. =Before Washington= Over thousands of years, American Indians periodically inhabited the lands that today make up Ferry Farm. Archaeological finds include a spear point made over 10,000 years ago by a big-game hunter, numerous tools associated with bands of hunter/gatherers, and pottery created by native farmers. The first European claim on the property was a land patent granted to John Catlett in 1666. By 1710, the tract had been subdivided into several small farms, with Maurice Clark in ownership of what would become Ferry Farm. In 1727, the property was sold to William Strother, a lawyer, and a Burgess for the newly formed King George County. In 1738, George Washington's father, Augustine, acquired the plantation from the Strother estate. Augustine Washington held political office, owned several thriving plantations, and was a managing partner of Accokeek Iron Furnace located six miles north of Ferry Farm on a tributary of the Potomac River. He moved to Ferry Farm in the fall of 1738 with his second wife, Mary Ball Washington, and their five young children. =Washington-era= George Washington's biographers could claim three locations significant as his homesteads through his lifetime. Pope's Creek, Virginia from 1732-1735 was his birthplace. Little Hunting Creek, later to be renamed Mount Vernon by elder brother Lawrence after his 1743 inheritance of the property was briefly the family home to Augustine and Mary Washington and their brood of five including his third son George, from 1735-1738.Philip Levy, Where the Cherry Tree Grew (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2013) 55, 76 The Washington-era farm, then referred to by others as the Washington Farm and by the Washingtons as the Home Farm, had a 1¬Ω-story central-passage house, two rooms deep, perched atop a bluff on the Rappahannock River. It was built by Augustine Washington. Based on excavations at the site in 2008, the structure was approximately wide by deep. It was the second of five houses at the site. George was six when the family moved to the farm in 1738. He inherited the farm and lived in the house until his early 20s. However, George Washington was not sentimental about the land. Washington saw the land as a \\"crowded, busy, trouble-filled place of limited options.\\"Phil Levy, Where The Cherry Tree Grew: The Story of Ferry Farm, George Washington's Boyhood Home (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2013) Washington's father Augustine had left behind a small set of surveying instruments after he died. At the age of 16 Washington used his father's surveying tools to survey for prominent Virginia grandees and instantly became hooked; George Washington had found his first true calling. Surveying linked George to his brother Lawrence and the Fairfaxes.Phil Levy, Where The Cherry Tree Grew: The Story of Ferry Farm, George Washington's Boyhood Home (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2013) 68 At age 18 Washington was granted a 453-acre tract in western Frederick County by Lord Fairfax. Washington surveyed the 453 acres of land and also purchased an adjoining tract. Washington soon had acquired close to two thousand acres in western lands. Washington had acquired more land through his own hard work than Ferry Farm would be worth in the three years Washington had to wait to legally claim Ferry Farm.Phil Levy, Where The Cherry Tree Grew: The Story of Ferry Farm, George Washington's Boyhood Home (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2013) 70 He often stayed with his half-brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon. Washington's mother lived in the house until 1772, when she moved to Fredericksburg, and the farm was sold to a friend Hugh Mercer. The Washington-era house was in ruinous condition by 1833. =After Washington= A new farmhouse was built at the site in 1850 for the use of an overseer. It was the site of skirmishing during the American Civil War in 1862. Throughout the Civil War, the area surrounding Ferry Farm was prone to encounters between Confederate and Union armies due to a concentration of ferry and train traffic. Because of these encounters, many significant battles occurred in the city surrounding Ferry Farm, although no battles occurred on the actual site. Ferry Farm was periodically occupied by Union Soldiers as a war campground, which military personnel used to prepare for battle.Philip Levy, \\"' Crystallized into Solid Reality' How Mason Locke 'Parson' Weems Shaped George Washington's Boyhood Home\\", Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 121, No. 2 In 1862, amid the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln, familiar with Weems' Washington myths, toured Ferry Farm. While occupying the Farm, many soldiers familiar with the Cherry Tree Myth, carved trinkets, such as rings, from a tree they believed to be the myth. Much of the farm was destroyed during this time. Another new farmhouse was built during the 1870s, along with many outbuildings. A surviving \\"surveyor's shed\\" is a remnant of this period. One of the post-Washington farmhouses at Ferry FarmNote: In some contexts, like on this circa 1900-1920 Library of Congress photograph and in the referenced 1926 'Boys' Life article, the Farm is also referred to as \\"Pine Grove Farm\\". Since the 1920s the property has been the subject of many preservation and money-making schemes. James Beverly Colbert sought to profit from the land's associations with Washington. The writer George Allan England agreed to write real-estate ads promoting the historical value of the land for a $5,000 fee upon the land's sale. He made full use of the many Weem's tales. Colbert also helped promote the thought that a non- important structure called \\"The Surveyor Shed,\\" was a genuine relic, though it was not. Since the bicentennial celebration of George Washington's Birthday was approaching, Colbert and England thought the land would sell quickly, but there were other historical sites vying for preservation and the Great Depression finally killed their dream. In each subsequent decade, different groups of preservationists have tried to make a \\"national shrine\\" out of Washington's boyhood home. The 1960s saw the creation of a home for troubled boys on the site. This project left on the landscape the site's most visible feature‚Äîa large pseudo-Georgian building which now houses a museum, offices, and archaeological lab, which, since 2006, is viewable for visitors. In the 1990s Stafford County's Board of Supervisors set out to both preserve the site and bring business to the county. Their attempts ultimately led to rezoning and a bid by Wal-Mart to buy the property and construct a large store adjacent to the boyhood site. This was opposed by many in Fredericksburg, which would have been able to see the back of the store from town. There was a widespread feeling that such a change in this historical town's viewshed would have had adverse effects on the town's crucial tourist trade as well as harming the town's charm and quality of life. The result was a deal whereby Historic Kenmore (the circa 1770s Fredericksburg home of Washington's sister Betty Washington Lewis and her husband Fielding Lewis), in conjunction with the National Park Service and commonwealth funds, purchased the site. Historic Kenmore became George Washington's Fredericksburg Foundation and in 2008 The George Washington Foundation. This foundation oversees both sites as well as Augustine Washington's ironworks at Accokeek (Potomac) Furnace (1726~ 56) in Stafford County, part of the Principio Company.GW Foundation site It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000. (version scanned and made available by Virginia DHR) (version scanned and made available by Virginia DHR) Extensive archaeological investigations began in 2002 under the direction of David Muraca (formerly of Colonial Williamsburg) and Philip Levy of the University of South Florida. The goal of the excavations is to locate and understand the original Washington farm complex. In 2008, Levy and Muraca announced that one of three sites excavated yielded the original home site, including foundations of a 53 by home. The home had suffered a small fire during George Washington's lifetime. In 2018 a replica of the original home was completed above these foundations and guided tours are offered on a daily basis. Ferry Farm also runs children's programs and other public events. It is located at 237 King's Highway (Virginia Route 3), near Fredericksburg. A building associated with George Washington's surveying work is listed at 712 King's Highway.George Washington Surveying Office, 712 King's Highway, Falmouth vicinity, Stafford County, VA, HABS Preservation=Wal-Mart Controversy= Samuel Warren and Irma Warren bought the land in 1969. The Warrens were interested in historical preservation and kept the property in the family for nearly 30 years but they eventually sought to rezone the land as a B-1 commercial lot. They then reached an agreement with Stafford County, with the county agreeing to rezoning a parcel of the land, and the Warrens agreeing to donate 24 acres surrounding the Colbert house. The sale, however, marked the start of a long controversy between commercial interests and proponents of national heritage. Robert Siegrist entered the controversy and expressed an interest in maintaining the land that was recently donated to Stafford County. Siegrist maintained the property for 4 years until early on the morning of September 26, 1994 when a fire broke out at the Colbert house. Stafford County quickly ended its relationship with Siegrist and looked for alternate applications of the property. In 1995, the Walmart corporation sought the land surrounding the Washington Site, and worked to purchase it. Included in the purchase was a promise that the site heritage would be preserved through a columned plaza with \\"special tributes to George and the Cherry Tree.\\" However, there was a large opposition including Fredericksburg small business owners, local historical preservationists, and many national organizations such as Daughters of the American Revolution. The conflict came to a head on April 1, 1995 after the review board assigned to the task rejected Walmart's offer. =Archaeology= The George Washington Foundation purchased the land in 1996 and since 2003 has supported an archeological field school at the site. The summer excavations are led by Philip Levy (associate professor of history at the University of South Florida) and David Muraca (who previously worked at Colonial Williamsburg). Digs are organized through university groups and consist of undergraduate and graduate volunteers. Archeologists and volunteers have found artifacts dating from the prehistoric period through the Civil War and beyond. =The House= The pathway leading to the replica Washington house. In 2006-2008 the archeology team headed by Muraca and Levy, funded by the George Washington Foundation, found the cellar to, and thus the location of George Washington's boyhood home. Using the remains of the building and the artifacts within, they have dated the feature to the 1740s, the time when the Washingtons lived on the land. In 2015, groundbreaking began on a replica house built above the original foundations using information gleaned from the archaeological remains, contemporary descriptions of the original house, and knowledge of similar houses in Colonial Virginia. The house was built using eighteenth-century building techniques by experts in colonial craftsmanship, and completed and opened to the public in 2018. It is stocked with reproductions of the furniture and objects listed in Augustine Washington's probate inventory as having been in the house when he died in 1743. Since they are reproductions, tour guides encourage guests to interact with all of the objects in the house, allowing them to sit on the furniture, open cabinets, and handle objects. =Foundation and Museum= The George Washington Foundation now owns the land as well as Kenmore, the Fredericksburg home of Washington's sister Betty and her husband Fielding Lewis. The GWF is funded by donors and grants and has been managing the land since the Walmart purchase. In addition to funding, staffing, cataloging, and overseeing the site's excavations there are now plans to recreate the historical landscape and build a new visitor's center on the site. Prehistoric Artifacts found at the Ferry Farm site have dated back to 10,000 B.C. This period of prehistoric artifacts continues on until 1,500 B.C.http://www.kenmore.org/ferry/farm/archeology/arch_special/unearthing.html Artifacts from this period include hunting and gather tools, which prehistoric peoples used to hunt wildlife around and in the Rappahannock River. The land around Ferry Farm was rich in nutrients and populated with multiple animals. \\"Such diversity in food sources required these groups to expand the types of tools they used.\\"http://www.kenmore.org/ferry/farm/archeology/arch_special/hunters.html Examples of artifacts that were found include spear points, stone axes, and quartz scrapers, which were used as tools for hunting. Pre-Colonial Life The grounds at Ferry Farm. While evidence is scarce, artifacts have been dated back to 1,500 B.C. until 1,500 A.D. when Woodland Indians inhabited the land around current day Ferry Farm.http://www.kenmore.org/ferry/farm/archeology/arch_special/woodland.html Colonial Life Popular artifacts found from the Colonial Period include the ends of 18th century wig hair curlers. \\"[...] These were associated with maintaining wigs for George Washington's younger brothers. The fashionable gentlemen of the late 18th century wore a wig- the single most expensive part of the gentry-class man's wardrobe.\\"http://www.dayofarcheology.com/george-is- waiting-the-2013-vcu-field-school-george-washingtons-ferry-farm/ Civil War In 1862 the Civil War arrived at Ferry Farm leaving behind a variety of artifacts throughout the duration of the war. Such as objects from battles including bullets, ink bottles, buttons and medallions from uniforms to name a few.http://www.kenmore.org/ferry/farm/archeology/arch_special/civil_war.html Ferry Farm in Stories and Myth=Cherry Tree= Ferry Farm is the setting for some of the best known stories about George Washington, most particularly those brought to the American public by Mason Locke Weems, best known as Parson Weems, in the early 19th century. These include the anecdote, appearing first in the 1806 edition of Weems's Life of Washington, in which a 6-year-old George barked one of his father Augustine's favorite English cherry trees with a new hatchet. Upon being confronted by his father, the boy confessed, saying: \\"I cannot tell a lie; I did it with my little hatchet.\\" George Washington's step-grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, published a newer version of the story in which George Washington tried to break his mothers new colt (horse). In this story, Washington rode the horse \\"so hard\\" that one of the horse's blood vessel's burst, killing the horse. Like the cherry tree story, when confronted George Washington admitted to killing the horse. Both stories celebrate George Washington's honesty and share a theme of loss, which Washington was painfully familiar with after his father's death and losing his opportunity to study abroad. =Silver Dollar Toss= It has also been claimed to be the site where George Washington \\"threw a silver dollar across the Rappahannock River.\\" It is possible to \\"skip\\" a coin or flat rock across that area. Regardless, the river was considerably wider during this period than it is today, making the feat that much more difficult. Each year during the celebration of Washington's birthday, townspeople are invited to attempt to recreate this event. In the summer of 2006, archaeology intern Jim Trueman duplicated Washington's alleged throw and did it again the following summer to prove the first throw was not a fluke.Phil Levy.

Cillian Murphy and Elaine Cassidy star as Cork teenagers who have a lifelong, but unhealthy, friendship that is imploding as they approach adulthood. Plot The film revolves around the intense relationship of the two teenage protagonists, Darren (Cillian Murphy) and Sin√©ad (Elaine Cassidy), who call each other \\"Pig\\" and \\"Runt,\\" respectively. Pig and Runt were born at the same hospital at nearly the same time and grow up next door to each other. This brings about an extremely close relationship between the two that borders on telepathic. They live in their own world and barely interact with the one around them; when they do, it's mostly to express their hostility toward it. Until just before their 17th birthday, their relationship, while very intense and unhealthy, remains platonic. Around this time, Runt catches and reciprocates the attentions of another young man, Marky (Darren Healy), from their school just as Pig begins to develop romantic feelings for Runt. As their birthday draws closer, Pig becomes more volatile and violent and his new feelings become obvious to Runt when he kisses her after a rampage at a nightclub. Runt does not know how to reject him and they continue their friendship, though relations between them are markedly awkward. Their relationship finally raises concerns at their school. With the cooperation of her parents and Pig's single mother, Runt, considered the more adaptive of the two, is sent away to a boarding school. Pig is devastated by this and decides to run away and retrieve Runt. Even though Runt is paralysed with uncertainty and fear at the boarding school, unsure of how to live her daily life without Pig, she starts to adapt, even befriending another girl. On their 17th birthday, Pig arrives at Runt's school and asks her to leave with them, which she does. Elated at their reunion, the two eventually chance upon a nightclub called The Palace. There, Runt sees Marky again and dances with him. In a fit of jealous rage, Pig beats Marky until he dies. The two flee the club and take a taxi to the beach where they often spend time and make love. In the morning, Pig wordlessly allows Runt to smother him, knowing the punishment awaiting him. Runt stares out to the ocean, wondering what the rest of her life will be like. Characters Darren/\\"Pig\\" is portrayed by Cillian Murphy, who also originally played the part in the stage version. Runt is the only person Pig knows well. Pig also has an extreme hatred for public displays of affection. He cannot begin to comprehend a world where Runt does not exist. Together, they create a surreal world where there is little division between reality and dreams and Pig's and Runt's two personas. Pig is a strange, volatile dreamer. Charles Bark portrays Young Pig. Sin√©ad/\\"Runt\\" is portrayed by Elaine Cassidy. She is the calmer of the two characters. When events involving Pig get too wild, Runt steps in quietly. Although the less voiced of the two, she is the more independent. Eileen Walsh played this role on stage. Sarah Gallagher portrays Young Runt.

It replaced Marvel Team-Up as the third major Spider-Man title of the time. Web of Spider-Man Annual ran for ten issues from 1985 to 1994. The series was launched with an April 1985 cover dated issue by writer Louise Simonson and penciller Greg LaRocque and featured the return of Spider-Man's alien black costume, which attempted to rebond with Peter Parker. Peter managed to rid himself of the costume again using church bells and the alien was presumed to have died after that. The first issue featured a cover painting by artist Charles Vess. In issue #18 (September 1986), Peter Parker is pushed in front of an oncoming train. He thinks to himself that this should not have happened, as his spider- sense would have warned him of the danger.

Produced by Paul Brooks and Eric Newman, the film stars Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Tania Saulnier, Gregg Henry, and Michael Rooker. The film is set in a small town in South Carolina that becomes invaded by a malevolent alien parasite. Slither was a box office failure, but received generally positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult film. Plot A malevolent, sentient extraterrestrial parasite lands inside a meteorite into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina, where it infects wealthy resident Grant Grant, taking over his body and absorbing his mind. With the alien in control of his body, \\"Grant\\" begins to transform into a grotesque, tentacled monstrosity. He also abducts and infects a local woman, Brenda, to serve as a breeder for his alien larvae. His wife Starla becomes suspicious over the changes in his appearance and his behavior, leading to Grant attacking her. When the police arrive to rescue Starla, Grant flees. During their search for Grant, a posse led by Police Chief Bill Pardy discovers Brenda, whose body has become inhumanly bloated from the larvae impregnated inside her. They see the floor littered with the remains of dead animals, as Brenda begs to be fed a possum, the slug-like larvae burst from her body, which infest everyone in town except Starla, Bill, Mayor Jack MacReady, and teenager Kylie Strutemyer. Those infected by the larvae become part of a hive mind controlled by Grant, who intends to consume all lifeforms until only his consciousness remains. However, Grant also retains his love for his wife and seeks to be reunited with her. The survivors deduce that killing Grant will eliminate the rest of the aliens before they are attacked by the infected townspeople. Bill and Kylie escape, but Starla and Jack are captured. Armed with a grenade to kill the monster, Bill and Kylie head to Grant's home, where the infected are being absorbed by the increasingly-mutated Grant. Jack and others are turned into breeders for more larvae, while Grant keeps Starla uninfected in the hope of reclaiming her love. After euthanizing Jack at his own request, Bill tries to use the grenade, only for it to fall into a pool when Grant knocks it away. Grant subdues Kylie with a couch and attempts to infect Bill with his tentacles, but Bill manages to attach one of the tentacles to a propane tank. Filled with flammable gas, Grant is shot by Starla and explodes, killing the rest of the aliens in the process. With everyone else in Wheelsy dead, the three survivors head off to seek help. In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches Grant's remains and becomes infected by the alien parasite. Cast * Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant * Nathan Fillion as Bill Pardy * Michael Rooker as Grant Grant * Tania Saulnier as Kylie Strutemyer * Gregg Henry as Jack MacReady * Don Thompson as Wally * Brenda James as Brenda Gutierrez * Jennifer Copping as Margaret * Jenna Fischer as Shelby Cunningham * Haig Sutherland as Trevor Additionally, William MacDonald and Iris Quinn portray Kylie's parents and Matreya Fedor and Amber Lee Bartlett portray her siblings Emily and Jenna. Other members of Bill's posse are played by Tom Heaton as Tourneur, Ben Cotton as Charlie, and Dee Jay Jackson as Dwight. Residents of Wheelsy include Dustin Milligan as a student in Starla's class, Lorena Gale as Starla's co-worker Janene, Darren Shahlavi as Brenda's husband, and Magda Apanowicz in an uncredited role as Kylie's friend. Troma Films co-founder Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo as drunken man and Rob Zombie provides the voice of Grant's physician Dr. Karl. Director James Gunn makes an uncredited appearance as Hank, Starla's co-worker. Themes and influences Controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with Fred Dekker's 1986 horror-comedy Night of the Creeps. According to journalist Steve Palopoli: Palopoli then goes on to directly compare Slither to the aforementioned Creeps as well as the 1975 film Shivers. Gunn has stated that both Cronenberg's Shivers and his 1979 film The Brood were the two biggest influences on the story in Slither, along with the 2000 manga Uzumaki by Junji Ito. The film pays homage to other horror films, such as a farm being owned by Castevet in reference to the Satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in Rosemary's Baby. Jack MacReady, the mayor of Wheelsy, is named after Kurt Russell's characters Jack Burton and R.J. MacReady from the John Carpenter films Big Trouble in Little China and The Thing. Home media Slither was released on regular DVD and on HD DVD/DVD hybrid disc on October 24, 2006. The HD version is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen encoded at 1080p and Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 surround. In addition to the film, the DVD contains two making-of documentaries, one being solely dedicated to the visual effects. The DVD also contains deleted and extended scenes, a blooper reel, visual effects progressions, a set tour with Fillion, and an audio commentary by Gunn and Fillion. Also included are featurettes outlining how to make edible blood, and Lloyd Kaufman's documentary discussing his day on set, and the shooting of his one line (which was eventually cut from the film). Finally, there is an added bonus entitled \\"Who Is Bill Pardy?\\" which is a joke feature made by Gunn with the sole purpose of roasting Fillion, and was shown at the film's wrap party. Shout! Factory released a Collector's Edition on Blu-ray Disc on July 25, 2017. In addition to new case artwork illustrated by artist Justin Osbourn, it includes new special features such as a new audio commentary with James Gunn and cast members, new interviews with James Gunn and actor Gregg Henry (Jack MacReady) as well as all of the special features found on the original DVD video. Reception=Box office= Slither was \\"a box office flop\\", failing to recoup its production budget following its debut in the United States and Canada on March 31, 2006 in 1,945 theaters. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $3,880,270 and ranked #8 at the U.S. and Canadian box office. Slither grossed $7,802,450 in its theatrical run in the United States and Canada. Slither also under-performed in France, grossing $236,261 from 150 screens. The film grossed $5,032,486 as of February 6, 2008 in territories outside the United States and Canada for a worldwide gross of $12,834,936. Its box office performance was substantially less than its total budget of $29.5 million, including marketing costs; the production budget taking up about $15 million of the total. Paul Brooks, president of the film's production company, Gold Circle Films, said the company was \\"crushingly disappointed\\" by the gross. Universal distanced itself from Slithers poor box office performance, citing their distribution of the film as merely part of a deal with Gold Circle. The Hollywood Reporter speculated that Slithers performance \\"might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future.\\" Producer Paul Brooks offered this explanation about why Slither failed to catch on with filmgoers: =Critical response= Slither received generally positive reviews. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus states: \\"A slimy, B-movie homage oozing with affection for low-budget horror films, Slither is creepy and funny ‚Äî if you've got the stomach for it.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The movie was featured in the April 14, 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly as #1 on \\"The Must List\\"; \\"Ten Things We Love This Week\\".

Over her career, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and as a member of the Senate of Canada. She was the first woman in the Commonwealth of Nations to become Speaker, and was known as a powerful women's rights activist in the Commonwealth. Personal life Born in London, England, Nancy Hodges attended King's College at the London University. She and her husband, Harry P. Hodges, moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1916 due to him needing a dry climate for recovery for his tuberculosis. She then found a job as the women's editor for the Victoria Day Times, where she had a daily column. Through 30 years of being an esteemed journalist, she produced over 2,550 columns. Along with her passion for the paper, she was involved in the Victoria Business and Professional Women's Club, where she became a charter member, and later President. Although losing this election, she ran again in 1941 and succeeded, staying in power until 1953. Political life Hodges first ran for office in the 1937 election in the multi-member riding of Victoria City, as a member of the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to run as a Liberal. She campaigned on increasing the quality of social conditions, resulting in better old-age pensions. Other ideas included bettering medical services and insurance, protection of single women, and compensation benefits for the working class. She came in seventh place and failed to be elected. She ran again in the 1941 election and was elected to the legislature. When the 1941 election produced only a plurality of seats for the governing Liberals, Hodges was one of the MLAs who supported forming a coalition with the Conservatives; when Liberal premier and leader Duff Pattullo argued that \\"coalition with the Conservatives will be the end of the Liberal Party in British Columbia.\\", Hodges responded \\"Coalition won't kill any party that hasn't germs of decay in it already.\\" The coalitionists ultimately won out, and Pattullo was replaced as premier by John Hart. Hodges took interest in the Victoria Business and Professional Women's Club, where her slogan was born: \\"Equal pay for equal work!\\" She had a strong belief that more women should be entering into politics to make a positive change. Hodges' principles occasionally led her to work across party lines with the other women in the legislature (Tilly Rolston, Conservative; Dorothy Steeves, Laura Jamieson, Grace MacInnis, CCF) to promote women's issues; in one instance, Hodges and the other women convinced the government to buy seven Emily Carr paintings before she was nationally renowned, making the purchase a bargain upon Carr's recognition. Hodges was re-elected in 1945 and 1949. She attended a public meeting conference for the United Nations in 1945 for International Peace in San Francisco. In this meeting, the Charter of the United Nations was first signed. In 1947, she attacked the Coalition government for laying off single women to provide jobs for returning veterans, and threatened to campaign for pensions for women at 40 if the practice continued. The firing of women stopped. During this time, Hodges advocated for women to be eligible for worker's compensation benefits, and for married women to receive property rights. When John Hart stepped down in 1947, Hodges supported Boss Johnson as his successor, nominating him in a passionate speech at the convention; Johnson won by eight votes. Following his victory, there was speculation among the press that Hodges would receive a cabinet post as a reward, but Hodges rejected such rumours, and said she would not accept a cabinet post. In 1950, she was elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, becoming the first woman in the Commonwealth of Nations to hold that office. She hinted towards \\"political repayment\\" and objected to the appointment on the grounds of sex. During her time as Speaker, Hodges toured North America, including visits to The Californian Business and Professional Women's Club, The Canadian Federation of Liberal Women, and The Women's Canadian Club in Ottawa. In July 1950, Hodges was invited to The Halifax Convention of the Federation of Canadian Business and Professional Women's Clubs where she was named Canadian Woman of 1950. Hodges was defeated in the 1953 election by the Social Credit candidate, Lydia Arsens. Shortly after, she was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1953, representing the senatorial division of Victoria, British Columbia, and served until her resignation in 1965. Increase in salary for underpaid government workers, teachers, and mothers were among the causes she took up as a senator. She later became the President of the National Association of Liberal Women. During her time as a senator, Hodges was a member of numerous committees, including the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour, the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts, and the Standing Committee on Divorce. Along with being a member of Senate committees, she was also a member of various Joint Committees including those of Restaurant and Parliament, and Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries.

It is a municipality and the mandal headquarters of Kovvur mandal in Kovvur revenue division.  Etymology  This Town was earlier referred as Govur. According to Brahma Puranam, Kovvur(Govuru) is considered as the place of Gautama Maharishi's Ashramam. He did farming in the surrounding regions to maintain his Ashramam. Gautama Maharishi once he accidentally kills a cow, grazing in his paddy field, by throwing a darbha (sharp, pointed grass). Gautama becomes upset with this incident and offers a great tapas for Lord Shiva in Brahmagiri mountains. The god, pleased by his tapas, wipes away his sin and allows Ganga to flow in his farm to purify the place (Kovvur). The river thus originated is called \\"Godavari\\" which means \\"originated due to killing a cow\\". It is also called as \\"Gautami\\" in appreciation to the effort of the maharishi in bringing Godavari to earth. Gautama maharishi accidentally kills a cow in his farm and to clear out his sin, he offers a great tapas near Bhrahmagiri parvatas near Triambakam in Maharashtra. Lord Shiva pleased with his tapas allows Ganga to sanctify the region. Kovvuru is a transformed name of Govuru which originated from the above story. The names of various places around Kovvuru highlight this fact. It is believed that Gautama established a Vijneswara temple in the South and a Kumaraswami temple in the North of his Ashrama. These are currently known as Vijjeswaram and Kumaradevam. The place where Gautama ploughed the farm was Arikirevula which is transformed to Arikirevu. Vadapalli, Munikoodali, Brahmanagudem were the places of rishis. The place where Ahalya lived was called Tougimi which is currently called Togummi. The place where the cow was Died was chavugallu which is currently called Chagallu. Kovvuru Goshpada Kshetram is very sacred place and a must visit place during pushkaras.

It remains the worst accident, in terms of lives lost, in Singapore's post-war history. It is also Singapore's worst industrial accident.  Background  The Spyros was owned by Ulysses Tanker Corporation of Liberia and operated by International Operations, SA. The Liberian-registered vessel was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan in 1964 and was a steam turbine-driven tanker of 64,081 tons deadweight. On 6 October 1978, the Spyros arrived in Singapore for a full special survey and general repairs at Jurong Shipyard. One of the items for repair was the replacement of the missing cover for the drip tray of the vent pipe leading from the aft starboard fuel oil tank.  Events = Explosion = At around 2:15 p.m., Spyros exploded. The explosion occurred as about 150 workers, including women, returned to the engine and boiler rooms of the vessel after their lunch break for repair and cleaning work. A number of the ship's 32 crew were also on board. The blast flung debris from the 35,600-tonne vessel as far as 100 metres (328 ft) away and started a flash fire that prevented dockside workers from rescuing those trapped inside the ship. = Rescue works = Minutes after the accident, an extensive rescue operation swung into action, involving the police, military and medical services. All hospitals were alerted to be on stand-by for casualties. Rescue workers went into the ship's engine and boiler rooms to search for missing workers. Eight fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene and after the fire was doused, more rescue workers poured into the ship to help the injured and remove the dead. The injured were ferried to hospital in ambulances and helicopters.  Aftermath = Casualties = The wounded were ferried by ambulance and helicopter to Alexandra Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. Most of those hospitalised suffered serious burns, with their conditions described as critical. Others, including four firemen, were treated for inhalation of toxic gas and shock. In summary, 57 of the 76 died on the day of the accident. The others succumbed to their injuries in hospital. Of the 76 deaths, 70 were male, six were female, and 69 others were injured.  Causes of disaster  An inquiry found that safety practices were ignored when repairs were carried out on the vessel. Sparks from the cutting torch used during repairs caused a fire, which ignited an explosive vapour mixture within the aft starboard bunker (fuel) tank of the vessel. The fuel tank had been contaminated by crude oil. The explosion ruptured the common bulkhead between the tank and the engine room, releasing the burning oil into the engine room and setting it on fire, killing the workers there instantly. Soon after the accident, greater safety consciousness in the shipbuilding and repairing industry was enforced.

Potter in 1987. The cover painting of the original book, which was also featured in the film version, is based on Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat. The book's main character was named after May Cutler, founder of its Canadian publisher, Tundra. Plot synopsis May wants a dog more than anything else in the world, and, at school, often imagines that everyone in her class are dogs too. But no matter how much she wants one, her parents often say no to the offer. One day, May tries to show them her such determination by luring, with salami, a pack of ten dogs to her home. But her mother wants them returned, and some time later, May buys a puppy for her mother's birthday using all of her allowance. It does not work to plan, and that same evening, May's parents discuss the trials and tribulations of raising dogs as pets. Still, as to May having a dog of her own, both of them object, and this leads to their daughter throwing her toys all over her room in outrage. It is not long before May sees one of her white rollerskates roll down the nearby staircase like a dog, which gives her an idea: along with a self-built training course, she can train that skate just like she would a real dog! Her school friends, hearing of her idea and amused at first, want to try walking it. Another day, May arrives at the neighbourhood luncheonette to check out the newest comic books, leaving her skate outside. Little does she know that her \\"dog\\" is being interrogated by a real one! The latter runs away with it, and afterwards, May panics about its whereabouts. With her \\"try, try again\\" attitude, she is reunited with the skate by finding it nearby. In time to come, May and the rollerskate become friends, and the craze as such is catching on with children all over her community. The biggest surprise of all, at the end of the story, is when she finally receives a real dog from her parents as a reward for her hard work. Reception Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"An excellent read-aloud, this tribute to undaunted independence might be even better for independent reading.\\" while Publishers Weekly found \\"Bright, busy paintings and a sympathetic narrative depict canine-coveting May's solution to her parents' ban on pets.\\" Books in Canada called it \\"delightfully outrageous\\".

Life Born in Kranichfeld in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the son of a local medical practitioner, he received his early schooling at the gymnasium of Meiningen, to which place his father had moved. After studying natural science at Leipzig as a member of the German Student Corps Thuringia and in various other universities, he engaged in private tuition, both independently and in families, in the Austrian towns of Graz, Br√ºnn and Trieste. In Trieste he caught the popular taste with an Alpine legend, Zlatorog (1877), and songs of a journeyman apprentice, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (1878), both of which ran into many editions. Their success decided him to embark upon a literary career. In 1885, he returned to Meiningen, where he received the title of Hofrat, and was appointed ducal librarian. He remained in Meiningen for the twenty years until his death on 14 of September 1905. Baumbach was a poet of the breezy, vagabond school and wrote, in imitation of his greater compatriot, Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, many excellent drinking songs, among which Die Lindenwirtin (\\"The Linden Hostess\\") has endeared him to the German student world. But his real strength lay in narrative verse, especially when he had the opportunity of describing the scenery and life of his native Thuringia.

It is a small fishing and lumbering community on Route 413 at the north side of the mouth of Green Bay. History Burlington was once named Northwest Arm, and was permanently settled in the mid-19th century. The community was renamed in the early part of 1915 due to a mix-up in the mail service. After many residents complained that their mail was sent to another community with a similar name, the town leaders felt the need to have a name change. Out of three separate entries, 'Burlington' was chosen. There was no large industry in the 19th century. The early settlers fished for cod and cleared land to grow potatoes, cabbage and small fruits. Keeping animals provided meat for the winter and milk and butter in season. Settlers built their own boats for fishing in Labrador, or they were employed by the inshore fishery. When mines opened at both Bett's Cove and Tilt Cove, some of the Burlington men went to both communities for work. Logging pitprops for the United Kingdom were started in 1915 by a contractor named John Jennings. This industry was closed in 1918 when the sale of pitprops ended. Lumber camps opened in 1920, but closed during the Depression of the 1930s. In 1935, the Thistle family started cutting export wood. They remained a major economic force in Burlington for approximately 30 years. Camps later opened for the cutting of pulpwood and continued for about ten years.

He has hosted several podcasts and video podcasts including The Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe, Chikara Podcast-A-Go-Go, Deep Blue Something, The Trending Show, Daddy on Board, Kayfabe 2.0, and Til We Make It. He is also the sole content contributor to Quackenbush on Camelot, a news resource for the goings-on at the dinner theater franchise Medieval Times and renaissance fairs. Quackenbush has written seven books including the two memoirs Headquarters (2001) and Secret Identity: Essays From Both My Lives (2004). Both memoirs were re- released as e-books for the Kindle in May 2010, and a few years later in 2017, he released 7 Keys to Becoming a Better Performer: A Book for Fellow Pro- Wrestlers. From 1998 to 2008, Quackenbush penned a regular column titled \\"From Bell To Bell\\" for The Wrestler magazine and \\"The International Report\\" for Pro Wrestling Illustrated, among other publishing credits. In wrestling, Quackenbush is well known for being the promoter of Chikara and head trainer of its Wrestle Factory, a promotion and school he co-founded in 2002 with Reckless Youth. Quackenbush is also noted for his 25 year in-ring career on the independent wrestling circuit, during which he became a former NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion and CZW World Junior Heavyweight Champion. In 2016, Sports Illustrated included Quackenbush on their list of the Top 101 Wrestlers of All Time. Professional wrestling career=Early career= Quackenbush began taking bookings for multiple local independent companies, including PCW and SCW in late 1998. Growing up, Quackenbush idolized Japanese professional wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger and adopted the nickname \\"Lightning\\" in tribute to him. Entering the business untrained, Quackenbush received training from wrestler Ace Darling, who took Quackenbush in as his protege. In 1999, he was ranked #128 by Pro Wrestling Illustrated in the annual PWI 500 as well as being named the June Flavour of the Month by the publication. Quackenbush eventually befriended independent wrestlers Reckless Youth and Don Montoya. They began teaming together as a trio, dubbed The Black T-Shirt Squad (abbreviated to The BTS), due to all three wearing black t-shirts in their wrestling attire, by fellow wrestlers, which eventually was used as their ring name. Quackenbush started taking most bookings with his fellow stablemates opposed to performing as a singles wrestler. =Combat Zone Wrestling (1999, 2004‚Äì2005)= Quackenbush first appeared in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) on June 19, 1999, at Down In Flames, where he defeated Reckless Youth and Ric Blade in the opening three-way dance. On May 14, 2005, he won CZW's Best of the Best 5 elimination tournament in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after defeating Arik Cannon, Claudio Castagnoli, B-Boy, Kevin Steen and Super Dragon. He also held the CZW World Junior Heavyweight Championship twice. =Chikara (2002‚Äì2020)= Quackenbush founded a professional wrestling school branded The Wrestle Factory in January 2002 along with Reckless Youth, where both men were appointed as head trainers for the school. They opened the promotion Chikara in May of the same year. At the inaugural show on May 25, 2002, Quackenbush teamed with fellow BTS stablemates Reckless Youth and Don Montoya in a match, where they defeated the Gold Bond Mafia (CM Punk, Colt Cabana and Chris Hero). On the last show of 2002 Quackenbush finished his first feud in Chikara, by pinning Mitch Ryder. The following year Quackenbush formed the SuperFriends tag team with Chris Hero and went the whole year undefeated. In 2004 Quackenbush teamed up with Team F.I.S.T. (Icarus and Gran Akuma) and started a feud with the Toxic Trio (Eddie Kingston, BlackJack Marciano and Jigsaw). The two teams faced each other on May 22, 2004, at Aniversario 3: Dodging the Sophomore Jinx, where Quackenbush and F.I.S.T. were victorious and as per stipulation of the match, Kingston and Marciano were shaved bald. In the spring of 2004 Quackenbush started disappearing from Chikara shows, just as Larry Sweeney's Sweet 'n' Sour International rose to prominence. He returned on October 30 during the first annual torneo cibernetico match at The Cibernetico Cometh under a mask and the ringname Spyrazul as a member of the Sweet 'n' Sour International. However, at the end of the match Spyrazul attacked his own team mates, removed his mask and walked out on Sweeney, who ended up being pinned by Jigsaw to end the match. In March 2005 the Chikara Wrestle Factory assumed control of the Combat Zone Wrestling wrestling school. Quackenbush served as head trainer of the joint facility for the two year duration, until the schools separated in March 2007. Quackenbush re-formed his SuperFriends tag team with Chris Hero and together the two of them entered the 2005 Tag World Grand Prix. They would make it to the finals of the tournament, where they were defeated by AC/CC (Arik Cannon and Claudio Castagnoli), after Hero turned on Quackenbush. Together Hero, Castagnoli and Cannon would form the highly successful stable and later tag team The Kings of Wrestling, with whom Quackenbush, Reckless Youth and Jigsaw would feud with the rest of the year. In late 2005 Quackenbush suffered a career-threatening back injury. He would make his in- ring return on March 18, 2006, at a Westside Xtreme Wrestling event, where he defeated Ares for the wXw World Heavyweight Championship. In his Chikara return on March 31, he would drop the title back to Ares. He then recruited Jigsaw and Shane Storm to help him battle the Kings of Wrestling, who had replaced Arik Cannon with Quackenbush's former partners Team F.I.S.T. Quackenbush set his sights on Chris Hero and defeated Gran Akuma and Icarus with his new finishing maneuver Quackendriver III. At the conclusion of the year Quackenbush, Storm and Jigsaw saved Claudio Castagnoli from a beatdown at the hands of his Kings of Wrestling partners. (Left to right) Quackenbush, Shane Storm and Jigsaw, the 2007 King of Trios 2007 started with Quackenbush, Jigsaw and Storm defeating Team Canada (Jagged, Shane Matthews and Max Boyer), Team TNA (Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt), Team Mucha Lucha (Lince Dorado, El Pantera and Sicodelico, Jr.) and finally Miyawaki, Yoshiaki Yago and Kudo to win the inaugural King of Trios tournament. The following month on March 25 Claudio Castagnoli defeated Quackenbush to win the right to represent Chikara in the first ever King of Europe Cup. That same month Chikara Podcast‚ÄìA‚ÄìGo‚ÄìGo was launched. The weekly video podcast debuts a new episode every Monday night and is available through iTunes, YouTube and other online outlets. On April 22, 2007, Quackenbush refereed a match between former partners Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli and counted the pinfall that forced Castagnoli to re-join the Kings of Wrestling. The following month Quackenbush faced Hero in a match two years in the making and defeated him after debuting a new submission maneuver, the Chikara Special. Following the match, Quackenbush announced that since he knew Hero would never be able to break the Chikara Special, he would teach it and the counter to it to every tecnico wrestler on the Chikara roster. However, to Quackenbush's amazement it did not take long for Hero to break the hold and apply it himself in a match against Equinox. In order to find out who leaked the move, Quackenbush sent Tim Donst to infiltrate the rudo stable the Order of the Neo-Solar Temple, led by UltraMantis Black. Meanwhile, Quackenbush and Shane Storm gained three straight victories, which would give them the right to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas (Tag Team Championship), but on June 14, 2008, Donst returned from his assignment and informed Quackenbush that his partner Shane Storm had been the one who leaked the move to UltraMantis Black, who in turn taught it to Hero. Quackenbush attacked Storm, who would find new partners in Vin Gerard and Colin Delaney, while renaming himself Stigma. Quackenbush at a Chikara show in June 2008 On September 7, 2008, Jigsaw, who had unmasked himself while in Ring of Honor, returned to Chikara and saved Quackenbush and Donst from the UnStable. Quackenbush returned the favor the following month, but refused to re-form the team with Jigsaw until he put his mask back on. On December 14 at the season seven finale Quackenbush and Jigsaw, under a mask, defeated Stigma and Delaney in a tag team match. In early 2009 Quackenbush and Jigsaw gained three points, but were unable to defeat the Campeones de Parejas The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian) on April 25. After May's anniversary shows Quackenbush decided to take some time off from in-ring competition in order to heal his injured back. In 2010 Quackenbush became embroiled in a feud with Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK), who had formed on the final show of 2009 and were threatening to take over Chikara, with its members quickly winning the Young Lions Cup, Campeonatos de Parejas and King of Trios, while also having one of its members as the Chikara Director of Fun. After UltraMantis Black declared that rudos and tecnicos would have to come together in order to stop BDK, Quackenbush announced on August 11 that he would join his seven man team facing BDK in the annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. After defeating The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) and BDK members Lince Dorado and Pinkie Sanchez, Quackenbush and Jigsaw were looking to get a shot at BDK's Claudio Castagnoli and Ares and their Campeonatos de Parejas. However, on August 27 Quackenbush and Jigsaw failed in their attempt at getting a third point by losing to BDK members Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey, after some shady officiating from the stable's own referee Derek Sabato. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw restarted their march towards three points by defeating the House of Truth (Josh Raymond and Christian Abel). On September 18 they picked up their second point by defeating BDK's Lince Dorado and Tim Donst. On October 23 Quackenbush represented Chikara in the torneo cibernetico match, where the company's originals faced BDK. He managed to eliminate Tim Donst from the match after countering his Inverted Chikara Special into the original Chikara Special, but was immediately afterwards eliminated himself by BDK's Claudio Castagnoli. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw once again failed in their attempt at getting their third point in a match against BDK members Pinkie Sanchez and Tursas. This failure led to Quackenbush's and Jigsaw's former partner Stigma reminding them that he and Quackenbush still had the three points they had earned two and a half years earlier, but Quackenbush made it clear that he wanted to win the Campeonatos de Parejas with Jigsaw, not Stigma. On November 22 Quackenbush and Jigsaw competed in a four‚Äìway elimination match with Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze, The Osirian Portal and F.I.S.T. (Icarus and Chuck Taylor) and after eliminating all three teams, finally earned the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. On December 12, 2010, at the season nine finale Reality is Relative Quackenbush and Jigsaw cashed in their points and defeated Ares and Castagnoli two falls to one to win the Campeonatos de Parejas for the first time. Quackenbush and Jigsaw made their first successful defense of the title on February 19, 2011, defeating The Batiri (Obariyon and Kodama). For the 2011 King of Trios, Quackenbush and Jigsaw formed a trio with Japanese joshi legend Manami Toyota, who had made her Chikara debut alongside Quackenbush the previous September, and on April 15 defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match. The following day, the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal stage by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki). On September 18, Quackenbush and Jigsaw lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano) in their third defense. From May to October 2011, Quackenbush took part in 12 Large: Summit, a tournament used to determine the first ever Chikara Grand Champion. Quackenbush ended up winning his block of the tournament with a record of four wins and one loss to set up a final match with the winner of the other block, Eddie Kingston. On November 13 at Chikara's first internet pay-per-view, High Noon, Quackenbush was defeated by Kingston in a match to determine the first Chikara Grand Champion. Quackenbush with Manami Toyota in April 2011 Beginning on February 26, 2012, Quackenbush began feuding with the new Gekido stable of 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard. assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt later revealed that they were former dropouts of the Chikara Wrestle Factory, while The Shard was a former training partner of Jigsaw and 17 revealed that he had modeled his career after Quackenbush's and claimed to be just as talented as him, but had never gotten recognized for it. The group announced that its intention was to expose Chikara's \\"dark underbelly\\". On June 2 at Chikara's second internet pay-per- view, Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Quackenbush, Eddie Kingston, Jigsaw, Green Ant and Soldier Ant defeated Gekido in a ten man tag team match, after which Quackenbush grabbed 17's hand and broke his fingers, sidelining him for nine weeks. On August 18, Quackenbush and 17 faced off in a tag team match, where Quackenbush and Jigsaw faced 17 and The Shard. Quackenbush lost the match, being disqualified for \\"excessive punishment\\" after hitting 17 with all four versions of his Quackendriver, ending 17's Chikara career in the process. Following the match, Jigsaw confronted Quackenbush about his new mean streak. Quackenbush later explained that he no longer needed to control his temper and play by the rules to maintain an image, since at High Noon Eddie Kingston had taken over his role as the face of Chikara. On September 14, Quackenbush entered the 2012 King of Trios, teaming with Jigsaw and Manami Toyota, just like the previous year. In their first round match, the trio defeated Gekido members combatAnt and deviAnt and Colony member Soldier Ant. After the match, Quackenbush continued his mean streak by attacking combatAnt, eliminating also him from Chikara. The following day, Quackenbush, Jigsaw and Toyota were eliminated from the tournament, after losing to Team Sendai Girls (Dash Chisako, Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko). On November 18, Quackenbush set his sights on eliminating The Shard from Chikara, however, his attempt was stopped by Jigsaw, who superkicked his former Campeones de Parejas partner and then left the arena with The Shard. On December 2 at Chikara's third iPPV, Under the Hood, Quackenbush represented Chikara in an eight man tag team match, where they were defeated by Gekido, led by Jigsaw. Afterwards, Quackenbush made peace with assailAnt, who turned tecnico and jumped from Gekido to Chikara. On April 6, 2013, Quackenbush teamed with his idol Jushin Thunder Liger to defeat Jigsaw and The Shard in a main event tag team match. Following the event, Quackenbush took a hiatus from in-ring action to heal a tibia fracture suffered during the match and wrist and rib injuries suffered earlier. Quackenbush later claimed that he had no plans to return to the ring. When Chikara returned from its one-year hiatus on May 25, 2014, with the You Only Live Twice iPPV, Quackenbush was revealed as the promotion's new Director of Fun.

Throughout the match, Quackenbush unlaced and loosened Tiger Mask's mask, a major sign of disrespect amongst masked wrestlers. In the finish of the match Quackenbush completely pulled off his opponent's mask and used the distraction to pin him for the title. In a promo after the match, Quackenbush explained that he did everything to get the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship and that he was, in no way, proud of it. He said he viewed the belt as his ticket to Japan, as Japanese promotions had not booked him in any events.
